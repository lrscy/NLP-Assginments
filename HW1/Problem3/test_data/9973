I really do not see the difference, and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee, look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants.
Mr President, what the investigations into this incident show is what can best be described as a culture of management incompetence and one of complacency.
The report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in February of this year into the safety records found that these records had been systematically falsified.
The processing of spent fuel from 34 plants in 9 different countries was thrown into doubt and, indeed, Japan, Germany and Switzerland stopped sending material - and quite rightly so - to Sellafield.
This whole sorry tale has added to the UK's reputation, as sordid as it is often inaccurate, as the "dirty man of Europe".
I believe that all at Sellafield must accept collective responsibility for the things that have gone wrong and must act to improve them.
A number of improvements have been made: the new chairman of BNFL has undertaken a fundamental review; a number of people have been dismissed.
There is undoubtedly progress.
However, there is a lot yet to be achieved and there is a long way for the UK to go, and for BNFL to go to re-establish its reputation.
I would ally myself with the concerns of Mrs McNally, when she asked the Commissioner to look again at these matters.
The fact is that the Commissioner telling us that the rules of individual Member States are more specific is simply not good enough.
We need high minimum standards and, in particular, we need those standards in the light of the accession of candidate countries, many of which are more reliant on nuclear technology than existing members of the Union and have much older generating capacity.
The importance of European Union action in this matter is that it will be a confidence-building measure, and what the public want are confidence-building measures.
I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
The fact is that we need legislation to implement what is called for in the motion put forward by the three main political groups tonight: high minimum standards for the safe and reliable design, construction and operation of nuclear and nuclear-related installations, as well as for nuclear-safety management systems.
My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight.
We feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms.
It raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at Sellafield.
But one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers.
We support the motion put forward by the three major political groups because we believe that improvements need to be made, improvements are being made, but that those improvements will be encouraged by an EU-wide approach to this whole matter.
We recognise too the great significance of this plant for employment in west Cumbria and we believe that should the future of the plant be thrown into jeopardy then the European Commission must come forward with special measures to help regenerate other employment in the area.
This is a saga in which nobody, least of all Sellafield, comes out well.
But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleague, Mrs Ahern, for raising this very important issue.
No one in this House could have been anything but appalled at the recent events linked to Sellafield, with the falsification of MOX fuel data and the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate's report on the low level of safety procedures at the plant.
Following the initial defensive response by BNFL, it was only when that report was published that the real scale of the problem emerged, that the falsification of figures had apparently been going on secretly since 1996.
Wales, like Ireland, has suffered from the radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea, due essentially to Sellafield.
There has been a theory about a link between a high incidence of childhood leukaemia, for example, and proximity to the Welsh coastline.
Now, added to that, we have a situation where any confidence the public had in the safety of the plant, and therefore their own health and safety, has been destroyed.
It is this crisis of credibility in the management of British Nuclear Fuels which may actually bring about the end of reprocessing.
BNFL was determined to press ahead with the Sellafield MOX plant to keep reprocessing going.
But one of the reasons why British Energy, which accounted for a third of Sellafield's reprocessing work, decided to shift from that to waste storage was on economic grounds.
It was cheaper for them to store waste, and evidence published recently by the nuclear-free local authorities confirms this view.
So, with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health, as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost, what justification is left for nuclear processing?
It is not worth the risks associated with it and, as the resolution states, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must reconsider this whole issue, including the production of MOX fuel, in the light of recent events and in the interests not only of people in Ireland and Wales but also in the whole of Europe.
British Nuclear Fuels has an obligation to deal with the levels of waste that Mrs Ahern mentioned earlier in the safest way possible.
That issue too is one of great concern to me because an area of Wales has been mentioned as a possible site for storing low-level radioactive waste.
This is unacceptable.
A strategic approach is needed.
The nuclear industry has caused enormous damage already and we have to be certain that more and more communities and people's lives are not blighted by its legacy in future.
Mr President, an essential requirement in parliamentary work is rigour.
For the sake of this rigour, I would like to remind you of four facts relating to the case of the falsification of manual measurements of the diameter of MOX fuel pellets at the British Nuclear Fuels installation at Sellafield.
Firstly, we are talking about secondary and superfluous controls at the request of a client, not a safety requirement; secondly, no nuclear safety requirement was violated; thirdly, there was no risk of radiation whatsoever; fourthly, no safeguard clause of the Euratom Treaty was violated since the measurements of the weight of the pellets were correct.
We are therefore talking about a dreadful case of a lack of professional ethics, which has done enormous economic and public relations damage to the company concerned, but this case had no implications whatsoever in terms of the safety of workers or the public.
Nevertheless, a mishap like this reminds us, despite its trivial nature, of the need to give utmost priority to the constant control and improvement of the procedures in an installation such as the Sellafield reprocessing plant.
This is the view of the British regulatory authority.
This is clearly demanded in the resolution supported by our Group and we hope that this will be complied with in the future.
Mr President, we must not be under any illusion that the falsification of quality control data at Sellafield was not a most serious matter.
I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant, both the management and the workers' representatives there over a good number of years, felt the issue more keenly than most.
It exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of MOX fuel.
However, we should note that the response of BNFL to the nuclear inspectorate report has already resulted in very significant management changes.
These have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible.
I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue.
I would suggest that one of the roles of Parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place.
We should also note that the chief inspector and the Commission made very clear to the industry committee that there were no safety implications at any of the Sellafield installations.
Nuclear safeguards were not an issue, nor were there safety issues in relation to transport of nuclear materials.
I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening.
The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured.
But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent.
We seek to apply standards to the applicant countries in eastern Europe and, I would suggest, beyond the applicant countries in eastern Europe.
European Union standards applicable to all nuclear installations are still something that most of us want to see. We know that the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association is seeking harmonisation.
I would hope that the Commissioner, as other colleagues have asked, will reconsider her position and actually support and encourage WENRA in this objective.
I am absolutely convinced, on the basis of my own experience in a number of countries that this is the way to reassure public opinion.
It is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a Parliament.
Mr President, I have been a Member of this Parliament now for sixteen years.
I believe I am accurate in saying that literally in every one of those sixteen years the concerns of the Irish Government and the Irish people about the nuclear processing plant in Sellafield have been raised in this Parliament.
I am always conscious, as I look around, that probably every light bulb in this Chamber is lit by nuclear energy, which explains the reluctance among many of the major European nuclear powers to address seriously the concern we have in Ireland.
Our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the British Government.
They have largely been treated - I regret to say - with indifference and indeed, very often with contempt.
There now exists in Ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in Sellafield.
The recent information about the falsification of documents just added to the deep sense of unease that is shared by people throughout our island.
We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant.
We are aware that the Germans and the Japanese are sending their nuclear waste for processing to Sellafield because it is politically too uncomfortable for them to do it in their own countries because of concerns about this.
I ask the Commissioner to reconsider her point.
I also ask her another question: are any of the non-nuclear countries on the nuclear safety committee you mentioned?
It is time that we realised that we must count the cost of processing the waste from these nuclear facilities as an intrinsic part of the cost.
It is, generally speaking, more comfortable to leave that out, but this is a matter of extreme concern to the Irish Government, the Irish people and happily, also to the Danish Government.
We are joined in our concerns by them as well.
Mr President, I asked to speak in this debate not just because I am a Member from the north-west region of England where the Sellafield plant is situated, not just because there could be 10 000 livelihoods at risk if Sellafield was closed, and not because I have any vested interest in the nuclear industry.
I do not.
I asked to speak because I want to try and help to get some truth into this debate.
The trouble is, when you talk about nuclear issues - especially Sellafield - it is dominated by a distortion of the truth.
When Mrs Ahern spoke, she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant.
No, it did not!
She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks.
No, it did not!
It made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks, as other speakers have said.
She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent.
No, it did not.
The workers at BNFL raised the issue.
They were the ones who discovered it.
BNFL were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened.
She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark.
I quote from The Independent where seven prominent Danish scientists, who actually study as a professional interest the releases of radioactivity from Sellafield, said on 12 May: "There is no scientific basis for the claim that the present release of radioactivity from Sellafield causes an unacceptable contamination in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions".
When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue!
She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety.
That is an absolute insult to the people who work there, and more so to their families who live near that site!
Those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe.
They would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case.
That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there.
Then she finished by talking about corruption.
That really is the last throw of the dice.
Finally, I say to the Commissioner: the one thing you should do, apart from listen, is to pay a visit to Sellafield and find out the facts for yourself.
That is the best advice that I can give you and many Members of this Parliament also.
Mr President, as a Cumbrian - born, bred and resident - and one of the representatives of north-west England, there is nobody in this Parliament who has been more affected by the reverberations arising from recent events at Sellafield than me.
Let us be clear.
There have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed.
Those lapses quite simply are not acceptable.
Speaking as a Cumbrian I know a lot of people in my home county - which I have the privilege to represent - feel let down by British Nuclear Fuels.
But as has already been pointed out, there have been no breaches of the law or of the regulator's rules and guidelines.
In a society subject to the rule of law recent events cannot be used to close the plant.
I know that there are many people who would like to see Sellafield closed down.
In particular I know this is a very strongly held view in parts of Ireland.
In a free society, if that is how people feel, they must be allowed to articulate their opinions.
But that is no reason why the plant should be closed.
There can be no question of any lawfully established enterprise in any part of the European Union being closed by the public authorities without its breaking the law.
This true in Ireland, Denmark, the United Kingdom or any other Member State.
The owners - that is to say the United Kingdom Government - and the employees of Sellafield have legitimate interests which quite simply cannot be swept under the carpet.
This applies in this case just as much as to anybody else.
Finally, just as the recent crisis at Sellafield has been self-inflicted, so the solution to it lies in British Nuclear Fuels' hands, as they themselves understand.
I wish them well.
But words are not enough.
They must be matched by deeds - their deeds.
From an Irish perspective we are witnessing the beginning of the end of reprocessing at Sellafield and we have allies.
The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate, embarrassingly inadequate.
No uniform standards for safety and discharges, no Community consultation procedure concerning power stations sited near frontiers, no clear Community provisions for the storage and transport of nuclear fuels or nuclear waste, no adequate Community system of information and monitoring in cases of nuclear malfunction.
Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern.
As there are no prescribed criteria in EU law governing the design or operation of nuclear facilities, how do we judge their safety of operation?
Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks.
Society usually accepts a certain level of risk in return for an advantage and proponents of nuclear energy almost inevitably remind us of the balance of risk and benefit.
What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain's nuclear installations?
If nuclear safety and nuclear energy are so safe, why are not the majority of these installations located near the population centres of the south-east of England?
To minimise the risk to these population centres of course.
But seen from an Irish perspective, this stands logic on its head, we have counties Antrim, Down, Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford where the vast majority of the population of the island of Ireland, about 2 million people, live on or adjacent to the Irish sea where the majority of British nuclear institutions are sited.
Furthermore in recent years, we have all seen how consumer concern about the integrity of the food chain can devastate a once seemingly secure market.
Witness the BSE and dioxin problem.
We can only begin to imagine the effect of any kind of nuclear scare - just a scare - on these sectors of our economy.
Choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one's children is a very basic human right.
This right to determine, to control, to have any say about the risk of nearby concentrations of nuclear installations is denied to those of us who inhabit the western shores of the Irish sea.
In practice, nuclear decision-making in the UK falls far short of democratic standards.
Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy.
I will conclude.
The reality of Sellafield goes beyond the contribution to the Kyoto targets on the dependence of the UK economy on nuclear energy.
It also includes a litany of unreported incidents, falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel rods resulting in the loss of confidence by the Japanese in safety standards at the plant and the cancellation by the Germans and the Swiss of mixed oxide nuclear fuel pellets.
The reality of Sellafield includes incidents last September and early this year of deliberate sabotage, allegedly by members of the staff.
Serious doubts are being raised about the long-term viability of reprocessing.
Their order books are full for a few more years, but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant.
Even the new CEO, Mr Norman Askew, is reported as saying that reprocessing is not the big part of the business it once was.
A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt.
But a nuclear future for Sellafield can be justified: not mixed oxide fuel production, not thermal oxide reprocessing at the MOX and THORP plants.
The skills and the experience of the workforce and the major capital investment could and should be redirected towards waste management and the creation of a centre of excellence for decommissioning and that is what I suggest we concentrate the debate on.
Mr President, thank you very much for an interesting and valuable debate.
I hope that we can all agree on the need for confidence-building because, even though the conclusion is that this incident did not cause substantial damage or serious risks, we see that the price of the loss of confidence is very high.
It is in the interest of all of us to ensure that our citizens have confidence in our safety and security systems.
I am ready to come any time to any committee in Parliament to discuss those issues.
I can say that personally I would very much prefer to have Community rules.
But we must not give the impression that this would mean higher levels of safety in the European Union, because with the unanimity rule on the decisions on these issues, the end-result could be that we have minimum standard rules which would not live up to the expectations of our citizens.
We must be realistic, because we know the discussion and the position and attitude among the Member States: they are not willing to give the European Union more competence in this area.
That is also why the Commission's responsibility in this area is restricted to control radioactivity - but no more than that.
We need European rules.
However, we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly.
I share the view that we ought to discuss it more thoroughly.
In reply to Mrs Banotti's question, this European Nuclear Installation's safety group brings together the power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states.
It is not a wider forum but they can cooperate in this specific safety group.
It is not the first time that Sellafield has been discussed and we need to look into the safety issues very closely because, you remember, there was an accident in Japan.
That was because of lax control and some of the staff thought they could make a mix of their own.
So even in highly advanced societies there are serious risks with nuclear and processing techniques.
I should be pleased to come to Parliament at any time to continue this discussion.
However, I do not want to give anyone false hopes about what can be achieved very quickly and with the help of Member States.
That is also why we have restricted competence.
I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I would like to make a comment in relation to yesterday' s Minutes.
I do not appear amongst the signatories of the attendance register.
I was present all day yesterday and during the vote which took place at noon, but I do not appear in the Minutes.
I would be grateful if this error could be corrected.
We will check the list, Mr Valdivielso de CuÃ©, and make the necessary correction.
Mr President, I would like to inform the House, under Rule 111, that last Thursday, the offices of the Moss Media Group in Moscow comprising independent television and a number of newspapers and magazines were raided by so-called tax police, uniformed and armed.
Documents were taken away, the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain.
Mr President, this matter is one of the utmost importance.
It involves freedom of the press in Russia and further outrages are expected over the next two or three days.
Mr Robin Cook is in Moscow today.
He will discuss the matter with Mr Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and the 15 Ministers are thinking of a joint dÃ©marche.
But we in the European Parliament - what are we doing?
Nothing.
The matter is, if you like, too urgent to take on board because it happened last Thursday and cannot be brought forward as an urgency.
Could you please refer this question to the Conference of Presidents so that some system can be found to deal with very urgent and important matters such as this one?
We take note of your comment and your suggestion, Lord Bethell, and we will pass them on to the President.
Mr President, I would just like to make the House and the Presidency aware, as I believe it will be of interest to them, that yesterday, on the occasion of the Conference of Reconciliation in Vienna, an agreement was reached between the Austrian government representative, Mr Schaumeyer, and the American Deputy Finance Minister, Stuart Eizenstat, on compensation payments for the victims of Nazi forced labour in Austria.
The lawyers - and I feel I should take the opportunity to mention this as well - Michael Hausfeld and Martin Mendelson, who represent some of the governments of Eastern European countries, commented at the time that, in some respects, Austria is in fact providing more generous compensation payments than Germany, because in the first place, we are including the agricultural workers, and secondly, we are also paying compensation for children under the age of 12 and women who gave birth whilst in forced labour camps.
I believe this is worth sharing with the House.
Thank you for your statement, Mrs Stenzel.
(The Minutes were approved)
Broad outlines of economic policies
The next item is the report (A5-0134/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission recommendation for the 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (drawn up pursuant to Article 99(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community).
. (EL) Mr President, broadly speaking, the report tabled before plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contains a particularly positive appraisal of the Commission' s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States.
The committee has worked with its usual efficiency and diligence and has supported its proposals with an impressive econometric analysis which I should like to praise here in public.
The recommendation for the year 2000 has been formulated at a time of favourable developments and optimistic prospects for the European economy.
The prospects of an increase in the national wage in Europe in excess of 3% for 2000 and 2001 - 3.4% according to the latest forecasts for 2000 - are much higher than the disappointing actual average rates of increase throughout the 1990s.
These results, provided that they are realised, offer a window of opportunity, a springboard from which the European economy can launch on to a course which will lead to a permanently high and ecologically sustainable rate of growth.
It goes without saying that permanently high rates of growth are the sine qua non for improving the employment situation and strengthening the competitiveness of Europe in the global economy.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepts that the requisite rate of progress is best expressed through a growth rate of GDP of 3% or more, that this rate cannot be maintained over time without a substantial rise in the potential product of the EU economy and that there can be no increase in the potential product without productive investment.
The Commission, however, has avoided specifying the ratio of investment to GDP.
The Committee on Economic Affairs takes the view that quantitative economic targets may be useful, but insists that the fixing of such targets must not undermine the goals established in the stability pact, which are the fundamental guide for the economic policies in the euro zone.
Despite this general reservation, the report by the Committee on Economic Affairs expresses the committee' s satisfaction at the restatement in the Commission recommendation of the quantified target, set in the Presidency conclusions of the European Council at Lisbon, of raising labour force participation from 61% to 70% of the population by 2010 and of increasing the participation of women from 51% to over 60% by 2000.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs maintains that the requisite economic growth must be based on price stability and budgetary discipline, reasonable wage increases taking account of price stability, productivity increases and a reduction in unit labour costs, even in the case of reductions in working hours.
It also believes in greater liberalisation of competition, strengthening national competition authorities, providing special support for associations of small- and medium-sized enterprises and further developing the single market - especially in the public utilities and financial services sectors.
As far as financial services are concerned, having reached a broad consensus of agreement, we shall be tabling a joint amendment calling for the action plan for financial services to be applied more quickly, i.e. by 2003 rather than 2005.
The majority of the committee believes that mobilising the market will result in the need to increase investments using purely market instruments.
At the same time, however, it approves of the restructuring of government spending in favour of investment which must be justified - when it is justified - by the cost-benefit ratio, but rejects using public investments simply to manage the economy.
On a more general note, the committee approves of the challenges identified by the Extraordinary Council in Lisbon of full employment, a knowledge-based economy, modernisation of social protection systems and dealing with the impact of the ageing population, but expresses its concern at the gap between the key challenges and the often routine specific policy recommendations.
It therefore calls upon the Commission and Council to seriously consider the need for a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind the general guidelines.
The committee also reiterates Parliament' s previous call for an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament on the subject of the adoption of the resolution, although it thanks the Portuguese Presidency for its willingness to cooperate on this matter.
This is ad hoc cooperation, however, not cooperation reflected in an interinstitutional agreement, and we consider this a shortcoming in our procedure.
Ladies and gentlemen, we achieved a significant degree of consensus in our work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade.
Of course, there are certain differences in our assessment of the best way of achieving these targets.
Some of us believe that setting quantitative targets, even without mechanisms for imposing them, would help Europe give concrete expression to its efforts to move in the right direction.
This comment applies in particular to the target investment rate, which requires us to increase the potential rate of growth of the economy to 3% on a permanent basis.
This percentage is a familiar figure.
The Commission set it repeatedly in its studies and it would not have hurt to have included it.
We could also have given more categorical expression to the, I believe, general feeling that we need to relaunch the trans-European networks and address the need for new forms of financing for them and the issue of the involvement of private capital and public investment in this sector.
Without, in any way, giving the green light to squander public spending, we could have tried to give the public sector of the economy a slightly more positive role than merely that of 'guard-dog' for price stability.
There are margins for all this, especially through the window of opportunity, if the main risk to our economy is from the probability of a crisis on the American money markets which could paralyse the private investment mechanism.
Just imagine, ladies and gentlemen, if that were to happen and we, in the meantime, had forgotten how to handle public investment.
The European economy has a huge margin for growth; it is true that the European economy can become more productive, but we need to be bolder in the way we go about it.
Mr President, when drawing up this draft opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Social Affairs fully appreciated the importance of this resolution, Parliament' s first resolution on economic policy guidelines since the Lisbon Summit.
In particular, it stressed the importance of the connection between these two priorities and considered that the common elements of the broad guidelines of economic policy should be fully exploited and the various implementing processes adopted by the Councils over the years coordinated, and by this I am referring to the objectives of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes.
In our opinion, the open method of coordination, which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon, should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment, which, we feel, cannot be ignored.
The subsidiarity principle needs to be steered in this direction with regard to the role both of the governments and of the decentralised institutions, without diminishing the decisive part played by greater synergy, greater coordination between the broad guidelines, and by placing greater focus on the European Community dimension with a view to developing an economic policy which can enhance the potential for development in Europe and allow us to effectively achieve the goals which we set ourselves with regard to full employment.
We have taken the chapters of the broad guidelines into account, in particular the aspects related to the introduction of flexibility and efficiency elements in the products market, the financial services market and the labour market, but we have also acknowledged the importance of the negotiations of the Social Partners and of social objectives.
A further consideration: we consider - and for the remainder we refer you to the text of the opinion - that Parliament' s role in this matter must be consolidated by formal institution of the procedure laying down a specific interinstitutional agreement on the participation of Parliament in formal consultations on the economic policy guidelines and on the monitoring of their effects.
Mr President, the Liberal Group will support the Katiforis report on the broad guidelines for economic policies, which we are especially satisfied with since many of our observations were accepted during the debate in committee.
At a time when we are debating the weakness of the euro, at least in relation to the dollar, I think that we would do well to remember that the state of the European economy is solid and offers a framework for stability and solidity as well as excellent prospects for growth and employment. In short, we can look forward to very positive development over the next few years.
Therefore, the fact that, in some ways, the US economy is doing better than the European economy, at least in terms of growth forecasts, should not mask the fact that the European economy is doing well at the moment.
Furthermore, it is the European economy which is funding a good portion of US development.
However, we should not only be concentrating on the more positive aspects; we should also be taking note of the fragility of continued growth and solidity in the European economy.
In order to overcome this fragility, in our view, we need the European economy to function better, since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity, in both the public and private sectors, and on the part of both economic and social operators.
We therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market.
This would clearly involve the removal of the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the European internal market and a deep reform of the tax system, with the adoption of a tax package at European level. To sum up, we should overcome the conservatism which still exists in certain economic and social areas of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not vote in favour of the Katiforis report as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Obviously, we endorse the general thrust of the Katiforis report.
In particular, we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and, above all, salary agreements.
On the other hand, we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous.
We shall reject these amendments. Indeed, we shall reject them systematically, and we hope within the current parliamentary term to convince our fellow Members, including those in the Group of the European People' s Party, how dangerous they are.
In the first place, we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely.
Endorsing the goal of a European society which is as competitive as possible in terms of know-how means maximising investment in human capital.
Well, enhanced human capital is not a commodity to be taken and then dispensed with, but rather something to be respected, something that is offered to an individual by allowing them time to be trained, to gain and enhance experience.
So if there must be structural reform in wages, then it must be in the direction of greater, and not less, stability in employment.
There is a second fundamental point of which I desperately hope to convince my fellow Members in the next five - now four - years, and that is that we cannot claim to wish to respect the Kyoto Agreement by the year 2008.
We are aware, and the report acknowledges as much, that, at the moment, it is contradictory to attempt to reconcile an objective of 3% annual growth with the rejection of the urgent requirement to invest in energy saving, transport systems, in improving accommodation, in such a way as to make the Kyoto objectives and the objective of 3% growth compatible.
- (EL) Mr President, the Commission' s recommendation for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 may well accept a return to full employment, but it has stood by the basic approach of previous years.
Although I recognise the contribution made by Parliament and our rapporteur in gaining acceptance once again for the concept of full employment, I think that the rapporteur himself, whom I congratulate on his efforts, would agree that we need to redefine what we mean by employment and by full employment.
What does employed mean when we have before us a policy which dismantles working relations, minimises employment and, as a result, makes general poverty a mass phenomenon.
As far as its general approach is concerned, the Commission' s recommendation forms part of a more general neo-liberal economic and social policy which, with the support of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, finds expression in the report under discussion.
As far as we are concerned, the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment, stable, permanent and full employment, protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers.
This is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking.
The amendments which we propose to the European Parliament move in precisely this direction and we call on our fellow members to vote in favour of them.
Mr President, reading the broad guidelines for the economic policy presented by the Commission for the year 2000 leaves one with a strange impression that something is missing because nowhere is there any mention of the single currency, except in a brief and fleeting reference, stating the importance of the Maastricht criterion regarding the rationalisation of public finances or the need to gear monetary policy towards price stability.
There is not a word, however, on the current depreciation of the euro and its influence on the economy and economic policies.
This seems all the more surprising because every few pages the Commission document reiterates the idea that efficiency demands an overall strategy.
The same is unfortunately true of the European Parliament' s report since, out of the 35 points raised in the resolution, not one relates to the single currency, and it is only briefly referred to in the recitals.
Apparently, the rule of silence is prevailing, as it did when the major groups within Parliament rejected the proposal from the Union for a Europe of Nations Group to organise, as of today, a debate on the implications of fluctuations in the euro.
This debate has been deferred once again, even though there is a great deal to be discussed.
For years, all the economic and financial advantages a strong euro was going to offer have been trotted out for our benefit.
Now the euro is weak, are we to assume that the loss of these advantages has no implications worth mentioning?
This is surely some mistake!
The weak euro favours exports, as is often boasted. It also, however, presents serious disadvantages which are concealed, such as the misappropriation of capital, third party buyouts of euro zone businesses or weakening of the incentive for structural reforms, even though these are so necessary.
Finally, the basic problem still remains.
This depreciation in the euro has occurred because it is perceived as an artificial currency, but until this is clearly stated it will not be possible to remedy the situation.
In this instance too, then, let us hope that the European Parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future, before it is too late.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having scarcely emerged from the dull 80s, Europe has been plunged into the throes of international speculation.
We were promised a euro-cum-mark that would be stronger than the dollar, and which would compensate for the weakness of economic growth by means of the on-going revaluation of assets.
We have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its non-identifiable character.
Formerly, speculation on the exchange market involved the pound.
Now it is the euro.
This is nothing particularly surprising for us Members of the European Parliament who are accustomed to seeing Europe operating on a daily basis amid differences and antagonisms.
What will the situation be like after enlargement, when the markets will react to any event affecting any one of the thirty odd countries which make up the European technostructure?
It would almost be like the United Nations issuing a currency.
This reduction in the value of the euro is not something that Mr Duisenberg can do anything about, as this European Central Bank, whatever they say, is the brainchild of the two main States in the euro zone, and the French and German Governments have given the order to do nothing.
In order to maintain the value of the euro in relation to the dollar, we should have to raise euro interest rates to a level which is slightly higher than that of the dollar, perhaps to a level in the order of 50 base points.
From my standpoint as a post-Keynesian, I see this as having little impact on economic growth, since this depends on various other factors, the most important of which are psychological.
Obviously, we cannot agree to all assets located in France being devalued if the downward slide of the euro continues beyond the short term.
If this should happen, and obviously we hope it does not, then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible, and this would not mean Mr Duisenberg.
We shall judge the candidates in the French presidential elections according to the efforts they have made to get us out of this bind.
Mr President, the report is self-contradictory.
Paragraph 14 supports the Stability Pact' s demand that price stability should always precede employment-related considerations. Elsewhere, the desire is for higher employment and more democratic influence upon economic policy.
However, inflation should always, of course, be between zero and two per cent.
This is something that is supported, even though inflation has only stood at that rate for a period of six years in post-war Germany and Denmark.
It is now quite certain, however, that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times.
We no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix.
We have a Central Bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation.
In this way, the euro is allowed to depreciate and interest rates are increased with the result that there may be lower rates of growth and increased unemployment.
It is worse than the sacred cows in India, yet the report does not protest against this.
In paragraph G, on the other hand, a new sacred cow is to be found: that of high taxation.
Social security arrangements must be critically examined and social expenditure reduced, but savings can also be made on social expenditure by making higher employment the top economic objective.
In that way, people receiving cash benefits and unemployment benefit will be able to exchange these for proper wages.
That is an alternative recipe for economic policy, but one which is contrary to the Treaty.
The balance of trade deficit is normally to be no more than one per cent of GNP, irrespective of whether the money is used for investments, which can subsequently produce much larger deficits again. This would seem to be something which no amount of elections in the Member States or in the EU Parliament can change.
This is absurd. It runs counter to all experience and is a denial of the principle of democracy which unites our countries and which means that voters can go to the polls and vote in favour of higher employment, even if inflation might, as a result, occasionally rise above the two per cent mark.
Mr President, I enthusiastically support the further deepening of integration.
Many matters are best dealt with at Community level, but when I read the report of my colleague Mr Katiforis - which provides several guidelines which are favourable to the market economy and therefore worthy of support - I cannot agree with some of the proposals in it.
The dynamism and desired growth of the European economy will not come about by creating Union-wide integrated programmes, whether they be applied with good intentions in the area of training or entrepreneurship or whether they be common support systems for the benefit of SME organisations.
I also have my personal doubts about the superiority of a European scientific community, if it is to be created from above, i.e. by the volition of the Commission and the Council, and not allowed to develop naturally through networking between the scientific communities, from one business or university to another; financing, both at a national and European level, must naturally be secured.
Something which I have reservations about is the faith in the importance of top-level structures which stands out in this report; a programme and planning from the top may actually put the brakes on development rather than make it dynamic.
At present, European dynamism will be improved by dismantling top-level structures, for example, barriers to trade, which are still hindering the creation of a genuine internal market.
This is what Mr Katiforis is also calling for, albeit of the Commission, when it should be demanded of those nation states, which - in a few individual cases - practice obstructionism, for example, in the areas of transport, public procurement or energy.
When discussing economic policies in the context of this report, we should not forget about competition policy.
Recently, the neutrality of the Communities' competition policy has been called into question - justifiably so - inter alia in the case of Volvo-Scania.
The reason given for regional monopolies and concentration of power in regions with a small population base is rather lame.
It is clearly a real blow to the industry and trade of small and remote countries while they are making efforts to increase their competitiveness within the Union area.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Katiforis and Commissioner Solbes, both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy.
We must take advantage of the fact that we are in the European Union to do things collectively.
I wish to concentrate on research and development.
I regret that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not draw up an opinion on Mr Katiforis' s report - it should have done.
Compared to the US and Japan, we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland - countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success.
We need scientists in order to have research and development.
Let us stop young people choosing to do other things.
Let us encourage women.
Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased.
Above all, let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists.
That is what makes them choose other careers.
Of course, we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications.
We need a strategy.
Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper, so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts.
However, the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the US in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science, and it pays off.
Commissioner Busquin' s communication on the European research area is very good.
However, what is important is the next stage: transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold.
Let us be innovative in the European Union.
Let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from Luxembourg to Brussels, where it can use its skills working with other departments of the Commission.
That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do.
Mr President, as everyone is pointing out, the euro has just lost almost 30% of its value in sixteen months, but the European Commission, like the Central Bank, does not seem to be in much of a hurry to learn the lessons of this experience, as that would be liable to challenge the current monetary policy which benefits only stock exchange transactions and speculation.
The ambition to achieve full employment and a modern economy, as declared in Lisbon, are indeed laudable objectives, but they are now effectively coming up against the liberal yoke.
In its document on the broad economic guidelines, the Commission pursues this liberal approach, and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States.
The Commission, indeed, shows no compunction in issuing orders to this or that State with a view to drawing up its budget.
It clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining, even going beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact.
Following the example of the Central Bank, it demands wage moderation as well as structural reform of the labour market, especially in order to make it more flexible.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the Lisbon decisions.
It advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages. It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market.
This is why I am unable to approve of the guidelines contained in this report, especially when made exacerbated by the many amendments introduced by the right wing.
The current economic situation, particularly with the decline in the euro, ought to lead the Union and the Member State governments to strive towards the reorientation of European policy, so as to enable it at last to fulfil expectations regarding social issues.
We must shake up the dogma of the Stability Pact.
We must reverse the current approach, which makes social policy nothing more than a consequence of economic and monetary policy, responsible only for making good the damage caused by the market by means of a policy of aid.
This new policy should be particularly based on support to investment that creates jobs by means of a selective policy of credit, the improvement in living and working conditions and a reduction of working hours without flexibility or increased precariousness, taxation on income and financial measures to curb speculation and to release new resources.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the very points which so displeased the previous speaker, i.e. the sections of the reports which display a liberal approach.
In fact, as recent events concerning the euro illustrate, the European Union and the institutions are currently at a crossroads: we have the choice between the road to prosperity and growth, undertaking radical structural liberalisation reforms that Europe must implement boldly, and the road of preservation and the perpetuation of a corporate, statist vision of the economy which is condemning many European countries to levels of unemployment which are two or three times higher than those in America and to a marginal role in the most innovative and dynamic sectors of the economy.
Having said that, I cannot fail to welcome the Katiforis and PomÃ©s Ruiz reports, which clearly stress the way in which the liberalisation and flexible nature of the markets - especially the labour market - the dramatic reduction in tax pressure, a thorough reform of state pension systems and the gradual separation of state and economy - first and foremost through the privatisation of public companies - are all choices which cannot now be put off any longer if we want to avoid building a Europe which may well be united, but united by unemployment, marginalisation of the most vulnerable, in particular women and children, and by the endless red tape surrounding the social initiatives of the society, a Europe, that is, which will fail to create either growth or employment.
This is one of the shortcomings of the euro, a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible, excessively regulated markets.
Some say that political control of the economy at European level would be a way of resolving this crisis.
Beware!
If political control has to be a means of control which transfers the interventionism of national economies to Brussels, this would be a bad move.
We Italian Radicals are also in favour of political control, but federalist, liberal control, with a limited number of clear laws and no state intervention in the economy, even by the European State.
Mr President, the present draft resolution by Mr Katiforis contains many valid points.
We should, however, qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle.
Both the Commission' s recommendation and the resolution claim high economically sustainable growth as the highest good and pursue this remorselessly.
This is odd, given the global relations in which the rich West is seen as an exclusive residential neighbourhood.
Do we want even more?
Do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means?
The lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society.
It stimulates egocentricity, social exclusion, a blurring of moral standards and moral decay.
The corruption of society eventually harms economic development.
On a positive note, attention is paid to the effects of an ageing population on the sustainability of government funds.
Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen.
A further consolidation, a reduction in the debt burden, is desperately needed in many Member States, so as to ensure that funds are available in future for health care and provision for old age.
Taxes and social security contributions in the European Union are high compared to the United States, but the picture changes fundamentally when we consider the sometimes extortionate insurance premiums which American citizens have to pay.
The amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support.
After all, the Kyoto Agreement more than merits compliance.
Mr President, I want to associate myself this morning with those people who have spoken in this debate and expressed some desire to challenge an atmosphere of complacency about the current state of the European economy.
I share the view expressed earlier by Mrs McNally that you can look to the United States and see that there has been investment in research.
That is one of the reasons why the United States is doing better than Europe.
But we must also emphasise that one of the other reasons why the United States continues to do so much better than Europe is because Europe has not yet properly addressed the issue of structural reform and market liberalisation.
I refer to the remarks made earlier by Mr Lipietz for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation.
The fact is that we have not yet seen the agreed market liberalisation within Europe applied in some Member States, not least his own.
I have a shared concern about the jobs of workers.
I would be very pleased to bring Mr Lipietz to speak to workers in the United Kingdom who may lose their jobs as a result of decisions made by a French owner of energy companies in the UK, when British companies are not allowed to gain access to the French market because the French have not applied agreed European policy.
That is a structural reform we must drive through.
It is not just in that area.
We see that the wealthiest states within the European Union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid.
That is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here.
That is also one of the reasons why I do not share the view expressed by Mr von Wogau in relation to competition policy.
My concern, where decentralisation is concerned, is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy.
Mr President, over the past few days, the debate on a European economic government has gained momentum once again in different quarters.
It is evident that more economic management is required at European level, but it is not so evident that only the 11 euro zone countries or the Ecofin Council will need to take on that coordination.
At the Lisbon Summit, a decision was made precisely in favour of a wider socio-economic approach in which employment, economic reform and social cohesion are seen as being interrelated.
In my opinion, the key conclusion that was reached at that summit was that the European Council will itself adopt an active, guiding and coordinating role.
Each spring, our government leaders will discuss the socio-economic policy on the basis of an integrated progress report from the European Commission.
Unfortunately, spring had already started this year.
The text for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 had already been drafted, very much along established lines.
Why did the Commission not take more time and, in line with Lisbon, draft the guidelines in an interdisciplinary manner, as prepared by the different DGs?
Why do we not let the Commission continue with, and further develop, this type of cooperation, which also typified the preparatory work for Lisbon, in a socio-economic field?
That seems to me a highly interesting challenge for the Commission' s new Secretary General, David O'Sullivan.
I would suggest taking into account conclusion 29 of the present report, which advocates a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind economic policy-making to bring it in line with the Lisbon conclusions.
I would also like to make reference to the conclusions of this Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, compiled by Mr Cocilovo.
He proposes the drawing up of a single annual report on the economic and social state of the Union, and one set of annual guidelines for sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion.
One additional suggestion I would like to make is to include the socio-economic forum, which is scheduled for next month, earlier on in the annual cycle, i.e. at the very beginning of the year.
At the moment, it is just tacked on at the end.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the consensus-oriented cooperation which we have enjoyed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this sphere and add that we in this Parliament should break though the compartmentalisation and endeavour to rise above the hobbyhorses of this or the other side and to have an input in, for example, next month' s forum, precisely on that basis.
The Commission' s recommendation and report may be evaluated in the light of the euro system' s most fundamental problems, and these are undeniably major and glaringly apparent.
I come from a country whose people enjoy the rare privilege of being consulted in connection with such far-reaching decisions as participation in the euro system.
Among Danes, there is a great deal of scepticism about, and opposition to, the national currency being swallowed up by the euro.
I have no doubt that this scepticism and opposition are shared by large and growing groups of the populations of the other Member States, who are not being consulted.
I only have time to mention a couple of points.
The first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro.
Nobel Prize-winner Franco Modigliani points out that, in his view, unemployment has certainly been used by the European Central Bank as an instrument of economic policy designed to control inflation.
This is a crucial point.
The other absolutely crucial point I would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution: the political weakness of the euro system.
What is missing, of course, is a political superstructure for steering economic policy.
This is the background to the French government' s proposal that the EU' s euro system should be equipped with a form of proper economic government.
It is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the Danish people' s consent.
I can predict that the question of whether or not the euro zone is to be enlarged to include Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain will be decided in Denmark in the referendum on 28 September. The scepticism I have expressed here continues to grow.
Mr President, the Katiforis report is no more than a mundane vindication of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States.
Of its 29 paragraphs, 8 go in for approval and then 4 indulge in self-congratulation.
As far as the working population of the countries of the European Union is concerned, there really is not much to be pleased about.
What use is the economic growth that the report boasts about, if it is only going to recommend - addressing employees of course - adopting a reasonable attitude in wage negotiations, going so far as to claim that the pension system must be radically revised with a view to protecting their financial position?
This is one way of admitting that there is no place in this growth for employed workers or for retired workers.
Once again, the Council and the Commission are acting as spokespersons for big business, asking Parliament to sanction it.
For our part, we have not been elected to offer congratulations to governments that come to the assistance of big business and major financial groups in order to enable them to accrue even greater wealth by exacerbating inequalities, leaving 18 million women and men unemployed, making flexibility at work and job instability more widespread, by making swingeing cuts in the total wage bill in order to ensure the continued growth of income from capital, including its most parasitic speculative forms.
If it is true, as the report states, that we have seen a return to growth, then it is all the more appalling that, throughout Europe, only a tiny minority benefits from it.
We shall therefore be voting against this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is having to compete with a series of challenges generated by globalisation and the creation of a new economy based on knowledge and new technologies.
The Union' s strategic goal for the forthcoming decade must be to ensure economic growth and free enterprise, without violating the social question, with guidelines based on competitiveness, sustainable development and the creation of new jobs.
On the subject of this last point, as the Katiforis report stressed, there has been a slight fall in unemployment in Europe, but unemployment is still unacceptably high, particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people.
The situation appears worse in certain regions of Southern Europe, in particular in the South of Italy, where 21.9% of the workforce is unemployed, including 56.6% of the 14-25 age group.
Consequently, in my opinion, broad guidelines for economic growth and a rise in employment should include measures to render the European market more competitive and increase job flexibility.
In order to bring about sustainable growth, we need to finalise creation of the internal market and remove all the remaining barriers by liberalising those sectors which are not yet totally open to free competition, such as transport, gas, electricity and the postal services.
We need to introduce the reforms which will have to be implemented by the Member States in order to alleviate the burden on firms, reduce labour costs, sustain actions supporting lifelong learning in the context of a knowledge-based economy and support research to close the gap between Europe and the United States and Japan.
We need to facilitate public administration structural reform in the countries where excessive red tape is a barrier to private investment and bring the social protection and taxation systems into line with the requirements imposed by the new economic rules and with the constraints established by the Stability and Growth Pact.
Mr President, we do not support the Commission' s guidelines.
They are outdated and obsoleted by events and do not contain any prospect of a solution to the extremely serious problems which are both holding back economic development and, in particular, weighing down the citizens.
The proposed formulae will lead to ruin: flexibility at all costs, further dismantling of the Welfare State with pension cuts, the imposition of unjustified salary restrictions across the board, and even discrimination between regions, a decrease in public investment and obsessive recourse to the Stability Pact and the monetarism which have not only already caused irreparable harm in the past but have certainly not done anything to support a euro which is yielding increasingly to the supremacy of the dollar.
The acclaimed macroeconomic development for job creation is so tied up in the self-regulation of the free market that it has not yet created any jobs, rather it has destroyed stable jobs, while, in the worst of cases, contributing to keeping salaries low in precarious employment sectors.
This is not the way to fight unemployment, but it will heighten social poverty, increase the democratic deficit and feed public scepticism towards the democratic institutions.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their magnificent work, and all the speakers in today' s debate for the additional ideas they have contributed, which will no doubt be useful to the Commission and the debate in the Council of Ministers.
Today, together with the broad guidelines for economic policies, other issues have been raised, particularly in relation to the euro.
When speaking of the euro, I would point out two things: firstly, I would ask that the problem be looked at in its entirety, not simply the exchange rate problem.
Secondly, I would point out that the Commission' s position remains the same; that is to say, clear growth and price stability must logically lead to an improvement in the euro.
This is not an issue we can go into today, but I wanted to make those points.
Today, we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies.
The new broad guidelines differ from previous ones in that they partially incorporate Lisbon.
It has been said that they do not incorporate it fully.
This is true in the sense that Lisbon is too close to the presentation of the broad guidelines and the bulk of the work had been done previously.
Nevertheless, I believe that there were elements prior to Lisbon which anticipated or foresaw what was going to happen there and which have been incorporated into the broad guidelines.
Many of you have referred to the idea of full employment as a fundamental element.
Full employment, according to the Commission' s initial document - which formed the basis of the Lisbon decision - is something which can be achieved as long as the proposed policies are implemented.
The problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns.
We can put a figure on both our employment objectives as well as on what we take the expression "full employment" to mean, as some of you have suggested.
It all depends on what we consider the objectives to be.
It is absolutely essential, in speaking of these objectives, that we know whether they are political objectives or whether they represent the possibility of achieving certain economic results, as a consequence of the policies we implement.
In any event, I would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies.
Some speakers have shown a degree of concern about the Commission' s habitual proposals on the flexibility of the labour market.
In our view, this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market.
It will therefore lead to more employment, but also - as we have always argued - greater quality of employment.
This is something we have regularly stressed.
The flexibility of the labour market involves many other things: we can talk about regulating working time, but also the removal of all the obstacles which currently stand in the way of employment, such as tax-related issues.
A major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment.
The central element of these broad guidelines for economic policies is trying to increase the European Union' s potential for growth.
If we are not capable of doing so, it is blatantly obvious that the current positive growth forecasts of over 3% will only last a relatively short amount of time and this trend will not be allowed to continue.
That is why public and private investment are absolutely essential.
Since 1997, investment has been increasing progressively.
By 2001, public and private investment should reach 21% of GDP and, in 2004, it should reach 23%, which would bring us very close to that objective of 24%, which was mentioned in the Commission' s White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness.
I would like to raise a point here which seems to me to be essential.
In my opinion, there is no contradiction between greater investment, greater public investment, and the Stability Pact. On the contrary, I believe that since the Stability Pact has allowed for the rationalisation of public finances, it will bring greater public investment in the future.
I agree with the view that, in these new circumstances, an improvement in the quality of public finances must involve greater public investment.
This is a point which the Commission has highlighted in the different stability and convergence programmes and, clearly, it is a point which we must continue to stress.
Some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy.
This is one of the key elements of the broad guidelines, but I would like to remind you - as I always do - that the main point of the introduction of the new economy is to improve productivity, which is the element which is most likely to bring future growth.
I would like to make an additional comment on two points.
Firstly, with regard to the interinstitutional agreement, which has been of concern to the Commission, and secondly, the problems of greater coordination in the face of greater subsidiarity.
With regard to the interinstitutional agreement, this is clearly one of Parliament' s recurrent demands.
It is also true that its implementation raises legal problems, as well as problems relating to the status of its participants, but I believe that, in any event, we should be satisfied with the progress made this year.
I promised you some months ago, when we discussed this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that the Commission would try to make the greatest possible progress with regard to its cooperation with Parliament.
It does not take the form of an interinstitutional agreement, but the presentation of the document on the results of the broad guidelines for economic policies, which will permit a prior debate in Parliament, seems to me to be a positive thing.
There are other more profound elements, such as the introduction of the idea of broader economic discussions, with the participation of Parliament, and the famous entretiens Ã©conomiques, which will, in the future, offer us new opportunities and ideas for our political debate.
In my opinion, the Portuguese Presidency' s idea - which we support - of also establishing a debate with Parliament on these issues, not at an institutional level as suggested by Parliament, but of a different nature, is also clearly positive.
I believe that this is a good direction to take, and we must continue to cooperate in this regard in the future.
Lastly, I would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied.
As you all know, economic policies are the responsibility of the Member States and, in this respect, subsidiarity is guaranteed.
In my opinion, the greatest possible coordination is essential.
I therefore argue that we should move ahead with the coordination of economic policies, making reference to the Member States' obligations.
I realise that for some of you this may seem like interference by the Commission in the responsibilities of the Member States, but that is what is laid down in the Treaty, in the legislation which we have created for ourselves, and that is the Commission' s mandate: to make specific recommendations.
I said that coordination is necessary, but I do not believe that this has to be incompatible with subsidiarity.
Greater coordination and greater definition of global policies does not exclude, however, the existence of an additional margin for action on the part of the Member States.
I would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions, your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented.
Stability and convergence programmes
The next item is the report (A5-0108/2000) by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes (2000/2041(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very happy to reiterate your closing words in the debate on subsidiarity or coordination.
I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that there is no contradiction between these two terms, and that they should both be perfectly achievable.
Perhaps this debate, on the 11 stability plans presented by the countries participating in the euro and the four convergence plans, is a good time to review the harmonisation between the subsidiarity and coordination required by the introduction and future of the single currency.
This, therefore, is the flip-side of the debate which we have just held on the report by Mr Katiforis, and we must firstly begin to think about the instrument.
This is the first time that this Parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the Member States.
I suspect that, in subsequent versions, the report will not be a single whole, but rather a detailed study will have to be made of the solutions, the weak and strong points, which this Parliament detects in the economic policies proposed by the Member States.
We are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted, in the structure of expenditure and also of income, paying particular attention to investments.
We would ask that the projections they make in the medium and long term take account of different scenarios relating to the development of interest rates, demographic development and other variables affecting the stability of our accounts in the long term.
We also ask in this regard - and I am returning to the debate on subsidiarity - for greater political commitment from the 15 national parliaments.
We believe that this is a task which falls to everyone, and not just to the European Parliament.
Some Member States have subjected the stability and convergence plans to internal debate in order to seek political support for this idea of jointly building economic unity, and we should ask the Member States who have not done so to debate these programmes in their parliaments in order to try, firstly, to persuade those states and parliaments to participate in this common task and, secondly, to provide political support for the commitments which are agreed to regarding the necessary coordination of economic policies.
Turning to the report' s proposals to the House, I am very pleased to note that all of the budgetary objectives established in previous programmes have been met, and even exceeded.
However, this cause for satisfaction is counter-balanced by the fact that, aside from the possible criticism that the objectives could perhaps have been more demanding and rigorous, we are seeing that the objectives have been achieved, not as a result of the interest and efforts of the Member States, but simply to factors such as the favourable development of interest rates or greater than expected tax revenue.
We therefore believe that, although budgetary consolidation must continue to be a priority, the economic environment - which has improved a lot - must offer us the possibility of speeding up consolidation and, at the same time, undertaking structural reforms in the medium term.
It is not acceptable for this relative economic boom to dissuade the Member States from making decisions - sometimes difficult decisions - on structural reforms.
These include, firstly, labour reform, which we discussed earlier.
It is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate.
The improved performance of the labour market - which is clear - has been based on satisfactory economic growth, and not all the Member States have made the rigorous reforms that they must make, more radical reforms, to resolve the unacceptable problem of the high rate of unemployment in the European countries in comparison to other countries and which is not only an economic blight but also, and above all, a personal and family blight which cannot be permitted in the modern Europe of the 21st Century.
It is also crucial that we liberalise the telecommunications and energy markets, and not all countries are doing so in the same way.
With regard to tax reform, we should welcome the reduction in the high level of taxes in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, and we should bear in mind that the high rate of unemployment often relates to the fact that we have high levels of tax.
In the long-term reforms, we should also include the serious problem of population.
In the programmes presented to us, we note that particular attention is given to the ageing of the population.
Perhaps it is time that we insisted that Member States resolve the demographic problem at source, through a suitable approach to both tax revenue policies and social expenditure, in order to protect families with children.
This is the way to tackle the problem at source, and not only its effects.
This is the only way we will prevent the old Europe from becoming a decrepit Europe.
Mr President, the Liberal Group supports the rigorous and demanding report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz.
It lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Member States in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied, which, as I mentioned in my previous intervention on the Katiforis report, have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the European economy.
However, this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, correctly makes in his report.
He mentioned one of these recommendations in his speech: the need to take advantage of the current favourable situation, the healthy state of public finances - which on the other hand are disciplined by the stability and convergence programmes - in order to reduce the deficit, and possibly remove it completely, as well as to reduce debt levels, even to below the limits set in the convergence programmes.
This would mean that we could make far-reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy, for business initiative, to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments: to be up-to-date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies.
I would like to conclude by arguing - and I believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz' s report - for greater coordination between the Member States with regard to the implementation of these programmes.
I would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at European Union level.
- (EL) Ladies and gentlemen, the PomÃ©s Ruiz report has the good fortune to assess the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes at a time when the economic climate has helped these programme achieve success.
The rapporteur complains that the objectives are more the result of higher than expected tax revenues and the favourable development of interest rates than of the Member States' own efforts.
This perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy.
In my view, there is nothing reprehensible about being able to achieve balanced budgets through development rather than by imposing fasting and prayer on the Member States.
To try and balance the budget solely by cutting expenditure, while, at the same time, wanting to reduce taxation, is something which goes beyond economic restructuring and the spirit of the Stability Pact, at least in my understanding, to limiting the involvement of the public sector in the economy.
It is something in addition to the Stability Pact.
This trend can also be seen from the reference to the fact that tax and social contributions in Europe account for approximately 46% of GDP, while in the USA and Japan they only account for 30%.
But they are higher in Europe because we have a social state.
If Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz' s group wishes to change the policy on the social state, it should table it clearly and not tack it on to the Stability Pact.
I did not find one single reference in the report which justified Greece' s being singled out, as Mr Karas has done, but I should like to say the following, now that the subject has been raised: it is irresponsible to say that inflation in Greece has only fallen over recent months.
Inflation has fallen over eight years from 18% to 2%, thanks to constant and unstinting effort.
I had hoped that we warranted more generous support for this tremendous effort, which has required sacrifices on the part of the Greek people.
To say that Greece will be unable to sustain the criteria, I am sorry, but that is prejudging the facts.
How do we know that they cannot be sustained in Greece but they can be sustained in so many other countries of the European Union?
The Greek people are determined to apply the criteria and they will show their determination in due course.
Mr President, we support the main objective of the motion for a resolution under debate, that is, the need for consistently transparent budget regulation on the part of the individual Member States in line with the objectives of the Stability Pact.
However, we feel that, precisely in consideration of these undertakings and in the light of the current situation, the precise nature of any interventions cannot be identified in advance just for the sake of efficient budget control.
In fact, in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between States, there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators.
I refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure, structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors.
On the other hand, we are aware of the need for a more effective convergence process, for economic cohesion and, therefore, also for the approximation of the single currency, whose oscillation is no longer virtual but is in line with prices and taxes; the need, of course, for more harmonious tax and fiscal policies, but also pricing policies; for more harmonious investment policies as regards both research and the closing of infrastructure gaps, including within the individual States, but also for greater homogeneity in the action of public administrations.
The most representative variable is certainly the time frames and contents of the Treaty reforms and the process of constitutionalisation of the Union, i.e. of a greater or lesser European political presence.
Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy, in a debate such as this, to differentiate between those aspects of our policy which we normally raise in the broad guidelines for economic policies, the stability and growth pacts or the references to the convergence reports, which will be the subject of the third debate this morning.
In the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements.
I would essentially like to refer to the one which seems essential today, that of the stability pacts, although I will mention certain other points which have been raised.
Firstly, I share Mr PomÃ©s' s view that we need greater coordination, which is not incompatible with subsidiarity, but I am also interested in his additional demands that we work in more detail on expenditure and income, the existence of different scenarios or greater commitments in terms of national policies.
However, I would like to remind him that, within the framework of subsidiarity, it falls to the Member States to define their own stability and growth programmes.
The Commission must judge them, but it is not our job to give instructions on this point.
Nor is it our job to give instructions on the stability programmes or structural reforms, which you have mentioned.
These structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies.
However, there is a point - the third which you referred to - which lies between the world of structural reform and the tax obligations relating to the deficit and, above all, the stability of public finances, in particular with regard to debt.
I am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population.
It is true that this is much more than a purely financial problem, but this is the concern which we highlighted in Lisbon.
I would say that, in this case - as in the case referred to by Mrs Randzio-Plath, of the need to compare the quality of programmes and greater harmonisation, or the reference by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, for example, to deepening tax reforms - in our current thinking there is the reasonable prospect of fulfilling the objectives of the stability and growth programmes, and we believe that we must pay more attention to what we call the sustainability and quality of public finances.
We will present a report in May on this specific point, in which we intend to consider not only the nature of income but also the nature of expenditure as well as how the reduction in public deficit has been achieved and what instruments have been used.
These are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the Member States.
We will also tackle the issue of our future obligations.
In many cases the Member States have obligations which are not classed as debt, but which do, in fact, constitute debt in one form or another.
All of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned.
I believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth.
Having said this, I am grateful for the effort you have made to assess the work we have done.
I believe that the problems of stability and convergence are basically characterised - as you have correctly highlighted, Mr PomÃ©s - by the fact that, firstly, the objectives set have been met; secondly, because we are following the same line.
However, that fulfilment of the objective, especially with regard to the reduction of public deficits, has been less ambitious - surely as a result of an improved economic situation - and we must take advantage of that improved economic situation so that we do not move backwards, but that we make progress in the right direction.
I said that I wanted to make a couple of additional comments on two points that have been raised concerning issues which are not strictly related to this report, but with the previous report.
Mr Karas referred to the Greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria.
In the case of Greece, exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments.
I understand that concern, mentioned in the Commission' s report, about the sustainability of inflation, but I would also like to provide some information which may clarify the situation.
According to the latest figures of the harmonised CPI - published on 15 May and concerning the month of April - Greek inflation is improving considerably in comparison to the previous situation: it has decreased from 2.8% to 2.1%; and the unharmonised index also shows better figures for April as compared with March.
Therefore, I believe that these concerns about Greek inflation are sometimes excessive.
Secondly, you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the PomÃ©s report.
I will simply say, with regard to two amendments by your Group, that in one of them there is a small error relating to Greece' s entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In my view, in Amendment No 4, it would make more sense to adopt a more positive approach with regard to the Greek government' s future obligations than it would to adopt an approach which raises doubts as to its capacity to fulfil its obligations.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Adoption of single currency by Greece
The next item is the report (A5-0135/2000) by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision for the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 (COM(2000)274 - C5-0226/2000 - 2000/0110(CNS)).
Mr President, Greece will be the twelfth country to sign up to the euro.
Greece does not have to beg to be allowed into the euro zone; it is fully qualified to join the States that will introduce the euro as an effective and definitive means of payment in 2002.
In Greece, the economic convergence criteria have been met, as a result of a stabilisation policy implemented most consistently by the Greek authorities since 1996.
At the beginning of the 1990s, Greece was considered the sick man of Europe, economically speaking.
The rate of inflation exceeded 20%.
The European Union officially described the budgetary deficit as excessive.
The public sector was notoriously mismanaged.
Almost half of the public debt was due to on-going transfers from the state to public undertakings.
Today, major international bodies such as the IMF, the OECD, the Commission and even the ECB generally speak very highly of the efforts which the Greeks have made.
It must be noted that private operators have also discovered Greece.
In recent years, it has become a significant net recipient of foreign capital.
The stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion.
International rating agencies have improved their rating for Greek loans.
The situation is far from perfect, of course.
There are still problems, particularly regarding the restructuring of the public sector.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stresses the following points.
Greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of disinflation has a lasting effect.
The government must step up the anti-inflationist bias of the economic policy instruments available to it, particularly in the fields of the budget and income policy.
Cooperation between the two sides of industry seems essential in order to maintain a situation of non-inflationary growth.
Even if considerable progress has been achieved in terms of the implementation of structural reforms, Greece must step up progress in the reforms which are still necessary, including the effective transposition of European legislation into national law.
Parliament has been consulted, in the context of a political decision to be taken by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, after deliberation by the forthcoming European Council.
Parliament' s response can therefore only be a political one, in favour or against, like any final decision in a genuine democracy.
Greece' s entry into the euro zone does not entail any political risks.
Greece is entitled and, indeed, obliged to join EMU.
There are probably some economic risks but these are more significant for Greece than for the countries in the euro zone.
In joining the euro zone, Greece will be forced to maintain the culture of stability which has been established since 1996, and this involves pursuing a responsible economic policy.
This has, however, already created a virtuous circle leading to sustainable, non-inflationist growth, proving that stability is not an end in itself but that it must serve the purpose of healthy growth.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by an overwhelming majority, therefore urges Parliament to vote in favour of Greece' s accession to the euro zone in 2001.
Mr President, let me add a few more personal observations.
I should like to congratulate the Danish and Swedish governments on having decided to consult their citizens regarding accession to the single currency.
I hope that the results of these plebiscites will be favourable.
In the same way, I should like to see the United Kingdom opt for the single currency in the very near future.
The shared objective of the fifteen Member States to create a European Union which is ever more closely bound, particularly comprising an area without internal borders, could not be achieved in full without a single currency.
The United Kingdom, as one of the financial capitals of the world, will not be able to claim all the advantages of an ever more integrated European financial market unless it becomes part of it in its own right and takes on all the joint responsibilities and obligations required under Economic and Monetary Union.
There are some Members of Parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow, or who will abstain.
Some are opposed to the euro, as is their right, while others are attempting to make political capital out of the real concerns which our fellow citizens have regarding the dollar-euro exchange rate.
It must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency.
Citizens' purchasing power within the euro zone has remained virtually unchanged since inflation has been, and remains, at a very moderate level.
Of course, the value of the euro has fallen in relation to the dollar and, to a lesser extent, in relation to the yen and the pound.
Such fluctuations are inevitable in a floating exchange rate system.
Even so, the euro has not become a weak currency.
In the last twenty years, the Deutschmark has experienced much more extreme variations in relation to the dollar.
In 1985, the dollar stood at 3.5 DM.
In order to reach such a low level in relation to the dollar, the rate of the euro would have to fall below 0.6 to the dollar.
Some people claim that the financial markets do not value the euro because of Europe' s tardiness in implementing structural reforms.
What structural reforms did Germany undertake after 1985 in order to ensure that the Deutschmark returned to a rate of 1.7 or 1.8 DM to the dollar?
The fact is, the economic position of the European Union is very sound, and is much more favourable than it has been over the last decade.
The only grey area is a rate of unemployment which, although falling, is still excessive.
A return to full employment is certainly not calculated to please the financial markets most of all.
Generally speaking, good news regarding employment makes the stock exchange nervous, as it makes them afraid of a rise in inflation.
Financial markets operate according to their own particular logic.
They look for immediate returns, and currently this is a safer bet in the United States, particularly because of its higher interest rates.
This trend looks set to continue, as the Federal Reserve has just hiked up its interest rates.
With their sheep-like behaviour, however, the markets will ultimately come to realise, Mr President, that, in the medium term, the euro will be a more secure currency than the dollar.
Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to welcome Greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of Greek membership.
For those other 'out' countries, including my own, I very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon.
I very much regret too that there are so few British Conservatives here in the Chamber today because it shows, with Greece now the twelfth member of the euro zone, how far from reality British euroscepticism about the future of the currency is.
The euro has successfully delivered low inflation, rising growth, falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges.
Indeed, the British perception of the euro as a failure, because of its fall against the dollar, simply misunderstands the whole project.
The key test of a currency is price stability within the economy, not the value of the currency against other currencies outside the economy.
On the test of internal stability, with inflation at less that 2% and growth higher at 3.1% in the euro zone than in Britain, the euro is clearly succeeding.
Indeed, research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi recently calculated the euro' s value as if it had existed over the last few decades, weighting each predecessor currency's value to create a synthetic euro.
Historically, that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of USD 1.70 in December 1979 and a low of just USD 0.69 in February 1985.
In other words, the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further 23% or rise by 188%.
Certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the Italian Lira, but the same point applies even to the mighty German Mark on its own.
If the euro is a weak currency, than the Mark was positively anaemic.
It plunged to DEM 3.45 against the dollar at the end of February 1985, which is a third below its current rate of DEM 2.16 to the dollar.
Within three years, and a dollar crash, the Mark was back to DEM 1.57 during December 1987.
The truth is that the history of foreign exchange is a history of gross misalignments, of overvaluations and undervaluations, each inflicting either depressive pain or inflationary costs on the economy and, as Greece has rightly recognised, the euro is a way of regaining control over a key part of our economic environment.
- (EL) Mr President, the report under discussion contains accurate information and an objective assessment.
Greece is being judged, just as the first countries in EMU were judged, and this judgement accords Greece the position which it deserves, the position which it could have taken up back then, when it could have become a member of EMU along with everyone else, but which it failed to take up because of the weakness of its government.
In all events, this moment is an historic moment for Greece and, may I say, for Europe too.
I hope that we shall see other such historic moments when other countries join and, even more so, when we proceed, as we must, with the policy to complete unification.
The euro restored politics to Europe and it is incumbent upon us to pave the way so that politics in Europe can be institutionalised and globalisation, which is progressing blindly, without any historical or political plan, can be politicised at a later date, through a unified Europe,
For Greece and the other members of EMU, the problem of sustainability is crucial.
The problem of whether or not they will be able to act together on economic policy, as if they had already achieved political unification, is a political problem par excellence.
It is a problem of development choices and changes and, of course, it is a problem of public finance management.
Greece has a tax reform problem.
A large part of the economy pays no taxes and the basic taxes which exist in other Member States do not exist in Greece.
The average Greek taxpayer pays more than other Europeans but total tax revenues in Greece are much lower as a percentage of GDP.
This structural change is pending, while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation.
Other important structural changes are also pending, such as the need to strengthen regional authorities and their financial independence, reorganise cooperatives in all sectors from the bottom up and liberalise and strengthen the social economy and the third sector.
These are the areas which need to be strengthened immediately if sustainability is to have a future.
Mr President, the European Parliament report on Greece' s adoption of the single currency on 1 January 2001 is remarkable, more by virtue of the political will it expresses to enlarge the euro zone than by its concern for technical exactitude.
It is, however, true that Greece has made considerable efforts in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and has achieved good progress, except in a few areas, such as public debt, but on that subject there are some countries within the euro zone that are doing no better.
These minor failings, which would have had little impact if the euro had been strong, are now liable, against the background of the euro' s depreciation, where the slightest ambiguity serves to detract from the image of the single currency, to have a much more negative effect, for psychological reasons.
Nonetheless, the European institutions did not feel that they should postpone Greece' s accession so as not to give the impression that they had anything to fear and, from that point of view, the position seems perfectly logical, albeit somewhat risky.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group almost agrees with their conclusions, but as a result of a very different logical argument.
Our initial impulse, obviously, would be to refrain from participating in a debate which a good number of us think is nothing to do with us.
But, on the other hand, we think that extending the euro zone may, in the end, provide the stimulus for beneficial reforms.
The fact is, the more the euro zone is extended, the harder it will be for the single currency to represent nations which are very different, and the more it will be recognised that it would be much simpler to make the system more flexible by having the euro develop into simply a common currency, overlapping with the national currencies with a degree of flexibility but not replacing them.
This solution, of progress towards a shared currency, would probably attract the support of the countries within the European Union which, until now, have remained outside the euro zone, creating a shared point of reference for everyone, and putting an end to the current schism, which is disastrous for the credibility of Europe as a whole.
- (EL) Mr President, the Council' s legislative proposal on the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 is a positive proposal which responds to the objectives of the European Union to strengthen social and economic cohesion through Economic and Monetary Union.
The New Democracy team within the European People' s Party has always vigorously supported the policies needed so that Greece, which was outside the first round of Member States, could honour the obligations needed in order to join the euro zone.
The truth is that Greece now meets the convergence criteria, with the exception of the public debt criterion.
However, this also applied in the case of Italy and Belgium and Greece should not suffer adverse discrimination in the present case.
In fact, economic development and convergence policies started in Greece at the beginning of the 1990s, as both the Commissioner and the representative of the European Central Bank stressed during the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and they concern various governments and various political powers.
However, they are due mainly to the efforts of the Greek people as a whole.
Policies in Greece need to focus today on further structural changes, while maintaining an anti-inflationary line, with the aim of achieving a real social market economy in conditions of healthy competition, so that Greece can keep comfortably to the Dublin Stability and Development Pact.
EMU will be a real success once it succeeds in uniting all the Member States, far more Member States such as Sweden, where convergence is proceeding exceptionally well.
I hope that soon the verdict of the Swedish people will take the completion of the euro zone one step further.
For the time being, we call on the European Parliament to vote in favour of Greece' s accession to the euro zone and we assure you that, as far as we, the main opposition are concerned, we shall use our policies to support the efforts being made to apply the rules of the Stability Pact and to honour joint European obligations within the framework of a unified country without borders.
Mr President, Greece meets the convergence criteria according to the European Commission' s verdict, which is based on a very nominalistic interpretation.
Every self-respecting economist knows that Greece, despite the impressive achievements of the past couple of years, does not yet have inflation and government debt sufficiently under control or in order.
The Greek government has major financial interests in an extensive number of government enterprises which are mostly loss making.
In 2001, the derogation for the liberalisation of various sectors will lapse, at which point the large hidden government debt - half the size of the current one - will become public.
Why did the Commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment?
On 17 January last, the Greek drachma was revalued by 2.5%, mainly to push down inflationary trends.
At the moment, the short-term interest rate in Greece is about 600 basic points above the European Central Bank' s level.
Participation from 1 January 2001 means that the short-term interest rate must come down by the end of this year at the latest.
As a result, the credit facility will expand considerably and Greece will be unable to meet the inflation criterion.
Why does the Commission turn a blind eye to this?
In the interests of the Greek citizens and a more flexible development of the Greek economy, we are forced to decline our support for this Commission proposal.
- (EL) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his serious and objective approach to Greece' s candidacy. I wish to thank him because he dealt with us just as strictly as all the Member States which preceded us in forming the single currency.
This is the biggest compliment which he could give a country which, for a while, gave the impression that its economy was on the slippery slope towards general disintegration.
The world has many examples of where such a slippery slope can lead; however, there are relatively few examples of a country which has found the strength not only to stop but to reverse the decline and manage to satisfy the extremely stringent stability criteria of today' s world.
This success is particularly significant because it was built on the basis of an economy which was not rich and not particularly strong.
We do not need you to remind us that the Greek economy is weak.
We know it is.
For a nation to build monetary stability on such a basis requires greater effort and sacrifice than in a richer economy.
The fact that the Greek people agreed to make these sacrifices is proof positive of their determination to break away once and for all, by their own efforts and taking advantage, of course, of the support of the European Union, from the fate of economic backwardness.
And we shall make the same effort in the future, not because you are strict and we have to, but because it is in our interests to do so.
This effort is dictated by our wish to have a better standard of living, to run a modern economy and to prosper with the rest of Europe.
We are here not because we wanted to conceal our weaknesses, but because we wanted to fight and we fought and we won.
As far as we are concerned, we are a small country, but we are fighters and our accession to the single currency is a vote of confidence in this huge European venture; it is a sign of the fact that we support the European endeavour and we hope that other, far richer countries will see this and follow our example.
No one should rejoice prematurely at the present vicissitudes of the single currency.
In joining, we have shown our trust in Europe, in monetary union, in the prospect of economic unification and in the success of our common economic fate.
That is the meaning of Greece' s accession, that is the meaning of its acceptance.
Europe has become stronger today, not weaker, as the result of Greece' s accession.
Mr President, the Commission' s and the ECB' s convergence report deals not only with the Greek, but also with the Swedish, convergence programme.
So too does Mr Goebbels' report, even if the part about Sweden is limited.
The Swedish economy is doing well - very well.
Mr Goebbels also points this out.
In common with Mr Karas and Mrs Randzio-Plath, he also issues a reminder that the EU would be that much stronger if all the Member States were to participate in EMU.
This is a timely reminder of something which is self-evidently the case.
If one is going to join the EU, one should not do so by halves.
Even if the economies of Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden are going well, it must be clearly pointed out, as it was by Commissioner Solbes Mira in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that, if the spirit of the Treaty is to be complied with, no Member State can, in the long term, place itself outside so strategic an area of cooperation as the common currency.
This could have been brought out more clearly in the report.
The euro has provided greater stability.
This has benefited companies, especially small companies.
Price competition has increased, and there has been greater transparency.
The euro is not weak. Instead, it is the dollar which is extremely strong.
Allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further.
Last week, we learned that France' s prime minister wants to see a Euro 11 - soon a Euro 12 - with more influence and power when it comes to economic and financial policy.
At present, the economy is on the way up in Europe, but the clouds are gathering - in the United States and in Europe.
You do not buy an umbrella once it has begun to rain. Instead, you buy an umbrella when the sun is shining so that you are prepared for when the rain comes.
The euro provides Europe with economic stability and competitiveness.
There are very strong economic and moral reasons why Sweden should join EMU.
Sweden should also have an obligation to help increase Europe' s economic competitiveness.
I should therefore have liked to have seen my home country, Sweden, being able to join with Greece today.
- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our reservations about Greece' s accession to EMU are not a matter of principle; they are based on actual facts, as regards both EMU in general and the Greek economy.
As far as EMU in general is concerned, we are in favour of real economic and monetary union.
Unfortunately, this union is only monetary, not economic.
It is MU, not EMU.
We know that EMU was created prematurely for political reasons which date back to the events of 1989 and 1990, which is why the child, the euro, has been delivered early and is languishing in an incubator.
This is the opinion expressed by the Nobel prize-winning economists Friedman, Tobin and Modigliani.
The creation of EMU was not preceded by an agreement on the economic policy which the Member States had to follow.
Only now are the Commission and Council trying to outline common policies for certain economic problems such as unemployment and competitiveness.
But the road is long and full of adventures, as the poet says.
The Goebbels report tells us that Parliament' s reply cannot but be a political one and assures us that Greece' s accession to the euro zone does not involve any political risk.
However, the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of Greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone.
We agree.
There is no danger to the economies of the other 14 Member States.
Of course, I have trouble understanding how anyone can distinguish so easily between political and economic risks, but we shall let that pass.
As far as Greece is concerned, our reservations concern the economic risks mentioned in the report.
The sole aim of the economic policy pursued by Greece over recent years has been to satisfy the convergence criteria.
Efforts have focused on improving indicators, not real economic quantities.
The competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise.
The structural changes needed have not been carried out and privatisation has been presented as the new panacea for development and prosperity.
Wage differentials have been sacrificed to indicators and are increasing, and, as a result, the figures are doing well while the people are suffering, however.
In all honesty, the Goebbels report says that, as regards convergence, all EU governments are required to produce results but are free to choose the means of achieving it.
It is therefore the Greek government' s choice of means which we object to.
The means chosen were neither economically suitable nor socially just.
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer.
In joining EMU, we are jumping in at the deep end and hoping for the best.
Mr President, firstly my congratulations to Mr Goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation.
Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress.
Securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the Union.
The Stability and Growth Pact States provide the 15 Member States of the Union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies.
The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach, in the medium term, a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.
It must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios.
The Commission and Parliament monitor submissions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.
We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union.
The principle of the Stability and Growth Pact is also a logical progression from the criteria laid down in Maastricht for the Member States to comply with economic conditions for participation within the new European single currency.
The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is: Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime?
It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union, and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future.
I welcome Greece into the euro zone.
It is also clear that Sweden and Denmark will accede to the single European currency regime over the next couple of years.
It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible, but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro.
The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future.
We shall adjourn the debate on Mr Goebbels' s report, which will resume at 3 p.m. today, as we are now going to start the voting, which will run from 11.30 a.m. to noon.
It will be adjourned for a formal sitting and will resume immediately after the formal sitting.
I therefore urge the Members not to leave the Chamber at the end of the formal sitting.
Agenda
As regards the report by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, currently scheduled for Thursday 18 May, the rapporteur, Mr Gerhard Schmid, has just noted that the text which is to be submitted to the Council on 29 May is substantially different from the text submitted to Parliament, on which the report in question was based. This means that Parliament must be consulted afresh.
In order to avoid debating the subject twice over, the rapporteur wishes to wait until the Council' s recommendation has been updated in order to draw up a new text.
The Socialist Group has therefore asked that this matter be referred to committee and that the item be removed from the agenda for next Thursday.
(Parliament gave its assent) I must inform you that due to the late submission of the report by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, this report was not available in French, Spanish or Swedish for the meetings of the political groups last night.
I therefore propose that we keep the debate on the report on the agenda as it currently stands, as the first item on Thursday 18 May, but that we defer the vote on the report until the next part-session.
Are there any objections?
Madam President, it would be much more coherent and in keeping with our Rules of Procedure if we voted, as long as we hold the debate, on Thursday evening or Friday morning.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, the problem is that the text is still not available in French, Spanish and Swedish, thus presenting a problem in terms of our Rules of Procedure.
That is why the Bureau proposed this solution.
Madam President, I respect what the Presidency has said, but I have different information: that this morning all the versions are available.
I accept the President' s words, but I must point out that there is some inconsistency here.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I quite understand your objection.
I am informed by our services that the other reason for making this proposal was related to the limited time the groups have to table amendments.
Having said that, following your request, I suggest that we put to the House the sense of the proposal which I have just made.
Perhaps Mrs Buitenweg can give us her opinion, as rapporteur?
Madam President, I would very much regret it if my report were to be taken off the agenda and if the vote were not to take place this week.
We have an agreement with all political groups in this Parliament that we would accelerate proceedings for this directive.
This is necessary to put through this directive swiftly and within the time in which the Portuguese Presidency, which has shown exceptional commitment in this respect, is in office.
The Council will be convening before our next plenary sitting.
This means that if we do not adopt a resolution here, the Council will be unable to adopt its position either, and everything will be shelved long term.
I would like to point out that the group which has the most problems and seizes upon administrative issues as an excuse to postpone dealing with these, is also the group which voted against this report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
I therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here.
This has a bearing on the speed at which anti-discrimination can be translated into legislation in Europe and at which people can therefore be protected from racial or ethnic discrimination, and I do not appreciate the fact that Parliament is arguing in favour of postponing this protection.
Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the importance of this discussion, but I propose entering the debate on the agenda for tomorrow, as the Bureau wished.
I suggest that the Conference of Presidents or, at any event, the groups, should come to some agreement on the procedure to be adopted regarding voting after the debate, and that our final decision on the timing of the vote should be postponed until tomorrow.
May I take it that the various group presidents and Members of Parliament agree in principle, as I am afraid that if I give the floor to every Member who requests it we shall be starting the whole debate up again?
Mr President, as you know, I am the co-rapporteur with Mrs Buitenweg on this important directive on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I hope that you will rule that the vote, as per our agenda agreed on Monday, will go ahead and I have two points to make to our colleagues in the PPE in that respect.
The first is this: since this directive was first proposed, the whole furore across the European Union because of events in Austria and elsewhere, where the extreme right has come forward, has caused us, as a Parliament, with the widest possible across-party support, to work with the Council and the Commission to agree an accelerated timetable to enable this directive to go through to provide the strongest possible response to the racist and extremist threats that undermine our combined values.
That deal with the Council and with the Portuguese Presidency said that we would agree in this Parliament this week prior to the Council of Ministers' meeting in June.
If we fail to meet that commitment, what does that say to the racists?
And my second point: we talk about the dignity of Parliament.
What about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment, victimisation and discrimination?
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make things quite clear.
The debate is indeed going to take place as scheduled on the agenda and, like everyone in the House, I appreciate its importance.
Nonetheless, I suggest that you accept my proposal, which is this: that the debate should take place as scheduled on the agenda and, tomorrow, the sovereign Assembly, after consulting the groups, shall decide whether or not to vote on this report during the present part-session.
I think it would not be right to vote on it immediately.
Madam President, I do not see why the Conference of Presidents should make the decision.
Surely it is up to all of us here at the plenary sitting to decide whether or not the vote should take place during this part-session, not the Conference of Presidents?
We wish to decide right here, either today or tomorrow, whether the vote on this directive and this report should take place this week. We do not wish to leave the decision to the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, I think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough.
I did not suggest that the decision was referred to the Conference of Presidents, which does not have the authority to decide.
I suggested reconciling points of view within the groups and then tomorrow, in the House, discussing the timeliness of voting this week.
It goes without saying that only the plenary assembly has the right to make this decision.
I should now like to put an end to any further speeches on the subject, as I am afraid that discussing the matter ad infinitum is not going to lead to a clear decision.
I shall just give the floor to Mrs Ludford, whose group has not yet had an opportunity to comment.
Madam President, I just wish to emphasise on behalf of the Liberal Group the desirability of debating and voting this report this week.
Despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter, it has been dealt with very fully in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled.
It is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions.
However, I feel that there is a touch of opportunism in the PPE Group' s objections to a vote this week.
After all, if it were technically impossible, the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow.
Therefore, we should debate and vote on it tomorrow; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group.
Ladies and gentlemen, I put it to you that we decide as follows: we shall carry on the debate as scheduled on the agenda and tomorrow, the House will consider whether the vote should be retained as scheduled, after consultation with the various groups.
Vote
Mrs Muscardini, I suppose you wanted to speak on the next item, but, quite frankly, I would urge you not to take the floor.
I cannot deprive you of your freedom of speech, however, but I do appeal to your sense of responsibility.
Madam President, my responsibility is that I have worked in this Parliament for 11 years and I have seen it deteriorate with every passing day.
I will not go back to the previous debate although I had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter.
I am afraid that this is not the first time that the Presidency has ignored this area of the Chamber and so I am going to speak on the House' s agenda.
Would the Presidency please organise the Secretariat and herself in such a way as to accord all Members the same right to speak on the matters over which they wish to take the floor.
It is deplorable to talk of democracy and human rights and then not give Members the right to read the texts in their own language or to speak in the Chamber.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report (A5-0128/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez measure on the regulation on the monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars.
Why am I in favour of this measure?
It goes without saying that I support the monitoring of new passenger cars when they are first placed on the market, but my vote in favour of the motion also contains a call to make greater efforts in the monitoring of second-hand cars, for, in actual fact, I would argue that new cars are never to be found on the road due to the fact that the very act of driving them along a road ages them by definition.
It is, above all, 'old' cars, the cars which have been in use for a number of years, which cause atmospheric pollution.
I call for monitoring of these 'old' cars, to ensure that they are always in a state of good health and to prevent them from harming the earth' s atmosphere.
I therefore support the use and preservation of pensioner cars as well.
- (FR) The GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report deals with reducing CO2 emissions, a necessary goal, particularly with the fight against global warming at stake.
An objective like this would require Europe to provide itself with effective resources in order to limit such emissions, either by binding standards, as is the case for other pollutants, or by incentives, with checks and penalties.
Furthermore, the increase in the number of vehicles plays a major part in the increase in CO2 emissions.
This aspect of the problem must be tackled as well, by implementing a transport development policy involving rail and waterway transport, combined transport, and public service which is capable of offering an effective alternative to the private car.
According to the explanatory statement, the Commission is still at the stage of a 'monitoring scheme' , i.e. collating statistics but without undertaking effective checks, and, apparently, excluding light commercial vehicles (vans) and heavy commercial vehicles (trucks).
It is better than nothing, but not much!
Despite its limitations, we nonetheless voted in favour of the GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report.
Smet report (A5-0129/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the report on the conciliation process concerning the organisation of working time, first and foremost in support of the article on doctors in training.
It is, in effect, appropriate for them to be able to rest in-between operations, particularly during their training period, also in consideration of the fact that, during the rest of their careers, it is above all - not exclusively, but for the most part - the elderly who will fall victim to their scalpels.
The doctors will need to have learnt their trade well, free from considerations of working time.
Above all, however, my vote for the motion is an invitation to consider reducing not just the working time in a worker' s day but the time he spends working over his entire lifetime.
It would, in fact, be appropriate for a person not to have to work for 80 years if he is going to live to be 90 years of age, but to work for a period of 30 years if he is going to live to be 60 or 70.
Madam President, I voted for the amendment of the directive on working times because this directive has been extended to include certain categories which had not been covered.
I refer, in particular, to categories of the transport sector.
Furthermore, I hope that the approval of this directive will prompt a decision, at last, to approve the regulations on flight times and working times for pilots and cabin crew.
This is not solely a social matter of worker protection - although it does include this factor - but it is also a question of flight safety.
. (EL) It is a fact that man' s strength and capabilities are limited.
Working times may be harmful to the physical and the mental health of both individuals and families, which is why working times need to be organised so that the safety and health of workers are not put at risk.
However, 7 million workers in the EU, in transport and fisheries and doctors in training are exempted from Directive 104/93/ÃC on the organisation of working time.
This intolerable situation and the abuse of workers in the above specialist sectors as regards their working times is of a nature and is taking on dimensions which are such that rules must be imposed without delay, given that workers such as doctors in training in Great Britain work up to 72 hours a week.
Extending the directive is essential, but it is not enough.
The provisions proposed will be unable to protect the safety and health of workers effectively, given that there are still numerous exemptions and long transitional periods for implementing the directive.
We must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day (it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure).
- (NL) My Group eventually accepted the compromise reached by the Conciliation Committee to apply the working time directive to the excluded sectors.
It is now crucial that these sectors can, at long last, look forward to a regulation so that they too come under the scope of the directive.
We struggle greatly with the long transitional periods for the junior doctors sector.
After the directive enters into force, the Member States have a total of nine years before they are obliged to have transposed the directive into national legislation.
Under certain conditions, this period can be extended by another two or three years.
Needless to say, we feel for the many Member States which struggle with inadequate staffing levels in their health sector.
However, the Member States have known for a long time that they will need to adapt to the working times directive in the long run.
It looks very much like this serious problem has been shelved, as a result of which, in our opinion, the arguments used to support the long transitional periods do not so much signify powerlessness as unwillingness.
In the light of the above, when this directive and the ensuing national legislation is implemented, close monitoring will be required to ensure that the weekly working hours for junior doctors meet the statutory standards.
- (FR) I can only recommend that this text be adopted, which is the product of a long and difficult conciliation process between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
This favourable vote is of capital importance as it concerns the health and safety of some 7 million workers in Europe.
Workers in the transport sector and offshore workers, sea fishermen and doctors in training will at last be entitled to benefit from European working hours regulations.
As a French member of the Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, at second reading, I supported Parliament' s position which, in particular, provided for a four-year transition period for doctors in training, with a maximum working week of 54 hours, over a four month reference period.
The conciliation process produced an agreement whereby doctors in training will be covered by the directive, as far as its scope of application - a maximum 48-hour working week over a four-month reference period - is concerned, after a period of nine years.
The nine-year period is to be subdivided as follows: a four-year transposition period and a five-year transition period.
In the first three years of the transition period, the number of weekly working hours shall not exceed 58, or 56 during the last two years.
For some States, however, this sort of nine-year period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjustments.
These States may therefore be permitted an additional period of two years.
The Commission will make a statement on the notification of the relevant Member State, after consulting employers and workers at European level, as well as representatives of the Member States.
The notification, the opinion of the Commission and, if this opinion is not acted upon, the Member State' s justification, shall be published in the OJ and sent to the European Parliament.
If there are specific problems, then the two-year period may be extended for a further year, but the Member State must incorporate the procedure in full.
The maximum number of weekly working hours may not then exceed 52.
. (PT) I have voted against this report because, as a doctor by profession, I think that the excessive working hours that it proposes for junior doctors are unacceptable.
- (FR) The text before you, after years of negotiations seeking to define the maximum limits for weekly working hours, is symbolic in more ways than one of the ambiguities and inadequacies of European social policy.
Firstly, as regards the very principle of a European social policy, the Treaty of Maastricht restricts this to minimum social standards, and only on condition that they do not "hold back small- and medium-sized undertakings" .
These restrictions are no longer acceptable today.
That, then, is one urgent question to be raised for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty.
Ambiguities and inadequacies are, however, just as evident in the proposal before us.
Are we sufficiently aware that, in 1994, when the Member States came to an agreement on the maximum 48-hour working week, they excluded several million workers, such as transport workers, offshore oil rig workers or junior doctors in training?
Mrs Smet' s proposal extends the general rule of 48 hours to some of these sectors.
It still does not, however, settle the matter of long-distance road haulage workers and puts forward a frankly ridiculous timescale for implementing the directive with regard to junior doctors!
The position of these doctors in training is similar in many countries: working weeks of 70 and 80 hours in conditions that are occasionally disgraceful and sometimes dangerous to patients.
The recent strike by junior doctors in France showed that such a situation was not acceptable, either for the doctors, the patients or the public health service.
But, even though, last November, the European Parliament proposed almost unanimously that the 48-hour rule should come into force within four years, it is now suggested that we alter our position radically.
We should adopt the joint proposal of the ministers and the parliamentary delegation allowing Member States up to twelve years (!) before they apply the 48-hour week directive to doctors in training.
Please think about what this means exactly. The first doctors in training to benefit from these conditions have just started secondary school!
I do not know of a single other area - the euro, the free movement of persons, goods or capital - where a timescale of this order is tolerated.
In such circumstances, how can we expect the European Union' s social policy to be taken seriously?
Especially as the proposal divides this twelve year period into several distinct periods, each with their own rules for the maximum working week:
until 2004 there will be no change, there will be no restrictions on working hours;
between 2004 and 2007 the maximum working week will be 58 hours;
between 2007 and 2009 it will be 56 hours;
between 2009 and 2012 it will be 52 hours.
In adopting this text we are sending out a worrying message.
This is the first directive on social matters to be adopted since the Lisbon Summit on employment. I would like to express the hope that the Commission, Parliament and the Council will, at last, take European social policy more seriously.
Social Europe will not make progress, nor will it convince our countries' citizens with proposals such as this.
Roth-Berendt report (A5-0117/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the Roth-Behrendt report, although, as before, my vote in favour of the motion is also a call for improvement of European legislation in the field of the implementation of the precautionary principle.
It is, of course, right for us to consider our health as human beings and to slaughter the huge number of animals at risk; it is right for us to adopt this measure and thereby establish rules to bring farmers and stock breeders into line, but we also need to keep our feet firmly on the ground.
What I mean is, right now, I can imagine farmers running along behind their cows - Daisy or Buttercup, maybe - and fussing over feeding them hay, fodder and products from their fields, whereas they may well not have had time to have their animal' s health checked.
So let us combine practical action with a desire for improvement.
- (FR) I should like to express my satisfaction with the content of this report.
Let me remind you that in presenting this proposal for a regulation, the Commission is fulfilling the undertaking it gave in 1997 to the European Parliament' s Temporary Committee of Inquiry to put forward measures for effectively monitoring transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
This proposal seeks to create a standard legal basis for the monitoring and prevention of TSEs, of whatever type, and for all animal-based products.
It incorporates all Community regulations in force in the field of TSEs.
Like the rapporteur, I endorse the general strategy adopted by the European Commission, but I think the text before us needs tightening up in order to guarantee maximum consumer safety.
I have therefore supported the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
These amendments were intended to introduce the possibility of systematically implementing rapid diagnostic tests, and to reintroduce the European Parliament' s request in the context of the follow-up to the recommendations on BSE, i.e. withdrawing the entire herd from the food chain, banning any movement of animals defined as at risk, and advocating the slaughter and destruction of such animals, with the exception of animals intended for scientific research.
The proposal also had to be extended by inviting the Commission to present proposals for the inclusion of some cosmetic products and medicines, and to draw up a procedure for determining the epidemiological status of countries or regions in relation to BSE, i.e. a classification of countries according to contamination levels.
I shall conclude by stressing the fact that the European Parliament must continue to be involved, under the codecision procedure, in fundamental decisions on the prevention of TSEs.
- (FR) The problem under discussion this morning was first identified a long time ago.
It is all very laudable to attempt to prevent the risks of BSE at Community level today, but it was almost 15 years ago that our researchers clearly established that one of the causes of mad cow disease was the consumption of cattle fodder containing animal-based meal made from ingredients taken from the carcasses of sheep suffering from ovine scrapie.
This is why, when we contributed towards setting up the Parliament' s Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE, we pointed out most forcefully that any regulatory instrument should necessarily cover all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Why has it been necessary to wait so long to effect the necessary changes in the regulations?
Why is there this time lag between scientific discoveries and Community proposals?
Fortunately, as far as the protection of the citizens is concerned, reactions at national level and in a number of Member States were rather more rapid and effective, compared with the incredible slowness and the usual paradoxes of Community bureaucracy.
Let me remind you that some countries, in effect, in order to ensure consumer food safety, have had to deliberately contravene Community regulations.
It is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread.
They will be a significant component of BSE monitoring at Community level.
Let us not, however, treat them like a universal panacea.
These tests can only detect the affected prion protein above a certain level.
They are therefore no substitute for, in particular, the withdrawal of specific high-risk materials.
Above all, it would be an outrage if Member States which have set up a screening programme based on tests far stricter than the Community programme were to be penalised, in terms of classification with regard to BSE-related risks, in comparison with States which have confined themselves to the minimum Community programme.
Community regulations should never represent a brake on, or obstacle to, the action of Member States that wish to offer their citizens more stringent protection.
It has been clear since the start of the BSE crisis that the most appropriate and effective level of protection for our citizens is directly linked to the vigilance of the national authorities, with Community procedures, when they finally come to be drawn up, being able, of course, to play a useful complementary role.
Savary report (A5-0113/2000)
Madam President, I should briefly like to pay tribute to the work done by our fellow Member, Mr Savary, who has once again shown himself to be a staunch defender of the railways and of public services. Next I should like to tell the people who voted in favour of this report that I, of course, agreed with saying that it is no longer possible to accept the share of rail transport increasingly losing out to road transport, and that nor is it possible to accept the technical, and even regulatory, obstacles from a bygone age that stand in the way of the much-needed freedom of movement throughout the whole of Europe?
All the same, for future reference, I wish to state today that making this observation and supporting this determination to make progress must not lead to untrammelled liberalisation and privatisation, as this puts our safety at risk, and we can see many examples of this today in some countries of Europe, and it is destructive as far as our public service is concerned.
This is not the purpose of today' s report but, in view of debates we will have in future, I wished to state this publicly.
Madam President, although we are in favour of completely harmonising European rail networks and making them compatible, since this is a necessity, and although we are in favour of developing this type of public transport, both on major international routes as well as on regional and local networks, we abstained from the vote on this report, since nowhere did it mention the need to operate rail networks as a public service, i.e. as a system designed and put into practice in order to respond to the needs of users and not to be a source of profit for private companies.
Madam President, I voted for the measure contained within the Savary report, on the trans-European conventional rail system.
How could I do otherwise?
This is a clearly a matter in which the European Union must intervene on account of the subsidiarity principle.
Long-distance transport can only be regulated at European level.
Nevertheless, there was room for improvement in this measure, but I hope that this will be achieved over the next few years.
We should use this as a springboard to create, at last, a European department of transport links, but, first and foremost, we should make it easier for pensioners and the elderly to travel between the European capitals. Pensioners love to travel and could have the right to a free travel card for journeys between their capital city or their own town and the capital cities of the other 14 European States.
We must give our support to the interoperability of European railways as a means of revitalising and developing the sector at international level, in order better to meet users' needs, and also as an instrument for protecting the environment.
Nevertheless, we do not feel that adequate solutions to the problems arising for those working in the sector as a result of this process have been provided in the texts before us.
We are also aware, and are therefore bound to express our concern about this, that the proposals currently being discussed are part of a package of measures designed to liberalise the sector, and that the experiments that have already been carried out in this area have certainly led to a deterioration in safety and social conditions for workers.
Savary report (A5-0112/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the second Savary report, which differs from the previous report in that it refers to a trans-European high-speed rail system.
My point, this time, is that there is also room for improvement in this high-speed European transport system, in that it should be designed for use by ordinary citizens as well as businessmen who want to travel from Madrid to Copenhagen or somewhere even further away in as short a time as possible: businessmen can always go by plane.
High-speed links must, first and foremost, be designed for tourism, leisure and the enjoyment of all European citizens, especially the elderly, who would be avid travellers if conditions were more luxurious and rail travel a more pleasurable experience.
- I voted against the report on the trans-European high-speed system (A5-0112/2000).
It is most enlightening to compare the two reports presented by our colleague, Mr Savary, even if these documents have different legal bases.
The high-speed sector and the conventional rail system respond to quite different philosophies.
The former report received unanimous support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Only half of the Members of the very same committee voted for the latter.
This fact is, in itself, expressive enough.
On the high-speed rail system report the Environment Committee, astonishingly, did not deliver any opinion, even if the environmental aspects are not mentioned in it at all.
It seems that most people in this House do not really care about the need to rebalance the different modes of transport in favour of the railways, to reach a significant rise in the volume of goods and passengers that nowadays overwhelmingly use the roads.
- (FR) First of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work on the Commission' s report on the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system.
Creating the technical conditions for the interoperability of the European railway networks involves harmonising, between the various networks, the many different systems and components involved in rail transport.
The objective is a threefold one: to gradually create the conditions for the uninterrupted movement of trains on the 15 national networks - the free movement objective; to eliminate current high costs and delays in order to improve the competitiveness and reliability of the railways vis-Ã -vis their competitors - the sustainable mobility objective; and to create the conditions for a single European market in railway rolling stock by harmonising the elements that make up the railways - the economic and technological objective.
The objective of the directive before us today was to publish the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) for six sub-systems - Maintenance, Infrastructure, Energy, Rolling Stock, Operation and Control-Command - beginning the work of standardising components in collaboration with CEN, Cenelec and ETSI, and establishing in each Member State a list of notified bodies instructed to assess the conformity of the components produced by the relevant industries.
This report, drawn up pursuant to Directive 96/48/CE, gives an initial assessment of the progress made.
It must be noted that four years after the directive was adopted, not one single technical specification for interoperability (TSI) has been drawn up even though interoperability is deemed to be fundamental to the mobility of persons and the effectiveness of trans-European rail systems.
The majority of Member States have not, to date, transposed the provisions of this directive into their national legislation.
We are a long way from debating the priority to be given to rail!
It would, however, be unfair to say that no progress has been made.
For one thing, a tripartite body, the EARI (European Association for Railway Interoperability), has been set up and has undertaken the work of identifying and specifying existing technologies, components and procedures, which should culminate in two TSIs in the near future.
Moreover, the latest high-speed network investment projects, designed along the lines of Thalys, have, for the first time, made efforts to achieve convergence and technical coherence.
Even so, these achievements are still inadequate in terms of the issues at stake.
National disparities are a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in Europe, in spite of the many advantages of this means of transport in terms of sustainable development, pollution and safety.
