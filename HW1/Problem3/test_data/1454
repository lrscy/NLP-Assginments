In reality, 10 countries might well join, but not until 2004 so that the economy, over time, should offset the extra burden represented by the additional Member States.
We approve of balancing of this kind, which will enable us to remain below the budget ceiling of 1.27% of the Member States' GDP.
We are also able to accept the progressive adaptation of payments made under the agricultural policy to the new Member States, as anticipated by the BÃ¶ge report, bearing in mind that the idea here is to maintain a consistent policy.
We should also like, however, to see this policy reformed and converted into a 'durable CAP' (see my explanation of vote on the Olsson report).
On the other hand, we condemn the meagre efforts made by the Member States which at present benefit from the structural and cohesion funds and which should better understand the need to move these credits eastwards.
There must be a clear intention to abolish the present cohesion fund which, in any case, was designed to give the Eastern countries easier access to the single currency, a task which has now been completed.
Although I voted in favour of the report I would like to make it very clear that I am opposed to the text of paragraph 16 and that I regret that it was adopted.
The request for OLAF offices to be opened in the candidate countries before the end of June seems to me to be at the very least absurd and bordering on an insult to the candidate countries.
Moreover, it is impossible to comply with.
There are no offices in the current Member States either, nor is it known what powers OLAF may have outside the EU apart from inspecting our own offices.
In short, it is nonsense that the report did not deserve.
.
(NL) In 1989, Western Europe considered itself the victor in a long-term conflict.
This victory was to be crowned with the annexation of the East.
Many people in the East were amenable to this, in the expectation of receiving great financial support and imminent wealth.
Now that 2004 is on the horizon, it becomes apparent how difficult the accession of new Member States is.
Many of these difficulties are money-related.
Our agricultural policy, which promotes the economy of scale and keeps food prices artificially low in order to curb pay claims by the workers, will become unaffordable if the small farmers in Poland are allowed to take part.
The lion's share of our regional funds, which, to a large degree, pump money from the rich Member States via the bureaucracy in Brussels back to the same rich Member States, would, on the basis of the current criteria, be intended for the new Member States, mainly at the expense of areas in Spain, Portugal and Greece which are currently still the poorest countries.
The monies reserved for accession are being distributed over far more candidate countries than was originally planned.
There will soon not be any money left for circulating around the rich Member States for propaganda purposes.
Like the rapporteur, I am quite happy to protect poor Member States from a role as net payers, but simply to exempt newcomers from payments in order to entice them, is taking things too far in my view.
Notwithstanding the self-congratulation of the European Union's governing bodies, a rather sombre picture emerges from the situation of the Central and Eastern European candidate countries.
A goal which no effort is made to disguise is served by the observation, realistic as it unfortunately is, to the effect that there is 'a prosperity gap with a ratio of as much as ten to one? between regions situated at the external borders of the EU and adjacent regions in the candidate countries.
The Commission has already agreed broadly to subsidise these regions and, in particular, the undertakings that operate there, explaining that, following enlargement, the regions at the present external borders of the EU will certainly attract less than prosperous labour from newly admitted countries.
As for the rapporteur, she adds that, in terms of the needs of the wealthy regions and their undertakings - and most certainly not in terms of the needs of the impoverished populations of Central and Eastern Europe - the subsidy 'is no more than a drop in the ocean?.
For that reason, she proposes increasing the subsidies that are to be paid to the wealthy regions and their undertakings, while approving what are termed transitional measures which, even after enlargement, will hinder the free movement within the EU of workers from the newly admitted countries.
Indeed, these new countries are only being integrated into the EU accompanied by restrictions which make second-class citizens of their inhabitants.
We have therefore, quite obviously, voted against this report.
.
(DE) My group supports Mrs Sommer's report, as it takes up the specific problem of the situation which will face 33 million people living in 23 of the European Union's border regions after the accession of the central and eastern European countries.
We are also glad that a range of proposals submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have been incorporated into the report, for example the emphasis on the need to provide more funds to promote SMEs, and the call for an increase in the EU share in co-finance in order to take account of the calamitous gaps in terms of development.
We share the rapporteur's fundamental conviction that the EUR 195 million in funding allocated by the Commission are far from adequate, and we support to the utmost the demand for additional financial resources.
This is all the more the case as the funds currently available are being found by means of reallocations, whilst at the same time the finance ministers of various countries can look forward to billions from the resources of the Structural and Regional Funds not being utilised and therefore being refunded.
We regret the fact that it has not been possible to bring about the acceptance of a legal basis specifically for the promotion of border regions, without which the longer-term funding of measures will be impossible.
By way of contrast, we welcome the orientation towards dealing more effectively with the connection of the regional transport systems to the Trans-European Networks.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) The problem of the border regions is doubtless one that will become apparent with the forthcoming enlargement.
The financial endowment of this initiative is clearly inadequate - and was always bound to be so.
Nevertheless, being aware of these limitations, it demonstrates the due attention that needs to be paid to regions that will suffer from a form of 'geographical displacement' within the future European Union and which could be harmed by competition from the EU's new neighbouring regions.
We therefore hope it will be possible to establish - in some way, including through the best possible use of available resources - a new dynamism in these regions and that this will also have positive effects on those regions now located immediately beyond the EU's current borders.
.
(DE) My group supports the report by Mr Turco, who has done good work.
The Structural and Cohesion Funds are European Union instruments of extreme importance for bringing the EU's less-favoured regions up to the level of development of the prosperous ones.
We take the view that these instruments of European incentive policy enable EU policy to have the greatest direct and visible effects on people's quality of life and must therefore at all costs remain part of future policy after enlargement.
Support given by stronger regions to the weaker ones, in a spirit of solidarity and without reference to national boundaries, is symbolic of European unity.
We therefore oppose any discussion of even the partial renationalisation of regional and structural policy, as this would undermine the principle of solidarity and it is not foreseeable where such a policy might lead.
We are of course aware of the serious problems involved in realising structural and regional policy, and see the Commission and the Member States as sharing responsibility.
The poor implementation rates and constantly increasing backlogs, totalling - incredibly - EUR 112 billion in 2000, give grave cause to consider the possibility of a radical re-examination of the procedures and structures that have been in place to date.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Turco on the report he has presented, which makes a positive contribution to the debate on the importance of cohesion policy and of maintaining and strengthening this policy.
I should like, however, to emphasise two points that I feel are important to this discussion:
the need to maintain our efforts to simplify and speed up implementation processes in the field of structural actions, which are crucial to their sound and efficient implementation, guaranteed by appropriate assessment and monitoring systems;
observance of the principle of additionality, the guarantee for a coherent structural policy, which reflects the added value of Community structural policy in national regional policies.
- (FR) The Olsson report and the Commission propose gradually extending the present common agricultural policy to the new Member States in the course of the ten years following their accession, with consideration being given at the same time to a new CAP, applicable to everyone but, for financial and technical reasons, unable to be put into effect before 2006.
It would appear difficult to do anything else for the time being. Current EU rules cannot be applied to everyone immediately, for that would be too much of a burden financially.
Nor is a two-speed CAP acceptable on a long-term basis, for that would be unacceptable politically. At the same time, however, a situation should preferably be avoided in which inevitable transitional measures are the pretext for ending up with a huge and labyrinthine administrative and financial system spread right across the continent.
Let us therefore state right now the future principles of a new CAP: a concern for quality, respect for the countryside, support for multifunctionality and the maintenance of a proper social balance in rural environments; in short, the defence of the European agricultural model, undertaken through border protection and therefore funded by the consumer rather than through an endlessly expanding Community budget funded by the taxpayer.
The proposals to integrate the new Member States are illustrative of colonial-type efforts to annex the CEECs.
There will be no single CAP in practice and the policy applied to the new Member States will be even worse than the policy applied to the current Member States.
Enlargement is being used as a springboard by the strong countries in the north to abolish direct income support by reclassifying it as "acquis communautaire". This will wipe out vital agricultural sectors in both the CEECs and the ?U.
The aim is to secure markets for big business and develop neo-capitalist farming models which marginalise the agricultural sector and alter its social and environmental role (paragraph 24 of the report speaks for itself here).
The ?U will throw a few crumbs at the CEECs, while at the same time turning them into markets for its own products - and not the other way round, as their propaganda would have us believe - with the result that the agricultural economy will shrink, small and medium-sized farms will be wiped out and employment and the social and economic fabric will be irreparably damaged.
The Communist Party of Greece is against the accession of any country to the ?U because accession has nothing to offer small and medium-sized farmers or the working classes.
However, as and when these countries join the European Union, they must have the same rights and receive the same subsidies from the first year of their accession and quotas must be determined on the basis of the real capacities and food requirements of their people.
Mr Olsson has already mentioned in his report the political and economic importance of agriculture in all CEECs and the structural changes that are required in their rural areas.
It is also crucial to bring agriculture and the foodstuffs industries into line with the European Union standards, especially hygiene and veterinary standards.
But we must also accept that many candidate countries practice far less intensive methods of agriculture and give a more prominent place to rural development.
To give a positive signal for enlargement, we should give the candidate countries equal voice in the discussions on the future of agricultural policy.
We should also concentrate on the issue of direct payments and the proposal for the phasing in of direct payments. This must not be a stumbling block for enlargement.
Whilst agreeing that the gradual introduction of direct payments would prevent a sudden excessive influx of cash, with over-production as an end result, it would also mean the unequal treatment of the new Member States during the ten-year transitional period, which would be very discouraging for them.
The EU should make clear that there must in the longer term be a single common agricultural policy for all Member States, with all players starting on an equal footing.
My main reason for supporting this report has to do with the necessarily provisional character of the European automobile industry's voluntary commitment to improving pedestrians' and cyclists' chances of survival in the event of collisions, weighed against the stricter and more solid Community legislation that is on the way and that will replace the voluntary commitment.
Although this voluntary agreement being considered between the various automobile manufacturers could be implemented fairly quickly and give rise to practical measures, I nonetheless think that, in the long term, a solid legal basis is the only satisfactory way of protecting pedestrians and cyclists.
A framework directive with a precise and realistic timetable seems to me to be the appropriate way of bringing about a genuinely dependable policy on roads.
The voluntary agreement does not, for its part, seem capable of offering the guarantees required of a trustworthy road safety policy.
In addition to the fact that such an agreement is of no effect if one of the partners decides to withdraw from it and that it suffers from a lack of openness and transparency, it also has the major shortcoming of not being really binding.
These are all reasons in favour of a framework directive aimed at introducing a genuine policy to protect pedestrians and cyclists, and all reasons which lead me to support the report in question, inviting the Commission to propose this directive.
.
(NL) Due to the large number of road victims, road safety has finally become a political issue.
Public opinion is right to be indignant about the many vulnerable road users who are the victim of road traffic that kills.
The Petersen report helps to do something about this.
Cars should be safer not only for car drivers; they should also be safer for the vulnerable road users.
I emphatically endorse the wish in the Petersen report that the European Parliament be involved in legislation in this area.
Road safety cannot simply be the concern of the executive and car manufacturers.
As long as increased car speeds are used as a sales argument, I shall remain suspicious of the industry.
After all, it is impossible to cut down significantly the number of victims of road accidents if the speed on the roads is not reduced, if car drivers do not adapt their driving behaviour and if the infrastructure is not conducive to caution and safety.
Road accidents are not natural disasters.
We must prevent them.
. (PT) This report should call for testing to be imposed, in order to end the tragedy of the around 2 000 deaths and the more than 18 000 serious injuries that occur in road traffic accidents across the EU every year.
After more than twenty years of debates, the Commission considers itself to be satisfied with a voluntary agreement with the European motor vehicle industry - and is reluctant to submit a legislative proposal - which we feel is unacceptable.
The consequences of this inaction are proving to be serious.
The phase A reduction from four tests to two, unlike the proposal by the European Enhanced Safety Vehicle Committee, will mean a 75% decrease in lives saved, added to the fact that in only 10 years, the objectives proposed by this body will be achieved.
Only a framework directive can guarantee the effective protection of pedestrians in the EU and this is why we are abstaining on the report that has now been approved and which insists on this voluntary agreement.
. (PT) Our vote reflects the fact that we consider the compromise reached in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to be acceptable.
In this extremely sensitive area, which is so often overlooked and whose importance is so often underestimated - basically, a structured form of pedestrian protection - we endorse the drawing up of a framework-directive clearly establishing a timetable and procedures for an agreement negotiated with the automobile industry, specifically with regard to the monitoring assessments that are laid down.
This approach goes some way towards safeguarding the Commission's line, which has the merit of speeding up a process which might otherwise drag on indefinitely and only achieve its objective after an extremely lengthy consultation process.
A study will then, of course, have to be carried out on the framework-directive, in which the Commission must, as specified, formalise the general conditions of the agreement negotiated with the automobile industry.
Only then, strictly speaking, can a careful, informed assessment of its content be carried out.
I welcome this report, which calls for a voluntary agreement on road safety and pedestrian protection, with a view to more binding legislation in the future.
The report has made significant headway in terms of reaching agreement between industry and citizens on important issues such as bullbars and pedestrian-friendly car fronts.
Hopefully these agreements will soon be matched by marked decreases in harm to pedestrians.
These measures will fortunately be implemented very soon.
However, we must guard against complacency to ensure that, in the long term, more binding and transparent legislation is forthcoming.
Voluntary agreements are useful tools to ensure that changes are made relatively quickly, but they are not a long-term solution to something as important as the protection of Europe's citizens.
We have voted against this text, which is yet another plea for the European institutions to be placed still further at the service of private capital, for the latter no longer to face any obstacles at all in Europe and for open markets to become a reality in those sectors which have not been fully privatised, namely telecommunications, energy, postal services and transport.
The report is not interested in the users of services, who are in danger of seeing the complete deterioration of public services if these forms of privatisation end up being imposed.
What the report is interested in is the 'dynamic climate of investment and entrepreneurship' which it intends to favour through a reduction in the 'tax burden? and through 'access to funding?, in particular for what are termed small and medium-sized enterprises.
It argues, in fact, for the European Union to give more attention, and more aid, to such enterprises, and although its 'explanatory statement' is eloquent about the situation of 'small enterprises? in Europe, it conceals the fact that the vast majority of these enterprises belong to large groups whose subsidiaries they are.
In practice, this means that these forms of aid on the part of the European Union will mainly add muscle to the largest companies.
Those elected by universal suffrage are therefore being asked to vote in such a way as to provide their democratic support for the private interests of the small minority of people who possess capital.
The Commission communication, 'Sustaining the commitments, increasing the pace? has made it possible to draw up a complete inventory of the 'specific provisions of the Lisbon strategy in the field of entrepreneurship? and to underline the ways in which these still fall short when it comes to small enterprises and businesses.
Progress in a large number of areas must still be made in order to support and develop apprenticeship, which is dogged by a poor image in many European countries.
It is time to promote apprenticeship as a modern and dynamic form of training.
I am therefore delighted that, by adopting Mrs Vlasto's report, the European Parliament is offering, via the measures I have proposed by way of various amendments, to put in place a genuine policy in favour of apprenticeship, consisting of the following: an Erasmus-style exchange programme with a view to encouraging mobility among apprentices; a European statute for apprentices and training exchange grants to enable apprentices to link up with entrepreneurs; a policy to support small enterprises and craftsmen in connection with the European training pathways to which I have attached a lot of importance; and, finally, training networks, set up for the purposes of these pathways, to act as lifelong vocational training outlets.
We have abstained from voting in the final vote on Mr Belder's report on the accessibility of public web sites.
The report indicates a number of problems experienced by disabled and older people, a matter which is important and to which attention should be given.
Creating conditions enabling disabled people to participate fully in society is also very high on our liberal agenda.
We believe, however, that it must be the task of the Member States to take responsibility for measures designed to adapt public web sites.
In general, there should also be very considerable restrictions on regulating Internet services, for the World Wide Web depends for its dynamic development precisely upon its having operated without regulation or subsidies.
We believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to the people they affect.
That is why we actively promote the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the division of responsibilities is clear to everyone.
It must be perfectly clear to everyone that the EU should only concern itself with those issues it is best placed to deal with, namely the cross-border issues.
All other issues should be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.
I have voted against Amendment No 9, even though I have considerable sympathy with the principle raised; but Internet access does have a cost, and if the "at no cost to the user" principle is to be taken forward, the question of who bears the cost must be clarified.
This amendment introduces a very broad issue of major importance into a report on a very specific dimension of Internet access.
. (PT) We welcome this Commission communication and the superb report by Mr Belder, which are both committed to formalising and developing a fundamental approach, launched at the Feira Summit and again affirmed at the Nice Summit, to the fight against all forms of exclusion, specifically those related to disability and old age.
New opportunities provided by the new technologies must not be wasted, nor should they have, paradoxically, a negative effect as a result of a perverse form of info-exclusion arising from our insensitivity.
In our view, the EU and the Member States' adoption in 2001 of the guidelines for web sites was extremely important. We also believe it is crucial to keep up the work and the efforts we are making in this field, on the exchange of information, on revising the relevant legislation, on encouraging best practices and on creating and coordinating centres of excellence in this field.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.41 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0334/2002, by Mr SÃ¶rensen and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on child labour in the football industry;
B5-0337/2002, by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on child labour in the production of footballs;
B5-0347/2002, by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on child labour in the sports industry;
B5-0351/2002, by Mr Hughes and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on child labour in the football industry;
B5-0360/2002, by Mrs Martens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on child labour in sports goods industries;
B5-0370/2002, by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on child labour in the manufacture of sports material.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to emphasise that I am in complete agreement with this compromise text on child labour in the football industry.
I also hope that the European Union can give its stamp of approval, for it is up to Europe to put an end to this phenomenon.
I do not want to discuss child labour in general, as we are all against this.
Despite all previous agreements, conventions and codes of conduct, during this Football World Cup too, use was once again made of products which had been manufactured - under licence - by children, in an unacceptable manner.
I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the World Cup that, in 2006, will take place in Germany.
I cannot imagine that the Commission and the Council would accept that children would once again be used for manufacturing products for this World Cup which will take place on European soil.
I therefore expect from FIFA - the customer of industry - and from the European Commission not only a commitment in terms of effort but also a commitment in terms of result in the run-up to the World Cup in 2006.
In this way, we can be certain that, in future, children only touch a football to play and to have fun with.
This is also why we need to call for alternatives for these children who now have to work, not least in the interest of the developing countries.
They too must fight these practices.
They need to ensure that these children can learn and work - work at school, that is - and that they receive education.
Why?
Because these children are the economic future of the developing countries.
This is why I think, and hope, that this resolution will find widespread support, certainly with a view to the future.
Mr President, the World Cup is a truly international sporting event which arouses the interest of millions of people throughout the world.
However, in the shadow of this event, thousands of children use their valuable time every day making the balls used in football matches.
These children are deprived of any chance to acquire a better education at school or play with other children their own age.
Child labour and the inhumane working conditions which adults making footballs also work under are, unfortunately, still standard practice, despite the agreements concluded by the International Football Federation with companies which make sporting goods.
According to the report by the India Committee of the Netherlands tellingly entitled "The Dark Side of Football", Pakistan is the biggest producer of footballs in the world, followed by India.
In just one area of India, the Punjab, about 10 000 children aged between 6 and 12 sit stitching footballs, while about 15 000 children work in the area of Sialkot in Pakistan.
These balls, which are hand stitched by children for a few cents, are the same designer and FIFA endorsed footballs which are sold in sports shops in the west for tens of dollars.
Despite the efforts of both international organisations and the sports companies themselves to introduce programmes and control systems to combat this awful practice, production has shifted to small villages where either there is no policing or the children work at home rather than in factories.
Similarly, according to the London Times, numerous children have been found making footballs for famous multinational companies.
We call on international organisations, sports companies and governments to use the World Cup, which has been dedicated to children, as an opportunity to work together and adopt a reliable system for checking if labour regulations are being complied with.
Because child labour is neither a hobby nor a game, I hope both FIFA and the industry will take the lead and make football a truly fair game for everyone.
We need to send out a message today that adults should be given work and children should be sent to school.
Adults at work, children in school.
Mr President, it is not because my country has not qualified for the World Cup, but along with my fellow MEPs from other groups and from our group, I think we should seize the euphoria surrounding the World Cup in Korea and Japan to consider the perpetual losers: the children aged six, ten or twelve, who stitch together footballs in India, Pakistan and other countries.
Three reports were presented at the press conference of Global March Against Child Labour in New Delhi last month.
They furnish the proof that child labour is still the order of the day in the production of sports equipment.
For example, according to a report from the Dutch National India Working Group, the number of children working in the Indian production of sports equipment full-time has hardly fallen over the past four years. This despite an inspection scheme introduced by FIFA.
Other reports of a similar kind denounce the situation in Pakistan and China.
Admittedly, FIFA demonstrated its good will in 1996 by concluding an agreement with the international trade union on the code of conduct to banish child labour and poor working conditions.
However, this code has not been implemented to date, and the reports I mentioned earlier show that we are still a long way off the set goal.
Hence the express appeal to FIFA to speed up the implementation of this code.
We all know that child labour is a complex matter.
Our campaign should not only be confined to calling FIFA and the manufacturers to task over this in an overbearing manner.
The production of sports equipment is certainly not the only, and not even the most important, sector in which children work.
In order to tackle the problem at the roots, cooperation is required between industry, civil society, as well as the governments and international organisations involved.
After all, we need to look for alternatives where labour, education, income and education are concerned.
The countries involved must be reminded of their duty to monitor existing rules effectively.
I should like to underline that this resolution should not be considered as a targeted attack on one specific form of child abuse, or aimed at one specific sector in industry and one product.
However, the World Cup is an illustration of the extreme contrasts in our world. Between the fit and healthy children who copy the World Cup on the streets in the richer world and the children on the Indian Subcontinent who stitch together leather footballs in sweatshops all day long.
In this way, the World Cup 2002 forms a starting point to remind everyone - manufacturers, governments, international organisation and the public - of their own responsibilities.
This is why I warmly support this urgent procedure.
Mr President, the title of this resolution on child labour, which we also support, is contradictory, because at that age children should be at school, not working.
The truth is that there are agreements, there are declarations, there is the FIFA Code, there are mechanisms banning child labour.
But child labour among children as young as 10 years old, as my colleagues have said, is increasing every year.
Child labour has other serious connotations: for example, it decreases salaries in the regions in which thousands of children work, takes work away from adults, causes poverty in families and, above all, deprives children of the right to education, which they should have from birth.
Recent data indicates that there are thousands of children in India and Pakistan, aged 10 or under, who are working to produce balls, and we believe that in the European Union's talks in the World Trade Organization and in bilateral talks with each of the countries mentioned, one of our fundamental requirements should be that child labour should end.
But, as one of my colleagues has already said, it is not enough just to demand that child labour be ended, but alternatives have to be offered to the families in order for them to survive.
And of course monitoring and surveillance systems have to be put in place in order to ensure that it no longer happens, and it would be good if, as the World Cup is now being played, giving rise to so much passion, including in this House, we could say at the next World Cup in 2006 that child labour no longer existed, if not across the world, at least in part of it.
Mr President, yesterday, on the initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) the first World Day against Child Labour was proclaimed.
Two hundred and fifty million children are regarded by their parents as an investment in their whole family's survival.
They are exposed to the heaviest physical burdens from an early age, thus being robbed of a carefree childhood.
Not only are they put to work as cheap labour in plantations, quarries and mines, but they are also exploited by the manufacturers of sports goods.
Now of all times, when the World Cup is on in Japan and South Korea, it should not be forgotten that many footballs are made by children.
As long ago as 1998, FIFA undertook to outlaw the use of child labour in the production of officially licensed products, but the world's richest and most important football association has now had to admit that it cannot guarantee this.
The PPE-DE group, like all the other groups, condemns every form of child labour.
FIFA and the sports goods manufacturers must at last introduce a code of conduct and then monitor the way it is implemented, if this deplorable state of affairs is to be brought to an end.
Industry and organisations should work together with governments, as Mrs Martens and others of our fellow-Members have just emphasised.
The European Union and the ILO must check that these working guidelines are consistently adhered to.
One step in the right direction is the 'Red Card for Child Labour' campaign started during the African championships in January this year.
We call on FIFA, national teams and the sports goods manufacturers to do everything possible to make the 2004 European Championships in Portugal the first international football tournament free of child labour.
Over and above that, I agree with the ladies who spoke before me that the fight against the causes of child labour - poverty, poor education and inadequate training - has to be stepped up.
Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns expressed about the use of child labour in the football industry.
It condemns all forms of child exploitation, as well as the worst forms of child labour.
It supports the calls on FIFA and the sporting goods companies to make sure that no children are employed in the production of FIFA licensed sportswear and footballs.
The Commission has not had any contact so far with FIFA on this issue.
It is ready to support NGOs which work with local partners for the elimination of child labour.
It has already financed several initiatives to combat child labour, especially in Africa.
The Commission considers that assistance for and protection of vulnerable children should be seen in the wider context of poverty eradication and therefore in the framework of the Community framework development cooperation.
Children are an important focal group in the Community's external aid, particularly in sectoral policies such as education and health.
The Community is committed to applying the ILO core labour standards and has agreed to implement those standards in the framework of bilateral and multilateral agreements with developing countries.
A good example is Article 50 of the Cotonou Convention.
In that article the Community and the ACP countries have reaffirmed their commitment to ILO core labour standards, including the fight against the worst forms of child labour.
The Community is increasing its support to universal and compulsory primary education in all developing countries as part of its commitments to the "education for all" framework and the millennium development goals for education and gender equality.
It sees this as one of the most efficient means currently at its disposal for rescuing children from the vicious circle of exploitation.
Assistance for, and protection of, children is channelled through a number of Commission programmes, including the European initiative for human rights and democracy.
The promotion of children's rights was one of the priorities for funding in 2001 and will be mainstreamed in funding for the period 2002 to 2004.
Furthermore, the Commission has also made children a cross-cutting priority for humanitarian assistance.
In its communication on the promotion of core labour standards and social governance, the Commission presented a comprehensive strategy proposing actions at European and international level.
This should, in the medium term, ensure better implementation of the ILO core labour standards through institutional support and capacity building and trading in developing countries.
As regards trade, in December 2001 the Council adopted a revised GSP scheme by which additional trade preferences are granted to countries that respect core labour standards.
This includes an improved social incentive scheme and extends the base for withdrawal of GSPs to cover serious infringements of all ILO core conventions.
Finally, the Commission played an active role in the UN General Assembly special session on children.
In this context, the EU considers a rights-based approach as fundamental to the promotion of the interest of children, given that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most ratified international treaty in the world and provides an already agreed normative framework.
The plan of action agreed at this special session contains strong elements aimed at combating child labour.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0335/2002, by Mrs Maes and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the tragedy in Kisangani and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0343/2002, by Mrs Sanders - ten Holte and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the massacre in Kisangani;
B5-0349/2002, by Mr Andrews, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in DRC (massacre in Kisangani);
B5-0352/2002, by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the tragedy in Kisangani and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0359/2002, by Mr Van Hecke and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the recent massacre in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo;
B5-0371/2002, by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the tragedy in Kisangani and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the war in Congo has been raging since 1998 and has claimed 3.5 million victims in the process.
Two-thirds of the territory is still being occupied.
Recently, international opinion was once again startled by the report of a massacre of 200 people in Kisangani.
This massacre occurred two years after 1 200 people were killed in the same town as a result of the fight between two rivalling military factions.
The civilian population is naturally the victim, but those responsible have never been punished.
Amnesty International is therefore linking the events of then to now.
The war in Congo still receives far too little attention from international opinion.
During the Belgian Presidency, the European Union made greater efforts than before to get the dialogue off the ground.
But I am left with questions.
Why is MONUC not being given any reinforcement?
MONUC is even being humiliated, officials are being expelled by DRC-Goma.
Why has Kisangani, despite resolutions by the Security Council, still not been demilitarised?
What are we actually doing in order to help this peace process succeed, since the major parties are still not at the negotiating table?
What are we actually doing in order to open up the Congo River?
The population inland is denied any food or medicine.
Nobody can reach these people because the Congo River is probably the only route to access them.
In these circumstances, preparing for Congo's reconstruction is wishful thinking.
Such reconstruction will not take place.
Quite the reverse, in fact: demilitarisation is not being maintained.
Only Namibia has done something.
I can understand that Rwanda wants to be safe, but why does international opinion not protect Rwanda and demand for everyone to leave the country, because they are, after all, only there to plunder the crops from the land.
They do not fight each other, but they rob the civilian population of the little it has left.
Mr President, the Inter-Congolese dialogue has not finished.
Its false closure in Sun City (South Africa) with a partial agreement means that clashes and, in the extreme, massacres such as that in Kisangani, are continuing.
The human tragedy is currently in Kisangani, Kivu and Bunia, but the fundamental political problem has lain for 40 years in the illegitimacy of the governments and institutions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as Mrs Maes said.
Only an honest democratic transition process, involving all of the opposition parties, will lead to peace and national sovereignty.
The Socialist Group condemns the Kisangani massacre and the presence of various foreign troops in the DRC, and supports the efforts for peace by Masire, Ajello and Monuc in order, respectively, to re-open integrated dialogue and to demilitarise the areas of the Congo occupied by armed groups and regular troops from the neighbouring countries.
With this in mind, we propose the following oral amendments to the compromise text:
1. Adding the following paragraph to recital H, which is in line with the declaration of the Council of the European Union on Sun City.
"Whereas the European Parliament nonetheless regrets that some participants have not agreed to join this agreement and invites all the Congolese parties to take responsibility and to respect the framework established in the Lusaka agreements and the United Nations resolutions".
This addition covers everything that the European Union said about Sun City.
Only quoting the first part would give a biased idea of the European Union's positions, which we do, of course, support.
2. Adding the following paragraph to paragraph 5 of the resolution, after 'civil society?: 'Regrets that the opposition parties (UDPS, FONUS, PALU and MNC/L), and other parties and platforms representing civil society, have not signed the agreement of 19 April?.
Paragraph 5 would therefore read as follows: 'Welcomes the political agreement on the consensus for transition in the DRC signed on 19 April 2002 by the Government of the DRC, the MLC of Jean Pierre Bemba, the RDC-ML, the RDC-N and other delegates of the unarmed opposition and civil society; regrets that the opposition parties (UDPS, FONUS, PALU and MNCL), and other parties and platforms representing civil society have not signed the Agreement of 19 April and supports the efforts of the special representative of the European Union to move forward the Alliance for the Protection of the Inter-Congolese dialogue, which includes the RCD-Goma and five unarmed opposition parties to this agreement?.
The Socialist Group will vote against recital E, because we do not believe that, in the current political conditions in the DRC, it can be said that the population of Kisangani, or of any other province, has democratically expressed itself.
The date of the Sun City Agreement also needs to be corrected in the text, as it took place on 19 April and not on 19 May, as incorrectly featured in the resolution.
In a conflict as complex as that in the Congo, in which there are so many spurious interests in play, the role of the European Parliament should be one of conciliation and integration, of ensuring, as far as possible, that real democracy is established rather than mock democracy.
Mr President, anyone who has ever seen from the air the huge landscape around the Congo and its neighbouring great lakes knows that this is one of the world's most fascinating regions.
It is actually a sort of continent within a continent, and so this cannot, alas, be considered as a normal internal problem; the extent of this war is comparable to something like the Thirty Years' War in Europe.
Just as, in Europe's Thirty Years' War, religious motivations were exploited by tough political and economic interests, the ethnicity of people in the Congo region and in the Democratic Republic of Congo is being misused as a tool in the interests and for the sake of corporations, raw materials and the major powers.
As in the age of the Thirty Years' War, the troops of neighbouring states have become caught up in this civil war, never returning to their countries of origin and themselves joining the marauding bands in this gigantic country.
That is why this is, lamentably, a problem whose solution will take a great deal of time.
We have to start, in the first place, by constructing a State structure for this gigantic land that the decolonisation process carved out.
This can only be done step by step in a gradual process that must build on what was agreed in Sun City, but we must be clear in our own minds that it cannot be done overnight, that many, many small steps will be needed and that we will only be able to talk in terms of democracy when we have ensured that the State is able to perform its most basic functions.
That will involve, above all, a minimum of administration and communications and the reinstatement of shipping on the Congo, which is this great country's lifeline, and without which it cannot be reconstructed.
Mr President, the Commission shares the concern about violence and repression in Kisangani and strongly condemns the terrible events of 14 May.
We recall, as did the declaration made on behalf of the European Union, the obligations stemming from the UN resolutions for demilitarisation of Kisangani, as well as the commitments made by the parties under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.
The Commission would like to reiterate that the Lusaka Agreement is at present the only commitment to a negotiated solution and the international community has stressed on many occasions the absolute need to respect it.
The Union has welcomed the power-sharing agreement reached by the Government and the MLC.
However, the Commission stresses the need for all the parties to subscribe to a consensus-driven and inclusive agreement for the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Commission believes that a political settlement of the crisis should be pursued by all parties and by the international community.
We fully support the recent initiative of the UN Secretary-General to further support the inter-Congolese dialogue by nominating a Special Envoy.
The Commission is in favour of an international investigation into the alleged massacre in Kisangani, but we believe that MONUC and other UN agencies present in the field can provide sufficient elements and evidence.
At this critical moment, the Commission considers that priority should be given to the international attempts to continue the peace talks and negotiations among the parties, including the foreign countries involved in the conflict.
We call on all parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to respect the end to hostilities and to refrain from any act which might hinder the search for an inclusive solution to the conflict.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.

Equatorial Guinea
Equatorial Guinea is at present the scene of unacceptable violations of basic human rights.
Dozens of opponents of the regime of President Teodoro Obiang have been arbitrarily arrested and brought before the courts accused of conspiracy, incitement to rebellion and attempted murder of the president.
In reality, the only purpose of the trial, which began on 23 May, is to put the opposition leaders out of the running.
Along with their families, the latter are being held in inhuman conditions and are the victims of brutal torture.
Freedom of expression and of the press is systematically flouted, and independent journalists are subject to insidious daily pressure.
A repressive and brutal policy is being conducted against everyone with an ideology opposed to that of the regime.
The 68 opposition leaders have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in the course of an unfair trial, which has made a mockery of people's most basic rights to a defence. A number have even been in danger of receiving the death penalty.
It is vital that Equatorial Guinea respect its commitments to the international community and the European Union and engage in a genuine process of democratisation including the holding of free elections and complete respect for human rights.
A dialogue must be instituted between the opposition forces with a view to guaranteeing political rights, democracy and pluralism.
With this in mind, the trial must be annulled and the political prisoners freed immediately.
As for the press, it must be free to cover the events and to do so in safety.
In order for that to happen, it is essential that the problem of Equatorial Guinea be raised as a matter of urgency within the Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly and that the Council and the Commission be very firm indeed in their relations with the government of this country.
In order to guarantee the rapid re-establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights, a consultation procedure between the government of Guinea and the European Union needs to be put in place as quickly as possible, and this in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
As Europeans, we cannot now remain indifferent to what is happening in Equatorial Guinea and to the human rights violations there.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the European Union's foreign policy there are times and circumstances in which something has to be said out loud.
What is happening in Equatorial Guinea, which since its independence has had two extraordinary presidents and is now experiencing a highly unusual political situation, if we look at the latest United Nations report and the international press, sets a contradictory scene: while the international community is supporting Equatorial Guinea both technically and financially, perhaps because it is interested in its oil wealth, the authorities in the country are not respecting the most basic human rights.
This resolution is therefore appropriate in condemning those violations of human rights in this African republic, which for many years was associated with my region, the Canary Islands, the bridge between Africa and Europe.
This explains my political interest in supporting and defending the resolution.
The Liberal Group wishes to express our agreement with the Council's position in expressing a grave concern for the political deterioration, procedural anomalies and lack of respect for human rights on the part of the Guinean authorities.
The European Union should therefore review its political relations with this African republic and call on President Obiang to establish the rule of law that has been lost and to begin to open up democracy for the good of his country.
Mr President, the trial conducted against 140 citizens in Equatorial Guinea is a sham that the European Union cannot keep quiet about.
The totalitarian regime in Malabo has tried to get rid of those who could represent a democratic alternative.
It is true that a few years ago the process would have meant that the opponents would have been physically eliminated and it is also true that the fact that the country has joined the ACP Community as a signatory of the Cotonou Agreement has led the regime to act with more respect for the standards of the rule of law, holding a trial and allowing international observers to attend it.
This revealed a grotesque set-up in terms of its lack of legal legitimacy.
There was talk of a plot to overthrow the regime and even to assassinate the Head of State, without putting forward the slightest bit of evidence, with brutally tortured witnesses and defendants, a public prosecution service that raised its initial petition of eight death sentences to eighteen, and a final verdict which, although not so extreme, punished the main people accused with long prison sentences, thus removing them as potential adversaries in any electoral battle.
We were struck by the contrast between the incompetence of the officials of the dictatorship, judges, public prosecution, police, etc. and the admirable dignity of the defendants and defence lawyers.
It is extraordinary that, despite the ill treatment inflicted on them, there was not a single witness or defendant who confirmed in the trial the statements that had been extracted from them in police stations.
I would first like to express our repulsion at such a corrupt and anachronistic regime and our solidarity and confidence in the democratic future of Equatorial Guinea.
In that country there are people of unquestionable bravery and convictions who undoubtedly represent a better future for their people.
This future is what the European Union needs to support, without, of course, falling into judgements that betray our own values.
For now, there are clauses in the Cotonou Agreement that we should activate in order to make it known in Malabo that practices such as the trial I mentioned are simply incompatible with its association with the European Union.
Mr President, it is important that the European Parliament makes its views known on the deteriorating human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea.
Since March this year, opponents of President Obiang's regime have been arbitrarily detained and tried under deplorable and unacceptable conditions.
Detainees have been subjected to brutal and inhumane torture and often prevented from contacting their families and lawyers.
In some cases, detainees' family members have been arrested merely because of their connection to the accused.
Independent journalists reporting on political trials have come under extreme pressure, while several human rights organisations report that deaths have occurred from injuries sustained from torture while in detention.
The nature and timing of the arrests lead me to detect a cynical attempt by the authorities to spread fear in advance of the elections due to be held next year.
I believe the Red Cross should be given immediate access to detainees, international monitors should be introduced and arbitrary detention must be brought to an end.
Equatorial Guinea is in clear breach of every human rights convention it has signed.
It is undermining its own commitment to the Union on democratisation and the full implementation of human rights.
This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured.
To speak of justice in that country is to speak the language of torture and of systematic brutality.
This betrayal of core human values serves to remind us of the often-tragic gap between words and action and human rights in many parts of the world.
This House must meet the challenge of bridging that gap with vigour and authority.
We demand that the EU as a whole makes its concerns known to the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and call for an end to the current abuse of human rights.
Mr President, unfortunately, this is not the first time that we have discussed Equatorial Guinea in Parliament, to condemn the dictatorship that in practice the country is under, and also to regret the ineffectiveness of all the actions that we take.
The recent trial, which was a sham, and which was also, according to all of the observers and as confirmed by Amnesty International, riddled with evidence of torture, is an insult to the values that we defend in this Parliament.
We therefore have to express our solidarity with all those detained, with all the democratic parties that are doing an incredible job under those conditions in order to move forward in solving these problems through democratic values, and I say incredible because desperation is also appearing among the youth of Equatorial Guinea, and the seeds are appearing of what could be a violent response to so much brutality and dictatorship.
I therefore believe that we have to make an extraordinary effort to promote the path of democracy in Equatorial Guinea and not only condemn the dictatorship, but also those Western countries who, either by action or by omission, are in practice supporting the continuance of the dictator.
I therefore think that the work of people such as Onbam Ndong and PlÃ¡cido MikÃ³ should be highlighted, as they are doing important work, the latter as the secretary of the Convergence for Social Democracy party.
Like the other parties, we support this resolution demanding that this trial be repealed and voided, that all those detained be freed and that the democratic future of the country be set in motion.
Mr President, although we cannot take away the torture to which the political opponents who were tried without any guarantees in Equatorial Guinea were subjected to, the country should void the trial, its results and the measures adopted during it, such as the suppression of the bar association, if it wants to be part of the association with the European Union.
Freeing those convicted and the members of their families and restoring the bar association should be demands from the European Parliament.
With this legal sham, the regime in Equatorial Guinea has surpassed all the limits that can be allowed for a signatory of the Cotonou Agreement, as Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez said, which is not only an agreement for economic cooperation, but also for political dialogue.
Equatorial Guinea has already committed itself internally with the European Union and with the whole of the international community, as a signatory of the Convention against Torture, to begin the transition to democracy, in other words, to hold free elections in a context of respect for human rights.
Failing to comply with that international obligation gives rise to sanctions that we request from the Commission and the EU-ACP Council of Ministers as part of the Cotonou Agreement.
In this sense, democratic conditionality, used in a constructive manner, is a key tool in the European Union's development policy.
The Socialist Group will join with its African colleagues in a detailed debate on this in the next ACP-EU Joint Assembly.
The Commission is very concerned about the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea and welcomes the attention which Parliament has drawn to it in this debate.
The Commission thinks that the recent court case demonstrates the shortcomings of the regime in relation to transition to democracy and respect for the rule of law and for human rights.
The Commission considers that the judgments have been severe and recalls the declaration made on behalf of the Union which condemns the irregularity of the procedures and the weakness of the proof presented.
The Commission deplores the decisions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to remove Equatorial Guinea from the list of countries to be observed by Special Representatives.
The Commission considers that, under the circumstances, the UN Special Rapporteurs on matters such as torture, independence of the judiciary and freedom of the press should visit the country as soon as possible.
Community assistance was blocked from 1993 to 1997 for non-respect of human rights and has only been partially resumed.
The 8th EDF National Indicative Programme emphasises support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Obviously, this has had only limited impact, but it allows the Commission to make support conditional on respect for human rights without resorting to application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The Commission fears that the financial leverage of development cooperation risks being ineffective when compared to the level of resources coming from oil.
Therefore it considers it more appropriate at this time to maintain a robust dialogue with the Government as well as constant international and public pressure.
The Commission is closely following the situation in the country and would not rule out the possibility of opening consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mr President, Belarus is the only one of the countries bordering on the enlarged European Union with which we cannot have normal relations, and President Lukashenko has set at nought all democratic rules since the day he took office.
Parliamentary and presidential elections served only to prop up his autocratic regime and give it the outward appearance of legitimacy.
After he abrogated the democratic constitution in 1996, the OSCE sent a mission of observers to the country with the aim of re-establishing dialogue and helping to restore the foundations of a democratic order.
Its task was an unambitious one, but even that was too much for President Lukashenko.
Parliament, the Commission and the Council worked closely together with the OSCE mission, and the experience increased our regard for its achievements, as repeated attempts were made, in a situation with few - if any - prospects, to set up dialogue, even if only a tenuous one, to at least work towards the minimum criteria we had established, and to find a way to restore normal relations.
Yet even that was too much for Mr Lukashenko, who made it unmistakably clear, in a major speech last month, that he wants no more OSCE missions in the country once the presidential elections are over.
It is simply not as if we are dealing here with a country that is not a member of the OSCE and has not acknowledged its rules; on the contrary, he himself subscribed to the OSCE rules and democratic standards.
This has not stopped him putting the media out of action, meaning that any dissident is at his mercy.
I believe that we must protest vigorously about this, and it is clear that normal relations with the European Union will not be possible if dialogue on the basis of the OSCE mission is not begun.
Thank you, Mr President, I should like to fully endorse Mrs Schroedter's view.
It appears that the brutality of the regime in Minsk knows no bounds, and the way in which they are now managing to close down the OSCE office in that city by no longer issuing visas to diplomats who work there, is in itself a disgrace which once again illustrates how poor the quality of democracy in that country is.
It is also a rather personal matter to us because many in this House know the people who are now being ousted out of the country, if they have not been ousted already.
Over the course of two elections, we have joined forces with the OSCE team in Minsk in a very pleasant and effective partnership.
On two occasions, we, along with the OSCE, have had to conclude that the outcome of the elections was not legitimate, and this is the problem we are essentially faced with.
Also, we have always said that the European Union and the OSCE should be pro-active in supporting civil society and the opposition.
This is what Mr Lukashenko considers unacceptable and what he tries to avoid at all cost.
This is also why we are calling on the European Union too to find out when the office will actually be closing down and whether we should also consider ceasing the TACIS activities because these have probably become ineffective, since they share the same objective as the work of the OSCE.
Mr President, I entirely agree with Mrs Schroedter and Mr Wiersma and shall list a number of points by way of summarising how we Christian Democrats view the closure of the OSCE office in Minsk.
First of all, the closure is not an act of strength on the part of Belarus.
The event is, rather, an expression of weakness.
Secondly, Belarus is actually signalling, albeit in a desperate way, that it is seeking contact with the EU.
Thirdly, Belarus is seeking a bargaining counter, or something to play off against the European Union.
Fourthly, Belarus is trying in this way to give prominence to its basic need also to join the European Union in addressing the border issues and the refugee situation within Belarus.
On the basis of this analysis, we can openly enter into talks with Belarus, taking of course as our starting point our vigorous and fundamental criticism of the unacceptable incident at the OSCE office in Minsk.
I would appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Liikanen, whom I would call upon to approach Commissioner Patten, to step up all their contacts with Belarus.
What has happened in Minsk in connection with the OSCE office is a sign that Belarus is ultimately appealing for some form of contact.
They are doing so in an unacceptable way. We cannot, however, allow neighbours of an enlarged European Union to behave as they have in this case.
It is also important for the European Union to state clearly that, within the framework of the union between Belarus and Russia, President Putin of Russia has a major and special responsibility for putting pressure on Belarus to act in an internationally credible way.
Mr President, over the course of the past four years, the OSCE mission in Belarus has done impressive work under impossible circumstances.
The present joint draft resolution is right to express its deep respect for this mission.
What is exactly the merit of the Advisory and Monitoring Group?
Its former head of mission and great driving force, Mr Hans-Georg Wieck, has given a thumbnail description of this commitment: observation of the human rights situation and administration of justice in Belarus, legal assistance for the affected families, reporting of processes and interventions in cases of violations of the law, humanitarian aid to victims of state persecution on political grounds and by administrative and criminal penalties, development of the range of action and cooperation of political parties, the forming of a coalition of parties and social forces, observation of elections, also involving the local population, and finally, projects reinforcing civil society.
Needless to say, all these activities have been a thorn in the side of the authoritarian President of Belarus, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, from the very outset.
He has therefore done everything in his power to ignore or undermine the work of the OSCE mission, or what is worse, gave it a bad name in public.
This has certainly not done anything for the popularity ratings of the recognised ballot director Lukashenko.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
While in the opinion polls, his popularity is consistently declining, that of the OSCE mission so detested by him is on the increase.
It is therefore hardly surprising that the Belarussian Head of State is now trying to force the OSCE mission in Minsk to resign by refusing the necessary visa to be issued.
It is up to the Council and the Commission to stop him, in close cooperation, if at all possible, with the Russian Federation, since we cannot afford to abandon civil society in Belarus, which is finally regaining political and social consciousness, at this crucial time.
I therefore agree with Hans-Georg Wieck that nothing less than the credibility of the European institutions is in the balance here.
Mr President, I support all the statements made on this resolution by other Members, and as the rapporteur appointed by the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to inform Parliament on a possible association agreement with Belarus, I would like to say that I am in no way satisfied with the progress of that country.
The visits that we have made with Mr Wiersma, Mr SacrÃ©deus, Mrs SchrÃ¶der and other Members to gauge the situation have shown that in Belarus society there is a vast majority and wide range of social, political, cultural and professional forces in favour of democracy and the values of Western Europe, with strong desires to move their position towards the European Union.
I therefore think that we have a twofold commitment or challenge with Belarus: on the one hand, to strengthen relations and help the democratic transition to take place quickly and urgently, and on the other hand, to make the necessary diplomatic efforts so that this position of transition towards democracy can also be brought to the fore in Russia and elsewhere.
As has already been said, what happened with the OSCE mission is unacceptable.
The work done by the former Head of the Mission, Ambassador Hans-Georg Wieck, and by the subsequent heads, has been commendable, and we should therefore continue to exert considerable pressure so that work continues along those lines.
Our Group therefore supports this position, in agreement with all of the democratic opposition forces I mentioned, who want a different Belarus.
Mr President, Mr SacrÃ©deus has, I think, addressed something of essential importance.
Byelorussia, or Belarus, will, in a very short time, be one of the European Union's neighbours.
What was termed Poland in the Middle Ages was in actual fact a federation consisting of Poland, Lithuania and Byelorussia, each part having equal rights.
Lithuania and Poland will, next year or the year thereafter, be able to become members of the European Union, whereas Belarus seems today to be further away than the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which we were speaking earlier.
This is a tragedy, responsibility for which lies principally at Mr Lukashenko's door.
The people of Belarus played a part in the democracy movement that led to the fall of Communism and helped to bring about the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
It is for that reason that we have to give forthright support to the movement for democracy and human rights in that country, a movement that is supported not only by us but by former human rights campaigners in Prague, Warsaw and elsewhere; we have to send a signal to the people there that we know that they are Europeans, and that they really belong to us.
We must, of course, use all democratic and diplomatic means to work towards the OSCE becoming genuinely operational there, to ensure the failure of the attempts at doing away with monitoring and concealing this oppression behind a veil of authoritarian measures.
I would, though, be very wary of involving Moscow in this process, as Moscow, being the former colonial power, of course bears some responsibility for what is happening in Belarus today.
We have to work together with everyone, including Russia, but I see the European Union as having a special responsibility to make it clear that this European people too will have a place among us, but that the OSCE, and then the Council of Europe, must do their work, and, above all and most crucially, human rights must be made to prevail.
That all this should be, as it were, obscured and befogged by one regime, is something we cannot permit.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes this timely debate and shares the deep concerns that have been raised by Belarus' appalling record on human rights and democracy.
The EU and its Member States have supported all OSCE moves to keep the OSCE assistance mission in Belarus open and running.
The EU has issued a number of statements, either in the OSCE in Vienna or from the Presidency in Madrid, strongly condemning the action by the Belarus authorities to suppress the activities of the OSCE office in Minsk.
Via its delegation in Vienna or during the Council working group meetings, the Commission has been very active in the discussions on the OSCE position vis-Ã -vis Belarus.
The closure of the OSCE mission in Minsk would put in jeopardy many of the mission's activities, notably the observance of Belarus' commitments under OSCE human rights rules.
If the mission is closed, this reporting will no longer be possible.
The case of Mr Andrew Carpenter is just one illustration of the methods used by the Belarus authorities to gag OSCE observers working in their country in full compliance with OSCE and diplomatic rules.
The Commission has made it clear, in its contacts with the Belarus authorities, that it regards the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group as a significant test case for the authorities' approach to the development of democracy, civil society and human rights in Belarus.
If Belarus intends to join the democratic family of European nations and to establish fully-fledged relations with the EU at all levels, it should demonstrate this by accepting the mandate and the services of the AMG.
We shall follow developments very closely and if need be propose further action to support the OSCE resolve.
Mr President, we are here to debate the situation in Syria and in particular the changes that have taken place since President Bashir al Assad took over from his father some three years ago.
Following the arrest of Mr Riad al-Turk, a 72 year-old lawyer and secretary-general of the banned Communist Party, there are suggestions that Syria might be about to enter a new phase of repression, following a gradual thawing of relations with the West and a desirable but limited opening-up of the Syrian economy to market forces.
Although no expert, I would certainly support the calls for all prisoners of conscience to be freed, in Syria and elsewhere.
It is vital that the Syrian Government understands the need to distinguish between those who advocate violence or rebellion and those who simply advocate political change.
I also fully support the paragraphs in the motion calling for the Syrian authorities to ensure that detainees are not tortured in prison.
Human rights cannot be detached from wider political developments in the region.
Only yesterday I was privileged to hear the very fine speech by the King of neighbouring Jordan, an exemplary role model of moderation and wisdom.
For many years Syria sponsored terrorism in both Israel and Turkey and was the main state to reject any compromise solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute based on land for peace.
There are signs that the end of the Cold War and the new geopolitical realities of the region have forced the adoption of a more reasonable and even pragmatic foreign policy by Damascus.
Syrian leaders need to recognise the importance of the recent shift in international opinion and, in particular, the widespread support for a viable democratic Palestinian state and to work with - not against - the international community for a comprehensive regional settlement, including the return of the Golan Heights.
Only then, I believe, will Syria be able to fully develop its potential as a nation and to offer its people the peace and prosperity which they truly deserve.
Mr President, I will start with an individual case.
After spending 18 years in prison for crimes of opinion, the lawyer, Riad al-Turk, was released in 1998.
In recent months, he has been imprisoned anew, also for crimes of opinion.
The trial is in progress and the defendant is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years.
All this is happening in Syria, where, despite the hopes of renewal raised by the new president, Bashir al-Assad, I regret to say that there has been absolutely no increase in consideration for freedoms.
Let me tell you about Riad al-Turk, a political opposition leader who has paid an extremely high price for defending his ideals.
The lawyer, now an elderly man in poor health - and we can imagine what it means to spend 20 years in prison in that country - has suffered a deterioration of his health in recent months, since he was arrested again.
He is not a familiar face in the West, for he has never tried to claim that his is a special case.
He has displayed great dignity throughout his life and he was not even allowed books in prison.
In order not to lose all sense of time and reality, he tried to survive and to preserve his concentration by drawing with small stones that he found in his cell.
Among those in prison with him are two members of the Syrian parliament, who are being detained on the same charge. These are their crimes: taking part in political meetings not authorised by the regime.
We are scrutinising a key country in the region with interest and we hope that the association agreement being negotiated by the Commission will be concluded.
Clearly, however, respect for human rights is an essential condition of these agreements.
We therefore expect the European Commission's negotiators to take a firm stand on the case of the elderly lawyer, Riad al-Turk, as well.
It is impossible to put this matter down to cultural diversity: these are basic conditions which a State founded on the rule of law must respect.
Mr President, the Commission participates fully in the European Union's endeavours to support human rights in Syria.
Our aim is to establish a constructive dialogue with the Syrian authorities on human rights issues on the basis of the principles expressed in the Barcelona Declaration.
The EU Troika demarches were made after the arrests of opposition personalities, including Mr al-Turk, in August/September last year, and after the convictions of the two MPs, Mr al-Homsi and Mr Riad Seif in March/April this year.
Through the EC Delegation in Damascus, the Commission also participates in the EU observation of trials.
We regret that recently EU observers have on some occasions been excluded from the trial against Mr al-Turk.
While we welcome the opportunity to observe trials in Syria, we also realise that the mere presence of observers at trials must not become a substitute for the fairness of court procedures.
With this in mind, the Commission, through its Delegation in Syria, will continue, together with Member States' Embassies, to follow as closely as possible the trial against Mr al-Turk.
The Commission will also continue to raise its concerns, regarding both the general human rights situation and individual cases, with the Syrian authorities and will call upon Syria to respect freedom of expression and of association in line with the Barcelona Declaration.
Mr President, I am dismayed by the way in which the human rights situation has developed in Malaysia, particularly since the events of 11 September.
Under the pretext of combating terrorism, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has made much use of the Internal Security Act, which authorises the detention without trial of anyone suspected of undermining national security, to muzzle all political opposition and to intensify the repressive measures contravening individual freedoms, notably freedom of expression.
In a few months, we have moved from the image of a country on the up and up, run by civilised people, to that of a country whose leaders are destroying with their own hands what they have built up.
That is why Parliament is duty-bound to condemn these abuses and call upon the Malaysian Government not only to guarantee respect for individual freedoms but also to abolish that notorious Internal Security Act and to ratify without delay the International Convention on Human Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture.
It is also vital that the European Parliament send a mission to Malaysia in order to investigate the conditions under which the political prisoners are being detained and the violations of their basic rights.
Finally, the European Union should place this issue on the agendas of the forthcoming meetings between the European Union and the ANASE.
Mr President, since the attacks of 11 September, the Malaysian Government has stepped up its internal security measures, allegedly against suspected Islamic militants.
It increasingly resorts to the use of the Internal Security Act, which allows it to detain people indefinitely without trial if, in the Government's view, they are suspected of threatening national security.
Human rights groups have consistently criticised the abuse of this draconian legislation.
The High Court of Malaysia has also called for the Parliament to review its use.
This resolution quite correctly calls for the abolition of the Internal Security Act and any other laws that permit detention without trial.
It is also clear that the Government is using the pretext of the crackdown on terrorism as a means of suppressing Government opponents and critics.
The repeated use of the Internal Security Act has often been politically motivated and politically selective.
It has been used to arrest and detain without trial various members of Malaysian civil society, including opposition leaders, academics, trade unionists and students, frequently without charging them and often denying them access to a lawyer.
The resolution highlights the fact that some 40 political activists have been arrested since 2001 under the Act.
The resolution rightly calls for either the release or charging of all political prisoners of conscience, including the six political prisoners specifically named in the resolution, who have been imprisoned for exercising the right to legitimate political organisation and dissent.
We want to see them either released or for them to be formally charged and receive an immediate and fair trial.
In conclusion, I would urge that all future political cooperation with Malaysia be conditional upon the Malaysian Government's abolition of the Internal Security Act and also the release of all political prisoners, so that all Malaysians may be assured that their basic human rights as enshrined in their constitution are respected.
Ladies and gentlemen, I now have the honour of welcoming on behalf of Parliament a delegation of members of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Laos, who have taken their seats in the official gallery.
The delegation is led by Mrs Pany Yathotou, the Vice-President of the Assembly, and is visiting Strasbourg on the occasion of the Third Interparliamentary Meeting between the European Parliament and Laos.
We hope that your visit to Europe's Parliament will be an informative one.
Mr President, Malaysia could, in many ways, be a model for much of Asia, and indeed of Europe.
When one considers the constitution created by the nation's wise founder, Tunku Abdurahman, under which the various states are in a federation, with the nine sultans electing a common Head of State every five years, and diverse races and religions living together without violence and largely without conflict, one might say that Malaysia had what it takes to be a model state, and, in economic terms as well, decades in succession saw repeated and outstanding development, despite the setbacks in recent years.
It is, then, all the more dramatic a development that Mr Mahathir's regime is beginning to take on the characteristics of an autocracy.
First he attempts to act against dissent in the name of politicised Islam.
Then again, he misuses the fight against terrorism, and its Islamic variety in particular, to take further action against dissidents, albeit under another label.
At one moment he tries to win worldwide acclaim as the representative of democracy; the next he is a brutal autocrat, withholding even the minimum rule of law.
That is what is at stake with this Internal Security Act - that appropriate judicial review should have to take place; that proper evidence should have to be produced; that detention should be under proper conditions; and that the law should provide proper means of appealing against detention.
Political detainees in Malaysia enjoy none of these things.
It is for that reason that we have to make use of both the next EU-ASEAN summit and the next EU-ASIA summit to push energetically for a partner as important as Malaysia to respect human rights, return to its roots, renew the peaceful coexistence of the various religions and ethnic groups, and, at the end of the day, for the disappearance of the repressive measures that have been constantly stepped up in recent years, have resulted in a growing number of political prisoners, and are incompatible with Malaysia's status as one of the European Union's key partners.
Mr President, I recently represented the Group of the Party of European Socialists at the Socialist International Asia-Pacific Committee in Manila, where we had a first-hand opportunity to learn of the increasingly repressive regime in Malaysia.
The government has used the tragic events of 11 September as an excuse for a crackdown on peaceful democratic opponents of the current regime who have no connections with either al-Qa'ida or any terrorist or fundamentalist groups.
The Internal Security Act, the Emergency Public Order and Prevention of Crime Ordnance and the Dangerous Drugs Special Prevention Measures Act all allow for detention without trial.
It is important that pressure is put on the Malaysian Government by the Council, the Commission and Parliament to release those held under these laws, to repeal them and to fully restore the right to a fair and public trial and respect for human rights in that country.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes Malaysia's commitment to the fight against terrorism and the concrete steps it has taken to implement that commitment.
However, the Commission takes seriously the concerns reflected in today's debate and in Malaysia, as in many other countries, the fight against terrorism has at times impacted negatively on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Although the Commission does not yet have a permanent presence in Kuala Lumpur, together with the Member States present in Malaysia it follows the human rights situation in the country, including the application of the internal security act, through contacts with the Government, opposition parties, Malaysian civil society and the national human rights commission.
As my colleague David Byrne made clear in the debate on this subject last year, the Commission remains concerned about the use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) in particular for the suppression of legitimate political dissent.
The Commission believes that the Malaysian authorities should either release political opponents detained under the ISA or provide them with access to justice in an open court of law.
The Commission continues to support EU dÃ©marches on human rights issues to the Government of Malaysia on all occasions.
On 8 May, the Commission adopted its strategy paper for Malaysia, in which it is proposed to use the appropriate EC financing instruments to support activities to strengthen governance and the role of civil society in Malaysia.
When implementing that strategy, we will seek to pursue a constructive dialogue with the Government of Malaysia on these issues.
Thank you, Mr President, more than half of the countries in the world have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice, and this number of countries is on the increase.
Moreover, these are mainly former countries of the Soviet Union and surrounding areas.
In Europe too, important steps are being taken towards the abolition of capital punishment, even in times of war.
This has been rubberstamped by more than 36 European countries.
In Asia too, there is a trend in this direction, on the part of both governments and human rights organisations.
Despite this, and despite the positive steps being taken in the Japanese parliament, the situation in Japan is still very distressing.
The number of executions that take place every year is fewer than in many other countries.
Between 1993 and 2000, 39 prisoners were executed.
The attendant system, however, is very different from what one would expect from a civilised and leading industrial nation.
The executions take place by hanging.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes before the condemned person finally dies.
There have also been cases where the lawyers were not even able to collect the bodies in due course, but only the cremated remains of the prisoners.
I welcome with open arms the announcement of the Taiwanese Ministry of Justice that capital punishment will be abolished in Taiwan in 2004.
Executions were still taking place in Taiwan until 1998.
This has now stopped, and in January of this year, the Mandatory Death Penalty Act of 1944 was repealed.
In South Korea too, we see very hopeful movements in the direction of abolishing capital punishment. This too is to be welcomed.
Mr President, I think that we all remember various resolutions from Parliament against the death penalty, which led to an increase in recent years in the countries who have abolished the death penalty, or at least in those who have had a practical moratorium, in which executions have not taken place in recent years.
Today we are talking about three countries in particular: South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, in which some measures have been taken which at least give us hope.
In Japan there has been a bill, and the Japanese Diet has created a league against the death penalty.
In South Korea there has been a bill, which was signed by 155 of the 273 representatives.
In Taiwan the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty has been reduced.
I think that these three facts can lead us to believe that in these three countries, in the not too distant future, the death penalty could be abolished.
We should think not only about the harsh conditions under which prisoners condemned to death live, but also that there are 70 prisoners in South Korea and more than 50 prisoners in Taiwan who are still awaiting the death penalty.
In the European Union we have concluded that the death penalty is barbaric.
We therefore support the proposal from the European Council that universal abolition of the death penalty should be achieved without too much delay, so that we can look to the future with greater hope.
Mr President, the abolition of the death penalty is a cornerstone of the moral message which the EU wishes to convey throughout the world, not only to free and democratic countries but also, and especially, to dictatorships.
The abolition of the death penalty also expresses that view of the equal, unique and inviolable dignity of mankind which has its deepest roots in the Judaeo-Christian ethic of our Western civilisation.
The EU's opposition to the death penalty therefore has a conscious and deeply entrenched ethical and moral basis that provides the foundation for our civilisation's view of human beings.
Enlargement of the EU will also mean abolition of the death penalty's being a principle that will be extended to new countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
We Christian Democrats and liberal conservatives in the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regret the fact that, in the present resolution, this unifying principle of the abolition of the death penalty, which we fully support, is only affirmed in relation to free and democratic states such as Japan and South Korea, where football's World Cup is being organised right now, together with Taiwan.
For some reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, together with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the left-wing socialists and former Communist parties here in the European Parliament have chosen not to say anything at all about the abolition of the death penalty in neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea.
We find that extremely one-sided and difficult to understand and therefore choose to abstain from voting in the impending vote at 5.30 p.m.
In the fight for the abolition of the death penalty, we must take our stance on a shared moral basis.
Singling out free and democratic states gives a one-sided impression.
That is deeply regrettable.
Mr President, I have some sympathy with Mr SacrÃ©deus.
I am opposed to the death penalty.
It needs to be abolished throughout the world, save possibly in time of war.
I myself in this House appealed to President Fontaine last year to write to the US federal authorities to protest against the death penalty for the right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh.
Yet I confess I voted against placing this issue on the agenda.
I am not convinced of its urgency in the light of the fact that in South Korea the government of Kim Dae-jung has not allowed any death sentences to be carried out since he took office in February 1998.
In Taiwan, as the resolution itself states, there has been a recent reform in the penal code abolishing the mandatory death penalty for various violent crimes, while the Minister of Justice has stated that this is the first step towards abolishing capital punishment within the next three years.
In Japan there has been a Diet Members' League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 1993.
In one sense I am almost amused that the resolution welcomes its creation nine years on.
It almost warrants an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as one of the most belated welcomes in history, and I confidently expect in the future to hear in one of our resolutions that Mafeking has been relieved.
The League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty has 113 members from all parties in both Houses in Japan, representing almost one sixth of MPs.
Last year, only two death sentences were carried out and the government has announced that it will promote a new law that will create the possibility for judges to substitute life without parole for the death penalty for capital crimes.
Nevertheless, now that the matter is on the agenda, we will vote in favour of the resolution, of course, but maybe in future we can focus on those countries around the world where the carrying out of death sentences is virtually or actually a daily event.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, in particular, to thank Mrs Frassoni, President of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, for having put this matter to the vote on Monday as an addition to the subjects for topical and urgent debate, and I should also like to thank Mrs Napoletano of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, as well as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - whatever the views of Mr SacrÃ©deus - and the Communist Group for having supported and upheld this resolution.
I think we had to salute this remarkable Council of Europe initiative, which is aimed not at all countries but at specific ones, namely the countries with observer status within the Council of Europe and, in particular, the United States and Japan.
A delegation from the Council of Europe recently visited Japan to participate in a seminar organised by the Japanese Diet and, in spite of what Mr Ford says, the Parliamentary League, which has actually been in existence for nine years, had been somewhat in abeyance and has only resumed its work very recently.
That said, I think that the issue of the death penalty in democratic countries is one thing, while the death penalty in non-democratic dictatorships is another.
I freely admit that the vast majority of cases - the figure is 98% - involve dictatorships but, where dictatorships are concerned, I think that the priority is not perhaps the abolition of the death penalty but a return to democracy and the rule of law.
The battle is quite different, as are the forces deployed, but I believe that this initiative, aimed at three democratic Asian countries, is important, and important for one essential reason.
When we meet the top leaders of the People's Republic of China, we see them basically arguing in favour of a certain relativism in human rights whereby there is apparently a distinctively Asian approach to the issue.
What, then, we have to state is that there is no such Asian approach to human rights. There is a universal approach to human rights and democracy and, that being said, enlisting countries as important as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the ranks of the abolitionist countries is crucial to affirming this universal nature of human rights.
It is therefore obvious - and I hope, by saying this, to reassure Mr SacrÃ©deus - that we are not giving up the battle for the abolition of the death penalty in dictatorships.
It is just that, in such countries, the problem is just one among so many others. What matters now is to affirm this idea of universality, and I think we also need to start thinking about transforming the Council of Europe.
With the forthcoming enlargement, there is now an overlap between the European Union and the Council of Europe, and I think we need to think about transforming the Council of Europe into a Universal Council of Democracies into which we could integrate countries like Canada, the United States, Japan and South Korea and have them genuinely spearhead a campaign to affirm democracy throughout the world, beginning with the battles for the abolition of the death penalty and for the International Criminal Court.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's motion for a resolution on the abolition of the death penalty in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan.
The EU works towards the universal abolition of the death penalty, which is one of the pillars of its human rights policies.
In the process of attaining this objective and in accordance with the EU guidelines on the abolition of the death penalty, where the death penalty still exists the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and insists that it be carried out according to minimum standards.
The EU also presses, where relevant, for the introduction of moratoria.
The EU reaffirmed its commitment to the abolition of the death penalty by tabling a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year.
Many activities which aim to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty have been supported under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
Funding such projects has recently been reaffirmed as a priority in the Commission's communication, or policy paper of 8 May 2001 on the Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries.
The Commission welcomes some of the recent positive steps taken by the three countries concerned, and, firstly, the frank exchange of views at a seminar in Tokyo in May 2002 on "Justice and Human Rights in Council of Europe Observer States: the Abolition of the Death Penalty" and the establishment of a Japanese Diet members' league for the abolition of the death penalty; secondly, the bill tabled to abolish the death penalty in the Republic of Korea which was supported by a majority of the National Assembly last year; thirdly, the amendment to the penal code of Taiwan which reduces the list of crimes for which the death penalty is mandatory.
However, conscious that a great deal remains to be done to abolish the death penalty in the Asian region as a whole, the EU decided in 2001 to enhance its strategy for abolishing the death penalty in that part of the world on the basis of the 1998 guidelines on the death penalty.
The forthcoming EU Annual Report on Human Rights for 2001/2002 will provide an overview of the action taken in the region.
The EU will continue its efforts to abolish the death penalty in the region.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following three motions for a resolution:
B5-0367/2002 submitted by Mr van Dam on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities on foot-and-mouth disease and the football World Cup in South Korea;
B5-0369/2002 submitted by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and others on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Mulder on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mrs Lucas and Mr Wyn on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Berlato and Mr Hyland on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group on foot-and-mouth disease and the football World Cup in South Korea;
B5-0377/2002 submitted by Mr JovÃ© Peres and others on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on foot-and-mouth disease and the football World Cup in South Korea.
Mr President, many football fans in Europe are following the matches in South Korea very closely.
They are being overwhelmed by alternate feelings of surprise and disappointment.
Who, for example, had expected the French team to be out of the World Cup so early on?
Captain Zidane definitely had not.
In fact, the team of the candidate Member State Slovenia has been eliminated too.
The homecoming of Zidane and his French team constitutes a risk to millions of animals in Europe.
South Korea is currently suffering with foot and mouth disease.
The virus can travel with returning players and fans in food and on their footwear.
Control at European airports and outposts is minimal and should be stepped up drastically, preferably along American lines.
Disinfection and completing a questionnaire by travellers who arrive back from FMD-sensitive areas should become standard procedure.
One by one, the European teams are disappearing from the green pitches in Korea.
It would not acceptable for all sheep and cows soon to have to leave the green fields through laxness at European borders.
Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr van Dam said, there are still many people left in Korea.
It is estimated that there are currently between 650 000 and 700 000 people from the European Union who are going to return to their countries of origin, and there was foot and mouth disease in Korea very recently.
Council Directive 72/462 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries, does not apply to meat that forms part of the personal luggage of those tourists, insofar as it does not exceed 1 kg., belongs to the bovine or swine species, is fresh meat and is for personal consumption.
Therefore, if we know that the foot and mouth virus can be transmitted by food carried by tourists that has been made with contaminated meat, and that it can be carried by the human body, which can be a vector even if it is not affected, as Mr van Dam also said, there is currently a degree of laxity in the inspections being conducted in the Member States, at the borders of the European Union, both external and internal, and even more so at the airports.
These shortcomings have been highlighted in the report by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, which points out these serious defects in the inspections of imported food and animals.
Parliament therefore asks the Commission to urge the Member States to conduct more rigorous inspections at airports, to conduct a major information campaign among all tourists who have been to that part of the world regarding the risks that exist on their return, based on the International Animal Health Code; and for there to be a signed acceptance of responsibility in order to authorise entry to the European Union if they are coming from a country that has not been clear of the disease for at least three months.
As the matches are finishing on 30 June and people are returning, the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, put forward a suitable administrative and legislative process containing the strictest possible standards to be applied to inspections at borders, similar to those that are being applied in other third countries, to ensure that foot and mouth disease is not reintroduced into the European Union.
Mr President, we can take it as read, on the basis of current scientific research, that foot and mouth disease is, of all viral infections, one of the most dangerous to our stocks of cloven-hoofed animals.
The situation is that this dangerous animal disease spreads in an explosive manner if it is introduced in unvaccinated stocks.
We saw that happen recently, when foot and mouth disease broke out in Great Britain.
We also know what damage then ensues.
It is irrelevant whether foot and mouth disease has broken out or is present in South Korea or in another country of the world.
The mobility of people and goods, which can be transferred from one place to another in the shortest conceivable time, means that the risk is always present.
So I ask the Commission whether the prophylactic resources are sufficient to avert this danger in the long term.
We know that the European strategy for combating animal diseases still has its flaws.
The state of knowledge, which must normally increase over time, is unchanged as regards what happens in the absence of vaccination.
I ask the Commission whether the attempt should not be made to alter the animal diseases strategy in future, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease, in such a way that prophylaxis is monitored far better.
As Mrs Redondo and her predecessors on the floor said, prophylaxis of course begins at the airport or on the train.
Prophylaxis is, though, also to a very significant extent, a matter for the individual stock farmer, and I must say, some very worrying things come to light.
When I run an open day for visitors to my farm, there is no doubt in my mind; I always see people from the towns running through the stables without taking any steps whatever to prevent the spread of disease.
Taking all these things together, I would consider it possible to stop this dangerous disease in its tracks.
Let me plainly say here and now that I very much question the assumption on which we have based our actions over the past years, namely that we can stamp it out across the board.
So I urge the implementation of a prophylaxis worthy of the name, and I ask the Commission to give an appropriate answer on the subject.
Mr President, the principle of prevention being better than cure applies before anything else.
It is one of the tasks of the Temporary FMD Committee under the dynamic leadership of Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez to look into this and to publish a report on this subject later on in the year.
Every attempt should now be made, however, to prevent FMD from being imported.
The outbreak in South Korea is now in the limelight accidentally because that is where the World Cup is being held.
Many supporters travel to that destination.
Some return and some do so much sooner than they had wanted, and there is thus a risk of them bringing the FMD virus with them.
As Dr Kindermann rightly pointed out, however, travellers and tourists are already returning from Africa and Asia every day, where FMD, with its many varieties, is a common occurrence.
The big question is what the European Commission and the Member States have done since the most recent major outbreak last year in order to protect the external borders more effectively.
The daily traveller has noticed no difference at all since then.
Despite this, the latest FMD outbreak incurred billionsÂŽworth of damage to the European economy.
Better border control is also expensive, of course, but much cheaper than what we have had to spend in the wake of the FMD outbreak.
Financially, it is an extremely profitable investment.
We have to model ourselves on the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and impose heavy fines on imports of foodstuffs from countries that, in terms of infectious animal diseases, are in the risk area.
Mr President, the Commission wants to thank the European Parliament for this timely reminder of the risks of foot-and-mouth disease.
The outbreak in the Republic of Korea coincides with the World Cup when many thousands of Europeans are present to support their football teams.
Clearly, we need to be alert to any potential risks that they may come in contact with the disease and return with it to the European Union.
We should not, however, focus our attention only on Korea.
The fact is that foot-and-mouth disease is widespread throughout the world.
All foot-and-mouth-affected countries represent a potential risk to Member States and therefore the problem must be addressed in a general way.
Although it would appear that the outbreaks in the Republic of Korea are at least 40 km away from the nearest football venues, the potential threat to Member States cannot be ignored.
Therefore, this issue was discussed with Member States at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain on 8 May 2002.
I also understand that Mrs Redondo, chairperson of Parliament's Committee on foot-and-mouth, raised the issue directly with my colleague David Byrne.
This is no doubt in the context of the ongoing work of Parliament's Temporary Committee on foot-and-mouth disease.
I understand the issue of controls, including on passengers at points of entry to the EU, is the primary focus of the committee's work.
The Commission has subsequently reminded all Member States that, in accordance with EU law they are not authorised to import from the Republic of Korea foot-and-mouth disease susceptible animals and their products (fresh meat, meat products, meat preparations, milk, milk products, etc.).
They have also been advised that imports of foodstuffs from Korea by passengers are not allowed under EU legislation.
The Commission has requested that all Member States ensure that public awareness of travellers visiting Korea is specifically addressed at airports and that controls at points of entry into the Community on goods coming from the Republic of Korea are reinforced.
Following the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic, the Commission has been preparing a number of proposals addressing the issues related to foot-and-mouth, including measures to raise public awareness.
The Commission intends to present a proposal shortly to raise public awareness and reinforce controls on passengers at points of entry.
However, the technical and logistical problems, and consequently the financial implications associated with such procedures, should not be underestimated.
It must be borne in mind, that unlike Australia or New Zealand, the EU has a long land border.
There is passenger traffic of millions each year between our Member States and third countries where foot-and-mouth disease is endemic.
In addition, there are air-traffic links with 90 countries that are not internationally recognised to be free of foot-and-mouth disease and infection.
The extent of the challenge is also highlighted by the existing difficulties in combating drug smuggling in international transport.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the European Parliament for raising public awareness of the risk from foot-and-mouth disease.
I am sure that the issue can be addressed in greater detail following the report of the Committee on foot-and-mouth disease and in the light of the Commission's forthcoming proposals on foot-and-mouth disease.
I shall pass on the record of this debate to my colleague David Byrne.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for a resolution:
B5-0333/2002 submitted by Mr Messner and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Nepal;
B5-0345/2002 submitted by Mr van den Bos on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0358/2002 submitted by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0365/2002 submitted by Mr Thomas Mann and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Nepal;
B5-0368/2002 submitted by Mr Collins on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in Nepal;
B5-0378/2002 submitted by Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mr SeppÃ€nen on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Nepal.
Mr President, the renewed escalation of violence in Nepal gives cause for concern and puts the stability of the entire region at risk.
When the Maoist rebels attacked the Nepalganj army camp at the end of May, over 100 of them were killed, as were many soldiers.
The number killed since the conflict broke out six years ago has risen to 3 500.
Despite international appeals for peace, there is no sign of the violence coming to an end.
What is worse is that families in Kathmandu and western Nepal - with whom I have had contact for years and whom I visit regularly - tell me that the fighting is getting more intense from day to day.
The rebels are destroying specific infrastructure targets, cutting off the public's supply of electricity, and murdering both police officers - who are poorly trained - and government officials in the provinces.
The overwhelming majority of the Nepalese people are still backing the monarchy and supporting King Gyanendra, who has substantially gained authority in the past few difficult months.
He has dissolved Parliament early at the request of the Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and called new elections for 13 November this year.
He has appealed to all sections of the population to turn out to vote in large numbers and thereby unambiguously declare their support for democracy and play their part in bringing about internal stability.
The European Union is supporting Nepal to the tune of some EUR 15 million, and quite rightly so.
I speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats when I say that it should send independent observers to see that these November elections are fair and free and that the secrecy of the ballot is maintained.
Commissioner, the European Union should definitely be willing to act as a mediator in this conflict, should it be asked to do so.
Quite apart from that, there must be no let-up in the efforts to make use of every opportunity for negotiations between the parties that presents itself.
We are also looking to see a proper trial for Krishna Sen, imprisoned on suspicion of leading guerrilla operations, and for four other suspected members of the banned Communist Party.
I know Nepal very well - it is one of the poorest countries in the world, but also one of the most fascinating.
Its principal source of income is tourism, and of that it is currently deprived.
Why?
It is because of the lack of security in this beautiful part of the Himalayas that thousands of foreign visitors are choosing not to travel to Nepal.
As much as they need the state's internal affairs to be well ordered, Nepal's people need even more sustainable interventions, economic and structural reforms in all parts of the country, if they are at last to emerge from poverty, which is one of the essential causes of violence.
Mr President, in relation to the last debate, I cannot resist noting that Commissioner Liikanen did not thank those European Union football teams who have made a thankless contribution to helping decrease the likelihood of transmitting foot-and-mouth disease from South Korea by departing from the competition early.
Speaking on behalf of the Socialist group on the resolution on Nepal, we have a situation where Maoist rebels are threatening a very fragile constitutional monarchy, and the situation is in danger of fast sliding into a civil war.
Several thousand people have died and hundreds have been arrested.
The way forward is clear: the Government must ensure respect for human rights and internal law.
The alleged massacres of 500 Maoist guerrillas in May, if it is true, will only make the situation worse.
We must provide the means from the European Union to try and find a peaceful solution to the current conflict, and the finance to help rebuild the economy, in particular in the rural areas.
The government of Nepal itself must restore the rule of law and order and there is a need to set up an independent investigation into the allegations against the security forces.
Mr President, I must admit that I was about to say that Finland generously allowed England and Germany to go to the World Cup because it wanted to be free of foot-and-mouth disease, but the real reason was bad luck in those two games.
I now turn to Nepal.
The Commission deplores the increasing number of victims of continuous clashes between Maoist and Government forces, particularly following the promulgation of the state of emergency.
The EC is also particularly concerned by the consequences of the suspension of constitutional guarantees and by reports of abuses perpetrated by terrorist attacks and counter-insurgency forces.
The EU was disappointed by the interruption of the negotiations with Maoist leaders started by new Prime Minister Deuba in November 2001.
The new wave of terrorist attacks is having a disastrous impact on the economy and progressively disrupting the entire development process in Nepal.
The Commission is further concerned that the recent dissolution of the House of Representatives marks a blow to democracy in Nepal.
The anticipation of new elections on 13 November 2002, the establishment of a "caretaker government" and the extension of the state of emergency will not help ensure a solution to the Maoist problem.
It will further increase the democratic deficit of Nepalese institutions, while further delaying the most urgent administrative reforms.
The Commission calls on the Nepalese political class to abandon the internal rifts and personal rivalry that are one of the causes of the endemic state of crisis of Nepal.
Despite the political crisis, the Commission is committed to support for Nepal's sustainable development.
The primary objectives of the new EC Cooperation Strategy for Nepal for 2002-2006 will be the consolidation of democracy, conflict prevention and poverty eradication.
Development activities will be located in the most deprived areas of the country, including the west, with the hope of improving poor socio-economic conditions of local populations and thereby reducing any pro-Maoist sympathies.
The Commission is at present considering the possibility of supporting the electoral process of 13 November 2002 with EU observers.
The Commission has also planned the mobilisation of conflict prevention resources through the Rapid Reaction Mechanism following an overall assessment of the situation and a detailed report carried out in February 2002.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 4.55 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Mr President, I have just two technical corrections.
The first is that recital K speaks of 3.5 million Congolese, a figure about which nobody can be certain, and so we ask that it should speak simply in terms of millions.
The other point has to do with paragraph 5.
This mentions an agreement as having been signed on 19 May, but it was rightly pointed out in the debate that it was signed on 19 April.
We ask that both these points be corrected.
Mr President, we have tabled an oral amendment which would mean adding to recital H: 'Whereas the European Parliament nonetheless regrets that some participants have not agreed to join this agreement and invites all the Congolese parties to take responsibility and to respect the framework established in the Lusaka agreements and the United Nations resolutions?.
This amendment reflects the idea that was expressed in the debate, on which I think there was a consensus among the other groups.
It would mean copying everything that was said by the European Union about Sun City, as in the resolution only the first part was copied.
Mr President, in paragraph 5, after 'civil society?, the following paragraph should be added: 'regrets that the opposition parties (UDP, FONUS, PALU and MNC/L), and the other parties and platforms representing civil society, have not signed the agreement of 19 April?.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
I have voted against the report.
Regions bordering the candidate countries will experience the effects of enlargement more quickly and more directly than the present Member States.
The Christian Democrats therefore see nothing wrong with the Commission's proposing to appropriate special resources for improving the infrastructure and, for example, encouraging youth exchanges with adjacent regions in the candidate countries.
We do not, however, believe that resources additional to those in the Commission proposal need to be provided.
Nor do we see any reason why small and medium-sized enterprises should be allocated additional aid to enable them to cope successfully with the competition from the candidate countries for a long time to come.
On the contrary, these enterprises should see enlargement as a positive challenge.
Given the possibility of reaching agreements with trade unions and local enterprises, the Christian Democrats do not support the report's demands for temporary transitional periods with regard to freedom to provide services and the free movement of workers.
In practice, that would create a second-class membership of the EU.
Finally, we question whether the need for aid for this total of 23 regions in Finland, Germany, Austria, Italy and Greece really is greater than the corresponding need for aid for the border regions between the candidate countries and their eastern neighbours.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 13 June 2002.
I would like to make a proposal: since we currently only have four items on the agenda for the topical and urgent debate and since the Rules of Procedure and common practice allow us to have five, I would suggest that we add the item on Argentina rather than replace it with another item.
Mr President, my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, would like to discuss Afghanistan and Cuba in September, provided that both points are well prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
We have a feeling that neither of these topics should be dealt with by singling out one item, but rather that this should be done thoroughly. Both topics can then be put on the agenda in September.
This applies to both Cuba and Afghanistan.
We therefore support the idea of replacing Afghanistan by Argentina.
It is proposed as a replacement, as before.
Mr President, I would just like to say that our group fully supports Mr Wurtz's proposal and wishes to add Argentina to the topical and urgent debate.
We must, of course, discuss Argentina since it is an urgent subject and urgent subjects do not always take the form of a speech.
Events have occurred that I, for example, do not see in the same way as Mr Wurtz.
Events have taken place, complaints have been made about what has happened in Afghanistan, and it is Parliament's role to discuss these and to try to clarify the situation.
I therefore feel that it is absolutely necessary to open up the debate on both Argentina and Afghanistan as soon as possible, instead of postponing this subject until September.
If, at the end of the debate, we need to put a question to the Commission or the Council, all well and good: we will continue the debate in September or October with a question to the Council and the Commission.
I do not want to open up a debate on this, as that would be against the Rules.
Mr van den Berg upholds the proposal of the Socialist Group.
I therefore put to the vote that Item 4 "Democracy in Afghanistan" should be replaced by a new item, "The crisis in Argentina".
Mr President, on a point of order, we should be celebrating the International Criminal Court, which today comes into formal existence.
Unfortunately, in the United Nations yesterday, the United States vetoed the United Nations mandate for Sfor in Bosnia, in which many EU countries are participating.
I should like to express my strongest possible objection to the operation of that veto in the Security Council, because it effectively vetoes, not only the mandate by the United Nations in relation to Sfor, but also the foreign policy of Ireland and other countries which operate in Sfor based on the UN mandate.
Ireland may therefore have to withdraw from Sfor because a UN mandate will not now exist if this veto persists.
I would ask you to convey my objections at least, if not the objections of many others in this Parliament, to this operation by the United States.
It is unbelievable that the United States is seeking to act outside international norms of law.
It is unbelievable that it wants its personnel to be free from prosecution if they are involved in human rights breaches.
It is not acceptable to this House and it should not be acceptable to the European Union.
We also have the possibility, Mr De Rossa, to discuss this on the agenda on Wednesday morning, following declarations by the Council and the Commission, but it is already clear, from the reaction in the House, what the overwhelming view is on this matter.
Mr President, on a point of order, in the early hours of last Thursday morning, a bus carrying 43 school children from Largs Academy in Ayrshire, Scotland, was involved in a tragic accident near the French village of Bierre-les-Semur, near Dijon in Burgundy.
Sadly, a 15-year-old girl, Katherine Fish, was killed.
One of the teachers accompanying the party lost an arm. Several pupils were seriously injured and are still undergoing treatment in hospital in Semur-en-Auxios and Dijon.
Those who were less seriously injured have now been flown home to Scotland on a specially chartered plane.
I am sure that the other MEPs from Scotland would wish to join me in expressing our deep shock at this tragic accident and our great debt of gratitude to the Mayor of Bierre-les-Semur, Michel Neugnot, and to the emergency services, medical staff and residents of that area.
They acted with enormous concern, sympathy and humanity in caring for these pupils and teachers in the aftermath of the accident and in supporting the many parents from Scotland who rushed to be with their children.
The people of Scotland were deeply touched by the kindness and decency of these good people, many of whom volunteered to provide help and comfort to the crash victims.
I hope this House will join with me in thanking sincerely all those who opened their hearts to the courageous pupils who were involved in that accident.
We wish those who were injured a speedy recovery and send our deepest sympathy to the parents and relatives of Katherine Fish.
Mr President, as I have already requested of you in writing, the Council must, as a matter of urgency, provide a full explanation of the serious events that involved hundreds of Portuguese citizens, including delegations of Portuguese political parties and members of parliament, who were trying to go to the demonstration due to take place on 22 June, in Seville, during the European Council and who were prevented from crossing the border between Portugal and Spain, with some of them even being subjected to violence by the Spanish police and having photographic and audiovisual equipment confiscated.
Since such occurrences constitute a flagrant breach of fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees, not least the right to demonstrate and the right of assembly, it must be clarified who was responsible for these actions and what were the reasons for them so that such practices are not repeated in future.
We must also clarify whether freedom of movement ,the right to demonstrate and the right of assembly are now going to be undermined whenever European summits are held. If this were the case, it would constitute a serious threat to democracy and an unacceptable restriction on the right to protest and to express one's indignation.
The Portuguese parliament has already stated its position on this matter, because members of the national parliament were affected by this situation.
I therefore ask you, Mr President, to obtain a full explanation from the Council about these serious events at the end of the Spanish Presidency.
Mr President, I rise in order to express my agreement with the comments by Mrs Figueiredo and to endorse her request to the Council and the Commission for explanations about the serious incidents that took place on the border between Portugal and Spain.
We must condemn these incidents and draw the necessary conclusions from them.
They have upset many people in Portugal and have caused a political storm, and this House cannot remain indifferent to what has occurred in a Member State of the European Union.
The right to demonstrate and the freedom of movement are constituent rights of European citizenship and cannot be breached without powerful reasons for doing so and without this House stating its position and protesting.
Mr President, naturally I agree with the principles expressed here by my fellow MEPs, but I would like to point out - and they probably know this - that your compatriot, Commissioner Vitorino, has already stated publicly, via a note, that there has been no infringement of the Schengen principle in these incidents, and furthermore the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already apologised to the people affected.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week, you all received a communication from the Quaestors saying that, as a result of a judicial statement by the French court, drivers' services will be very limited in Strasbourg this week, and we can only use our own drivers, and not the hired taxis that we always use.
When we began our current term of office in 1999, the French government said that it wanted to do everything in its power to make our lives more comfortable here in Strasbourg.
Well, first of all, a great many flights from the capitals to Strasbourg have been scrapped.
Secondly, it is no longer possible to transport hot water in this Parliament and we are now also being faced with a car shortage.
What more could the French government do to make our lives here unbearable?
I would therefore suggest that only those Members who vote against Strasbourg should still be allowed to use Parliamentary cars.
To try to reassure you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Parliament has arranged for an improvised service until the necessary changes take place in French regulations.
For very fit Members like yourself, we have doubled the pool of bicycles available to Members in the course of the week.
Mr President, with regard to the comments on the International Criminal Court, I am pleased to see that my fellow Members are taking such a lively interest in this subject.
That said, I do not think we should use this opportunity to indulge in anti-American rhetoric.
The statute of the International Criminal Court is based on the principle of complementarity, which does not therefore apply to American troops.
Nevertheless, this is a fundamental problem, and I think that Parliament must revisit this problem, because we must convince the United States.
Without the United States, the Court would not be a genuinely international Court.
Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to speak briefly about the American position on the International Criminal Court.
We should be grateful to our American allies for the enormous contribution they have made to peace-keeping operations in Europe.
We should recognise, as America recognises, that one of the primary functions of the nation state is to protect the rights of its citizens in its own courts and we should respect the Americans' view that their ability to exercise that responsibility would be prejudiced if they allowed their soldiers or other American citizens to appear before that court.
Mr President, as you must know, a lot of exciting things are happening in Cuba right now.
There is a major referendum project and calls for there to be a vote on introducing democracy.
Fidel Castro's response to this has been to make socialism an inescapable part of the constitution, something which is a very serious matter.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has arranged a meeting for Thursday in this building.
We have invited four liberal friends from Cuba who are working entirely peacefully on issues of democratisation.
The Cuban Government has, however, denied them permission to travel.
They are therefore invited by the European Parliament but are not allowed to leave Cuba, something I find deeply disquieting.
I hope that you can perhaps protest about their treatment to the Cuban authorities.
Mr President, every day brings fresh evidence of the barbaric behaviour on the part of the state of Israel.
The latest operation to annihilate the Palestinians, by murdering civilians, segregating the people and flattening the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority in Hebron, in which fifteen people were killed, is paralleled by unacceptable intervention in a effort to overturn the Palestinian leadership.
The objective of Israel and those who support it is clearly to wipe out the Palestinian Authority, or replace it with some sort of vehicle which kow-tows to international imperialism, and to re-occupy the whole of Palestine.
Once again we condemn the policy of genocide being pursued against the Palestinians by Israel and reiterate that the only reason behind the violence in the area is the Israeli occupation.
We categorically condemn the attacks on the Palestinian Authority and defend the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to select their own leaders.
Finally, we condemn the attitude of the European Union which, by sitting squarely on the fence, is basically supporting Israel's barbaric behaviour.
Mr President, I would like to inform you that, with regard to the motion signed by 10% of the Members on the violation of the rule of law and democracy in Italy, which was submitted on 18 April 2002, the Secretary-General decided, after 42 days, to reject the motion on grounds of form.
This resolution was submitted on 20 June 2002.
As I have informed the group chairmen, as of 5 p.m. today I have started a hunger strike and, as of tomorrow, I will refuse liquids as well, to ensure that, in view of the seriousness of the accusation, the motion is included on the agenda of the forthcoming Conference of Presidents on 4 July.
When a Member State is accused of violating the rule of law and democracy, some sort of political response is necessary. Smug, indifferent bureaucracy is unacceptable.
Mr President, on a point of order, I too would like to distance myself along with my colleague, Roger Helmer, from Mr De Rossa's comments regarding the International Criminal Court and the fact that today it became operational in The Hague.
The Rome Statute is flawed, as it would allow political mischief against American troops and political leaders.
It would make peace and reconciliation much more difficult, as no longer could guerrilla leaders or dictators be given any kind of guarantee or immunity from prosecution after a peace and reconciliation process.
It is interesting that only some 70 countries have signed the Rome Statute.
Russia and China - and nobody has criticised Russia and China on the other side of the House - have also refused to sign the statute for good reasons.
Surely, ad hoc tribunals such as those in former Yugoslavia or Rwanda are a much better solution.
The next item is the report (A5-0245/2002) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for waiver of the immunity of Efstratios Korakas (2001/2230(IMM)).
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask your understanding for my not making use of all the five minutes available to me.
I do not think it is worth it in a case like this one, in which we are dealing with something relatively trifling.
Let me tell you at the very outset that the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends, at my suggestion and by a very large majority, that immunity should not be waived in this case, in which the honourable Member concerned is accused by the Public Prosecution Service in Athens of having used his position as an MEP to exert influence on his female companion and induce her to make defamatory statements about her former husband.
The Greek State Prosecution Service made explicit reference to the honourable Member's position as an MEP when it overruled the Athens Public Prosecution Service's rejection of the original application for criminal proceedings.
Let me refer to the report in saying that the assertion made by the plaintiff - that is, the ex-husband, who laid the original charges - appears to stand up, as the copy of the judgment submitted to us - the reference number of which eludes me - contains evidence that he did in any case, even bearing in mind his position as an MEP and the consequent status that position gave him, give at least moral support to the offence of defamation.
Under normal circumstances, we in the Committee treat a case of this sort on the assumption that we are dealing with a case of what is termed fumus persecutionis, which means that the possibility cannot be excluded that the prosecuting authority, in this case the Greek State Prosecution Service, is acting against one of our colleagues because he is an MEP.
It was in this perspective that the great majority of the Legal Affairs Committee took the view that immunity should not be waived in this case.
I ask the House to come to a similar decision and vote tomorrow against waiving Mr Korakas' immunity.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0191/2002) by Gilles Savary, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a transparent system of harmonised rules for restrictions on heavy goods vehicles involved in international transport on designated roads (COM(2000) 759 - C5-0679/2000 - 1998/0096(COD)).
Mr President, I should like to take the place of the rapporteur in this matter.
As we all know how difficult it is to reach Strasbourg, we understand all too well when our French fellow MEPs have difficulties with this too.
The free movement of goods is one of the European Union's four basic freedoms.
In principle, driving bans, in whatever form, constitute an infringement of this freedom.
In both the EU's core countries, France and Germany, HGV traffic at weekends on through roads is a very sensitive issue for the local people, whose objections we take very seriously.
On the other hand, it has to be recognised that HGV traffic ensures that, in our complex society, products and foodstuffs arrive on time.
Whilst taking the sensitivities into consideration, we need to try to find a viable solution for all parties concerned subject to these pre-conditions.
Along with the European Commission, we believe that we have found this solution in the report by Mr Savary who deserves all credit for this.
Nobody needs to cut down the current weekend driving bans by even one minute.
Mr Ferber - it would be nice if Mr Ferber, too, were paying attention - nobody needs to cut down the current weekend driving bans by even one minute.
We only want to make the bans predictable, thus allowing transport and logistics experts to schedule their journeys in good time and to consult clients about possible different rates of delivery.
At the moment, the increasing number of uncoordinated new driving bans is a nightmare for the sector.
We are trying to solve this by imposing notification duty in respect of new driving bans to the European Commission under the said conditions.
This is therefore not about harmonising driving times.
We only want to guard each other from surprises.
National bank holidays will not be harmonised either. All bank holidays that are already subject to a driving ban can simply remain intact.
Consequently, the Commission proposal to reach a kind of minimum regulation of harmonised conditions for new driving restrictions deserves our support.
It is hoped that this revised proposal will also appeal to opponents of European interference in respect of driving bans.
After all, the regulation only applies to the TEN roads.
For all other roads, the Member States can determine themselves whether they wish to introduce driving bans.
Most amendments that have been tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism form a constructive addition to the Commission proposal.
A European information system, for example, is of major importance to the European transport sector.
In addition, Parliament has tabled amendments that should guarantee good parking and sanitary facilities for drivers who are unable to return home for an entire weekend and are forced to spend that time at a lorry park.
The social conditions which drivers face as a result of driving bans can rightly be termed tragic.
A whole raft of amendments has been tabled to expand the list of derogations.
My group will be rejecting all expansions.
I personally have to say that I will be voting in favour of Amendment No 21, which pertains to the transport of flowers, although my group will, unfortunately, be voting against it.
This will, in fact, hardly affect the driving ban.
Finally, I should like to point out that Amendments Nos 4 and 13 jeopardise the directive, to say the least.
Thanks to these amendments, Member States can determine at their own discretion whether or not they wish to impose driving bans, rather than via comitology within the European Commission, as has hitherto been the case.
These amendments, therefore, undermine the entire proposal.
This is why I should like to urge this House to vote against these amendments, as well as against Amendment No 12.
In addition, the amendment by Mr Ferber and others will be adopted by my group this time round.
We voted in favour of it in the committee.
Mr President, I apologise for my late arrival.
I thought that I was scheduled to speak later, but Mrs Peijs has been extremely professional and I thank her and I welcome the support she has given.
This was an extremely difficult report, a subject already very familiar to all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, given that it has already failed on two previous occasions.
We are faced with differences of opinion that are certainly not run-of-the-mill. They are more to do with geographical than political issues, between peripheral countries that wish to transport, and central and transit countries that wish to ban transport.
For some time, I feared that we were gravitating towards a contradictory consensus, where everyone would reject this directive: some because they wish to have freedom of movement, others because they wish to have the freedom to impose a ban.
I think that we have finally achieved - after many years of work and thanks to a proposal by the Commission, which is already a compromise - a good balance.
The only issue to be resolved between us, between those Members who wish to reject this draft directive and the others, is to establish whether we should introduce legislation in this area.
I personally believe that we should.
The current situation is totally anarchical, which creates unexpected difficulties virtually everywhere in each country and particularly at borders.
The dates for the ban only apply in seven out of nine countries: these are not co-ordinated, they give rise to illegal parking on motorways, and even sometimes in motorway service area car parks.
As a result, lorry drivers are very often away from home because of difficulties in scheduling their journeys and, lastly, the dates make it very difficult for hauliers and the transport economy to organise the logistics chain.
In my view, this legislation is valid from all viewpoints.
First of all, because I believe that we have the necessary legal bases.
It would be extremely paradoxical for European road transport, which was Europe's first transport sector to become established, now to return to being auxiliary.
The European Parliament would be sending out entirely the wrong message if it said, at the end of the day, the title relating to Transport in the EC Treaty does not apply to road transport.
How then could we dictate that, in the future, it will apply to rail, to the maritime sector and to all the other sectors?
Personally speaking, I feel it is very important for a Europe of transport to be implemented and that it leads us towards a policy which was also alluded to in the White Paper, and I think that this is a good reason.
There is, however, another, even more important reason: we currently have no legal certainty as far as bans on movement at weekends are concerned and the countries - and I say this to those who wish to reject the proposal - which would like to strengthen this proposal unilaterally would expose themselves to legal proceedings and to possible appeals based solely on the principles of the freedom of movement and non-discrimination and which would most probably pose a threat to a number of existing bans, as well as to the regulation that is commonly known as the 'strawberry regulation' of 1998, which has recently been imposed on France in order to allow lorries to travel through the Mont Blanc tunnel.
I therefore believe that this will guarantee security for all countries that have introduced bans.
Furthermore, I would reiterate that the proposal by the Commission provides a legal basis for what are currently the most stringent bans, namely those in Austria and Germany, and which ensures that the other countries can choose whether to conform to them.
The proposal is, in fact, to introduce bans similar to those in Germany and Austria with specific or not so crucial derogations, an exemption scheme in other words, and I will be giving my personal support to Mrs Peijs in calling for the introduction of an exemption for fresh flowers and horticultural products, as I believe that these are products that are difficult to keep fresh.
In short, by imposing bans on the movement of HGVs at the weekend, we are being extremely flexible as well as providing reassurance.
I live in a region where there is heavy HGV traffic, and I cannot imagine meeting my constituents to explain that the European Parliament does not wish to ban HGV traffic at weekends, which would of course be huge step backwards.
I welcome the fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has finally managed to find a modus vivendi.
Tomorrow, we must examine the 21 amendments, which were adopted in committee, and the 18 new amendments.
I do not think that we should alter the balance of the text too greatly and I myself will call for the amendments tabled by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities to be rejected, namely Amendments Nos 30, 28 and 31, which ultimately propose to return to the Commission's draft text that was rejected in 1998 and which specified 'Sundays only? - this is too little.
Secondly, I will propose that we reject Amendments Nos 22 and 23 as well, which were tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and which, conversely, and this is perfectly legitimate, would result in the Commission acquiring greater powers than anticipated in the text.
Lastly, I agree with Mrs Peijs that some amendments distort the text and that we must not therefore venture down that path.
Mr President, I would like first like to congratulate the rapporteur on taking the Commission proposal, which was a good one, and making it even better.
I also, of course, welcome Commissioner De Palacio to the House.
I nevertheless believe that some of us, myself included, were right to table a number of amendments.
The plethora of often diverse rules and regulations certainly means that the lot of HGV drivers - mainly men and rarely women - can hardly be called an easy one.
It must not, though, be forgotten that it is at the weekends that many members of the public want to have a bit more peace and quiet, and that it is at that same time that drivers want to go on trips. Hence this conflict.
I therefore think that there should be mutual solidarity between the population in general, including the haulage business, and the overwhelming majority of the public involved.
The rapporteur took the view that such solidarity could be better organised.
He was right, but planning for it is often difficult.
In my opinion, the transport industry could certainly plan convoys better if it knew about the weekend bans so that the result would not, as is often at present the case, be these periods waiting at borders, which are admittedly unpleasant.
So better information would make that improvement possible - and the Commission also has a few things planned, which the rapporteur supports.
Railways, too, certainly offer a possible alternative to some degree.
To sum up, I think there is a lot to be said in favour of leaving the status quo as it is.
There is also much to be said for doing so without coming up with a specific rule on the subject.
That is also the thinking behind some of the amendments that have been tabled.
I would nonetheless like to take this opportunity of reiterating in the clearest possible terms that the Group on whose behalf I am now speaking supports the rapporteur's basic line wholesale.
What results we achieve are a matter for democracy and for tomorrow's vote.
In any case, the rapporteur has done a good job.
Mr President, I shall read out on Mr Vermeer's behalf the speech that he wanted to deliver.
That Mr Vermeer is unable to attend today is due to the HGV traffic that is not allowed to drive on Sundays but that subsequently causes so much traffic on Mondays that he is unable to get here on time.
It is not the purpose of this proposal, namely the harmonisation of driving bans on the Trans-European Network, that is called into question by my group, but the way in which this is done.
A general expansion of weekend driving bans is a very sensitive issue in our group.
A driving ban, however useful it may be, has a drastic effect on the principle of the free movement of goods and hits the peripheral countries the hardest.
Especially for those countries, the grapes are sour because the benefits of the internal market are not always that evident to them.
The introduction of a driving ban simply causes a greater traffic flow on a limited number of days and with it, an entirely different traffic pressure, even in the so-called transit countries.
The irony of this artificial state of affairs is that the Member States on the TEN network, which often enjoys EU funding, are entitled to introduce driving restrictions without these being adequately examined by the Commission, for example, on their usefulness.
On behalf of the ELDR Group, I have therefore tabled a few amendments that should make this possible.
The aim of my amendment is to allow Member States to introduce a driving ban if this is justified on the basis of various criteria, such as the environment, safety or on social grounds.
This should prevent a proliferation of driving bans from being imposed.
I would therefore ask for your support for Amendment No 23.
As far as the rapporteur's Amendments Nos 4 and 13 are concerned, in which topographical reasons are given to justify driving bans, these are not acceptable to my group.
What exactly is a topographical reason and how is it defined?
In the explanatory note to that amendment, reference is made to the Alps.
However, the Dutch polder landscape can also form a topographical motive for a driving ban, for example.
This concept is, in my view, wide open to misuse.
Should these Amendments Nos 4 and 13 be adopted during the vote of this report tomorrow, then I, as the shadow rapporteur, will advise my group to vote against the report as a whole.
Let us leave the internal market open and not create too many restrictions or opportunities for restrictions.
Mr President, international HGV traffic is characterised by sharply contrasting interests.
If some companies had their way, it would be possible to drive without any time restrictions, during the day, at night, during weekends and on bank holidays.
This type of driving would benefit this industry which, in permanent competition with the railways and internal shipping, tries to be the fastest and the cheapest.
HGV drivers who are employees are pleased about driving-time restrictions, which aim to protect their own health, but not about compulsory waiting at uncomfortable locations.
Self-employed drivers, who are often former employees who, under pressure from their managers, have had to take over the business risk, want to drive without any time restrictions in order to be able to keep their heads above water financially.
If, on the other hand, it were up to the residents in the vicinity of through roads, HGV traffic in Europe would be kept to an absolute minimum, and it would certainly not pass through built-up areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, mountain valleys and mountain passes.
Local authorities welcome HGV traffic only to the private industrial sites, because these generate employment and income, and not through traffic, which only generates inconvenience.
There is now a plethora of measures by means of which local authorities and regions protect the environment and their Sunday rest, and try to level out dangerous peaks in traffic.
For a large majority of people, it is important for this freedom to be retained without facing unnecessary barriers to cross borders.
Mr Savary's proposals make the bans on TEN routes predictable.
However, I would prefer to see the fast transport of perishable agricultural products, to which he gives due consideration, transferred to the railways, and for that reason, I do not endorse his proposal for a derogation.
For the rest, I believe that he has struck the right balance between the different conflicting interests.
Mr President, Commissioner, we believe in the concept of the single market and in the Community principle of the free movement of people, capital, services and goods, but we also argue in favour of quality of life and the environment.
The former and the latter often come into conflict, a conflict of interests, and we therefore understand the need to apply certain restrictions to movement in order to safeguard co-existence.
In this regard, several Member States have established differing timetables and dates for restrictions, which is creating great confusion for hauliers, for the senders and receivers of cargo, as well as disturbance in the freight market in terms of distribution and supply.
All of this means that we need to seek a minimum degree of harmonisation at Community level in relation to timetables for restrictions and to this end it will firstly be essential to provide an effective information system for hauliers.
We also need reliable statistics on congestion on the Trans-European Networks, on its peak days and hours etc., and also on the ecological impact of high traffic densities, in order to better protect our environment.
Furthermore, we must take advantage of these restrictions on heavy goods traffic to ensure that drivers enjoy a minimum period of uninterrupted rest.
Furthermore, it would not be democratic for some Member States to be able to maintain their previously established restrictions indefinitely, while the new States are not allowed to introduce them.
It is only fair that this privilege should last for a limited time period.
I would finally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Savary, on the quality of his report and on having managed, after two previous failed attempts, to bring about a parliamentary debate during this plenary on regulations harmonising traffic restrictions, which are so essential to the effective operation and co-existence between the market and the people and to the environment in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time that the Commission has tried to concern itself with matters that do not actually have to be regulated at European level.
That is what is at the heart of this report, and that is what we have to grapple with.
Is today's free movement of goods disrupted by national restrictions on journeys?
I will tell you quite clearly that such is not the case, for if it were, the Commission would be entitled even now to take action against the Member States in the European Court of Justice.
It has not done so to date, and so no disruption of the free movement of goods can have occurred.
Secondly, we will never manage to harmonise Europe's public holidays.
That too is indeed part of the regulation.
I do not imagine that France, that grande nation, will ever let anyone prevent it celebrating 14 July, and we in Germany will also resist any attempt at doing away with 3 October.
What this means is that we have different rules on travel restrictions as it is, because our public holidays are different.
Thirdly, it was as long ago as 1998 that the Commission, guided by your predecessor Mr Kinnock, proposed to limit the travel ban to Sundays, and that is the direction they are actually going in.
Hence it is not on for us, when we vote today or tomorrow, to agree to the European Union being given the right to enact regulations of any kind on travel bans.
These are things that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, must not be regulated other than at the level of the Member States, nor, indeed, can they be.
That is why we have started an initiative across group and national lines and tabled an amendment to reject the Commission proposal.
I would like to ask my fellow Members of this House to vote in favour of this amendment.
The European added value in this is not self-evident.
There is no European added value, because the derogations in the proposal are such that nothing will change in real terms.
If this is all about making information available, then it goes without saying that the Commission is entitled to set up information systems as appropriate without drafting legislation.
My dear Commissioner, it is simply not enough for all the public holidays in the European Union just to be announced in the Official Journal.
If the establishment of information systems is what it is all about, then you have my entire support, but that is something the Commission can do on its own responsibility without resorting to a directive.
That is what I would ask you to do, so that the regulations prevailing in the individual Member States can be made known to everyone throughout the European Union who will be affected by them.
