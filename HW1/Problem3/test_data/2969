It gives us leverage in our efforts to obtain the removal of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad, as it ensures that EU markets remain attractive to foreign issuers.
It will benefit EU investors and issuers alike.
I am aware of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and others regarding many of these issues, but a clear roadmap has been set out.
If there is goodwill on all sides we will reach a satisfactory end, but in any event if we do not reach a satisfactory outcome then, as we say in my country, nothing is lost.
So I think that the prolongation of the time period is the correct decision for many reasons.
First, so that we give ourselves here in Europe an opportunity to see how IFRS has been implemented in the various Member States - and we will be learning in that process as well.
We have a clear commitment from our colleagues in the United States as to the roadmap and the time lines there and, all things being equal, we should reach a satisfactory conclusion.
But if we do not and if we are not satisfied, then, as I say, nothing is lost.
Worldwide more people are moving to the IFRS accounting standards which Europe adopted as from last year, so therefore it will be to our benefit.
Concerning the great question posed by Mr Radwan and others about this question of convergence and equivalence, let us see where we are in the few short years hence.
On the transparency directive, I shall deal with the point raised by Mr Skinner.
His point relates to a provision in the recital of the level 1 directive, and this recital stipulates that payments by the extractive industries should be reported.
This as such is not the subject of today's debate, but I can confirm that the Commission will monitor this issue.
Concerning the implementing measures to the transparency directive, I should also add that I understand some of the concerns expressed in relation to future developments.
In this regard, the Commission commits itself to making a declaration that will be added to the minutes of the European Securities Committee on the date of the vote on the draft implementing measures.
It should state that the Commission undertakes to re-examine the issue of the auditors' review of half-yearly financial statements once the work in relation to the international standards on auditing, currently under development, is sufficiently advanced.
The Commission will also re-examine, within two years of the final deadline for transposition, the question of the minimum content of the condensed set of half-yearly financial statements that are not prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.
The Commission also undertakes to conduct a review of how the regulated information is disseminated in practice pursuant to the obligations of the transparency directive and the future implementing directive.
This could be undertaken two years after the end of the transposition period for the implementing directive.
In this way we will ensure that the transparency directive tools are adapted to improvements in the market.
Pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received two motions for resolution.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
LIFE+ - Financing of the Natura 2000 network
The next item is
the recommendation for second reading (06284/1/2006 C6-0226/2006 on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Isler BÃ©guin)
the debate on the oral question to the Commission on financing of the NATURA 2000 framework by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety B6-0441/2006).
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the work that we have done together, because I believe that it can be said - even though, as is customary at this hour, the Chamber is not very full - that we have genuinely carried out a joint piece of work and that this report, which bears my name, could just as well bear the name of my fellow Members, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, Mrs Ries or even Mrs Lienemann, who apologises for not being able to take part in this evening's debate.
We have also produced a joint piece of work with the Commission.
Unfortunately, it is regrettable that the Council is not present, because, ultimately, our results will depend greatly on it.
I am entirely convinced that the cooperation that we have been able to put in place during this first reading and that follows on from the common position will enable us to reach a consensus with the Council and with yourself, and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to pass the results of this debate on to the Council.
Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE+ is no longer the programme that we once knew, but will indeed constitute the Union's 'environment' budget heading.
Thus, it is LIFE+ that will govern Europe's innovative policies, that will rise to the challenges, such as the fight against climate change and the efforts to rid the air and soil of pollution, that will prevent biodiversity damage and that will provide the Environment DG and the NGOs, our bio-indicators par excellence, with the means to endow the Member States' environmental policies with European added value.
In fact, as you will know, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking here about an 'impossible budget heading', given the derisory sum that the Council and the Commission have granted it.
We made an attempt, at first reading, to increase this LIFE heading, which, I must point out, does not even represent 1% of the overall budget, with the aim of bringing it into line with the policies much-publicised by the Union itself.
The debate focused back then on support for the Natura 2000 network, our flagship environmental policy.
By adding EUR 21 billion, which even the Commission felt was necessary if Natura 2000 was to be managed properly, the European Parliament sent out a strong signal to the Commission and to the Council.
We were right to do so.
Today, with the reduction in the Structural Funds budgets, a form of unbridled competition has begun in the regions, and all of our colleagues are having a change of heart.
As Natura 2000 does not specifically feature in the financial regulations, well, it will undoubtedly be environmental volunteers who produce the results. We should not get our hopes up too much, however, regarding the share that will be reserved for the protection of nature and biodiversity, despite the fact that, at the European Parliament's first reading, we were virtually unanimous in our support of an ambitious European policy.
The common position proposed to us has spectacularly ignored our warning.
Worse still, it is deviating from it in an alarming way, going so far as to grant 80% of the delegated management responsibility to the Member States, even though you did not mention this percentage in your initial proposal.
What minister would refuse such a gift?
Admittedly, we also realise that, with too few staff members, the Commission is afraid of managing multiple projects.
This is made all the more difficult by the fact that, with a reduction in the number of European officials having been announced, there remains little hope of the Environment DG strengthening its staff.
Let us make it very clear to you: this approach is not the right one because the European level remains the most relevant and most secure one for dealing with environmental issues.
We even feel that this handover of power from the Commission to the Member States is dangerous.
In our view, this initial strategy to renationalise the environmental policies is the sign of a slow disintegration of the European idea.
Each Member State demanding its initial bet would thus be free to dip into the Lisbon Strategy, and thus to become an unrivalled competitor - and we know full well that competition generally goes hand in hand with environmental damage - or to claim that sustainable development, which requires a global approach, is the opposite of such competition.
We also know the extent to which the label 'environment' serves to justify problems that destroy the environment.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the trap that we refuse to fall into because to do so would be to negate all of the successes that Europe has had in relation to the environment.
If there is one policy that can be seen, identified, recognised and appreciated by Europeans, it is indeed the one that we have succeeded in implementing on environmental protection.
We all know that LIFE must enable us to deal with emergencies and to implement policies aimed at restoring our environment.
The EUR 100 million that were extracted at the time of the financial perspective and that we are demanding, Commissioner, be allocated entirely to the environment will not be enough to achieve these aims.
Commissioner, unless you are a magician, it will be impossible for you to keep your promises with such derisory sums.
Entrusting them to the Member States therefore means running the risk of failure.
Our ambition is for the Union to remain the flagship, the global leader that takes the initiative for establishing laws to protect the planet.
That requires the Commission to be able to produce ambitious policies, to assume responsibility and control of the quality of the projects launched at Member State level and to reject any that are unsuitable.
European policy must under no circumstances compensate for the Member States' failings in relation to the environment, and, as you will understand, we are refusing to give them a blank cheque.
On the other hand, we are perfectly aware that the delay that this procedure could cause is also liable to cause delays in terms of funding.
That is why, together, we have tabled the same amendment, so as to ensure that the work done by your Environment DG continues to be funded, pending an agreement, of course.
Above all, we also want it to be possible for this work to continue and even for you to launch new projects and oversee the funding of the work done by NGOs.
We should like to make it clear in this House that, legally and financially, that is possible.
To conclude, Mr President, I would say that the ball is now in the court of the Council and of the Commission and that we are convinced that we are going to reach an agreement amongst ourselves precisely so as to ensure that this ambitious environmental policy is taken forward.
That is what our fellow citizens expect, and they encourage you in that regard.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, for her exceptional work and for her report on this proposal.
I should also like to thank Mrs GutiÃ©rrez for her very positive approach and to assure both ladies and all the Members of Parliament that the Commission will work to facilitate this approach and to achieve fast agreement with the Council.
I must stress that, since September 2004 - when the College of Commissioners adopted the Commission proposal - about one year after first reading, we have made a great deal of progress with LIFE+ and the position of the European Commission has changed significantly on several counts in comparison with its initial proposal.
I believe that the Council's common position, with which the Commission agrees to a large extent, satisfies many of Parliament's basic demands.
The draft regulation now includes a section relating to nature and biodiversity.
LIFE+ will be able to fund measures and activities for exchanges of opinions and best practices or demonstration projects, including those relating to the management and designation of Natura 2000 sites and guidelines for habitats and birds.
The percentage of LIFE+ relating to the management of nature is large.
At least 40% of the resources will be made available for expenditure in this sector.
I should like to stress that this percentage is a minimum limit and that the Member States may spend a greater percentage if they so wish.
As far as the question of funding for Natura 2000 is concerned, the Commission has secured funding opportunities through the Structural Funds, the Fisheries Fund and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
The Commission may, of course, encourage spending on Natura 2000; however, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States have the jurisdiction and discretion to decide on the extent to which they wish to make use of these funding opportunities.
The Commission, for its part, will do what it can to ensure the Member States make use of the funding opportunities whenever possible.
The opinion of the Directorate General of the Environment is always sought before strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes for the Structural Funds and rural development programmes submitted by the Member States are approved.
I repeat that one of our top priorities is to safeguard suitable funding for Natura 2000 and that is why I particularly value Parliament's support on this issue.
However, the most important subject of debate this evening is the method of implementation of the programme.
According to the common position, 80% of funding for LIFE+ is to be made available to the Member States.
I consider that Parliament's preference for maintaining central management of the programme to be an indication of its confidence in the Commission.
However, this choice, as I emphasised earlier, requires more human resources.
That is why the method proposed in the common position is preferable.
First, it is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, granting the greatest possible flexibility in order to cover the various requirements of the Member States.
Secondly, it ensures that all the countries receive a minimum percentage of the funding.
Within the framework of the current LIFE III system, they often do not receive any money.
Thirdly, it is transparent and controlled and safeguards the maintenance of added value for the European Union.
As you know, delegated management is at the epicentre of the Commission proposal.
The Member States are relying on it and are already preparing their draft programmes.
That is why the Commission cannot accept the various amendments deleting all references to delegated management.
Unfortunately, the outcome of the informal meetings between Parliament, the Council and the Commission following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 14 September did not enable us to make significant steps towards achieving agreement as regards delegated management.
Nonetheless, despite the differences, we are all in favour of the LIFE+ programme and of its being applied as soon as possible, so that funds can be disbursed and there is no delay in the execution of the programmes.
The Member States have over two billion euros for the LIFE+ programme.
A way needs to be found so that this money is disbursed as quickly as possible, even if this means compromise on all sides.
We must therefore continue to work together to find practical solutions, especially as regards the method of implementing LIFE+.
Within this framework, we shall make every possible effort to bring about a compromise between the Council and Parliament and we shall intermediate in order to facilitate an agreement.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Within the framework of the LIFE III programme, running since 2000, we have spent more than EUR 950 million on various environmental protection programmes for the successful completion of countless local, regional and cross-border projects.
Even more importantly, it is precisely these projects which have brought the Union into close proximity to ordinary people, and which contribute most directly to improving the living conditions of EU citizens.
These are important considerations at a time when the popularity of the European Union is at an all-time low.
The status of LIFE+, and within it of the Natura 2000 programme, gives cause for concern and raises at least two significant questions.
The first is the fact that it is already clear that no timely decision will be taken regarding the new programme, and, as a result, we will not be able to launch the environmental protection programmes next January, as planned.
In my view, this is a serious problem.
Therefore, I propose that we follow the solution adopted in 2004, when a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council extended the LIFE III programme, which was then expiring, for two more years with an additional budget of EUR 317 million.
I propose that we now take a decision that will keep the LIFE programme, which is due to expire in 2006, in force until the new regulation has been accepted.
The second problematic area is the Council's proposal to delegate 80% of the funds to be managed by the Member States.
In my view, this is contrary to the logic and the practice followed hitherto, according to which environmental protection, by virtue of its cross-border nature, calls for a supranational approach.
For this reason, I personally can only support proposals that leave a greater proportion of the power to decide on the funds available within the competence of the Commission and of Parliament than does the present proposal.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, please accept Mrs Lienemann's sincere apologies for being unable to attend this evening, as you are all aware of her commitment to this matter.
It is, however, with the same pleasure and the same convictions that I take her place.
I would like to remind you of all the support that our group offers to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin's report and to pay tribute to the agreement reached by our political groups on an ambitious strategy to consolidate the only direct financial instrument intended for European environment policies.
It should also be emphasised that it is our Parliament that obtained additional budgetary credits for LIFE, although well below our initial aims.
Today, it is once again MEPs who are calling for strengthened resources to support the implementation of the Natura Directive.
An effort has been made, undoubtedly insufficient, but obtained in a tight budgetary situation within which we must work.
Our disagreements, as matters stand with this issue, concern the method chosen for financing activities.
LIFE is an exemplary European instrument. It has proved itself, and we cannot accept that this policy should be renationalised, as planned, with the management of 80% of its budget delegated to the Member States.
The European Union must not content itself with handing out money, it must hold the reins of this environmental policy.
At a time when the European idea needs to be safeguarded, and given that this is a policy largely supported by EU citizens, it is unacceptable to undermine the European dynamic in this way.
Our credibility in the eyes of Europeans is at stake following the statements in the future sustainable development strategy.
Moreover, LIFE must retain its exemplary status, which is founded on the choice of innovative and reproducible projects.
It is clear that we must guarantee Member States the level of funding that they expect, while requiring that the selection of projects is informed by a double rationale: one involving the European dimension and meaningful environmental practice.
Our group supports Mrs Haug's amendment calling on the Commission to guarantee continued funding for programmes now under way.
Indeed, we cannot accept that NGOs and other parties involved in LIFE should be penalised.
Mr President, twelve months ago, together with our rapporteur Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, we deplored this veritable gift made by the Commission.
I am referring to a subject on which a great deal has been said already: the delegation of environmental policies to the Member States, which are to manage up to 80% of the LIFE+ budget.
In this regard, I share our rapporteur's regret that, during our informal discussions with the Finnish Presidency, the latter did not take a firm step in the direction of meeting public concern for a better environment and quality of life.
It is clear that a solution must be found to this institutional disagreement and, in the meantime, the principle of providing continued funding for Community environment policy must, of course, stand. This is the aim of our Amendment 32.
Like my fellow Members, I therefore question this 'blank cheque' offered to the Member States on a plate.
Why renationalise what Europe as such does so well, even with so very few resources, as has already been said: namely, protecting biodiversity and rare species?
I would point out some of the successes achieved in the areas of nature, the environment and third countries since LIFE was first set up, in 1992.
In my own country, Belgium, no fewer than 120 biodiversity protection projects have been cofinanced by the European Union.
It is thanks to LIFE and the proper overall functioning of Natura 2000 that 20% of Belgium territory is now classified as a special nature protection area.
Furthermore, last Thursday, the Commission unveiled 75 environmental projects that will benefit from the Union's support - support totalling EUR 136 million thanks to the LIFE programme. To return to Belgium, I am delighted that the restoration of the Hautes Fagnes plateau covering more than 4 500 hectares in the beautiful Ardennes region is one of the projects accepted.
Should we see this as a good omen?
I hope so because, in championing Europe in terms of its environment, we are also providing for the health and well-being of future generations. I am sure, moreover, that, as I have emphasised, Europe has everything to gain by committing itself wholeheartedly, as Europe, to this fight to preserve the natural world and biodiversity.
To conclude, Mr President, this is a fight that, as has been said and as it is important to emphasise, has transcended political divides throughout the debate.
The fact that we have all rallied strongly around our rapporteur - whom I would like to thank and congratulate once again - is the best proof of this today.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his question.
Last year, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's report on the financing of Natura 2000.
In that report, we expressed concern about the willingness of the Member States and of the Commission to take this issue seriously.
There will be plenty of voices speaking out for the natural world when it is time for headline speeches.
Just think how solemn the Heads of State or Government were in Gothenburg in 2001 in their assurances that Natura 2000 would be implemented.
Yet, for all that, everything was forgotten when it came to the budget being adopted, when the separate budget heading for Natura 2000 was rejected point blank.
Now it will be interesting to see whether those promises are recalled when the agricultural lobbyists again try to ensure that all the subsidies, including the rural development funds, go to large-scale agriculture and to industry.
The Commission will have to be stricter in this area.
The slackness and lack of supervision that have been the case up to now are on the point of having disastrous consequences, first and foremost for the natural world, but also for the reputation of the EU, as many of my fellow MEPs have mentioned today.
For many people, the protection of nature and the environment is one of the pivotal benefits of the EU.
We politicians, when we have had to defend and expound upon the necessity of European cooperation, have continually made reference to what the EU can do in this area.
At present, however, many experience an indifference on the part of the EU in respect of those values that cannot quickly be converted into money.
Rapid action needs to be taken if our good name is to be rescued.
The Commission should make it a condition for the payment of, in particular, rural development funds that the Member States put forward plans and also appropriate sufficient resources to Natura 2000.
It should remember also to remind agriculturalists that the rural development funds do not constitute agriculturalists' own private money.
Natura 2000 must receive its share, and without agriculture receiving compensation for this.
Agriculture should bear its share of responsibility for the health and diversity of nature.
This would be good news for everyone in rural areas.
There are splendid opportunities for money-making in the development of Natura 2000.
We know, for example, that approximately a quarter of a million people are engaged in the protection of nature, while the potential in the tourism sector is greater still.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her exceptional report and her strong position as regards the demands of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in connection with LIFE+.
A key point is to secure adequate resources for the Natura 2000 programme.
That is why I heartily support the call for another EUR 50 billion to be added to the LIFE+ budget.
If we leave the 50 million in the margin, with just one political commitment, as called for by the Council, we shall have no clear guarantee.
I also support the call by the Committee on the Environment for 55% of LIFE+ to be allocated to nature and biodiversity, which are issues of critical importance in the effort to achieve the corresponding objective of the European Union.
In all events, the additional EUR 100 million agreed within the framework of the financial perspective should be committed to above the 40% proposed by the Council.
If the percentage remains 40%, this essentially will mean a proportional reduction in the corresponding funding for biodiversity in comparison with the previous financial perspective and that is unacceptable.
Finally, I agree with the rapporteur, who has reacted to the Commission's proposal to grant 80% of resources to the Member States, thereby giving them a blank cheque.
The resources for LIFE+ are not there for the Member States to plug financial gaps, but to promote joint European programmes.
Commissioner, you know full well that, in the country we both come from, money often goes to cover wages rather than to protect the Natura 2000 network.
We want a strong European policy; all of us in the European Parliament want more Europe for environmental protection.
If the Commission wants the same, then why does it not stand up for it against the Council?
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I would tend to support the 80% management of LIFE by Member States.
This would ensure a much better and fairer spread of funds across the EU and across the many different types of environment within the EU.
It would bring more local knowledge to the project selection process and make public awareness easier to achieve.
I have only one hesitation as an Irish MEP: I believe that the second half of the second pillar of LIFE - implementation of existing environmental policy - is critical.
This is a priority, because there is no point in funding new policies and projects when we have not learned to implement the standards we have already imposed on ourselves.
Frankly, this is a problem in my home country, when it comes to industry.
My Member State's Environmental Protection Agency seems to be very reluctant to force the same compliance on industry as it does on the public.
In my willingness to support management of LIFE+ at Member-State level, I would still like to see a reasonable level of scrutiny to ensure that the projects selected prioritise efforts to improve compliance by industry with EU environmental law.
(PL) Mr President, a number of amendments were proposed during the first reading of the LIFE+ Regulation.
It was unanimously agreed that this financial instrument fails to meet expectations in the area of environmental protection.
The main difficulty concerned the restriction of financial resources for implementation of all the policies in this area.
The financial understandings with the Council and the Commission were not transferred to the environmental protection budget for the next seven years.
In my view, the difference of approach between Mrs Sinnott and most of the other Members is rather abstract in nature.
My conscience would be much easier if I voted in favour of this report in the certainty that the resources allocated to the various countries will be devoted to environmental projects.
The problem is that the funds are being spent on staff and not on environmental projects.
I believe this is the reason why we really are compelled to intervene in some way.
To conclude, I should like to say as an aside that at a time of crisis concerning our vision of the Europe of the future, and of scepticism about European institutions, the environment could serve as a true common point of reference for many citizens of European Union Member States.
(FR) Commissioner, during the first reading, our message concerned the limited funds allocated to LIFE+.
Today, the European Parliament is interested in sending a clear message to the Council and the Commission.
Under no circumstances can we accept that 80% of the credits for LIFE+ should be delegated to the Member States for management by national agencies.
Why is this unacceptable?
It is because environmental policy is one of the European policies most highly regarded by Europeans and seen by them as being one of the most transparent.
One wonders for what possible reason the Commission should want to abandon this opportunity to show people the direct impact of a Community policy on their everyday lives.
There is no sense in this, particularly at a time when we are being criticised for a lack of communication with citizens.
LIFE+ is an indispensable financial instrument for all our environmental policies.
Yet there is such inconsistency.
In session after session we are voting for strong environmental commitments in the framework of sustainable development, while LIFE+ is being whittled away.
In this too, moreover, we are not in agreement with the Council.
Handing over responsibility for 80% of the funding to the Member States means taking the risk of causing all our commitments to fail and seeing this funding diverted from its initial objective.
Yes, Commissioner, we are all in favour of LIFE+, but not in the guise that you are proposing.
We must retain a centralised model managed by the Commission, with projects selected on the basis of their merits and the added value they will bring.
As you are well aware, we shall otherwise face the watering down of our environmental policy.
Renationalisation is not the right solution.
We must use these resources not to pay civil servants but to launch and fund projects.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the nationalisation of LIFE from the outset contradicts the application of this environmental tool to date
The proposal to delegate the management of 80% of the admittedly inadequate budget for LIFE+ to the Member States would mean that all the European added value would be lost and, most importantly, that the Member States would be given carte blanche to - possibly - follow national objectives.
We are therefore calling for efficient and transparent management under the control of the European Commission of important programmes with added European value.
Finally, if no agreement is reached, I consider it especially important that we support the common proposal, on the basis of which it will be possible to fund activities which will have to be brought under the programme in question from 2007 onwards.
I should like to congratulate Mrs BÃ©guin on her exceptionally positive report.
Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, that during the first reading Parliament significantly improved the Commission's proposal on LIFE+, particularly with respect to the amount to be included for the funding of Natura 2000.
I therefore welcome Amendment 18, which restates the sum of EUR 100 million agreed during negotiations on the financial perspective.
There are, however, some reasons why I am not enthusiastic about Amendment 10, which, for the new Member States, deletes the very important second paragraph of Article 6 of the Council's common position.
I am afraid that centralised allocation of funding entirely through the projects favours old Member States that are more familiar with the procedures.
It is common knowledge that institutions of the new Member States are not yet sufficiently prepared to compete with their projects on an equal footing.
The Commission's proposal that 80% of funding should be allocated to the Member States rectifies this objective initial disadvantage, and detailed eligibility criteria should ensure European added value of funding.
Seen from this angle, I do not consider it renationalisation.
With regard to the implementation, I would not object to the Council's solution to the problem.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you have now often enough heard it said that all of us are opposed to this European programme being handed back to the Member States.
It should remain European.
Here in this House, we talk about environmental programmes and how to fund them, but we should consider well the way in which we do this.
It is not acceptable that the habitat programme or the Birds Directive should be used in the Member States to do things that actually go against this House's normal understanding of things.
Environmental policy should indeed be treated as having the value it does, but frogs are not meant to enjoy more protection than do human beings, and one function of the Commission and of its offices is to maintain the proper sense of proportion in this respect.
What matters is that we, here in this House, should join with you in the Commission in putting into effect programmes that add European value.
This must not be about a mere transfer of funds, that is to say giving Member States back their money and leaving it to them what becomes of it.
Nor is it acceptable that these funds should be used to finance NGOs with whose background and connections we are not familiar.
We must, then, take care that European taxpayers' money is used properly.
(DE) Mr President, the second reading of the financial instrument for the environment shows us once more that the Financial Perspective for the period from 2007 to 2013 does not adequately enable the EU to perform its functions as regards the environment, and, indeed, much else besides.
The fact that we are in such a problematic financial position makes it important that we should, tomorrow, give our rapporteur support in the shape of a massive majority.
The Commission may well be indicating its willingness to compromise, but we know that the negotiations will be extremely tough, for the amendments that the Commission has this evening declared itself unable to accept are at the very heart of this House's position.
As has already been said, handing this programme back to the Member States would imperil European environmental policy and the value that Europe adds to it, and it is for that reason that I support all the rapporteur's amendments to delete, for they take us several steps in the right direction.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the determined work by the rapporteur has already produced substantial results at first reading.
Nevertheless, the resources allocated for LIFE+ for the 2007-2013 period are not sufficient to meet the environmental challenges of the coming years and we therefore risk jeopardising the positive work that has been achieved thus far.
For this reason, it is particularly important to support the rapporteur's Amendment 3, in order to be able to guarantee more adequate funding, at least after the 2008-2009 review of the Financial Framework, with a view to adapting LIFE to the necessary changes and ensuring a high level of Community cofinancing.
Furthermore, I would like to underline the significance of the destination of European environment funds, in that they should not be used to make up the financial deficits of the Member States - it has in fact been pointed out many times that they are often used to pay civil servants - but to implement European projects that put the Gothenburg Sustainable Development Strategy into practice.
Finally, I am glad of the fact that the new LIFE+ programme pays greater attention to the issue of energy efficiency, lending financial support to new technologies, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to involve civil society to a greater extent in the development phase of both multiannual programmes and annual national programmes.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for their very positive contributions and for the acknowledgement that the initial proposal - adopted by the Commission in September 2004, with the help of Parliament - has been improved considerably.
What we have to strive for is a balanced solution.
In this respect, I will try to facilitate an agreement between the Council and Parliament.
With regard to the amendments, I am aware of 31 amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a further amendment introduced since last week.
The late amendment, similar to what happened in the budget debate, encourages me to believe that Parliament wishes to help find a solution to the funding gap that the late adoption of LIFE+ will create.
While the budget question will ultimately be solved by the budgetary authority, the Commission will do all it can to facilitate an agreement that, with your support, will provide funds to DG Environment throughout 2007.
Turning now to the 31 amendments on LIFE+, I will divide them into four distinct blocks.
Firstly, on the delivery method, the Commission cannot accept the group of amendments opposing delegated programme management.
Secondly, on allocation of funds, the budget, ring-fencing etc., Parliament has tabled an amendment aiming at adding the whole EUR 100 million extra to the LIFE+ instrument.
If Parliament and the Council were in agreement to allocate that amount to the LIFE+ programme, I would welcome the opportunity to see the programme expanded.
Parliament also calls for at least 55% of LIFE+ funds to be allocated to the nature and biodiversity component.
The Commission cannot accept this amendment, since it would reduce the flexibility needed by several Member States to tackle other pressing environmental concerns.
The 40% in the common position is a minimum and nothing prevents Member States spending double that figure on nature and biodiversity if they so wish and can justify it.
Thirdly, with regard to comitology issues, the amendments seeking greater involvement by Parliament during the various phases of programming and introducing the regulatory procedure with scrutiny would be acceptable in principle.
Lastly, with regard to a series of amendments seeking clarification, greater transparency, etc., on questions such as the application of the Aarhus Convention, cross-border projects, specific reference to the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the role of the Commission in supporting integration, etc., my view is that these amendments could be acceptable to the Commission in principle, subject to some drafting changes.
I should like to repeat what I said earlier, namely that we should continue working together to find practical solutions, especially on the implementation method for LIFE+.
In addition, together we need to solve the 2007 funding gap.
I am heartened by Parliament's good wishes in that respect.
We need a funding instrument for the environment in order to spend our EUR 2 billion budget.
I am therefore willing to help find a practical compromise between the Council and Parliament on these issues and I am willing to help facilitate such an agreement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Community civil protection mechanism (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism (recast) C6-0076/2006.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, first I wish to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, on drafting an exceptional report.
The Commission proposal to recast the 2001 Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism takes account of the demand by both the European Parliament and the Council for resources and facilities to be strengthened in the field of civil protection in Europe.
Its objective is to strengthen the mechanism with the experience acquired from previous emergency situations.
It provides a basis for the further development of cooperation in the field of civil protection by improving and strengthening the existing project in this sector and by launching new activities.
We must highlight two innovations which we are proposing: funding for the cost of hiring equipment and of hiring transport means.
We often face situations in which aid is available but there are no suitable means for taking it to the scene of the disaster.
As a result, this aid either arrives late or does not arrive at all.
In the case of emergencies which affect several European countries at once, such as, for example, forest fires in summer, floods in spring and possible simultaneous terrorist threats throughout Europe, the Member States may find it hard to provide help to other Member States, due to their own needs.
That is why the Commission proposed that a safety net be created at Community level, so that we have the facility to hire the necessary transport means and equipment.
The Commission, of course, knows that the European Parliament understands the importance of the benefit which will accrue from the reforms in question and expresses its thanks for the support which it has already given to the proposed new funding mechanism.
As emphasised in the Barnier report, the result of the enhanced cooperation in the field of civil protection will be better protection, both for the citizens of the European Union and for the inhabitants of third countries.
It will ensure that the Community as a whole can offer more coordinated and more effective and more prompt aid to any country affected by a major disaster.
I should remind you here that the proposal to hire transport means and equipment was part of the proposal for the new funding mechanism on which Parliament formulated its opinion earlier this year.
The negotiations which followed in the Council proved to be very difficult.
That is why we are calling on all the members of the European Parliament who wish to advance this proposal to do what they can at national level to support it; otherwise we shall not be able to achieve the enhanced cooperation in the field of civil protection called for by Parliament.
Mr President, over recent years we have experienced a tsunami, hurricane Katrina and earthquakes in Pakistan and Indonesia with high death tolls, while in the European Union the Member States have frequently faced major floods and storms, forest fires, disasters at sea and industrial accidents.
The repercussions of these tragic events are huge not only in terms of human lives, but also to the economy.
That is why the citizens of the European Union are rightly calling for a more effective approach.
Improving the European Union's ability to respond to emergency situations is a priority for the European Parliament.
That is why we are today debating ways of improving the Community civil protection mechanism.
During the preparation of the committee proposal we are debating, various alternative proposals were examined.
One of them was recast, which the Commission chose and which is the least ambitious choice, because it introduces a limited number of improvements to the Council decision governing the civil protection mechanism.
Could the Commission therefore tell me how it arrived at this choice, the least ambitious choice, despite the repeated announcements by the European Council and the resolutions by the European Parliament on greater and stronger development of the Community civil protection mechanism?
The main weaknesses identified in the recast proposal tabled by the Commission relate, firstly, to the transportation of rescue teams and equipment.
Today every Member State bears responsibility for organising the transportation of its own civil protection aid.
However, this shortcoming undermines the effectiveness of European aid.
In 2005 alone, in five emergencies, Member States were unable to send experts and equipment, because they did not have the means to transport aid where it was needed.
I think that the Commission needs to do more to address this problem.
The second weakness relates to the development of a European rapid response capability.
Today, Community civil protection aid is provided by the Member States on a voluntary basis.
This does not add up to the European rapid response capability demanded by the European Parliament.
In its communication on 25 April, the Commission proposed the creation of special standby modules which would be mobilised on request by the competent European authority.
I ask you, why did the Commission not include its own proposal in the recast?
The third problem relates to early warning.
The ability of the European Commission to respond to natural disasters also depends upon the existence of early warning systems.
The recast states that the Monitoring and Information Centre in Brussels should be linked to the systems of the Member States and international organisations.
That is good, but it is not enough because, immediately after the earthquake caused by the tsunami, the governments learned, but the citizens never learned.
That is why a suitable legal basis must be set up within the framework of the Council decision, so that early warning systems can be developed within the framework of the mechanism.
The fourth weakness concerns the coordination of interventions in third countries.
In this sector also more work needs to be done, because there is a blatant lack of coordination.
Some Member States work constantly through the Community mechanism, some Member States prefer to work with the United Nations, some Member States work with both and some Member States with neither.
This fragmentation and lack of coordination completely contradict the ambitious announcements by the European Council.
As rapporteur, together with the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups, we tabled amendments which were approved almost unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
In brief, they relate to information for citizens, to the integration of civil protection measures in education programmes and advertising campaigns, to land management and use, in order to strengthen prevention, to the definitions of terms based on the agreed international terminology, to the inclusion of public health and to the use of military means on an auxiliary and voluntary basis.
Finally, I should like to mention the Barnier report on the creation of Europe Aid.
In January 2006, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council asked Michel Barnier to examine the role of the European Union in dealing with crises.
It turned out to be a very detailed report with interesting proposals.
Unfortunately, however, both the Commission and the Council simply welcomed the report as an important contribution and did nothing about it.
I should like the Commissioner to tell me how the Commission intends to make use of the Barnier report.
The price of the lack of a unified and effective Europe when it comes to crisis management is very high, which is why we need to proceed more effectively and with greater coordination.
Mr President, the Council decision being approved, with our adopted amendments, is the product of an exhaustive preparatory procedure and of the experience acquired over recent years from dealing with natural and man-made disasters, disasters which, apart from their huge impact on every aspect of citizens' every day lives, revealed objective shortcomings in the capacity for national intervention and, hence, enhanced expectations for Community assistance.
We are therefore being called upon today to strengthen and arm the Union so that it can respond to this demand by the citizens for effective intervention in the fields of the prevention of and rapid response to natural and man-made disasters.
This is therefore an expression of the real solidarity sought between the Member States, which will further strengthen the feeling of participation in a community and will thus further strengthen the European conscience.
As far as the amendments to the initial proposal are concerned, I consider it necessary to draw your attention to the following points:
An effective early warning and response system is founded on the following four components: identifying and assessing risks, constantly monitoring them, a warning and communication mechanism and, lastly, preparedness - the capacity to react and assist.
I too, like the rapporteur, should like to emphasise that the amendments which we tabled concern matters such as the early warning system, standby modules from the participating states, response and citizen information guidelines, best practices for dealing with situations and, lastly, mutual consular assistance for determining contact points between Member States.
I should also like to say - and I think that this should be accepted - that we must pay special attention to the public health sector, because disasters are usually accompanied by dangers to public health, either as a result of a lack of food or water or from epidemics and, consequently, this component should also be included in the proposal.
Finally, I should like to observe, as our rapporteur said, that the Barnier report is an exceptional report, which should be taken into account because, otherwise, what was the point in doing all this exceptional work?
I think that, together with your report today, we shall have an effective mechanism.
To close, I should like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent work.
Congratulations, Mr Papadimoulis.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Papadimoulis on his report and the Commission on its initiative.
The EU has at its disposal various legal mechanisms for preventing, and responding to, natural disasters.
There are indeed a number of Parliament resolutions to this effect.
I myself drew up a report on the European strategy for responding to natural disasters on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in which I advocated the need for the Union to have quicker and more effective resources for responding to serious emergencies.
On the basis of the experience of recent years with the forest fires in southern Europe and the floods in Central Europe, the creation of detection and early warning systems to protect the citizens and their property from natural disasters, including earthquakes and tsunamis, has become a priority.
Although responsibility for managing the response to natural disasters rests primarily with the country affected, with the Union playing a supporting role, the Community civil protection mechanism set up in 2001 lacked resources and powers.
In other words, it fell short of what was needed.
This recast, improved proposal is worthy of praise.
It will lead to better coordination and quicker assistance for the people affected.
More needs to be done, however, and the model needs to be perfected, not only on the basis of the Barnier report, but also the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, of which I should like to highlight the following: cooperation in civil protection should be based on a European strategic coordination centre responsible for gathering and disseminating information on emergencies and for providing additional resources for rapid intervention to fight natural disasters; the involvement of communities in prevention and response, for which they will need training and information; and greater investment in training the assistance intervention teams.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent work.
His report translates in practical terms that which has already been provided for in the report on the Solidarity Fund, which represents the legal and financial basis for intervention in the field of civil protection.
The European Union currently has financial means and new knowledge based on the experience of the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, created in 2001, which will enable us to improve the instrument's practicality and effectiveness.
It is true that the emergency response to disasters must come first and foremost from the local level, with prevention and reconstruction measures, but it is also true that there is a need for crisis management measures, which can and should be coordinated at European level, if we want to achieve significant economies of scale and, above all, greater efficiency.
Furthermore, when the scale of a disaster overwhelms the local or even national capacity to react, it would be desirable to be able to provide rapid additional assistance from other countries, using their available skills and resources.
We should in fact bear in mind that in many cases major disasters have effects that transcend borders, having an impact on the territories of neighbouring countries.
In addition, I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of proper and appropriate planning of land use and of prevention and management of disasters with a view to reducing risks.
There is a need to strengthen the European civil protection system, in order to be able to provide coordinated responses to tackle emergencies and contribute to a European Union capable of giving its own citizens confidence and safety.
I believe that we have to learn to live up to these legitimate expectations.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all learn from the past and from our own experiences, and I believe that disaster prevention is one area in which we do this.
The documents you have submitted and Mr Papadimoulis' outstanding report represent an attempt by us at putting these experiences to good use.
Three aspects need to be considered: firstly, the preventive measures; secondly, interventions in a crisis situation, and, thirdly, how to deal with the aftermath.
While the European Union can afford a great deal in the way of preventive measures, it is an unfortunate fact that disasters strike in a variety of regions and for various reasons, so it is of the utmost importance that we, here in the European Union, should learn from one another.
It is in this respect that the European Union has a particular task to perform.
During interventions to deal with a crisis situation, the Union must discharge its particular role as a coordinator.
The Member States must not be discharged from their responsibilities; the prevention of disasters is and remains a national responsibility, and it is for that reason that I take an extremely critical view of the EU's current acquisition of equipment, which represents what might be termed an attempt at duplication, and certainly is not beneficial.
It is important that duplication should be avoided, and we should concentrate on good coordination of the resources present in the Member States in order to do that.
The next stage is dealing with the fallout, and a crisis response instrument - in the shape of the Solidarity Fund - has already been put in place by the European Union in order to do this.
Here, too, we should consider how more efficient use may be made of it, possibly by changing the basic rates and concentrating on dealing only with crises that affect Europe as a whole.
(EL) Mr President, the protection of European citizens from accidents and natural disasters is directly connected to their economic and social security.
Over recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of natural disasters, resulting in an equally huge increase in requests for assistance from the civil protection mechanism on the part of the governments of the Member States.
Civil protection is a complex system which consists of prevention, intervention and, lastly, restoration.
The excellent report by Mr Papadimoulis on the proposed recast does, I think, improve the Council proposal in a way which strengthens the supportive and supplementary actions by the Union when they are needed.
However, I stand by the ongoing need for instruction of the parties involved and I consider that greater information for the public is needed, especially in areas with a high degree of risk, in order to help improve prevention and preparedness in the areas in question.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their excellent comments.
Before I touch on the matter of the amendments, I should like to reply on the question of the Barnier report and to say that the Commission has already started work on many of the issues connected with this report, the most important, of course, being the development of civil protection modules.
Meetings have been held with specialists from the Member States in order to ascertain what types of modules should be available in each case and the specific terms and conditions for each type of module.
A second field of work relates to exercises and, despite the fact that no provision is made for the creation of a European institute in accordance with the Barnier report, we do nonetheless propose that a network of centres should be developed which will extend the existing exercise programme.
We also agree that the Monitoring and Information Centre should be reinforced.
We have already requested an increase in the number of employees, of officers, to be employed at the centre.
We have also asked the Member States to give us the opportunity next year to use certain specialists at the MIC.
Finally, the Commission has two legislative proposals, one for the means of financing and one for the recast of the 2001 decision, which will give us the possibility of working in another sector, the transport sector, about which I spoke earlier.
Now, as far as the amendments are concerned, the European Parliament has presented a series of important amendments with a view to strengthening civil protection capabilities at European level.
The amendments relate to the need to safeguard prompt transportation of civil protection aid, the importance of early warning and alert systems, the interoperability of civil protection modules and the role which the mechanism can play in helping the citizens of the European Union.
The Commission can accept most of the proposed amendments.
However, there are some which cause problems and cannot be adopted as they stand.
I refer to those relating to the provision of measures relating to prevention, public health and deliberate maritime pollution.
As regards the measures relating to prevention, the Commission wishes to emphasise that the proposal for the means of financing civil protection will cover actions in this sector.
The Community civil protection mechanism is designed to cover actions in the sectors of preparedness and intervention only.
Nonetheless, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament about the importance of actions in the field of prevention and has promised to promote them within an appropriate framework.
As regards the inclusion of public health, the Commission recognises that civil protection actions very often aim to protect public health.
However, the civil protection mechanism set up at European Union level does not form part of public health policy, which is covered by other existing Community mechanisms, such as the Community action programme in the health sector.
As far as deliberate or intentional maritime pollution is concerned, the Commission fully supports the proposal whereby it must be possible for the civil protection mechanism to intervene in cases of extensive maritime pollution caused either accidentally or deliberately.
The proposal by the European Commission to extend the scope so that it also covers man-made disasters covers this possibility.
However, the term 'intentional, deliberate' maritime pollution usually refers to the jettisoning of small quantities of oil from ships and the Commission wishes to avoid the interpretation that the scope of the regulation covers jettisoning to such a minor degree.
It would be practically impossible for the Commission to mobilise the mechanism - nor, as I said earlier, does it have the staff - and this sort of minor jettisoning should be dealt with by the means available to each country.
That is why the corresponding amendments were not accepted.
Finally, the Commission would point out that a series of amendments relates to aspects of existing legislation.
The Commission supports some of these amendments in essence.
However, the interinstitutional agreement on the use of the recast technique does not allow the Commission to accept them, unless they are of vital importance to the application of the new provisions contained in the proposal or derive directly from the new provisions.
However, the Commission will bear the issues in question in mind within the framework of the development of our policy in this sector.
These are the main issues on which the Commission's position differs from that taken in the European Parliament report.
However, I wish to stress that these differences of opinion do not overshadow our common objectives.
We agree fully with the ambition of the European Parliament to develop a very strong European intervention capability in the field of civil protection, both inside and outside the European Union, and we thank you for your support.
I shall send the European Parliament secretariat a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments.
I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, on his excellent work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(SV) The European Parliament is now dealing with a proposal for revising the Civil Protection Mechanism set up in 2001.
There is no doubt that disasters put great strains on the parties affected.
Coordinated European civil protection is not, however, the solution to the problem, especially in the form in which it appears in this proposal.
Civil protection in each Member State is funded through taxes.
It is up to each State to choose how tax revenue collected from its citizens is to be distributed.
This proposal may entail a risk of certain Member States choosing to invest a minimum of resources in national civil protection, relying on other EU countries contributing when a disaster occurs.
This problem of free-riding is very serious and is unfair towards people in those countries that choose to have strong civil protection.
Where international efforts are concerned, these should be coordinated through OCHA and funded by the Member States and not by the EU.
The Commission's document also talks about rapid reaction forces and about the Member States having to give notice of available resources, including military resources and military capacity, in cases where an affected country requests that type of aid. The June List resolutely objects to these proposals.
A country's military resources are a matter for that particular nation, and it is up to each Member State to decide whether or not such resources should be mobilised.
European order for payment procedure (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position (07535/3/2006 C6-0227/2006 for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European order for payment procedure (Rapporteur: Arlene McCarthy).
rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, almost 12 months ago we first gave our approval to the European payment order, a new law to assist in simplified debt recovery for businesses and citizens owed money in another EU Member State.
Today, a year later, the committee's view has not changed.
We believe that we need this pragmatic and practical EU law, in particular to ensure that businesses and citizens have an affordable system to recover those debts owed to them.
Why?
Because until this law comes into force, recovery of debts from another EU State is a costly legal process.
In some cases, money spent on lawyers and administrative costs exceeds the amount owed to the individual.
More significantly, studies and experience show that companies which do not get their debts paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects not just in terms of job losses, but also for other SMEs in the supply chain.
Out of between 30 and 40 billion invoices in Europe each year, as many as 1 billion default and turn into debt cases.
Interim Justicia carried out a survey on payment practices in 16 European countries some 10 years ago.
The average delay then was just 14 days.
By the end of 2003, however, this had not declined, but risen to 16 days.
According to a World Bank study, 'Doing Business in 2004: Understanding Regulation', the Nordic countries have the most efficient and effective legal systems of the countries surveyed.
They take the least time to reach a solution while keeping costs low.
Italy is one of the countries with the longest delays worldwide.
The explanation it is said lies in the lax appeal process, which allows proceedings to be disrupted at any point during a trial.
Spain, by contrast, has one of the most complex legal systems, which generates higher costs and leads to longer court proceedings.
My own Member State, the UK, has some three systems operating for payments, again creating confusion for businesses or the public.
Extensive differences in legal regulation of overdue payment recovery therefore lead to uncertainties, especially in EU trade, and the additional costs prevent the EU's aim of equal opportunities for market access for both local and EU operating companies.
It is clear that a lack of enforcement systems for payments undermines the internal market and business confidence and that, as a result, SMEs have continued to experience cash flow problems caused by late payments.
The European payment order will also apply to individual citizens who work or live in another Member State and who can also take advantage of this new law.
Of course, the high and expanding volume of trade within the EU and the increased movement of people raise the likelihood that more and more businesses may become involved in cross-border litigation.
There is a risk that citizens may not be inclined to assert their rights because of the obstacles they face, particularly in dealing with the legal system in another Member State and with unfamiliar procedures and unknown costs.
It is essential, therefore, that the EU provide for a judicial area where private individuals and businesses can have access to justice and redress in the case of an uncontested claim.
This procedural law will help facilitate that access.
The payment order introduces a practical EU-level instrument for obtaining an enforceable decision and I believe in this way we can demonstrate to citizens that the EU is delivering a practical tool to assist them with redress and remedies.
I want to put on record my thanks to members of the committee, in particular the shadows, Mr Wieland, who is here this evening, and Mrs Wallis, who cannot be here.
They have not only supported my approach but have made useful and constructive proposals for amendments at every stage of the procedure.
The committee consulted with key protagonists and we believe we focused on the core issues.
Both my shadows were concerned to ensure that the forms and the annex, the bones of the proposal, were simple enough for businesses to be able to fill them out with minimum bureaucracy.
Only time and experience will tell if this has been achieved.
That is why, under the new comitology procedures, Parliament needs to be consulted and informed of any changes the Commission would like to make to the system.
I would also like to thank the British Presidency, in particular the Minister Baroness Ashton, who was instrumental in helping us to make progress on the clear drafting of this law.
So now, Commissioner, at second reading we are down to the last few details.
Mrs Wallis is concerned that the Commission should seriously address the potential discrimination affecting citizens and businesses where EEA members can participate in the single market, but cannot be a party to the EPO.
I hope the Commission will address this issue.
The forms should be user-friendly and simple and we would therefore like the Commission to take on board our amendment in this area.
Finally, since we started this process a year ago and since the Commission's original proposal, we now have a new institutional agreement, with effect from July 2006.
The committee and Parliament insist that the new regulatory scrutiny procedure and rule should be respected in this legislation and on the payment order.
Commissioner, let me say how much we have appreciated the cooperation of your departments in this area.
I hope that, together with the Finnish Presidency, we can sign off the European payment order and begin the process of putting it into law across all the Member States of the EU, so that businesses and citizens can be confident of operating in the internal market in the knowledge that the failure to pay a debt does not end up in endless court proceedings with no outcome.
Thanks to the European Union, there is now a simple and user-friendly system for speedy payment of debts which, I believe, will drive forward the internal market for SMEs and boost the EU economy.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, warmly for her work and her efforts to bring this project, which is very important for our citizens, to a satisfactory conclusion.
Like the rapporteur, I would also like to thank the former United Kingdom Presidency, particularly Baroness Ashton, for the work done in moving ahead with this important project.
As you know, this regulation on the European order for payment procedure aims at facilitating the mass recovery of uncontested claims in Europe.
It is thus very important, as it will allow all creditors in Europe to recover their claims in a uniform way and more rapidly and cheaply than in ordinary court proceedings.
It will also alleviate the burden on the courts by removing from ordinary proceedings those claims where the debtor does not contest the debt.
The proposal potentially concerns all citizens and economic operators in Europe.
A European order for payment can circulate freely in Europe and will be enforced automatically.
There will be therefore no need to request a declaration of enforcement - the 'exequatur' - in the Member State of enforcement.
Concerning the amendments, I can accept the third amendment as proposed.
On the second amendment, I can accept the compromise amendment on the comitology procedure, which is in line with the Council decision taken in July 2006.
On the first amendment, while I understand the reason and the concern expressed by the committee, I think that we should not at this stage reopen the question of the definition of a cross-border case, adopted at first reading by the Council and the European Parliament.
At the same time, I can confirm that the Commission is available and willing to look more closely into the effects of the regulation for parties domiciled in third countries and, in particular, states of the European Economic Area.
I am ready to give very careful consideration to any proposals.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has set out the essentials of why this matters in economic terms.
This European order for payment procedure represents a major step forward in the application of laws across borders, and, in particular, a step forward for business, which has a particular interest in the legal soundness of claims being established without delay, in the prompt assignment of title, and in this claim being capable of being enforced, without further cost-intensive procedures, in the country of the debtor.
It has to be said, though - and it is to this that I want to give particular attention - that legal relationships across borders will become increasingly important to private citizens, who find it particularly difficult to enforce claims across borders, whether such claims are contentious or not.
Today, it is undisputed claims that we are discussing, and that is why this first step is so important.
Private individuals find the business of getting what they are entitled to complicated enough as it is, and they have serious problems with getting claims enforced in a country other than their own; this instrument will make things easier for them.
A form that even an ordinary member of the public can complete will make it possible for claims to be enforced relatively simply and without great expense.
Another consideration is that constant reference has been made to businesses and to creditors, but not enough has been said about the debtors.
Systems have been introduced in the Member States of the European Union - not least in the one from which I come - to make the establishment of such claims a positively economical business, not least for those who owe the money.
The debtor who is willing - but perhaps not able - to pay up, can agree reasonable repayments with the creditor, who has an interest in establishing title and thereby preventing the debt from lapsing, and, in the absence of a contested case, fewer costs are incurred.
It is therefore in the interests of all parties that we should make cross-border legal proceedings speedy, efficient and affordable.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, late payments are the main cause of insolvency, which threatens the survival of businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones.
They jeopardise the operations and solvency of these businesses, often resulting in the loss of many jobs.
Swift and efficient debt recovery when no legal dispute is involved is therefore vitally important for business entities in the European Union. It helps to preserve jobs.
The Member States have attempted to solve the problem of large-scale debt recovery in the case of undisputed claims, generally by simplifying proceedings regarding payment orders.
There are, however, significant differences between national provisions and the way individual procedures operate.
As a result, the latter may be inadmissible or impossible to apply in cross-border situations.
It is therefore appropriate to respond positively to the proposed regulation setting up a European procedure for payment orders.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.

You wish to take the floor, Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez.
I imagine that it is for a point of order.
On the basis of which Rule do you wish to speak?
(ES) Yes, Mr President, I simply wished to mention the fact that the media is reporting that a European citizen, of Spanish nationality, Mr Emilio Morenatti, has been kidnapped in Gaza this morning by a group of armed men.
I would ask that you call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to do everything they can ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is not a point of order.
I understand your concern, but the Rules of Procedure must be respected.
I take good note of what you say, thank you.

Decision on urgent procedure
The Council is requesting the application of the urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions C6-0295/2006.
Who will speak on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries?
(ES) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries in the absence of its chairman, Mr Morillon, in order to support this Council request for urgent procedure.
We are talking about approving, as you have said, and as the Commission proposes, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets.
The fisheries sector in the outermost regions is suffering a structurally precarious situation.
The Council's approval of the Regulation on the European Fisheries Fund was accompanied by a joint statement by the Council and the Commission in support of these regions, extending until 31 December 2006 the derogations regarding the possibility of granting State aid for the renewal of the fishing fleets registered in those regions.
Although the extension ends in two months' time, the Regulation has not been able to enter into force due to the slow pace of the process for adopting decisions within Community legislation.
Our committee is in favour of the urgent procedure and urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the sector can receive the aid without delay.
(Parliament agreed to the urgent procedure)
This item is therefore included in next Thursday's Voting Time at 11.30 a.m. and the time limit for presentation of amendments is tomorrow Wednesday at 10.00 a.m.
Commemoration of the 1956 Hungarian uprising
Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to make a statement, and I shall do so standing, on the 'Hungarian Revolution' of October 1956.
Half a century ago, the Hungarian people rose up against the Communist dictatorship and against the occupation by a foreign power.
On 23 October 1956, Hungarian university students took to the streets of Budapest to protest against the Communist government and they were soon joined by citizens from all professions and sectors of society.
I must tell you that that is my earliest childhood memory of politics.
At that time, the news in my country was full of the resistance by the Hungarian people.
I can remember our school teacher showing us where the events were taking place on a map, the voices on the radio and photographs in the newspapers of burnt-out T-34 tanks in the centre of Budapest.
It brought alive in me for the first time the notion of fighting for freedom.
For two weeks there was hope; then the radios stopped and a complete silence fell, and behind that silence thousands were killed and hundreds exiled.
For some time those who rose up in Budapest hoped that the free West would come to their aid. It did not.
For some time, they were led to believe that it would.
We looked on as powerless spectators as thousands of Hungarian men, women and children fled their country and sought refuge in the West.
It was an indescribable tragedy for the Hungarian people, but it was also the first chink in the armour of the Soviet system - a chink that would grow and would lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall - and it was undoubtedly a great moment in the history of that country.
Around that time, at the end of June, the Poznan uprising in Poland, with the workers from the Cigielski factory demanding 'bread and freedom', was another significant moment in that upheaval.
Those events were undoubtedly related.
In fact, during the ceremony organised this year to commemorate the events in Poznan in 1956, the Hungarian President, Laszlo SÃ³lyom, said that 'Poznan and Hungary rose up together against the Soviet occupation.
On 24 October 1956 the Hungarians took to the streets carrying placards reading "Poznan - Warsaw - Budapestâ'.
That was a source of inspiration for what happened later, although it took a long time.
It took a long time, until the spring came in Prague in 1968.
It took a long time, until the strikes in Poland in 1970, which led to the recognition of Solidarnosc, ten years later, which was the pickaxe that brought the wall down.
History repeated itself in 1989.
Hungary and Poland laid the first stone of the reunification of the continent, and I believe that this is a good point to quote from Albert Camus in 1957, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution.
Camus said: 'Hungary conquered and in chains has done more for freedom and justice than any other European people for twenty years [...].
In Europe's isolation today, we have only one way of being true to Hungary, and that is never to betray, among ourselves, or anywhere, what the Hungarian heroes died for and never to condone, even indirectly, what killed them.
It would indeed be difficult for us to be worthy of such sacrifices.
We can, however, try to be so, in uniting Europe at last, in forgetting our quarrels, in correcting our own errors, in increasing our efforts and our solidarity'.
A reunified Europe today is prepared to make further progress and to disseminate the European spirit even further, thereby helping to create a world in which our actions are guided by the principles of freedom, solidarity and progress.
We owe that to those who died for their belief in a free Europe.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are, today, commemorating the uprising by the people of Hungary 50 years ago, when people rose up in desperation against a totalitarian dictatorship.
We are commemorating the events of the autumn of 1956 today because what they did, they did for all of us.
They did the idea of freedom, justice and democracy proud.
They stood up for human dignity and filled it with renewed vigour, continuing to demonstrate it even when they were crushed by tanks.
They went into exile for all of us, suffered for all of us, thus to be borne in remembrance for all of us over the years and the decades.
The heroes of the Hungarian revolution are heroes for us all.
They are heroes for Europe.
We are commemorating them today because we are indebted to their legacy.
We are paying homage to their achievement because we - especially here in the European Parliament - are bound to one another by the pledge that there must never again be such a challenge to freedom and human dignity in Europe.
Their life stands before us like a relief showing the great heights that humanity is capable of reaching when we are compelled to defend the values and the dignity of Europe.
We bow down before them.
What began with the first mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October 1956 and ended when Soviet troops were sent in on 4 November was a revolution for freedom.
The participants in the Hungarian uprising quite rightly spoke of revolution, or forradalom.
By contrast, the Communists who were in power at the time accused them - wrongly - of mounting a counter-revolution, or ellenforradalom.
The difference is not simply a small fragment of a Hungarian word. The difference is enormous.
It is the difference between freedom and serfdom.
The people of Hungary acted for our values in Europe, since the freedom for which the heroes of the Hungarian uprising of 1956 strove and died is a part of the European identity.
Our aims are the aims of those people in Hungary back then.
Nothing could better illuminate the potency of these events than the fact that, today, we are commemorating the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and that we have with us in this House freely-elected Hungarian MEPs.
For me, this will always be the miracle of my generation.
Hungary's freedom has become the freedom of Europe, and Europe's freedom remains the guarantor of Hungary's freedom.
Allow me just to express my great appreciation, in the light of today's events in Budapest and in Hungary, to the Hungarian Members of this House, irrespective of the groups to which they belong, for the fact that they have made it possible for us to agree on a common text, a joint resolution.
This shows us that we share common principles that bind us together irrespective of the disagreements of everyday politics.
I ask that, in the altercations in Budapest, no side should act disproportionately, that the demonstrators should not receive a disproportionate response, since we are linked by common values, namely the values of freedom, which also link us to 1956, as well as linking us in the modern day, 2006.
Let us always, in every disagreement, put this sharing of values at the heart of things.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a connection between the anniversary that we are commemorating today, namely the anniversary of the Hungarian uprising against their Soviet oppressors, and the anniversary that we will be celebrating next spring, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome.
These two events took place within a short space of time and both of them were motivated by the same spirit.
The Treaties of Rome were characterised by the spirit of freedom and the binding together of peoples in freedom. This was precisely the spirit of the uprising in Hungary too.
The people of Hungary wanted out of a system that had been forced upon them; they wanted their own sovereignty as a free people.
They had to fight that system and struggle against a power that wanted to take that right away from them.
Fifty years later we are commemorating those men and women who sought out the right that we, the European Union, today guarantee to each people, namely the right to be able to live in freedom and self-determination within the democratic international community.
Those men and women who had to fight their oppressors for that right are true heroes of European history.
They had no weapons, they could not resist an army and they faced the tanks with their bare hands and their chests torn open - we all know the pictures.
The courage shown by these men and women is worthy of our admiration.
In my opinion, that courage, and the stance that was, as both the previous speaker and you, Mr President, have pointed out, to be found not only in Hungary but also in Poland and twelve years later in Czechoslovakia, that courage is also part of the heritage of Europe.
It shows that on this continent, men and women have always been prepared to dedicate their lives to freedom.
The courage of those men and women is up there with the best that Hungary has to offer Europe.
It is also up there with the best that we as Europeans have to preserve.
I believe that the fall of the Wall that came later, the fact that it was possible to tear down the Wall, to overcome the Iron Curtain, grew out of the courage of the days that we are remembering today.
One thing is completely clear, and that is that however bitter oppression may be in any particular case, however painful a dictatorship, it will not last forever.
No oppression can keep down the desire of a people for freedom, the desire of humankind for freedom, in the long run.
Every dictatorship yet in the history of humanity has fallen at some point.
Just as this communist, Stalinist dictatorship fell, so will the other dictatorships in the world.
This means that the courage of those men and women in Hungary fifty years ago is the courage of men and women in other parts of the world who are fighting oppression in their own lives today.
This is an ongoing fight; it is not over.
By commemorating these events on the 50th anniversary we are also commemorating the fact that the people of Hungary have succeeded, having achieved their democracy and their freedom in their country, in transforming the act that forced them into the Eastern Bloc into an act of freedom whereby, through free self-determination, they have joined the European Union.
What that represents is a completely different concept, namely that of voluntarily joining an international community through free self-determination rather than being forcibly pushed into a community of force.
It is precisely this that is the giant step forward that we have made in Europe over the last 50 years.
This uprising took place when I was a little baby, just 10 months old.
I was a child in 1956.
The fact that I have been able to live my life in freedom is an enormous privilege, an advantage that the Hungarians of my generation did not have.
I am grateful for this, but I am even happier that, at this point in my life, we who were born in freedom in Western Europe are today able to live together, as Europeans, with those born under oppression, in the Union in which we share.
There could be no finer gift for my generation here and in Hungary.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to pay homage to the 1956 Hungarian revolution, to the courage, to the determination of the Hungarian people in the fight for freedom, to the memory of the victims of repression and to the suffering of an entire people.
1956 was a turning point in the contemporary history of Europe.
In June 1956, as the President has said, the uprising of Polish workers in PoznaÅ was met with bloody repression.
The liberalisation of the regime, which took place in Poland in October 1956, lasted only a short time.
That year was marked by the events in Hungary.
The Hungarian revolution was popular, national and anticommunist.
It was crushed mercilessly by the Soviet army.
The streets of Budapest were the scene of a bloody repression, and Hungary was gripped by terror and oppression for a long time.
Today we are commemorating this anniversary without trying to settle our scores with the past.
But in order to inscribe these events in the history of European freedom, and to feel a sense of community, the European Union needs to have a common memory.
The heroism of the men and women of 1956 cannot be forgotten.
We must remember Imre Nagy, a communist who became a protagonist of the anticommunist revolution, who was assassinated in a secretive and cowardly manner.
We must remember IstvÃ¡n BibÃ³, a great thinker and man of action in the service of freedom and democracy, who was thrown into prison and condemned to silence until the end of his days.
We must not forget that Europe, faced with the drama of 1956, certainly expressed its indignation, but remained silent and impotent.
This is a lesson for Europe now and in the future.
It must be strong, united, and show solidarity.
It must find its raison d'Ãªtre in freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of peoples.
And for Hungary, today, we should hope that the Hungarian people and its leaders will draw from the courage of 1956 the strength to find the wisdom needed to put the public good and the common interest above political controversies.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, there are a number of red threads running through history, and it is one of those red threads that we are taking hold of here.
It started on 17 June 1953 in Germany, then ran through Poland and Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, until Communism was finally defeated.
The Hungarian uprising was an uprising for democracy; it was a national uprising, but also a political one.
I would remind you of the PetÅfi group - the Hungarian intellectuals who founded the Workers' Councils together with the workers, first in Budapest and then throughout Hungary.
They had the hope to try to reinvent democracy.
That is what happened in Hungary in 1956.
As we remember this uprising now, 50 years on, we can also add to that memory another one, namely the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hannah Arendt.
She was one of those intellectuals who had the courage to name two totalitarian regimes in a single breath - communism and fascism.
This is precisely what history teaches us: we have never had a permanent hold on democracy.
We will only keep hold of it if we fight for it every day.
Poland and Hungary are showing us that today, as are the dangerous developments in France, where there are fascist, far-right forces at work.
We must continue to stand up and fight for democracy.
The people of Hungary and Poland 50 years ago and those of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and also the people in this country who fought against fascism, have shown us that it is sometimes necessary to give one's life for democracy and freedom.
We should take this lesson to heart, and not be afraid to say that totalitarianism - whether fascist or communist - is and always will be totalitarianism.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I express a point of view largely shared by my group when I say that I agree that the 1956 uprising in Hungary should be considered first and foremost as a popular uprising for freedom and independence.
I also agree that the bloody repression of this uprising by the Soviet army should be unreservedly condemned.
Finally, I agree that this Hungarian tragedy should be seen as an emblematic event, because it sheds light on the heart of the existential crisis of a model which would disappear thirty-three years later, as it was unable to reform itself profoundly.
By contrast, we cannot accept a unilateral reading of contemporary history that demonises the communist idea.
To stay with the case of Hungary, I would remind you that high-ranking communists played a major role in that country in the movement contesting the regime.
We are all familiar with the part played by Nagy Imre, the reforming communist Prime Minister who paid with his life for his commitment to the side of the insurgents.
It is less well known that the famous Petofi circle, whose activities are considered as one of the trigger factors of the movement, was formed on the initiative of young communists.
I could go on to cite the name of the great communist philosopher GyÃ¶rgy LukÃ¡cs, who was also involved in this struggle for reform.
In fact, over a whole period, we witnessed a rising tide of protests inspired by communists, whose criticisms were unfortunately stifled.
History was not written in advance, it is no more so today.
And so, let us condemn Stalinist crimes as much as necessary, but let us not rekindle the spirit of the cold war which was never productive for freedom and independence in any area.
The reunified Europe has more to achieve by turning resolutely towards the future.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over 2 500 tanks against an unarmed people, 75 000 Red Army soldiers, thousands of victims, over 2 000 people shot by the KÃ¡dÃ¡r government instated by the Soviets, 12 000 prisoners sent to gulags, 200 000 refugees: these are a few of the terrifying figures that sum up a nation's tragedy, but also the beginning of the end for a party and a power which, following the shameful and iniquitous Yalta agreements, dominated half of our continent.
The first signs came in Berlin in 1953, followed by the cry for freedom in PoznaÅ, in Poland, in 1956.
Stalin had been dead for three years, but his political successors, despite Khrushchev's report to the XX Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956 denouncing the Georgian dictator's innumerable crimes, used repressive and criminal methods, for fear that power should slip from their hands in Hungary.
The revolt descended into a great tragedy.
Imre Nagy's reformist government was swept aside, and he was assassinated.
Only with the fall of Soviet communism could the victims of those years finally be rehabilitated.
Referred to by Hungarian communist leaders and the Kominform as a 'rabble', in fact, they were and they remain a symbol of human dignity, oppressed by one of the most insensitive and violent dictatorships that history has ever known.
This great tragedy must remind us today of the negativity of an ideology and a political practice that left millions of victims in the regions of the world in which the regime was installed.
Some of those who, at the time, defended the use of tanks and the shootings are today reappraising their actions, and, as always, they speak of mistakes.
They do not speak, however, of rejecting those ideas that led and inevitably lead to dictatorship and oppression.
Only by rejecting and condemning those ideas quite openly can we be guaranteed a future of freedom.
Remembering the tragedy of the Hungarian autumn, we appreciate the Union once more as a protector against any humiliation of the dignity of the individual and of peoples.
Furthermore, we recall that there are still regimes that exert an iron grip on the lives of their citizens and that represent a threat to free peoples: the world's many dictatorships, from North Korea to Iran and Cuba.
Yet we also remember the dangers of new forms of fundamentalism.
May the West never again choose silence, and may Europe be a champion of freedom and justice.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, today, we in this House are commemorating a tragic political event that took place in Hungary 50 years ago.
The insurrection that broke out at that time, and that was brutally crushed by Soviet troops, has opened the eyes of many in Western Europe to the dangers of the Communist ideology as dictated by Moscow.
The historical significance of Budapest 1956 is much more than local or national.
As a 13-year-old schoolboy, all that I grasped was that my mother's beloved home country fought a heroic battle for a freedom that it passionately desired.
The images of Prime Minister Imre Nagy and General PÃ¡l MalÃ©ter and the fight against the Russian tanks are etched on my mind.
We desperately - against better judgment, indeed - hoped that the West would send support.
We felt so much for the victims and for the refugees.
My parents taught me back then that Hungary is not an Eastern European, but a Central European, country, with strong, religious and cultural ties with Western Europe.
Now, 50 years down the line, the Soviet bloc has been dismantled and eight, and soon ten, of the former satellite states, are part of the European Union.
What have we done with this regained freedom?
National Socialism was defeated in 1945 and Communism 45 years later.
Did anything positive come to replace them?
Are we able, on the ruins of those ideologies, to build a society of tolerance, accountability and love of one's neighbour?
We need patience and perseverance to achieve this.
Since it took fifteen years for the Netherlands to be reconstructed after five years of occupation, it is likely that a few generations will be needed before all the wounds of oppression, sustained over a 50-year period, are healed.
May the Hungarian people display the courage and strength to conquer the past together and to collectively work on a future in peace and freedom.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the anticommunist uprising draw our attention to the crisis experienced by Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny's socialist government.
The new Hungarian elite has reclaimed the 1956 revolution and the communist symbols in order to justify liberalism.
This strategy aims to give legitimacy to the current government, given its affiliation with the communist intelligentsia, and to reassure a population that, socially, is beginning to seriously suffer under the effects of liberalism.
Communism in fact amounts to an excuse on would-be social grounds to exploit the people, as demonstrated today by China.
Hungary has its place in the European Union because, in its experience of resisting totalitarianism, it brings new political sensibilities and, as in 1956, a popular ability to generate hope.
Today, the protests by the extreme right against Prime Minister Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny, who has admitted having lied about the state of the economy in order to win the elections last April, have seen 100 000 people demonstrating in Budapest on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
Demonstrators clashed with police for hours in the streets, leading to arrests and injuries.
Supporters of the leading right-wing opposition party are themselves claiming the role of the true heirs of 1956.
In my opinion, it is not a case of rewriting the history that everyone knows, or that European socialists and communists fail to recognise. It is all too easy to appeal to the emotions, evoking the bodies of men, women and children who fell under the blows of the Soviet Union in the name of communism.
The Italian communists, Hungary and the Communist Party leaders sided with the USSR against the Hungarian revolutionaries.
Party Secretary Palmiro Togliatti and his successor Luigi Longo declared their solidarity with the re-establishment of internationalist justice many times, even years later.
The current President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, appeared in the newspaper L'UnitÃ  condemning the revolutionaries as thugs and disreputable troublemakers.
Fifty years later, in his autobiography, he does not retract this statement, but merely explains what is known to everyone, that is that in those years the Italian Communist Party and all European socialism was inseparable from the fortunes of the socialist block, led by the USSR.
We should not so much condemn the Soviet Union's imperial actions, but rather strongly condemn those who, at the time, enthusiastically chose to support the invasion, in the name of communist and socialist internationalism.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(EL) The debate in the European Parliament and the resolutions tabled for 50th anniversary of the Hungary uprising are yet another organised attempt to rewrite history and fuel anti-communism.
The celebrations by the representatives of capitalism and the presence of the secretary-general of ÎÎÎ€Î, the President of the Commission and other imperialist leaders at the event in Budapest are the best testimony of the objectives of the Hungarian uprising, the overturning of the socialist system and the restoration of capitalism.
The publication, moreover, of official documents which prove the active involvement of imperialists and organised support for the revolutionary forces are the best response to those who distort the nature of the events by calling it a popular uprising.
The common, copycat shouts of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance about democracy and freedom are an attempt to sanctify capitalist barbarity and present it as the only way forward for the peoples.
At the same time, they are hiding their fear of socialism, which is a social necessity.
The forces of the left are taking on huge political responsibilities with their stand.
Even though they know about the undermining and aggressive role of imperialism in the former socialist countries and their murderous role in all the grassroots movements, they are adopting the imperialist propaganda in the name of 'objectivity'. They are not taking a class-orientated approach to the events, thereby giving imperialism an alibi.
(IT) I speak, with great pride, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, a small group of uncompromising Italian socialists who have always chosen the same path and have refused offers from those on both the right and the left inviting us to give up.
This red thread of independence, which runs through to the present day, had its crucial moment in 1956.
At that time, the Italian Socialist Party, under Pietro Nenni, firmly condemned the violent attack by the communists that drowned the hopes of the Hungarian people in blood and massacred the insurgents.
This was the national uprising of a proud people, who were fighting not only against the physical and moral sufferings inflicted by communism, but also against the political and cultural drabness that had stifled the traditions, identity and patriotism of the Hungarian people.
As the tragedies of the following years demonstrated, to speak of communism and freedom has always represented a patent oxymoron.
The members of the New Italian Socialist Party will never tire of repeating this truth, which was for too long denied in Italy by the Italian Communist Party.
We therefore honour the 5 000 Hungarian martyrs who did not bow to injustice and who fought to the death to exert their right to a better future, to a prospect of freedom, democracy and peace.
Breast cancer (debate)
The next item is the debate on
the oral question to the Commission on the reintegration of breast cancer patients into the job market and use of social funds for continued training of health professionals in the field of breast cancer, by Mr Andersson and Mrs JÃ¶ns on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - B6-0433/2006),
the oral question to the Commission on the early detection and treatment of breast cancer in the enlarged European Union by Mr Florenz and Mrs JÃ¶ns on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0434/2006) and
the oral question to the Commission on breast cancer by Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ and Mrs JÃ¶ns on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B6-0436/2006).
author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Å pidla, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the chairmen of the three committees, Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, Mr Florenz and Mr Andersson, most warmly for their fantastic cooperation in preparing this debate.
I would also like to thank you, Madam President.
Breast cancer was on the agenda three years ago, and it is now time to take an initial look at the results, which appears to be urgently necessary.
In the 25 Member States, 275 000 women contract breast cancer every year.
The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another.
To make it worse, younger and younger women are contracting the disease: just in the last few years, the number of women under 40 affected has doubled.
Breast cancer is still the number one cause of death in women between 35 and 55.
However, I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States.
In some countries, mastectomies are still the rule rather than the exception, even in the very early stages of the disease, even though in 80% of cases these days it is possible to operate without removing the breast.
As you can see, then, we are progressing at a snail's pace.
This is particularly true in the new Member States, where the missed opportunities and deficiencies throughout the chain of care are at their worst.
However, at least in the old Member States, the fact that the structures remain, as before, inadequate to catastrophic has less to do with public budget problems than with the economic and class interests of the doctors.
Let us begin with early detection: the development of an across-the-board breast screening programme according to EU guidelines will involve a one-off cost for the public purse of no more than EUR 1.25 per citizen.
I am therefore sure that nobody in this House wants to claim that this money is not available.
If we had an EU-wide breast screening programme, we could save the lives of 31 000 women in the EU a year, help to reduce healthcare costs and substantially reduce subsequent costs for the whole of society.
To date, though, only 11 countries have a quality-assured screening programme, and these programmes are a long way from being continuous.
In your country, too, Mr Å pidla, you must put a stop to the practice of passing off opportunistic screening as EU screening.
In Cyprus, too, Mr Kyprianou, progress is still very sluggish.
Now we know, of course, that you are both on our side, but it would nonetheless have been nice to have the Commission's progress report now, instead of in the Spring, which is when it is expected.
We also call on you to put greater emphasis on the option of using money from the Structural Funds to develop a screening programme.
However, even the best early detection system is of no use if subsequent treatment is inadequate or inappropriate.
Time and again, breast cancer is operated on and treated in hospitals with barely any experience.
I would therefore specifically like to thank the Commission for the EU guidelines for breast centres, which we have received from you since last year.
The ball is now in the Member States' court, though, because the only place in the whole of the EU with such centres at the moment is - amazingly - the United Kingdom.
That is why we will also call today, in our joint resolution, for the Member States to establish sufficient breast centres nationwide by 2016. This is absolutely feasible by 2016.
We would need around 1 800 such centres EU-wide.
Then all women would have the opportunity to get the same optimum treatment, regardless of where they live.
In order to ensure that these breast centres actually work in accordance with the EU criteria, that they really do perform a minimum number of operations on primary breast cancer, namely 150 a year in a single centre, that the specialists really have specialised exclusively in benign and malignant breast diseases and that they really do carry out interdisciplinary consultations before and after the operation for each case of breast cancer, we now also need guidelines for the certification of breast centres.
In this connection, we would call on you in the Commission to embark on drafting these guidelines with real speed.
We would also ask you to draw up guidelines for the job description of breast nurses, who have a very important role to play in these centres, as guides and mediators between doctors and patients throughout the treatment process.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs JÃ¶ns.
That is a very personal thank you.
author. - (SV) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs JÃ¶ns for her great commitment and for having got to grips with this tremendously important issue.
As Mrs JÃ¶ns has already said, this is the most common form of cancer among women. It is also the most common cause of death among women aged between 35 and 59.
What is more, we know that breast cancer is on the increase among younger women and that the chances of detecting the disease vary a very great deal from one EU Member State to another, as do opportunities for breast-screening.
I know from my own country, Sweden, where breast-screening has been available for many years to women in certain age groups, that such screening has reduced the death rate amongst women and that it is important to detect the disease early in order to provide the right treatment.
All of this means that the efforts mentioned in the resolutions discussed by Mrs JÃ¶ns are incredibly important.
Three committees are involved in this work.
We in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs do not have responsibility specifically for health and healthcare matters, but rather for the link to the labour market.
We now have, I am happy to say, a labour market that is designed to involve women and where women can be found in ever increasing numbers.
In my own country, the proportion of women in work is just as high as that of men.
If someone contracts a serious illness such as breast cancer, one purely factual consideration is that time out has to be taken for treatment.
It is sometimes possible for a woman to go on working, but to do so means also being able to discuss with her employer what changes might be made to her work patterns so that she might continue in employment while she is receiving treatment.
It is also possible for someone to become seriously ill for a period of time but then get better as a result of treatment and be able to go back to work.
The question is then one of how she can be successfully re-integrated into working life, and in such a way that the breast cancer treatment does not have a harmful effect on it
It is important for us to address these issues. That is the first point to be made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Our second area of concern comprises the professionals involved in these issues.
There is constant progress in terms of research and development and procedures for treating breast cancer.
It is important for medical staff to be kept up-to-date at all times on new procedures as they are developed.
We do also have instruments at European level - specifically, within the framework of the Social Fund - with which to help staff develop their skills.
In this area too, we must be able to make use of the Social Fund for the purposes of skills development, so that staff can use the best methods.
This is also something to which the Lisbon Process is relevant.
The Lisbon Process is, of course, about best practice, and that means that we are supposed to look to those countries that have made most progress.
Finally, I would like to mention something else that I have spoken to Mrs JÃ¶ns about.
Breast cancer is a disease that strikes women, but it is important that we men get involved in working towards better procedures.
It must not be women alone who are committed to better methods of fighting diseases that affect women.
It is, rather, something to which all of us - both men and women - must be committed.
(Applause)
author. - (DE) Madam President, I am grateful to you, Mrs JÃ¶ns, for allowing me to co-author this question with you.
I was delighted to do so, because I was struck during the debate by just how little I had heard on this topic up until now.
As I followed the debate, I thought about how faint-hearted we really are in Europe, how stupidly we have acted in the past, and how many questions we have left open for this continent.
I will try to add my political weight to the balance in this matter, because in terms of content I have nothing to add to what Mrs JÃ¶ns and others have said.
I call on both Commissioners to summon up all their courage to deal with this topic, and to combat the faint-heartedness of the Council.
The Council has often - and I have experienced this all too often - weakly said: that is subsidiarity, a national matter.
Information and communication are the main tasks for the future, including with regard to this terrible disease, and I would therefore ask both Commissioners to exert all their political influence to convince the Council and to establish guidelines.
Just think about it for a minute: we even have guidelines for drawing up guidelines, but we do not have any guidelines on how we should combat breast cancer, the most important disease on this continent, in the future.
I think the idea of developing a job description for highly qualified nurses is an excellent and interesting one, and I pledge you my full support.
(Applause)
author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again gathered in plenary to debate an issue which affects both public health and the lives of women and families in our constituencies: breast cancer.
Already in 2003, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality had asked a question on this subject to the European Commission.
Commissioner, at the time it was your predecessor, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who took the first steps to respond to Parliament's requests.
Today, we ask you to recognise the progress that has been made.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is concerned with reducing mortality rates among women affected by breast cancer, improving their quality of life, and providing women and their associations, but also their close families, with information on the risks and treatment of breast cancer.
In this debate, we should also take account of the role of men.
Husbands, fathers and their children are also affected by these specifically women's diseases.
I also remember the many parents whose daughters are affected by the disease and who provide them with support.
Within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, we are working on the various aspects of the disease in order that one day we might see a Europe free from breast cancer.
I am encouraged by the great interest that the committee has shown in this issue.
I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent collaboration, which really deserves to be acknowledged.
Breast cancer is a public health issue that is important for all women in the European Union.
Every two minutes, someone is diagnosed with breast cancer.
Every six minutes, a woman dies from it.
This disease makes no distinction on grounds of race, religion or culture.
We must have the honesty to recognise all the causes of breast cancer, without exception.
It would be useful to compare the levels of increase across the Member States, in order to come to a conclusive strategy.
All women ought to have easy access to the means of diagnosis and to quality treatment in the early stages, independently of their origin, social status or level of education.
In this way, thousands of lives could be saved.
This would be an example of truly positive discrimination. It is now crucial to make every woman aware of the risk of the disease, and to increase the resources allocated to breast cancer prevention and screening in the Member States.
Commissioners, like me, you know from experience that the medical equipment is too expensive for regional hospitals in the new Member States.
The medical industry is not prepared to make an effort in terms of finances; it is too concerned with making profits.
All the same, I ask you to examine seriously the possibility of funding breast cancer prevention through the Structural Funds.
The efforts of politicians, doctors and scientists in developing the network of cooperation in all the Member States could enable us to ensure equal access to the means of screening and health care.
Only through this close collaboration can the fight against breast cancer transcend ideological divides and personal rivalries.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I should like to thank Parliament for having organised this debate on breast cancer.
The very detail of the questions shows the wide range of issues involved.
I will not try to address every question separately; that would be an impossible task, given my limited speaking time.
However, I would be very happy to provide detailed information at a later stage.
I shall therefore focus on three key areas, but first I should like to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem, already mentioned by many speakers.
Every year, 270 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the European Union.
That affects their lives and the lives of their families and it has a very significant medical, social and economic cost.
The first issue I should like to touch upon - and it has already been addressed - is how far we have come since the European Parliament's resolution of 5 June 2003.
It is true that the resolution set out some ambitious targets for the Member States to reach by 2008, notably a 25% reduction in mortality and a reduction in differences between breast cancer survival rates in the Member States to 5%.
I have to admit that it is too early to know exactly how much progress has been made.
Member States have committed themselves to report to the Commission on the situation by the end of this year, three years after the adoption of the Council recommendations.
The Commission will therefore produce an implementation report in 2007.
I can assure you that the lack of information from some Member States will not delay production of the report. Instead, the report will indicate the Member States that have not provided the information.
There are already signs that the resolution and other actions have had positive effects and started to make a difference.
We expect progress on aspects such as the exchange of best practice models to facilitate application in different parts of the EU and the guidelines for screening diagnosis, delivering some very significant reductions in breast cancer mortality.
In addition to providing the results on mortality, we hope to have the data to be able to set out a clear picture of the timeframes involved and developments as regards inequalities.
The second general area I should like to touch upon is research.
Breast cancer will feature strongly under the Seventh Framework Programme.
This will cover both the detection of the disease and, crucially, the causes - in other words, how it can be prevented.
As regards detection, research is focusing notably on improving breast cancer screening and alternatives to conventional mammography, in order to improve early detection.
Examples already supported under the Sixth Framework Programme include mammography with molecular imaging or the application of positron emission tomography - PET - specifically designed for breast cancer examination.
Early detection is, of course, crucial in ensuring successful treatment, but that is still treating the disease rather than the causes.
I am therefore very pleased that work on the causes of cancer is a priority in the Research Framework Programme. That work will cover the three key areas of genetics, environment and lifestyle.
Thirdly, the issue of campaigns: these can play a very important role in public health issues, in raising awareness of key issues by private individuals, public authorities and decision-makers, as well as, of course, health professionals.
Not only does it enable individuals to help and protect themselves, it also puts pressure on the decision-makers to give priority to this problem, which they sometimes fail to do.
The European Parliament's 2003 resolution has been an effective part of an ongoing campaign to increase awareness.
Awareness-raising among women on the importance of screening has been a key part of European action against cancer.
Such campaigns can be supported under our public health programme.
In conclusion, we all agree that breast cancer has to be tackled and best practice examples show that significant results can be achieved.
However, we have to understand that it is a continuous process.
We must never become complacent, even if we are encouraged by the initial success of some of those efforts and initiatives.
A coherent and collaborative approach is needed, covering in particular the three aspects I highlighted earlier.
Of course, we have to admit that most of these actions are principally for the Member States, but the European Union can and will provide support - as in the case of research - where possible.
As an indication, I can refer to future support for breast cancer screening guidelines, which will continue under the current and future health programmes, the European Council network and the European Union network for information on cancer in Europe.
A new project that has now been shortlisted answers some of the questions relating to the extension of the guidelines.
The European Union guidelines will be updated to cover not only the setting of standards for breast cancer nurses but also the specification for specialist breast units.
They will set the standards, principles and benchmarks to which Member States will have to adjust their breast cancer screening, training and treatment.
These initiatives will cover the need for information and consultation in the new Member States as well and will help to integrate the relevant experts within existing networks.
We must never forget that each year more than a quarter of a million women depend on such action.
They and their families depend on the priority we and the Member States will give to such an important and serious problem.
We must not let them down.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all of those present in this Chamber are aware that breast cancer is a terrible ordeal for the sufferers.
We are all aware of what an ordeal it is for their families and for those closest to them.
This is a disease that can turn a person's life upside-down. The treatment is arduous and lengthy, and often stops sufferers from working or leading a normal life.
My fellow Commissioner Mr Kyprianou spoke just now on issues of health and prevention in relation to breast cancer.
In my short speech, I should like to focus on reintegrating breast cancer patients into working life.
Breast cancer severely disrupts people's lives.
Life changes direction and women are often ill-prepared for such a change, although in reality they often cope with the situation better than their relatives, friends, colleagues and employers.
The latter often do not know how to behave towards women with breast cancer.
There is no universal solution.
Each individual situation needs to be treated on its own merits.
There is little information or guidance available on how to deal with breast cancer sufferers from a legal, work, health or psychological point of view.
The Community should improve the mechanisms for helping breast cancer patients.
Experience has shown that it is better for women with breast cancer to carry on going to work, assuming, of course, that their physical and mental condition allows them to.
In order to make life better for patients while they are unwell, special working hours and adapted holiday arrangements, for example in tandem with working from home, need to be introduced.
This would also help them to reintegrate more easily and more quickly into the working environment.
Support for employers and colleagues could play a crucial role during treatment.
Psychological help should also be permanently available, and to this end, an educational awareness-raising campaign should be launched, aimed at employers and the workplace in general.
As I said before, it is important to create the conditions whereby women with breast cancer can quickly and successfully be reintegrated into the labour market.
The specially adapted working conditions that may be needed during treatment should perhaps be extended until some time after treatment, in order to help the patient to reintegrate.
Breast cancer patients must not be allowed to suffer discrimination in the work place.
The European Directive of November 2000 provides a general framework for equal treatment in employment and prohibits discrimination on the grounds of disability.
The question remains whether long-term illness falls under the heading of disability.
In the United Kingdom, for example, following lengthy discussions on this issue, the law prohibiting discrimination against the disabled has been updated and now provides for protection against discrimination against cancer sufferers.
The European Court of Justice will need to decide whether this interpretation applies to the directive on prohibiting discrimination.
EU legislation, specifically Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety of workers, also states that employers must adapt the nature of work to the worker's state of health, which implicitly includes those with chronic and long-term illnesses.
I welcome the proposal to draw up a charter to protect those with chronic and long-term illnesses in the workplace.
I feel, however, that the social partners should develop such a charter in conjunction with the relevant bodies at national level.
Apart from legislative instruments, the Commission supports cooperation between the Member States via the open method of coordination in the area of social protection.
Investment in health is one of the goals of the new structural funds for 2007-2013, in particular in the convergence regions.
The objective is to increase the number of healthy working years and to enable as many people as possible to play an active role in society.
This objective relates both to health infrastructure and to the training of health workers, an issue that has been mentioned in this Chamber.
The measures in this area may include health support, disease prevention, knowledge sharing and the training of highly qualified workers.
Honourable Members, the European social model is based on solidarity with the most vulnerable members of society, towards whom we have a moral responsibility.
Breast cancer sufferers are physically and psychologically vulnerable and fragile, as well as actually having to fight against this disease.
They need support, they need decent healthcare, they need protection against discrimination, they need to be reintegrated into working life under the best possible conditions.
Honourable Members, I think that you can rely on us in this matter.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, we have heard a list of all the things we need, and what the House is saying is that we need action to achieve those things.
This resolution offers one of those rare occasions where we have total unity round this Chamber: unity across committees, unity across political groups. It is unity on what is a rare disease.
It is one of the rare diseases that is not the result of poverty; it is the result of increasing prosperity. That is why it is very much a European disease growing in prevalence.
The most common cancer among women is breast cancer.
We know the figures: 275 000 a year; 88 000 dying a year. That is why we demand access to better services, better research.
But medical science is making hope possible: early diagnosis, new drugs, specialist nurses, new therapies and knowledge leading to prevention.
All those things mean that we do not have to accept this terrible toll among women.
But it is also an issue for men. One thousand men in the European Union die each year from breast cancer.
Fill this Chamber with men - every seat filled, and the galleries and the interpreters' booths, and the platform - and wipe it out. That is the number of men we are losing each year to breast cancer.
Men need specialist services too.
They also have problems because although it is easier to spot in men, it is left too late and so the tumours are too large. So they need screening.
Too many men cannot cope.
They cannot cope, not just with the disease, but with going home to their families and telling them they have got breast cancer.
They cannot cope with going down to the pub to tell their mates they have got breast cancer.
Some - and 'some' is too many - kill themselves rather than face the consequences of their diagnosis.
That is our fault.
We do not enable them to cope; we must.
For men and women, our message is that we have a united resolution and we demand united action from the Commission.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, my thanks go to Mrs JÃ¶ns for bringing this issue back before the House.
This disease is not only a women's issue, as Mr Bowis and Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ have said.
Hundreds of thousands of men, hundreds of thousands of families, are affected by the disease each year.
My mother-in-law died of breast cancer and my wife's eldest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago, but thanks to early and successful treatment she is alive and well today.
I am sure you can imagine the shadow this disease casts over me and my family.
But, as we have heard, it is a particular ordeal for the 275 000 women who contract the disease each year and, tragically, the 88 000 women who die of the disease each year in the European Union, and their families.
These are figures which can and must be radically reduced.
We need further research into prevention.
But it is particularly shocking to me that mortality rates vary by as much as 50% across the Member States and that mastectomy rates vary by up to 60%.
That too is unacceptable.
There is clearly a pressing need for best practice to be spread evenly across the Union into every region and that best practice needs to be built around the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis.
Another pressing issue is the fact that an increasing number of younger women are developing breast cancer - 47% under 55 years of age.
Add to that the fact that up to 20%, a fifth of former breast cancer patients, do not return to work and it becomes clear that something needs to be done if we are to meet the Lisbon target for women's participation in the labour market.
I therefore fully commend the resolution's call - and I am pleased to hear Commissioner Å pidla respond positively to it today - to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of breast cancer patients and currently sick people in the workplace to facilitate their reintegration into the world of work.
Their working hours need to be tailored to their treatment pattern and their reabsorption into the workplace needs to be built around their rehabilitation.
Five women per day are diagnosed with breast cancer in my own region.
I hope that, with proper research into prevention, that figure will be reduced.
I also hope that our work can come to mean that those diagnoses will not represent a death sentence; rather a diagnosis needs to become a trigger for early, sensitive, humane intervention, successful treatment and re-entry into the world of work and a full and fulfilling life.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I should like to add my thanks to Mrs JÃ¶ns for this splendid initiative.
She has done a tremendous amount of work on it.
The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in European women, as we have heard, is one in ten, and it is the biggest killer of women between the ages of 35 to 59, and the second biggest overall.
Mr Bowis was absolutely right: we must not forget that although it mainly affects women, one thousand men die of breast cancer each year.
Still not enough is being done by Member States.
With advanced screening techniques, it is possible for breast cancer to be identified at an early stage.
The European Commission published a new set of guidelines on breast cancer screening and diagnosis in April.
They estimated that 32 000 breast cancer deaths across Europe could be prevented.
But many Member States do not have technical screening facilities or trained nurses in place.
I urge every Member State to sign up to the European guidelines but, more importantly, to implement those guidelines.
We need to do even more in terms of education.
Lifestyle, as well as genetics, can apparently affect the likelihood of getting breast cancer.
We also need to make sure that those diagnosed with breast cancer are not discriminated against in the workplace, as we have already heard.
They should be allowed to continue to work during treatment, if that is what they wish to do; but, if not, to be able to resume their careers afterwards.
That should be covered by the 2000 Employment Directive on anti-discrimination in the workplace - we have done that in the United Kingdom.
But many Member States do not class breast cancer as a disability, which is why we need a definition of disability.
With so many people developing breast cancer, we must get that right.
We must also have an exchange of best practice, particularly as mortality rates vary by 50% between Member States.
It is up to us all to keep this high on the political agenda.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have before us an excellent motion for resolution, which talks a great deal about better prevention and treatment for breast cancer.
As several of you have already pointed out, it submits proposals for, for example, better screening. Quite right too, and we should build on that.
However, I would like to stress once again that it is also a matter of prevention.
It is an old wives' tale that genetic factors and lifestyle are the only causes of this illness.
New studies have confirmed that harmful environmental factors in the form of toxic chemicals or increased radiation are responsible for half of all cases of breast cancer.
That is something to which we must pay attention.
Alongside comprehensive research into the causes, health protection must be at the forefront of European chemicals legislation.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we initiated a move towards greater health and environmental protection in Europe.
However, today's vote on breast cancer also provides clear support for a strong REACH, because it is clear that the changes in women's hormonal systems make them particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of chemicals.
Studies from the USA show that female farmers who use certain pesticides on their fields are more prone to breast cancer.
Women who live within a mile of a special waste site for herbicides and pesticides are also at greater risk, and we know that many of the softening agents previously used in cosmetics contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells.
Prevention should have an even higher priority in our fight against breast cancer.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, I have listened to all the previous speakers and I too wish to take my turn in thanking the authors of the resolution and those who have worked so intensively to combat breast cancer.
I shall comment, Commissioner, on the inequalities and on treatment.
As you know, the mortality rate is higher in the ten new Member States and screening programmes are very 'kindergarten', to coin a phrase.
I include my own country in this which, as you may know, has a pilot rather than a national programme.
It is a pity, Commissioner, to leave the country where someone will fall ill with breast cancer and the country and hospital in which they will be treated to luck.
This is due to the fact that the guidelines on the development, firstly, of quality mammograms and, secondly, of countries with specialist treatment centres - breast clinics - with specialist nurses, are not easy to consolidate.
I shall not, of course, omit to refer here to what John Bowis also said earlier: that men also get breast cancer and that we should not always refer solely and exclusively to women.
As we are debating breast cancer today through this fine initiative, I should like to point out that other forms of cancer, Commissioner, are not poor relations.
There are other forms of cancer where, with precisely the same guidelines, we can reduce the repercussions and the mortality rate.
What we need is a strategy for cancer as a whole, which coordinates all 25 Member States, and to stop sucking on the sweetie of subsidiarity, with the result that no money is granted from the Structural Funds in order to develop these programmes.
I beg you to please examine these issues.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I wholeheartedly support this question to the Commission from each of the three committees on what I regard as a most important topic.
I also want to welcome the positive response from the Commissioners.
I co-signed this resolution on breast cancer as I believe the European Union can do much to assist Member States in this area through extensive research, benchmarking and sharing of best-practice principles, as well as offering Member States substantial professional, material and technical assistance through European programmes.
The main concern that legislators and health teams face today with regard to breast cancer is that every woman, irrespective of her place of residence, social status, occupation and education, should have access to high-quality screening for treatment and aftercare in the event of cancer.
We need to improve the service of information to women, both younger and older, about the risks of and availability of treatment for breast cancer in order to ultimately reduce the mortality rate of women and to improve their quality of life and assist them in returning to work if they so desire.
There is a need for more extensive research on the causes of breast cancer, in particular on the effects of hazardous chemicals and the environmental pollution, nutrition, lifestyle and genetic factors.
I call on the Commission, through the Seventh Framework Programme, to provide financial support for the further development of blood-based tests, to provide funding for comprehensive investigation into the causes of breast cancer, to urge Member States to set up information and counselling centres, whilst simultaneously reporting back to the European Parliament on the results of more recent research conducted in this very important area.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the alarming statistics on women suffering and dying from breast cancer certainly call for a resolution calling on the Commission and the Member Sates to combat this epidemic and conduct breast screening.
Importantly, they also point to the need to take preventive action, which should involve the elimination of risk factors.
It would therefore be appropriate to draw logical conclusions from existing research.
These results indicate that breast cancer is not simply due to toxic damage, but that its main cause is the use of hormonal contraceptives from an early age, along with hormone replacement therapy.
In addition, breast cancer can be triggered by complications following abortion.
Furthermore, breast cancer often occurs amongst childless women, or amongst women who become pregnant relatively late in life and who go through the menopause relatively late.
The more children a woman bears, the smaller the chance she has of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer or cancer of the uterus.
It follows that the increased incidence of cancer can also be linked to the feminist concept of womanhood, which aims to deprive women of motherhood, exploit them as a potential part of the workforce and practically force them to control their so-called reproductive life, which virtually amounts to perceiving them as animals.
According to psycho-oncologists, the increased incidence of tumours is not unrelated to the spread of mental disorders, notably depression.
These result in reduced immunity to disease and allow the development of tumours.
Preventive measures should therefore involve spreading a culture of life as an alternative to the widespread notion that everything around us is about to collapse.
(SK) I would like to inform you of the outcome of discussions held on 20 October 2006 at one of the largest and oldest women's organisations in Slovakia, the Union of Slovak Women.
At the meeting the women were discussing the intolerable breast cancer situation in Slovakia and other European countries.
Nowadays, cancer is curable if diagnosed early enough.
Thus, given that the disease is preventable, women are dying partly because of our ignorance.
Therefore, I am here to inform you of the 'Don't Let Us Die' initiative conceived on 20 October.
I call on politicians, physicians, patients and the general public to prevent their mothers, wives, partners and daughters from dying of a disease that need not be fatal.
The European Parliament enacts regulations on nature protection, European motorways are being built, but investment in health is overlooked.
The European Union is also striving to reduce life-style differences between Member States.
Indeed, we are doing well in many areas.
However, statistics on cancer curability indicate that there are major differences between Member States, and these include breast cancer survival rates. Slovak women have a 30% lower chance of surviving this kind of cancer than many women from Western Europe.
It is deplorable that we cannot effectively guarantee the screening needed to boost the survival rate.
It is necessary to give women the opportunity to see their doctors for screening in the evening or at weekends, and at the same time to reward doctors and medical professionals properly for this additional work.
I believe that the majority of women are aware of this problem and behave responsibly.
They only need the appropriate access to a doctor.
Prevention, however, is not free; it requires considerable funding.
Therefore, everyone should be exerting more pressure to ensure that spending on prevention is not crowded out by other priorities.
We should approve a budget that provides for investing in prevention, which means not only fitting out hospitals and purchasing mammographs or sonographs, but above all investing in human resources so that a sufficient number of health professionals are available to operate this equipment.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to something that has already been said.
Firstly, I believe that the European Commission's policy is a good one, trying to harmonise aspects in a field in which it does not have any real competences, but where it can exercise leadership, and in this regard we insist that it extend its policies and carry on emphasising self-examination and pointing out the differences amongst the various countries.
I am not saying that it should condemn them, but I do say that it should highlight any shortcomings.
Above all, I also believe that its website should be expanded and self-examination should be introduced, for example, and a series of other possible actions taken, as is already happening in some commercial organisations.
Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the family tragedy that normally accompanies cases of breast cancer.
I believe that families are very frequently broken up and that many women do not dare to report their case precisely because the cancer interrupts their work rhythm, disrupts their normal lives and would prevent them from looking after their families in the event of their having to undergo surgery.
I therefore believe that the European Union must broaden its action and deal also with this area of family assistance and of awareness-raising.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, breast cancer is a major health problem, and increasingly so.
It is second only to lung cancer as the most prevalent type of cancer, but the causes of lung cancer are partly known. Smoking and asbestos are significant among them and air pollution is a risk factor.
Something can be done in order to prevent lung cancer; as people can, for example, stop smoking.
Little is known, in fact, about breast cancer, though, other than the statistics.
The incidence of breast cancer in the Netherlands is higher than anywhere else.
There are also statistical connections, and I would thank the Commissioner for the extensive and detailed response to my written question.
The Commissioner claims that there is a connection between obesity and breast cancer; there is also one with having children late in life.
There is a socio-economic factor: low-income groups do not get screened as often and are therefore more likely to die of the disease.
Finally, according to the Commission, perhaps the most important factor determining the risk of breast cancer is hormones, particularly oestrogens.
