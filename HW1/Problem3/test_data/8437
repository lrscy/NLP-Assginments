This provision will enable all generics to be made available more quickly.
My fellow Members and the Council also accepted my âeurogenericsâ proposal, which will prevent any hold-up in the development of these products, in particular in the candidate countries.
The review of pharmaceutical legislation does not seek solely to strike an optimum balance between generics and innovation.
Many other aspects that are just as important have been studied.
I am thinking in particular of the definitions of medicinal product, generic medicinal product and biosimilars.
These have been the subject of heated debate.
Personally, I have always advocated an approach based on product safety.
Having definitions that are too broad would be counterproductive for both manufacturers and patients.
A satisfactory balance has been struck in this respect, as is illustrated by the provision on borderline products.
I know that this point raises further questions.
Simply deleting this so-called âborderline productsâ clause would not have resolved anything and would require each manufacturer to seek judicial clarification from the courts, which would involve hiring lawyers and waiting months and months for a judgment.
Drawing up a list of exemptions did not appear to be the right solution, either.
Such a list would never have been exhaustive.
We already have legislation on cosmetics, food supplements and medical devices, to name but a few examples.
This is legally valid and our task here is not to call it into question, but to resolve a very real problem.
Here I have a request to make of the Commission and I would actually like it to give an undertaking in this regard, so as to increase the legal security of those active in the field. There is no doubt that it would be helpful if the competent Commission services were to convene a meeting as soon as possible of all of the stakeholders that I have mentioned previously.
I believe that this would be particularly important to set their minds at rest.
On the basis of this meeting and in the light of rulings already handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a joint and official interpretative statement could then be published.
I sincerely hope that this proposal is acted on, in the same way that I expect the Commission to clarify its position on the Doha Declaration.
I know that this too is an essential point for a good number of my fellow Members.
The issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product for human or veterinary use does not, however, signal the end of checks on its efficacy and safety.
Strengthening pharmacovigilance has therefore been one of our priorities.
This has made it necessary to modify the existing provisions: firstly, to make it possible for inspections to be carried out unannounced at the manufacturing source and secondly, to shorten the deadlines for mandatory submission of the periodic reports and to set up a system for the rapid exchange of data collected by all of the partners so as to ensure that the pharmacovigilance systems are applied consistently across the Member States.
We have also stressed that pharmacovigilance should be independent and requested that the management of funds earmarked for this purpose remain under the direct supervision of the competent authorities.
My fellow Members and I also wished to take into account the environmental aspect of medicinal products.
This point was, moreover, raised with the Executive Director of the EMEA in London, who confirmed that this was a valid approach.
However, under no circumstances should this constitute grounds for a marketing authorisation to be refused.
We all know, for example, that the products used in chemotherapy may cause harmful chemicals to be discharged into the environment, but we would not consider banning their authorisation.
This would not make any sense.
The idea here is to assess better the environmental risk and, for all therapeutic classes, to take effective measures to reduce its impact.
This is a very important issue for this Parliament.
I also wanted, with the support of my fellow Members, to return to the issue of information.
It is our responsibility to address the problems that arise.
It would have been easy to ignore the subject, but we have not done so.
We are therefore asking the European Commission to table a clear paper setting out what exists in this field, to analyse the potential benefits and risks of making information available to patients, to reflect on the responsibility of the information provider and to table proposals.
Nevertheless, I do have a number of regrets where these reports are concerned.
The most significant concerns the scope of application of the directive and the Councilâs refusal to make the centralised procedure obligatory immediately for all new active substances.
Here, Parliament has been too European for the Council.
The compromise does, however, include some significant pathologies in the scope of application and a review clause in four yearsâ time will enable us to strengthen this provision and increase equal access to health for every European citizen.
I would congratulate my fellow rapporteur, MrsÂ MÃŒller, who negotiated this.
Where the EMEA and the composition of its scientific committees are concerned, common sense should prevail.
It would seem to me to be inconsistent and even very dangerous if the professionals appointed to sit on these committees did not have a similar level of expertise.
It is the criterion of competence and not nationality that will guarantee the quality and effectiveness of the scientific evaluation.
We will be very vigilant on this point.
On homeopathic medicinal products, Parliament wanted to go further than the proposed compromise.
I am very aware of this, but advances have been made in the field of mutual recognition.
This provision will secure the development of this category of medicines.
We should look at what is being proposed and not just at what has not been agreed in the negotiations.
It is important to put things in perspective, as it shows that homeopathic medicinal products have not been neglected, just as veterinary medicinal products have not been sacrificed.
All of the provisions that I have mentioned so far also apply to all veterinary medicinal products.
These directives do not seek, as I have had occasion to hear, to hamper social security systems or to give one sector an advantage over any other.
On the contrary, they guarantee the development of a high level of health protection.
They facilitate access to products for all patients and encourage scientific research by supporting essential growth in generic medicines.
Neither do they divide the fifteen current Member States or the enlargement countries.
I hope that tomorrowâs vote is favourable, so that our three institutions are successful in improving human and animal health.
I am confident: we have an undertaking from the majority of the political groups. I dare not imagine that it will not be respected.
Â Â  . First of all, I would like to thank and warmly congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte, for their work and efforts, particularly in the search for a global compromise with the Council.
The review package, as originally proposed by the Commission, had three important objectives: first, to guarantee European citizens a high level of health protection; second, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products while at the same time encouraging competition with generic products; and third, to prepare for enlargement.
I am glad to note that the final compromise proposed by the two rapporteurs and by the Council would indeed meet these objectives.
Where the compromise amendments are concerned, I would like to concentrate on the most important issues.
First, the data protection scheme and generic competition.
The Commission wanted to strike the right balance between innovation and generic competition by adjusting criteria for achieving it.
The measures in favour of generic competition we proposed were agreed upon and even improved on thanks to Parliamentâs amendments during the first reading.
Regarding innovative industry, the Commission proposed harmonising the data protection period at 10 years across the board as an essential element for a smoother operation of the single market.
This period also represented one of the major tools available in the context of pharmaceutical legislation for rewarding innovation.
We also proposed a one-year extension when an innovative indication is granted after initial market authorisation.
The current compromise, known as 8+2+1, meets our objectives and expectations.
I am fully aware that the impact of this harmonisation in the new Member States was much discussed during the debate.
First, I would like to welcome the provision regarding the non-retroactivity of this harmonisation.
This was a preoccupation of the acceding countries and is now a part of the compromise today.
This provision will limit the effect of the new protection period to medicinal products authorised after the implementation of the directives.
Second, I would like to state that the Commission will give full consideration to any request for a transitional period presented by the new Member States on adoption of the legislative package.
The rest of the compromise on the data protection scheme and generic competition, including a one-year period in the case of switches and a one-year period for well-established substances in the case of innovative indication and clarification of generic and bio-similar definitions, is also welcome and acceptable to the Commission.
Regarding the scope of the centralised procedure and the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Agency, despite your support during the first reading, the Council has taken a more limited approach on the scope.
The common position did not follow the Commission and Parliament approach, but extended the current scope of the centralised procedure to some extent.
The current compromise further extends that scope, and more importantly, allows for future development.
It takes account of some of the most important therapeutic needs of today and probably of the near future.
The Commission welcomes the compromise solution.
More generally, the new legislation will consolidate the Agencyâs international role and will increase its role in key sectors such as market surveillance, pharmacovigilance and public awareness of medicinal products.
This development is also to be welcomed.
To perform these tasks, the Agency had to undergo some adjustment, and the compromise amendments related to its administrative structure, and in particular the composition of the management board and of the scientific committees, meet this objective on the whole.
Third, the environmental aspects.
The possible effects of the use of medicinal products on the environment is important.
The question needed to be addressed carefully as, at the end of the day, the availability of certain medicines was at stake.
The compromise amendments, which require an environmental impact assessment and possible mitigating measures but leave the criteria for granting the marketing authorisation untouched, are to be seen as a well-balanced solution.
Fourth, the implementation of the Doha Decision concerning the granting of compulsory licences for the export of patented medicines to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity.
First of all, I would like to stress and reiterate the Commissionâs political commitment to ensuring that the implementation of this decision is facilitated and that the right conditions are in place for its operation and efficient application.
However, Amendments Nos 6 and 19 pose a problem of form because a clause regulating the exports cannot be part of a directive dealing with the placing of medicines on the Community market.
This proposal concerns only market authorisation in Europe. It in no way impacts on exports of medicines from Europe.
Nevertheless, the Commission fully agrees with the principle of the implementation of the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003, both at Community and at Member State level, in the context of the patent legislation.
The Commission undertakes to address the implementation of this decision in the EU as a matter of the highest priority in early 2004 with a view to bringing forward an appropriate legislative proposal.
Finally, information to patients.
The Commissionâs attempt to modernise this part of the legislation has not been as fruitful as I would have wished.
However, I am pleased to note that the issue is now part of the compromise.
I would like to ensure that we make steady progress towards a future Community information strategy to deal with this question.
Concerning recommendations for second reading from Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte, the Commission can accept entirely the global compromise package as proposed by the Council and accepted by the two rapporteurs.
As to Mrs MÃŒller's request, once the legislation is adopted my services will organise a hearing with a view to adequately implement Article 2(2), where all stakeholders will be given the possibility to have input.
This compromise allows the settlement of a number of important questions and a dynamic approach to the tasks of the agency and the scope of this centralised procedure.
The proposed harmonisation of the data protection scheme, irrespective of the procedure used, is a major improvement.
I would also like to reiterate the importance of the new environmental features introduced in the legislation.
As regards the veterinary legislation, we also note that if the provisions have been brought into line globally with those of the human medicinal products directive, some specificity has been adequately kept, in particular concerning environmental impact.
In the veterinary sector, environmental impact may determine the final authorisation of the given product and therefore constitutes a criterion for its evaluation.
In conclusion, I would like to urge Members of Parliament to support the two rapporteurs on the approval of the compromise so as to conclude, at this stage, the legislative process of the pharmaceutical review for the benefit of all European citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am extremely satisfied with the exceptional results achieved by this Parliament and in particular with the work that has been carried out in recent days, which has shown significant, positive interaction between the various institutions.
My warmest thanks therefore go to MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and MrsÂ MÃŒller, CommissionerÂ Liikanen, and MrÂ Brunet, as well as to MrÂ Silano from the Italian Presidency who intelligently and openly contributed to drawing up these compromises that have finally been accepted.
As we know, the main aim of all of the institutions is finally to have new legislation that allows European citizens to have equal opportunities and to have access, as soon as possible, to new, more powerful drugs, which are more selectiveand more easily tolerated than existing ones, hopefully at a reasonable price.
I will focus on just a few points.
As regards the composition of the management board of the European Drugs Agency, the current compromise proposal is preferable both to the initial Commission proposal and to the one from the rapporteur MrsÂ MÃŒller, which, in my view, contains major deep-rooted conflicts.
The management board, as approved, will be predominantly institutionalÂ âÂ as I had personally wished for on a number of occasionsÂ âÂ with the addition of two representatives from the Patientsâ Association and two from the Doctorsâ Association.
Furthermore, I am satisfied with the length of the data protection period because this agreement is, in my view, very well balanced and will, on the one hand, give new impetus and incentives to European industries to invest more in scientific research and, on the other hand, will allow them to respond to ethical requirements, by implementing a solidarity policy towards developing countries and also towards some of new Europeâs accession countries.
The agreement reached to see a further data protection period in the case of a âswitchâ, as well as in the case of new therapeutic indications for well-known medicinal products, is also a step in the right direction.
Another point of the agreement regards the development of an EMEA centralised procedure for the marketing authorisation of new medicinal products.
As I have stressed on numerous occasions, I agreed with the initial Commission proposal and I am convinced that new medicinal products should in future be subject to authorisation by the EMEA.
Finally, I hope that in Europe the pharmacovigilance system, which I outlined as a pharmacologist and that guarantees maximum protection of citizens, will be made more efficient and transparent.
Â Â  Mr President, I also support the rapporteurs and all who have worked hard for this compromise proposal.
There is always a danger that a trialogue before second reading will turn into a kind of Bermuda triangle of lost hopes and failed expectations.
That has not happened in this case, and we can all accept the achievements that we have.
Everyone has sacrificed something to find a balance.
I accept that the failure to accommodate the Doha amendments, the further recognition of homeopathic medicines and the limited extension of data exclusivity for switch products will leave some here with heavy hearts.
It is when I turn to the third report on veterinary medicinal products â which the Commissioner dealt with briefly â that I confess to some further anxiety.
Again, I support the compromise amendments: they enhance the EMEA, they recognise some limits to the status of prescription-only medicines, which we all support and welcome, and they allow options in relation to the centralised procedure.
Nevertheless, they could go further in acknowledging the position of some Member States, including my own, where routine medicines are used by qualified persons, but not veterinarians.
Amendment No 27 would have allowed an explicit derogation to allow this to continue, alongside prescription-only medicines.
The Commission indicated before second reading that Amendment No 27 was acceptable in principle - it was not to the Council.
Nevertheless, I hope to hear from the Commissioner, when he winds up this debate, that there will be a subtle and consensual solution to this dilemma that will be in the spirit of compromise and of the Christmas season as well.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner Liikanen, I too should like first of all to congratulate my two fellow Members, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and MrsÂ MÃŒller, on their excellent work on this review of pharmaceutical legislation, which is undoubtedly one of the most important public health dossiers of this parliamentary term.
What we have on the table today is a package of amendments that has been negotiated by the two rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency.
It is an overall compromise, a balanced compromise, which has been accepted by the majority of the Member States and which gives guarantees and proposes measures to foster the growth of both branded and generic medicinal products.
The agreement with the Council incorporates a series of proposals that are dear to our hearts.
I am not going to repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, particularly on the subject of pharmacovigilance or the EMEA and the centralised procedure.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the five-yearly renewal of authorisations, which will enable the national authorities to remove medicinal products from the market if they are no longer effective; the clear distinction that needs to be drawn between information and advertising, together with the Commissionâs undertaking to table a report on current practices; the collection of waste and the environmental impact of medicines, and the Braille inscription on the packaging â which has not yet been mentioned â for the partially sighted.
Finally, and most importantly, I would draw your attention to the fact that the definition of generic medicines has been broadened and the eurogenerics concept has been introduced. This will harmonise and facilitate conditions for launching generics across Europe, and constitutes a major step forward in this review.
Our rapporteur mentioned it, but it has not been stressed enough so far. I was also delighted with Commissioner Liikanenâs response to MrsÂ GrossetÃªteâs question about so-called âborderlineâ products, whose status does require further clarification.
This brings me to what has been â it has to be said â the real battleground in Parliament and between the Member States from the outset: the question of data protection.
The 8+2+1 formula should be supported, as that is what we need today: a win-win approach, I would say, which will promote research, which is crucial for Europe, and provide better patient access to less expensive medicines, with the impact that we know this will have on our governmentsâ health budgets.
To my fellow Members and representatives of the four Member States who voted against this fair compromise and continue, in their efforts to defend health at a lower cost, to take data protection as their main, if not in many cases their only, target â as if the debate could be limited to this question alone â I should like to say that they are taking a huge risk.
The risk that they are taking is no more and no less than that of seeing Europe become nothing but a sales counter and of letting the United States become the only country where innovation takes place.
I will remind you of just one figure.
Since 1996, the proportion of new medicinal products launched worldwide by Europe has fallen from 55% to 28% â in other words, it has halved â and I am not talking here about turnover but about insufficient investment in research and development.
In conclusion, it is important that we do not choose the wrong target or strategy in this debate.
If the essential objective for Europe is to continue to care for its patients, and care for them well â and we all agree on this â then we need to pursue a genuine policy of innovation, stem the brain drain, fight against parallel imports and, as I was saying, promote, not a head-on collision between industry and generics, which would be fruitless, but a win-win approach, which will be of the greatest benefit to patients.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, which I am representing, I think that this is what we have succeeded in achieving here at the end of two years of work together.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have been working successfully on this project to revise European legislation on medicinal products for two years.
It is true that, at that time, I had hoped for a lot more than this compromise package, negotiated with the Council and the Commission, which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
For me, this process of revision of the procedures for European marketing authorisation of human and veterinary medicinal products should lead to a radical development of the criteria for evaluating and authorising medicinal products in the interests of patients, public health and health-care professionals.
The principal aim of this revision was to have the European Agency legally recognise all of the new substances.
In actual fact, the centralised procedure will only focus on some illnesses.
The London Agency has sufficiently enlarged its sphere of activity to ensure its funding, but the national authorities have, for their part, retained the most lucrative classes of medicinal products, namely those regarding neurodegenerative disorders or cardiovascular diseases.
The interests of the Commission and the Council are safe, but are they those of the patients?
Over and above introducing Braille, we have improved pharmacovigilance and transparency in patientsâ interests, but it is true that some last-minute Council compromises subtly weakened these gains.
The majority of the documents relating to the evaluation of medicinal products should be publicly accessible, but what about pharmacovigilance reports?
The public authorities responsible for issuing authorisations should be independent of companies but remain, in actual fact, dependent upon private taxation.
Patients do not have the means to directly inform the competent authorities of the side effects of medicinal products, and doctors are not obliged to do so.
It is a great victory, however, that advertising for medicinal products subject to prescription was rejected, but until when?
In terms of public health, the environmental impact of the new medicinal products should be assessed.
This should not be the sole evaluation criteria, but it must be considered in the benefit-risk equation for a medicinal product and, therefore, be one of the conditions for granting a marketing authorisation.
The environmental risk goes far beyond the damage to nature; pollution linked to discharges of toxic residue from medicinal products represents a risk to human health.
Clearly, treatments for which the medical benefits outweigh the environmental risks should continue to be used.
When effective alternatives exist, however, they should be promoted.
I am sorry to say that the final wording of the amendments concerned does not recognise the full scale of the problem.
For a doctor such as myself, the evaluation of the effectiveness of medicinal products compared to others is sorely lacking in this new pharmaceutical package.
It is only the safety and the quality of the new substancesthatcount.
It is of little importance whether or not they provide a significant clinical benefit.
I endeavoured to make the concept of added therapeutic value acceptable in order to encourage firms to carry out research into substances that are genuinely innovative, and I came up against the opposition of all of the institutions.
I was, however, persuaded that this debate will return to this House, because the pharmaceutical industry no longer wants to make do with placing new bogus treatments on the market and overprotecting them for years.
It is true that the major cause of friction related to the authorisation of generic medicinal products.
The pharmaceutical industry is trying to delay the sale of generic products, and this is normal.
The Commission and some Members shared this reaction, however, by restricting the definition of generic products, tightening the conditions for granting authorisations and extending the periods for authorisation by using various tricks: switch, new indications etc.
Despite opposition from the majority of Member States faced with problems of funding their social security, the first European medicinal products will have the longest protection period of administrative data in the world.
I wonder, furthermore, about the compatibility of such protection with the Doha provisions that call for the creation of generic medicines for export.
That is certainly the main concern raised by this legislation when it comes to funding public health.
Finally, another major disappointment was in the area of homeopathic medicinal products.
In actual fact and in conclusion, I recognise that we have made much progress, and I welcome this, but it is true that there still remains a great deal to do in the years to come.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteurs and the Commissioner.
Nevertheless, I still take issue with two points: patent protection and homeopathic medicinal products.
In May, ten countries will be joining the European Union.
Naturally, they are most welcome; at least that is what we tell them.
Of course, saying and doing are two different things.
That is also evident today: the proposals that the Commission and the Council have made here can hardly be called a warm welcome.
For one thing, the compromise on patent protection is extremely disadvantageous for the new Member States.
In the accession negotiations, it was agreed with these countries that they would include a protection period of six years in their legislation.
The â8Â +Â 2Â +Â 1â compromise would mean health care in these countries becoming much more expensive: to the tune of hundreds of millions a year.
Commissioner Liikanen may well promise a transitional period, and I welcome that in itself, but it is less than was agreed.
Amendment NoÂ 55, which I and my colleague MrsÂ Corbey have tabled and which has the support of a large number of observers, returns to the new Member States what they were promised, thus translating our good words into good deeds.
A second point is that the compromise proposal on the table also pays particularly scant regard to homeopathic medicinal products, even though a substantial majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy did advocate this.
One hundred and ten million Europeans use these medicinal products, and we must not deny them this.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to support Amendment NosÂ 20, 21, 22, 23 and 38.
Â Â  Mr President, like Mr Blokland and some other speakers, I want to speak on behalf of the accession states.
When I was chairing the debates on Mrs GrossetÃªte's and Mrs MÃŒller's reports in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I was presented with a petition, which I have with me here tonight.
It was signed by a large number of members of the observer teams from the accession states.
Almost all the accession states are there represented.
Certainly a very large number of Polish observers are very worried about this proposal.
I support the GrossetÃªte and MÃŒller reports.
I congratulate both our rapporteurs, and I imagine that they will be very glad to see the back of these three proposals.
They have done very good work.
However, I also support the ten-year data exclusivity period for the present 15 Member States.
But I am very aware that the accession states have recently negotiated legislation in their own countries to put the on to their statute book, and that included a period of data exclusivity of six years.
We are in danger here tonight of glossing over something very important, and I cannot understand why, given that the accession states were able to ask for derogation periods, we are not already hearing exactly what derogation periods they are asking for.
Part of the trouble may be the responsibility of the accession states themselves: they have not yet asked the Commission the Commissioner can tell us this for delays, temporary derogations, extensions, etc.
It would be far better, however, and in the interests of transparency, if, before we adopted this legislation - and I know that it is almost too late - we had a list of the derogations requested from the accession states in order to build these into the preamble to the existing directives before us.
Mr Liikanen may say that is impossible.
If he does, he is wrong, because that is precisely what we have done in the draft directive on packaging, which we have almost concluded.
The accession states asked for certain derogations.
We asked what the dates were.
They gave us the dates.
The Commission said that these dates were fairly acceptable.
We then built into the packaging directive preamble reference to the dates of derogations that the accession states requested.
If we adopt the legislation before us now without specific reference to the negotiations and to the deadlines requested by the accession states, then we are in danger of producing legislation which is not transparent, because nothing will appear in the Official Journal alongside these directives drawing attention to the deadlines available to the accession states before they need to implement them.
This is a very bad way of proceeding.
I have some sympathy with the Poles and others who are worried about this.
I can see that it is necessary for the health of the western European pharmaceutical industry for us to go for the ten-year data exclusivity period, but we need to be fair to the accession states and, above all, we need to be transparent about the arrangements that we reach with them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteurs for their efforts towards bringing this important dossier to a successful conclusion.
I am very happy that this Parliament, together with the Council, has succeeded in refining the Commissionâs proposals substantially, which were indeed very sweeping and liberal at first.
What is being served up is of course a compromise, with some elements that are good and some that are not so good.
In any case, it is a good thing that all medicinal productsfalling under EU regulations will have to comply with the same criteria of quality, safety and efficacy.
Another thing of great importance is that commercial advertising is still outlawed.
Do you recall the original Commission proposals, which, as a pilot project, sought to permit advertising of medicinal products for AIDS, asthma and diabetes?
In my view, patient information must be guaranteed to be reliable and objective.
It is logical, therefore, that this flow of information be organised and coordinated by the public sector in the first instance.
I am pleased that the Commission is now being given the task of putting forward proposals, based on an overview of the current situation, to bring about improved, objective information provision, which, in my opinion, will have to include information and sales via the Internet.
The duration of data protection, however, is less positive, in my opinion.
After all, in comparison with the United States or Japan, for example, the period of protection for medicinal productsin Europe is extremely long.
Admittedly, it is a good thing that, from the eighth year, the generic pharmaceuticals industry will be able to start some preparatory work in order that it may place generic medicinal productson the market from the tenth year.
In my opinion, however, there are too many possibilities for an extra yearâs protection to be added, for example when a new indication can be proved.
In my view, this was entirely unnecessary.
I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Commission will monitor the situation closely to ensure that these possibilities are not abused.
Finally, I also regret the absence of an amendment on Doha.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my warmest congratulations to my fellow MEPs MrsÂ MÃŒller and MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, and also to the brilliant Commissioner Liikanen and the Italian Presidency.
We have reached a good compromise: eight years for generic medicinal products, to begin with: the European Parliament achieved this.
The ten years has been dropped.
The Dutch Government voted against the common position since it would mean an extra EURÂ 160 million expenditure per year in the Netherlands alone.
At first reading, the European Parliament reached a good compromise of between six and eight years.
We have held on to this, and have also been able to push it through in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission.
The centralised procedure via the EMEA in London is increasingly becoming the norm for an increasing number of medicinal products.
That is a good thing.
In this regard, too, Parliament has put its stamp on the legislation in no uncertain terms.
We should have liked more, but the compromise is acceptable.
It was very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to incorporate the environmental effects of medicinal products into that Community legislation.
REACH does not do this â a small error on the part of our brilliant commissioner.
That deficiency has now been remedied, however.
In the case of veterinary medicinal products, negative environmental effects can even lead to a blockade.
That is not the case with human medicinal products, but negative effects will indeed be taken into account.
I am happy that the Commission has spoken out on Doha and stated that it will present legislation in early 2004.
We shall hold the Commission to this.
American advertising of medicinal products is and remains banned.
We in the Verts/ALE Group welcome this.
We shall have to discuss later on how provision of information to patients can be improved via websites and telephone helplines, and indeed that is the crux of the matter.
Direct patient reporting did not make it.
Member States can develop this further, however, and some of them will do so, and the subject will return to the agenda later.
The line between food supplements and medicinal products is not sufficiently well defined.
Let us hope that the Commission will conduct an accommodating policy on this.
Homeopathic medicinal products did not make it.
We in the Verts/ALE Group shall continue to fight for these.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my thanks to the two rapporteurs.
I think we have a good compromise package on the table and I will work to ensure that this House votes for it by a large majority tomorrow.
The most important point, in my view, is that we will have a uniform system of protection in Europe.
Regardless of whether we think that eight or nine years is the right period, I believe it is very important, in an internal market, that we do not have the differences which have hitherto existed in Europe.
That is a major step forward.
I also greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to achieve an additional year of protection for existing substances.
Progress sometimes proceeds at a snailâs pace, and it is not always a new substance that brings improvements.
Sometimes, improvements can also be achieved through studies on existing substances.
I think we have achieved very important progress here.
Let me remind you that at first reading, there were a number of points which were already non-contentious but were nonetheless very important.
We need to speed up procedures.
We also need to speed up the procedures further where particularly important medicines are concerned, and we need an adjustment of the structures of the European Medicines Agency to the EU of the Twenty-Five.
All this is very positive.
I also think we were right to reject the Commissionâs proposal on information and advertising.
The Commissioner has expressed his regret yet again that this was the case, saying that the Commission was proposing to modernise this part of the legislation.
I am still sceptical.
Let me give you a specific example to show why I am so sceptical.
The industry claims that it merely wants to provide information and naturally has no intention of engaging in the type of aggressive advertising that we are familiar with from the USA.
A few weeks ago, I was in Bratislava in Slovakia, which is not yet part of the EU but thankfully will be joining on 1 May 2004.
Opposite my hotel, there was a large billboard.
It showed two people â a couple â lying listlessly in bed.
Above them, there was Pfizerâs little blue pill â Viagra â and the name of the website:
I thought to myself: âSo this is the objective information that the industry wants to supply to patients via the Internet.â
This was advertising, and I for one would prefer not to have this type of advertising in Europe.
It is not that I have anything against Viagra, but I think that in view of its side effects, Viagra should not be marketed on the Internet but should be prescribed by doctors.
Objective information should also not be supplied in the manner depicted on the billboard.
That is why I think we were right to reject this proposal and accept Mrs GrossetÃªteâs compromise.
I think we have achieved a great deal.
Sadly, we have surrendered on one point, Commissioner.
We said that we would not include paediatric medicinal products in this legislation so that the rules on paediatrics could be adopted more swiftly than the overall package.
Unfortunately, we still do not have a proposal from the Commission.
Regrettably, I must say to the Commissioner that the Commission should keep its Christmas break short.
We expect your proposal on paediatric medicinal products in January.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, my heartfelt thanks to the two rapporteurs.
The amendments improve the common position, but, as far as I am concerned, it is not necessary to wrap the pharmaceutical industry up in cotton wool any longer or any more.
At the start of the second reading, I put a number of questions regarding the new Member States on the table.
I shall not pursue these, as I fully agree with what my colleagues MrÂ Blokland and MrsÂ Jackson have said on this subject.
The second point is much more fundamental and concerns the manufacture of medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis.
In early December it became known that AIDS has claimed five million lives over the last five years.
This is a serious situation, but there is hope.
On 30Â August, on the eve of the WTO Conference in Cancun, the United States, the EU and developing countries came to an agreement speeding up the enablement of the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries.
It was not an enormous agreement, but it was a start nevertheless.
However, we must now put that into practice.
I cannot understand why the Council, the Commission and some fellow MEPs are not prepared to do what the European Union decided before the Cancun Conference.
The Commission seems to be of the opinion that this matter belongs with the Community patent and national patents legislation.
That does not seem to me to be an acceptable stance, because we do have data protection.
That is exactly what this legislation is about.
A minute ago, Commissioner, you asked me to name a specific medicinal product that cannot now be manufactured on account of data protection, and AZT is such a medicinal product.
Now, as it was at first reading, Parliament is prepared to get involved, and several resolutions have been adopted, for example the report by MrsÂ SandbÃŠk from the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which unanimously called for the Doha agreement to be implemented in this legislation.
Finally, I have two questions for you, Commissioner.
Firstly, you have just said that you are prepared to introduce, in the near future, the legislative measures enabling the implementation of the decision of 30Â August.
When can we expect a proposal from you, and is it possible that that will take place in January?
Secondly, I am assuming that products manufactured in the European Union are always authorised in the EU. Are you now stating that the data protection in this legislation does not constitute the slightest obstacle to the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries by European undertakings?
If not, are you prepared to amend this legislation again if necessary?
Â Â  MrÂ President, may I add my voice to the fully deserved congratulations my fellow Members have offered to the two rapporteurs, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and MrsÂ MÃŒller?
We can agree that what we have here is a hard-won compromise, a compromise in which a large number of Parliamentâs wishes, in particular, are also fulfilled.
It is not Parliament who is the winner here, however.
The winner is the citizen, who will soon be given the possibility of obtaining a good supply of medicinal products, quickly and efficiently.
A compromise cannot be achieved, however, without some watering down.
I accept that it is not possible to win on every point.
May I add some criticisms, however?
The first relates to the decision on pharmacists that was taken in the compromise.
I understand that that amendment did not fit in the legislation as it stood.
A good supply of medicinal products also requires, however, that pharmacists make their know-how available, not only to patients, but also, in particular, to those writing out the prescriptions.
That is an omission.
If we do not regulate this here and now, I shall fight for its regulation in further legislation dealing with the quality of health care.
As far as I am concerned, it must not be the case that the only places still concerned with medicinal products are supermarkets, because it is cheaper that way.
My second point concerns homeopathic medicinal products.
On this subject, the compromise achieved does all users of these medicinal products a great injustice.
I ask myself why the compromise that has now been achieved would fail if we now voted for a couple of original amendments, such as Amendment NoÂ 20.
I know that some fellow Members have requested a separate vote.
I have the feeling that we are failing to answer the questions of many on that point.
I should like a definite answer to the following question.
Why do we not go further with these homeopathic medicinal products?
After all, what has now been adopted in this compromise does not by any means present a solution.
I am genuinely sad about this.
My next point concerns Doha and medicinal products.
I agree with MrsÂ Corbeyâs comments.
Unlike my fellow MEP MrÂ Liese, I think that it is a shame that we still do not consider our European citizens fit for independence when it comes to information on medicinal products.
I am not in favour of advertising; I am, however, in favour of information.
I think that an independent citizen should be able to obtain the information he or she needs in Europe, too, instead of being redirected from the website of a European undertaking to that of a US undertaking to find this information.
I think that that is a shame.
We have missed an opportunity.
Those were my remarks, and I should like an answer from the Commission regarding homeopathy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the space of one minute I can only paint a sketchy picture of the rapporteursâ work, and I apologise to them in advance.
I recognise all that they have done.
I would simply like to say to you that the compromise, which consists in providing medicines with data protection for eight years, plus two, plus one, is a great New Year gift from the European Parliament to the pharmaceutical industry and recognition of the effectiveness of powerful lobbies.
This gift will, however, further deepen the deficits for the Member Statesâ social security budgets by delaying the marketing of generic medicines.
Why such generosity?
The pharmaceutical industry put forward the reason that it must fund research, but studies have proven that only a fifth of new medicinal products launched on the market during the last twenty years were really innovations.
In addition, the New York Times writes that two thirds of medicinal products approved between 1989 and 2000 were only minor modifications of existing medicinal products.
Furthermore, if our social security systems urgently need generic medicines, then what about developing countries where 95% of AIDS victims live and where there are also a large number of endemic diseases?
There, the lack of generic medicines is,quitesimply, criminal.
Amendment NoÂ 19 of the GrossetÃªte report refers to this.
For goodness sake, let us adopt this and uphold the spirit of Doha.
Let us at least set our solidarity with the developing world against the pharmaceutical lobbies.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller for their personal commitment.
There is a lot of good in the package before us but, if we are honest, there are a lot of problems as well.
We have tried to do too much, too fast, with the threat of conciliation and enlargement used as the big stick to knock us into line.
I object.
In the months and years ahead we will pay the price, not least to the lawyers who unfortunately will have a field day.
Commissioner Liikanen, you mentioned that one of the objectives included the need to prepare for enlargement.
I say to you that a race to conclude this package before enlargement is not the same thing.
On the Human Medicines Directive, concerns have been raised that, with the wide definition of medicinal products and the supremacy clause, it is possible that food and food supplements, cosmetics and medical devices could all be classified as drugs.
The Commission's and the Council's solution to this problem is to insert wording in recital 7 Amendment No 60 to the effect that: 'Where a product comes clearly under the definition of other product categories ... this directive should not apply', thereby distinguishing between medicinal products and other products.
The problem with this solution is that recital 7 will not have any legally binding effect.
Indeed this recital will not actually go into the Pharmaceuticals Directive itself.
I have seen an expert legal opinion which advises that, unless modified, the Pharmaceuticals Directive will completely subsume the Food Supplements Directive.
I have two specific questions on this, which I would like you to answer, Commissioner.
Why did the Commission and the Council not propose that the recital 7 wording should go into the operative article of the directive to ensure that it has legal effect?
What assurance can the Commission give that even if recital 7 wording is not put into an operative part of the directive, it will still be effective in addressing the problem of borderline or frontier products?
The Veterinary Medicinal Directive would have benefited significantly if it had been dealt with on its own rather than as part of a package.
It has not had the scrutiny it deserves, not least in the working groups where it has been dragged along in the wake of the Human Medicines Directive.
Commissioner Liikanen, you accepted my amendment consolidated Amendment No 3 at first reading over 12 months ago on the prescription-only medicines issue.
You accepted this in principle, but the text presented to the Council and hence the second reading in Parliament of the common position amounted to the deliberate thwarting of the clearly expressed will of Parliament on three occasions and your own will as Commissioner.
The common position now requires all medicines for use in food-producing species to be subject to veterinary prescription, but with the possibility of an exempted list of medicines being available without prescription.
From considerable correspondence with you, Commissioner, it is clear to me that the exemptive list will contain very few medicines and is not a solution.
Medicines must be available to the farmer in a sensible manner.
Animal welfare and food safety must be our priority.
We all appreciate the ability to purchase certain medicines over the counter, without the need to go to the doctor.
Simple pain relievers, cough medicines, vitamin supplements are cases in point.
Likewise the farmer should have access to certain medicines without the need to consult a veterinary surgeon.
By making access to medicines too difficult, use will decline and animal welfare will suffer.
The use of preventative medicines such as vaccines will decline and we will end up treating sick animals with antibiotics, as opposed to protecting the animal against disease.
This is not a food safety issue.
All our information confirms that residues arise from medicines that are already the subject of a prescription regime in all Member States, namely antibiotics.
Putting even more medicines into the prescription regime will do nothing for food safety.
Food safety can only be improved by intensive monitoring programmes and large penalties for anyone who violates the residue limits.
I very much welcome the proposed resolution of the present crisis concerning the availability of veterinary medicines for a range of minor species, including equine veterinary medicines, but this crisis arose because of inadequate scrutiny and inadequate understanding of a previous directive.
In conclusion, there is no public veterinary medicine as in human medicine, only private veterinary medicine.
We have an extra duty of care on grounds of animal welfare, the integrity of the veterinary practice, the truth about the impact of the food chain and, most importantly, the economic viability of our farmers.
We turn to you to ensure that in future there is protection in all these areas, and proper scrutiny, particularly of the Veterinary Medicines Directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs.
The pharmaceutical review is important for EU citizens.
In this review we are not only encouraging research and innovation but we are also trying to get generic medicines on to the market more quickly.
This will cost the taxpayer less.
Considering that the drugs bill in the UK has gone up in the region of 30% in the last three years, it is no wonder that a sensible pharmaceutical compromise is necessary.
We have a compromise package on offer: either Parliament accepts a compromise or we go into a conciliation process in which we risk losing much of what Parliament has wanted.
I urge colleagues to back the compromise on offer.
As one of the movers of the original amendments, I warmly welcome the introduction of Braille on the information packaging that patients receive.
Product names will appear in Braille form on the packaging and a full information text will be available in a range of formats, including Braille, on request.
I would have preferred more, but I accept the compromise as a step in the right direction in giving access to information to blind and partially sighted people.
This is a balanced piece of legislation and one which I feel happy to support.
I hope that colleagues will support the compromise.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank Mrs GrossetÃªte for her excellent work on this report.
The tragedy is that human and veterinary medicines have been confused rather, because both of them are combined in one report.
We should really be looking at them quite separately.
I will come back to that in a moment.
On that score I agree totally with what Mrs Doyle said.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank both the UK and the Irish Permanent Representatives for their work.
It is a pity that their work on this report has been rejected by some Member States.
The Council's co-called common position is not at all a compromise: it is merely a way of expressing the Commission's original proposals, and the Commission has made it clear that any listing of products arising from comitology proposals will largely be under its control.
The common position would mean, as Mrs Doyle quite rightly said, that many rural small businesses would be put out of business.
That is of particular importance.
There has been huge confusion here and this is where the Council seems to have got it totally and utterly wrong that we are asking for exemption for prescription medicines.
That is not the case: they are already covered under food safety regulations and completely off the record as far as we are concerned.
We are not asking for that sort of thing.
Mrs Doyle quite rightly said that while you can go to the chemist's and get a pill for a headache, the problem is that in the United Kingdom and Ireland you can go to similar locally registered people where you can get flea powder, teat-dip for cows all those sort of things. And we are going to put at risk not only animal health but also animal welfare and the whole principle, because people just will not bother to pay the money for a vet.
That is very important.
This is already covered, as I have already said, by legislation.
In the United Kingdom we do not eat horses, dogs, cats, or budgerigars for that matter, so these should not apply.
I would say to you that if you cannot accept this sort of proposal then maybe we should have taken veterinary medicines out of this particular proposal and had a separate piece of legislation for it.
In fact, tomorrow, if you are not prepared to accept what Mrs Doyle and I are saying, it might be an idea to vote against this particular piece of legislation and send it back to committee.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House and our fellow Members have contributed, through their many amendments over the last two weeks, to ensuring that we could achieve a good compromise with the Council.
I believe this compromise is a gift to European citizens and not, as some Members of the House might think, to the pharmaceuticals industry.
I take a different view.
Those of us who have worked intensively on this package of legislation and are familiar with the details also know that the situation is different.
With the EMEA, we have created efficient structures which safeguard the quality of evaluations, thus ensuring that safe medicinal products are available to patients.
We have a database containing a wealth of information for patients, doctors and, indeed, for companies themselves.
We have transparent authorisation procedures, and we have information about adverse reactions, to cite just a few examples of what we have achieved for patients.
We have a centralised authorisation procedure which covers a wide range of indications.
As a result, a great many new and innovative medicinal products are subject to the centralised procedure and can be made available at an early stage to patients.
We have asked the Commission to compile information and guidelines to ensure that the information supplied to patients is genuinely independent.
All these are things which directly benefit patients.
In five yearsâ time, we will have a new authorisation procedure, which will include a cost-benefit analysis.
In other words, we have achieved a great deal for patients.
That is why I would ask everyone to be rather more cautious, perhaps, in their arguments for and against this package.
On the two points concerning the WTO, I have tabled an amendment myself, but I think the most sensible approach is for the Commission to put forward a proposal next year which deals fully with this topic and does not simply produce detailed legislation on the hoof, which would not be a good approach.
I therefore urge all fellow Members who may have a rather critical viewpoint to support this compromise tomorrow.
It will benefit Europeâs citizens, and that is a real gift to patients, no one else.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on having produced very good reports.
I want to state at the beginning that I totally support the view put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on homeopathic medicine.
However, as the report I want to deal with tonight is on prescription-only medicine, those are probably the only pleasant comments I will make tonight.
Is this something you really want to take forward?
Both Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle asked whether this should not have come forward in separate legislation.
Surely common sense, somewhere, some time, must prevail, even within the European Commission.
Surely!
You must listen to what people are saying and the concerns that they have.
Is this not, once again, total interference in the internal affairs of people within their own nation state?
When will you ever learn?
I wish to speak on prescription-only medicine because it will have a tremendous effect on my constituency in Northern Ireland.
We have an efficient, workable, effective system of agricultural merchants.
Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle have said that they have the same system in their own areas as well.
It works, is effective and does not need to be scrutinised in this way.
It has done that for centuries.
What harm has ever been done by those agricultural merchants?
All you will do, Commissioner, is drive this trade into the black market.
You will drive it underground.
You will drive people to sell on the black market, under the counter.
That is all you will do and that is what you have done in many other policies, from fishing to every other area in the European Union.
The European Union and the Commission are not listening to what the people on the ground are saying.
That is what you must do.
I know that this is essentially a UK, Irish and perhaps also a Dutch problem.
But we have that problem.
And you have to reflect on what we are doing.
I am amazed by the dictatorial attitude that has come forward from the Commission and indeed from some Member States that want their own way at all costs: get what you want, regardless of the rest!
This sends out the wrong message.
In my opinion that is not what Europe is all about.
Europe is about much more than this.
Europe can be much more than this.
You will deserve what you get, in the longer term, when they start to go underground.
I urge this House to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and others.
That is the way forward.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will reflect upon that, go back to your college of Commissioners and say that this has to be looked at again.
You must be flexible.
You must allow for what has been handed down and what works in certain areas at this moment in time.
Do not force decent, honest people to go underground; do not force them into the black market.
I am terribly unhappy that the United Kingdom Government is backing out and not supporting its industry through Coreper.
It is chickening out of the situation.
It says it is going to do it by the back door, which will end up placing a tremendous responsibility on farmers and many other people in my constituency and other areas.
Once again I ask you to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and the rest of us, as a way forward.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, I thank Mrs GrossetÃªte for her report and I support the last speaker.
The problem here is that whenever we try to put the whole of Europe together and try to bring in legislation that suits every Member State, one size does not fit all, and that is why I urge this House to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle.
Most of the medicines which at present farmers in Ireland and the UK buy not from vets but from general suppliers are either drenches for worms or vaccines and they are administered by the farmers.
Therefore, it is not the case that the vet will do the administration; these drugs will just be bought from the vets.
Vets will then have a monopoly on the sale of these commodities and it puts farmers again at a competitive disadvantage.
We have been told many times by the new world that farmers have to live in that they have to face up to responsibilities and the marketplace and yet here we are preventing them from being able to compete in buying those medicines.
It is absolutely crazy to try to force this through.
I echo again what Mr Nicholson said.
I rather fear that the UK Government, having said all along that it would support the farming industry so they would be able to buy these medicines from suppliers and not from vets, has capitulated and caved in.
Therefore, it is up to this Parliament to put this legislation forward in a way that will allow flexibility between Member States.
That is what we are being asked for.
A huge fuss is being made about food safety, but this is not the issue, because these drugs, wormers and vaccines can be bought from suppliers.
They can be registered there and therefore we will know when the farmers have bought them.
The farmers will then administer them, so there is no need go through all the procedure of veterinary prescription and vets-only medicines.
Therefore, I urge the House once again to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, all the same I would like to respond to some objections made by my fellow Members.
First of all, I am disappointed to see behind me that MrsÂ Jackson left a long time ago.
I would have liked to tell her what I am going to do and I will also give her an answer in writing tomorrow morning.
We have concerns regarding the enlargement countries.
These formed part of the discussions that we had with the Council and the Commission so that, quite rightly, the difficulties that some enlargement countries, but not all, could face with the application of this pharmaceutical legislation were taken into consideration.
We know, furthermore, that the Commission has made a commitment to propose derogations for some enlargement countries as soon as this legislative package is adopted.
Above all, however, I would also have liked to tell MrsÂ Jackson that, this morning, I received a letter from one of our observers from the Czech Republic who declared that he fully supported protecting data for eight years, plus two, plus one, feeling that this was an acceptable compromise between protecting data for six years and the proposal to protect it for ten years plus one.
He is completely aware that it is important to protect patent rights whilst allowing generic medicines to enter the internal market.
This is a letter which I will make available to my fellow Members.
It is not the only one that we have received in this area.
Furthermore, I would also like to reply to the British and Irish Members on the issue of veterinary medicinal products.
When I hear my fellow Member, MrsÂ Doyle, say that we have proceeded much too quickly, I really do find this rather appalling, being aware of the discussions that we have been having for months with the Commission and the Council; hours of discussions to quite rightly find a good compromise.
When it is an issue of animal safety, I believe that we cannot prevaricate on this issue either.
When it is an issue of animals raised for food production, you will understand that the concept of safety is essential in this case.
It is essential for us and it is essential for the Council.
We also had a large number of discussions about this too.
The British Members declared that there ought to be separate legislation, but that is what we have!
I would like you to look at the texts.
We have two directives and today we are discussing two directives.
One regards medicinal products for human use and the other regards veterinary medicinal products.
There are simply a number of provisions regarding the directive on medicinal products for human use that are the same as the provisions for the directive on veterinary medicinal products.
I would, therefore, like you to look closely at these texts, before speaking, in order to avoid this type of mistake.
When you refer to something that is specific to Britain and IrelandÂ âÂ and I hope that it is not because of this specific characteristic that you are going to take the risk of not adopting this compromiseÂ âÂ I would like to remind you that ArticleÂ 67 of the common position rightly provides for derogations, medicine by medicine.
You, therefore, already have the answer in the text.
All the same, I would like there to be a little more honesty in this type of discussion.
When you tell us that horses are not in fact part of the diet in the United Kingdom, then you really should not forget, and you know this all too well, that when these horses are no longer of use in the United Kingdom, then they are exported to other Member States to end up on our butchersâ stalls.
This is why there should be much more safety regarding the prescription of veterinary medicinal products.
There are still many things to be said but I would like to finally conclude by stressing that we ended up with compromises that were especially difficult to reach and that the Italian Presidency made the necessary effort to consider a number of requests that it did not intend to take into consideration at the start, and it would be particularly serious to be responsible for not adopting these compromises.
Like my fellow Member MrsÂ MÃŒller, I appeal to your sense of responsibility: do not allow yourselves to adopt amendments that are not part of the compromises.
You would call these compromises into question.
That means to say that there would certainly be conciliation, MrsÂ Doyle, but it is not absolutely certain that we would obtain the results that we amassed today.
I therefore ask you to adopt these compromises tomorrow and, above all, not to risk, or be responsible for, allowing what we have achieved through weeks of work to run aground.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to reply to at least those Members who asked questions and who are still present.
Firstly, Mrs Corbey's written question on Doha.
If I rephrase your question it will be easier to give a reply.
I want to be very precise here.
Authorisation is needed for medicines only in the EU market, so this legislation concerns medicines which are authorised for the Community market.
Mrs Corbey asks whether I declare that data protection does not hinder and here I rephrase it the production of the medicines in the EU to be authorised in the developing countries.
If I rephrase it like this, then my reply is 'yes'.
It means that this legislation concerns the authorisation to market products in the EU.
If TRIPS and patents mean that products produced in one country can be exported to a developing country, this has no impact, because this protection only concerns authorisation to market: it is not linked to manufacturing.
We are not regulating manufacturing via this regulation, we are regulating authorisation to market.
There is one small exception: Bolar provision, because there is always some production as regards generics.
I fully share the concerns of Mrs Corbey, Mr Whitehead and many others that we must respect Doha.
Doha takes a strict position on the patent. It does not take a position on data protection.
Data protection is not linked to market authorisation outside the EU.
Products outside the EU will be authorised for placing on the market by the authorities of those third countries, according to their legislation.
I hope that this has clarified the situation.
This does not hinder in any way the implementation of Doha.
Secondly, as far as commitment is concerned, what I have said here before has been accepted by the whole college of Commissioners: it will be our first priority in early 2004, which is in two weeks' time.
I will do my best also to help my colleagues prepare, because not all the proposals fall under my direct responsibility.
I will, however, take this issue up once this has been voted.
Mrs Jackson raised the issue of the new Member States and asked how many of them have asked for a transition period.
So far none have asked, but for good reason: we cannot start to negotiate on transition periods before the legal act has been adopted.
Then we will be able to start negotiations.
My position which my colleagues support is positively open.
We understand the transition period is a problem here.
Mr Liese raised the issue of paediatric medicines.
I feel a little uncomfortable here because I personally told this House that a proposal would soon be forthcoming.
As I said before, the Commission decided that this proposal should go through an extended, in-depth assessment, which has delayed the procedure.
On the one hand, this is good for better regulation but, on the other hand, it has caused a delay.
We will do that early in 2004.
I will take personal responsibility here because it is my proposal.
Mr Liese also raised the question of direct consumer advertising.
He mentioned a case in Bratislava.
If you have been surfing the Internet or looking at your e-mail, you will have seen a lot of aggressive advertising which pops up on your screen and which you cannot do anything about.
That is an explosive problem which we must deal with, but I am sure we can come back to that in the future.
I turn now to the points made by Mrs Doyle, MrÂ Whitehead, Mr Parish and Mr Nicholson on veterinary medicine.
I know they feel very strongly about this issue.
Mrs Doyle has talked about it in committee and elsewhere and I understand her problem.
When we say that we can accept an amendment in principle, it would of course be more precise to say that the amendment should be subject to modification, because normally, permanent derogation will never go through in the Member States' institutions.
Permanent derogations are exceptional.
The compromise gives a limited exemption which should be applied in a harmonised manner.
It states, however, that Member States may grant exemption from this requirement according to criteria established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2).
So it will limit it, and this can be done on the basis of this compromise.
Mr Nicholson mentioned internal affairs.
That issue was raised in the Council and many Member States strongly contested that position.
They say that even though the medicines may not circulate on the internal market, meat, as a food product, circulates.
So there is an impact across the national borders.
That has been the position of many Member States and for reasons of internal market coherence they contested the possibility of having a permanent derogation in this area.
Unfortunately Mrs de Keyser has gone, because I would have liked to reply in even more depth to her comment.
Discussions regarding the pharmaceuticals industry are always problematic.
We have public objectives which are accepted across the board: we need to have better health that is what medicines are for.
But if there are no innovative new medicines we will not be able to tackle illness in the way we should.
There have been some success stories in the last 20 years for example, illnesses which were extremely difficult to handle without heavy treatment in closed institutions can now be treated with medicines.
But this cannot be done without innovation.
Twenty or thirty years ago people with mental illnesses were placed in institutions.
Today they can live freely, which means better quality of life and also lower costs.
So we need to pursue innovation.
Let us take the example of Alzheimer's Disease.
If we do not find any new, innovative medicines the cost will be enormous.
We must support innovation.
Somebody referred to the situation in America where exclusivity periods are shorter.
Compare the costs for a moment.
Because we in Europe cover the costs from public budgets we want to have a say in pricing levels.
The longer protection period gives some compensation for innovation, due to the lower prices.
I commissioned a study in 2000 to assess the state of the European pharmaceuticals market.
It showed that in Europe there are countries where, after the expiry of a patent or data protection, there is no change in the price level of generics.
They remain at the same price level.
So there are high prices when they are put under a patent and under data exclusivity and no change after that.
This proposal will certainly create a real European market for generics.
When the rules are the same and they are harmonised, I am sure the generic industry will profit from this opportunity.
We need to invest in innovative medicines in order to be able to tackle difficult diseases but, at the same time, we need to push prices of generics down to reduce the costs.
That is the balance we want to achieve.
I am personally convinced that in that area this House has been working on very good balance.
Finally, I want to thank this House for a good debate.
It has been very committed in its work throughout this period.
I must also say that not all the issues have been solved here, but we all have worked very hard and very well to find a compromise which is good for public health and innovation.
Â Â  Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on a point of order?
I would appreciate it if you would tell me under which Rule you are requesting a point of order.
Â Â  I am always polite.
That means that I am always sitting in this Chamber to hear the answers of the Commissioner.
If the Commissioner does not give me an answer regarding homeopathic medicine, then I will convince him tomorrow, when a large part of this House will vote against some compromises because we did not get an answer.
Â Â  Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you know that this is not a point of order.
It is a political position.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a question to the Commissioner.
My question to the Commissioner was crystal clear, and I should like a little bit more clarification on this.
Just to make sure we are all singing from the same hymn sheet: the Doha amendment serves to enable manufacture for developing countries lacking that capacity themselves.
Am I to understand from your answer that we are sending unauthorised medicinal products to developing countries?
If so, those developing countries must then authorise them themselves, but how can they do this if they ...
Â Â  Mrs Corbey, this is not a point of order.
I cannot reopen the discussion on this matter.
I understand, but I cannot reopen a discussion that has already taken up so much time.
You do not have a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, mine is as much a point of order as the last two were.
I asked two specific questions on the Human Medicines Directive, particularly on the definition of a medicinal product, and recital 7 on the legality of it.
Maybe those two specific questions could be answered by the Commissioner.
They are important.
Â Â  Again, that is not a point of order.
I will make myself clear.
The Commissioner has answered questions, naming each Member that took the floor.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, please!
I heard the Commissioner answer the questions of each Member, mentioning the names.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the middle of my reply there was a lot of shouting in the House, so I had to conclude earlier than planned.
However, I am ready to continue my reply.
In response to Mrs Corbey, I should like to clarify that there is a difference with regard to manufacturing authorisation - Doha concerns manufacturing.
We fully support it.
Authorisation to market is regulated by this directive which is before the House.
It in no way limits Doha for they are handling different parts of the issue.
If, according to Doha, manufacturing is allowed for developing countries, the authorisation to market in developing countries will be given to the authorities of the countries.
The question is that this data is needed for authorisation to market.
On the issue raised by Mrs Doyle concerning recital 7: it is an explanation of the clause provided for in Article 2(2); the provision contains only the legal wording of the clause.
I said, in part, when I replied to Mrs GrossetÃªte, that my services will discuss with all interested parties the proper application of this issue.
With regard to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's question, on Amendment No 20, which asks for Member States to take due account of products registered in other Member States, our position is that the common position goes beyond that amendment because it submits these products to mutual recognition.
I have tried to reply to all the questions that were raised.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Î5-0452/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on traditional herbal medicinal products (12754/1/2003 C5-0519/2003 2002/0008(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Nistico).
Â Â  MrÂ President, after this report on the legislative package regarding medicinal productsÂ âÂ a report that, as we have seen, made veins and pulses tremorÂ âÂ my report is like drinking a relaxing cup of camomile tea.
I am in fact extremely satisfied, and I would, therefore, like to thank both the Council and the Commission, and also all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular MrsÂ Roth-Behrendtwho I am sorry to say is not here today because she has the fluÂ âÂ and she apologises for her absence âÂ and of course all the Members who contributed to improving this directive.
The directive, as adopted, finally brings order to an area that is very confused and much debated.
On the one hand, it precisely states the scope of the directive and excludes the use of herbal products as provided for in the other directives; on the other hand, in the interests of consumers and their health protection, it specifies characteristics regarding quality and good production practice.
Whilst the value of therapy with traditional herbal products must be recognised, it must also not be forgotten that inappropriate use can lead to the emergence of undesired side effects, sometimes serious ones.
So far, for example, the âFood and Drug Administrationâ has registered about 2Â 900 cases of toxic effects, including, if you look closely, 104 deaths predominantly caused by abuse of ephedra, as well as serious side effects of other products that are used daily such as St Johnâs Wort, ginkgo biloba and also ginseng.
This is why it was important to adopt a directive that seeks to protect consumer health which, on the one hand, calls for better quality and safety standards, but also, on the other hand, for it to be obligatory for labels and illustrative leaflets to include rigorous scientific indications that are simple and clear for citizens about the potential toxicity of herbal medicines, as well as their interaction with food, drinks and other medicinal products when taken together.
As you know traditional herbal medicines mean those that have been in use for at least 30 years, of which 15 years in countries of the Community.
Nevertheless, at the request of an individual countryÂ âÂ and this was a reason for improving the directiveÂ âÂ and with a reasoned opinion from the Technical and Scientific Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), the period of use of 15 years can be significantly reduced.
Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products as part of the EMEA.
Parliament clearly indicated how this committee should be distinct from the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products.
It should deal with classification, with preparing a list of traditional medicinal herbs, with updating lists, with preparing relevant monographs, and with assessing dossiers in the event of disputes at national level.
At second reading, Parliament proposed and also adopted two amendments.
In particular, an initial amendment inserted in the recital intends to clarify, somewhat unnecessarily, the scope of the present directive by specifying that this only regards traditional herbal medicinal products, whilst the use of plants or herbs for food use fall under the current specific European legislation for food products.
The second amendment is merely a specification: it concerns inserting the word âtraditionalâ when talking about herbal products.
Both of the amendments were then adopted by the Council, as appears from the communication to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of 8Â December 2003.
After all, the current directive defines the harmonised legislative framework for all countries of the European Union in favour of free movement of traditional herbal medicinal products within the Community.
This guarantees, furthermore, the maximum level of public health protection on the basis of documentation requested regarding quality, efficacy and safety.
Â Â  . In January 2002 the Commission proposed its directive amending, as regards traditional herbal products, the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.
Now we have the possibility to adopt the legislation successfully in the second reading.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. NisticÃ², for his consistent effort in this.
What were the concerns that we wanted to address through the adoption of this legislative initiative?
The proposal aimed at guaranteeing a high level of health protection for European patients using traditional herbal products.
It was also intended to ensure a single market for herbal medicines by introducing harmonised rules and procedures.
To that end, the proposal provided for a simplified registration system for traditional herbal products.
The quality requirements to be met are the same as those for all medicinal products.
But to avoid unnecessary testing and burdens on firms, the legislation foresees that new pre-clinical and clinical trials will not be necessary when sufficient knowledge already exists about a particular product.
The Council common position is consistent with these objectives and main principles.
Moreover, it retains the substance of around two-thirds of the amendments proposed by the EP during its first reading.
On 27 November the parliamentary committee adopted two amendments.
The Council has already acknowledged that it finds these amendments acceptable.
The first aims at clarifying that foodstuffs (including herbal products) will continue to fall within the scope of food law.
The second aims at specifying the purpose of the list of herbal substances to be drawn up by the future committee on herbal medicinal products.
The Commission supports these two clarifications.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your efforts concerning the adoption of this directive, and in particular for the discussions over the past weeks leading to the possibility of successfully concluding the dossier during this second reading at the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to commend Mr NisticÃ² on his success in bringing Parliament and the Council together on the issues that remained outstanding during the second reading.
As a result of negotiations between all concerned, a compromise was agreed on prior to the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, allowing for a consensus incorporating only two amendments tabled by myself and other colleagues from an original list of ten amendments.
Under the first of these amendments, traditional herbal food products that are non-medicinal should continue to come under existing food legislation and not pharmaceuticals legislation.
The second amendment essentially provides that the list of herbal substances to be set up by the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products should only cover the medicinal use of herbal substances.
This would allow, for example, herbs to be used, along with vitamins and minerals, as food supplements and to come under food legislation.
This logical approach avoids overlapping jurisdictions.
The solution presented in the common position and the European Parliament's two amendments is eminently sensible and has the full support of the Commission.
I would urge colleagues to give them a positive vote tomorrow.
I welcome this directive, which recognises the value of medicinal plants as an important complement to modern chemical medicines.
The traditional and herbal medicines sector is one that is of increasing significance and is expanding in scope and popularity across the Community.
This directive allows for the fast-tracking of traditional medicinal herbs, which is most welcome.
However, we must look towards establishing systems that encourage research and development.
This was a key concern of mine in my former Amendment No 10, tabled in the Environment Committee, which was aimed, at one level, at avoiding the constraints imposed by an overly narrow and historical definition of traditional medicines, to further product development.
This amendment was withdrawn in the interest - shared by all of us here - of maintaining the integrity of the directive.
As in the conventional medicines field, innovation must be encouraged in this area and we must look to the future as well as to the past.
I hope that when the Commission reviews this directive in three years' time it will recognise that this is a dynamic field and one in which new products are constantly emerging.
While efficacy and safety must never be compromised, we need to look at building in mechanisms that will allow traditional medicines to continue to evolve in terms of their application and use and the better exploitation of the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants.
This is an exciting area, one that we must not be afraid of, and one that will not benefit from over-regulation.
We must protect the consumer in terms of efficacy and safety, but at the end of the day we must leave the choice with the consumer.
Again, I thank Mr NisticÃ² for his sympathetic acceptance of colleagues' views and of our amendments in the various areas.
I thank him for his cooperation throughout.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank our rapporteur, Professor NisticÃ², who has done a lot of work considering how controversial this debate was in first reading.
The directive based on the common position text will introduce a regulatory regime for traditional herbal medicines, giving the public assurances as to safety and quality, as well as systematic consumer information relating to traditional herbal remedies sold over the counter.
The common position incorporates significant additional areas of flexibility over the scope of the directive, as had been sought by Labour MEPs, including a number of herbal interest groups as well.
These include greater flexibility to take account of evidence of traditional use from outside the EU and the possibility of vitamins and minerals being added to traditional herbal remedies which are ancillary to the activity or the active herbal ingredients.
It is due to this progress that we have had very few people disagreeing with our approach during this second reading.
As I described in first reading, presently consumers are unaware of some shoddy practices going on in this sector.
Last year I gave the example of echinacea root.
Over the past few weeks there has been some debate over echinacea due to a report by the University of Washington in Seattle questioning its effectiveness.
However, there are plenty of other reports highlighting its effectiveness and, as a user of this product, I believe it helps especially at this time of year in combating colds.
Sadly, in information provided to me analysing four different echinacea root products only one contained what it claimed it had on the label.
This is not good for echinacea and certainly not good for the consumer.
One product failed to comply because of excessive amounts of ash and acids in soluble ash.
Another did not contain echinacea root at all and another had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder, as was claimed on the label.
This means that when I purchase this product I have a one in four chance of getting what is described on the label.
This is just not good enough.
That is why the Consumers' Association, the British Herbal Medical Association, the European Herbal Practitioners' Association, the UK National Institute of Medical Herbalists, the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, the International Register of Consultant Herbalists and similar herbal practitioners across Europe back this initiative.
The message from genuine manufacturers who love the herbal sector is clear: they need basic regulations which reward quality producers and give consumers the standards they deserve.
The herbal sector is no longer a cottage industry.
It is a multi-million-dollar industry, and genuine manufacturers who are doing the right thing are suffering commercially because cowboy dealers are breaking the rules.
We need regulation in this sector in order to protect the consumer and reward those decent producers making quality products.
I hope Members will back this recommendation for second reading and the sooner this becomes law, the better.
I should like to thank Professor NisticÃ² once again.
Â Â  Mr President, this directive is supposed to harmonise the legislative framework for traditional herbal medicines.
While I believe it is very important that we try to cut out cowboys and people who operate in a completely unacceptable manner, this legislation was supposed to provide a simplified registration procedure that would allow the registration and marketing of certain traditional herbal medicines that have been on the market for a specific period of time.
In the first reading it was quite clearly limited to herbal medicinal products or pharmacological activity and excluded food supplements.
Many feel that it is extremely important to protect the herbal supplements already on the markets of most Member States.
These herbal supplements should be regulated under food law.
We need to safeguard the long-term future of traditional medicines, which I believe are much more important and beneficial than the synthetic and pharmaceutical approaches to health care.
Member States must also be allowed to introduce national rules on their territory to accommodate any traditional or non-conventional approaches to health care not covered by the directive.
Health care must take precedence over commercial considerations.
Where Member States wish to have control over any health care tradition that they consider to be of value to their citizens, they should be entitled to do so, regardless of the aspirations for commercial harmonisation.
Harmonisation should not mean that diversity is destroyed.
European citizens have a right to retain their local cultural traditions.
This is particularly important where the cultural traditions relate to health care products that are not yet scientifically understood.
Traditional medicines should be protected as living traditions.
In many EU countries traditional medicine is a living tradition that has continued to evolve over many years and has the capacity to continue to evolve.
The natural evolution of traditional medicine is stunted by this directive that defines 'traditional' in a purely historical context and restricts its application to what took place many years ago.
The scope of traditional medicine is greater than the directive recognises.
This must be taken into account.
Traditional medicines are used extensively to treat a wide range of serious conditions in Member States, which should be entitled to introduce appropriate regulation to accommodate such practices.
I believe that if you stunt the possibility for traditional medicines, you are doing a disservice to the consumer and the public.
Everyone recognises that there are people who act in an unorthodox manner, but I believe that traditional medicine is much more beneficial, in the long term, than the pharmaceutical approach.
Â Â  MrÂ President, many people have good experiences of using herbal medicine to supplement ordinary medicine and treatment.
Herbal medicine must, moreover, be seen as an ecologically sound alternative to the many unnatural chemicals we let out into the environment in the form of chemical medicine.
The area of natural medicine is far from being fully charted.
There are presumably many good products around the world that we have still not used or with which we are unfamiliar in Europe.
We must not rule out the development of all these known and unknown ecologically sound medicinal preparations.
That is what I in actual fact think we are doing with the directiveâs demand for approval and registration.
In Denmark, we obtained a similar regulation of herbal preparations a few years ago.
From previously having approximately 2Â 500 different products, there are now only 50 approved products.
Well-educated and experienced therapists now complain about the lack of legal access to many important preparations for treating, for example, cancer and allergies.
I cannot therefore support the directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I appreciate that a large number of people will benefit enormously from this directive - the lobbyists and those who are entertained by them.
But vast numbers of UK suppliers of herbal medicines are small business people, often sole traders, for whom the prospect of having to register products under this directive will be a burden too great to contemplate.
The result will inevitably be the decline of the small specialist shopkeeper in favour of the large pharmaceutical companies.
With this proposed directive we are seeing yet another imposition of the Nanny State, creating laws where none currently exist in the UK, for a well-established small market whose consumers are invariably well informed.
The proposed amendments will disallow the registration of significant numbers of products currently recognised as traditional herbal medicines, on which many people depend for their wellbeing and in which they have great faith.
My party is totally opposed to this legislation, which we see as yet another area in which harmonisation is being imposed to the detriment of the freedom of individuals.
Â Â  Mr President, I understand that the purpose of this proposal is to allow the regulation of herbal medicines under a simplified procedure.
However, it is a fact that producers, retailers and consumers have been astonished and dismayed by the cascade of highly restrictive legislation dealing with such products that have been safe and available in certain Member States including my own for many years.
We have heard from certain colleagues, particularly in the UK, that is also the case there.
We need simple, basic regulation to protect the consumer because there are, as Mrs Stihler has said, products that purport to contain herbal remedies that do not actually contain those herbals.
However, while doing that, we need to ensure that products are not withdrawn from the market as a result of legislation and we cannot be certain that this is going to be the case under the present procedures.
I welcome the clarification that the amendments make to the report.
It is particularly important to clarify that the Committee for Herbal Medicines should only deal with products for medicinal use, not food use.
I, like MrsStihler, use echinacea.
I also use garlic.
Garlic is an extremely potent medicinal remedy; it is also a food in wide circulation.
We risk making a nonsense of ourselves if we allow this committee to deal with food products.
I want to emphasise this point to the Commissioner and I hope he takes it on board.
I would like to thank all the colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their hard work, but it is a fact that there is a great diversity of traditions within the Community and the harmonisation of this legislation really risks losing products that are in safe use and have been in safe use for years.
Our citizens will not accept this.
I give the Commissioner full warning that if this ensues it will not be a happy result either for the Member States or for Brussels.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Î5-0458/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on measuring instruments (9681/4/2003 â C5-0417/2003 â 2000/0233(COD)) (Rapporteur: MrÂ Chichester).
Â Â  . Mr President, we now come to a measure of great length, weight, size, volume, thickness and complexity with the capacity to affect a wide range of instruments.
National legislation on measurements and measuring instruments has been with us a long time.
It precedes European legislation and reflects the importance of accuracy of measurement on the daily life of people.
All EU and developed countries have metrological institutes charged with the task of establishing traceability of measurement results.
The first question to ask is: why the interest in measuring instruments?
The answer is because all developed countries have complex economies which need a minimum level of measurement accuracy for fair trading in the public interest.
Thus all legislation is based on the premise that the public interest is served if measuring instruments are subjected to legislative requirements that guarantee this minimum level of accuracy.
A number of concepts or issues are raised in this proposal.
Optionality: Amendment No 2 essentially states that a Member State will be free to decide whether or not to regulate in this field.
However, Member State legislation should not act as a technical barrier to completion of the internal market, nor cause unfair competition.
Regarding harmonised standards, in order to meet the essential requirements for any of the instruments covered by this directive, the manufacturer must show conformity in one of three ways as made clear in Amendment No 21.
It is important that manufacturers have the choice between the requirements in new Annex 2, together with the detail of the instrument-specific annexes M1 to M10, or by applying the relevant European harmonised standard, or by compliance with the relevant parts of the normative documents adopted by the OIML and approved by the new measuring instruments advisory committee and published in the Official Journal.
This advisory committee also has an important regulatory role which is why new Compromise Amendment No 30 is so crucial in requiring proper consultations with representatives of interested parties i.e. the industry and practitioners.
Perhaps the most important improvement to the common position lies in Compromise Amendment No 32: the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission regarding conformity assessment procedures.
It has been a matter of much concern to your rapporteur that there is inconsistency between the conformity assessment modules in Council Decision 93/465/EEC and Annexes A to H1 of the common position.
After much discussion, the compromise position has yielded a commitment to review both texts and bring forward a full set of coherent conformity assessments very soon, which I believe will make industry much more content.
In which context I thank the presidency for its measured but constructive approach and I thank the Commission for being instrumental in finding the compromise text.
One matter remains before this long process reaches conclusion.
That concerns our desire to distinguish between manufacturers and traders in the definition of terms in this proposal.
If the Commissioner is willing to give an undertaking that he will include a review of the definitions in the overall review of the conformity modules I am mandated by the committee to withdraw Amendments Nos 3 and 11.
We naturally expect the Council to respect the spirit of cooperation and compromise involved so as to shorten the procedure.
I shall close by thanking my shadow rapporteur, MrÂ Glante, other colleagues, and the staff of the committee for their helpful and constructive work on this proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly, let me express my congratulations to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur, MrÂ Chichester, for his intensively prepared second reading report and by using the word 'intensively', I am not exaggerating.
The present proposal replaces ten existing directives and implements the principle of the new approach for technical harmonisation.
The aim of the proposal is to ensure appropriate consumer protection by imposing the use of high-quality instruments for measurement tasks, covering commercial transactions.
Examples are gas meters, electricity meters, petrol pumps and taxi meters.
The proposal imposes technical requirements, expressed in performance terms, allowing for different technical solutions to be applied, thus allowing innovative products to be developed and enhancing competitiveness in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
The proposal, however, does not use legal instruments to lay down which measurement tasks must be performed.
This remains the competence of Member States.
I am pleased that the rapporteur supports the common position concerning measuring instruments.
His amendments contain many good and useful suggestions, all of which the Commission can support.
In reply to the rapporteur's question, the revision of conformity assessment procedures, which has been agreed upon in the joint declaration and in Amendment No 32, also includes harmonisation of the definitions of specific terms used in certification, such as 'manufacturer', 'authorised representative', 'trader', etc.
With the Commissionâs support for Parliamentâs amendments, I trust that the Council will agree with you in a second reading.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, MrÂ Chichester, ladies and gentlemen, I was my groupâs shadow rapporteur during the first reading of this Measuring Instruments Directive, and have followed the inception, development and progress of this directive throughout the two readings.
The rapporteur has been kind enough to express his thanks to me, and I would like to take this opportunity to reciprocate.
He has shown a masterly grasp of this highly complex and technical subject matter and settled into the work very quickly during the second reading.
We worked well together.
I think it is important to say this, for although our political views diverge in a number of respects, we were able to collaborate very closely and productively on this project.
There is no point in seeking confrontation needlessly.
I would therefore like to reciprocate his thanks.
It was a great pleasure working with him.
As has already been mentioned, this new directive replaces ten existing directives.
It may thus be a small contribution to dismantling bureaucracy, which is something we are always calling for in a range of areas.
It remains a complex but also a very important directive.
On the issues of optionality and the distinction between manufacturers and traders â Amendment No 32 and Commissioner Liikanenâs statement play a key role here â there was vigorous debate about whether the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would be willing, yet again, to conclude the matter through an informal trialogue during the second reading.
I would like to reiterate â especially since I myself will have an opportunity to make a statement on my own report tomorrow â that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is showing good will and is happy to adopt this approach.
This must not, however, become the rule.
We are making these exceptions in order to speed up the procedure.
The compromises which have been found are acceptable.
The Commissionâs opinion and statement are good too.
Naturally, I very much hope, as do the rapporteurs and my fellow Committee members, that the Council will write this letter and submit this declaration accordingly so that we can actually conclude the matter and do not wind up in a conciliation procedure after all, on the basis of the compromise which has now been achieved.
Otherwise, I am very happy with the outcome.
I hope that European industry, users and manufacturers will be satisfied with it.
Perhaps you will permit me, at the end of our pre-Christmas session and almost at the end of the year, to express my hope that our British colleagues and above all the hospitality industry in Great Britain will be satisfied with the rules on measures for beer glasses.
I understand that this is a particular problem.
However, I think we have found a good solution here as well.
Thank you very much for the collaboration and particular thanks to the interpreters for providing their services at such a late hour in the evening.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations just expressed to our rapporteur.
At this time of night I cannot match him in using words skilfully in the form of puns as he did in his speech, but, well done!
I am pleased that we will be able to present this to the public as a move towards efficiency and clarity.
This will not get big headlines in newspapers for the rapporteur or anyone else, but it is extremely important for the public to have clarity and security in the measuring instruments used as listed for items of public health, public safety, public order, protection of the environment and, indeed, the levying of taxes and duties and the protection of consumers and fair trading.
All those public goods need accurate, trustworthy measurements, and in the European Union we need to get rid of the barriers to trade that might exist without such instruments.
A quite considerable range of instruments has been mentioned, including water meters, taxi meters, exhaust-gas analysers and breathalysers.
We support, as Mr Glante has said, the principle of optionality: it is quite reasonable to give Member States a choice as to whether or not they regulate.
But with that choice goes a responsibility not to put up trade barriers or to be unfairly competitive.
The comitology issues that concern us appear to have been solved.
This is an example of the new approach to harmonisation.
We have to bear in mind that there may well be technological advances or problems we have not heard or thought of, perhaps, for example, electromagnetic interference.
The simplification, clarity and conciseness of the rapporteur are helpful.
I am glad that the Commission agrees and I look forward to the Council of Ministers taking the same approach.
The joint declaration on the procedures for ensuring conformity with the review of texts will be welcome.
I am glad that the countries which will be joining us in May 2004 will have an example of how Member States can make decisions in the context of a European Union which wants fair competition and does not want barriers to trade.
I am sure that they have been following this work with interest.
We hope there will be an agreement at second reading.
Our committee has a reputation for putting in hours of work in the form of informal trialogues.
Some of us sometimes question whether we are misguided in doing that in comparison with other committees such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
But my belief is that, so far, we have managed in an assertive way to put across our points of view.
I congratulate the rapporteur again.
Â Â  Mr President, after this memorable, perhaps even historic weekend, we should be making even more use of our right to ask questions.
Is what we are doing here really necessary?
Do we need it to the extent envisaged?
Is it not rather surprising that a fellow Member who generally lobbies for as little regulation as possible is now working in such technical detail?
Is it really a success for Europe if we have now more precise knowledge about the measures on beer glasses in Great Britain?
I doubt it very much.
Are we not on the wrong track?
Is it not precisely this form of regulation, which concerns neither product liability nor very clear principles, that is likely to lead us in quite the wrong direction?
Surely we need genuine transparency in our work, and that includes what we are doing here.
If we look around the group of fellow Members here, surely all we are doing is just patting each other on the back, with very high costs for the taxpayer.
Â Â  .
Mr President, it was not my intention to hog the debate, but in response to MrÂ Martin's question I should like to point out that, yes, harmonisation is necessary here.
In the light of the famous case law, harmonisation is necessary because national technical regulations conflict and separate conformity assessments are required.
The proposal in question based on the new approach replaces some 11 existing old-approach directives which allow for national legislation to exist alongside Community provisions and are technically outdated.
Harmonisation thus allows firms to gain from economies of scale and to improve the competitiveness of European firms in the global market.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the Members' Statute.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
Mr President, when the Council Presidency wrote to you on 21 November 2003, we stated clearly that the Council was fully open to dialogue with Parliament on this issue.
Moreover, that statement confirmed the offer made by the Greek Presidency, in the person of Mr Papandreou, on 20 June 2003.
That is why todayâs debate is important, providing us with an opportunity to move forward and to explore the possibility of reaching agreement at last after 25 years.
Mr President, the Council fully respects the primary role played by the European Parliament in drawing up the Statute for its Members.
According to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, it is Parliamentâs responsibility to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, which requires unanimity as regards taxation.
It is therefore clear that the European Parliament cannot introduce the Statute without the consent of the Council, and the Council cannot approve the Statute unless Parliament puts forward proposals it can accept.
It would be as well to remember this.
Mr President, I know that many of you are keen to know what the Council's position is on the Statute in general and, more specifically, on a number of proposals which have been made at different levels in recent weeks.
When Parliament forwarded its proposal for a Statute to the Council last June, it was clear that substantial differences existed between our respective positions, thus preventing the Council from giving its approval.
You will remember that, before that, last March, the Greek President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Papandreou, outlined to a Parliamentary delegation the parts of the Statute which were acceptable to the Council and which were not.
I regret to say that Parliament's June proposal was too far removed from the Councilâs positions and that made it impossible for us to give our approval.
I will, if I may, outline once again the Councilâs position on the key issues.
Firstly, the Council is of the unanimous view that we cannot modify primary law by means of the Statute: the aspects relating to primary law will therefore have to be regulated through a different instrument.
The Council welcomes the measures recently adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament on the reimbursement of expenses.
In the Councilâs opinion, this reimbursement must be carried out on the basis of costs actually incurred.
On taxation of Members of Parliamentâs salaries â a point which requires unanimous agreement in the Council for it to be able to give its consent â the provisions regarding the Community tax to be applied to the salaries received by MEPs must not prejudice the entitlement of the Member States to subject these salaries to their national tax system, provided that the salaries are not taxed twice over.
As regards retirement age, while there was a clear preference in the Council for a retirement age of 65 years, we would, in a constructive spirit of compromise, be prepared to accept a limit of 63 years.
As regards the difficult question of salary, the Council does not have any objection to determining the figure by taking as reference a particular percentage of the salary of a Judge of the Court of Justice, an approach which would solve the problem of annual adjustment.
I would draw your attention to the fact that all the positions I have just outlined are the result of lengthy, detailed Council debates that took place a long while before the Parliament approved its Statute on 3 June 2003.
As regards some recent initiatives put forward in Parliament, the Italian Presidency has witnessed a positive initial response from all the delegations in the Council.
Should these initiatives secure the support of Parliament, we would be closer than never before to agreement on this longstanding issue.
As I stressed at the start of my speech, dialogue is the only way to eliminate our differences and the Council is ready for dialogue.
For its part, the Italian Presidency has always been willing to find a solution and I know that the incoming Irish Presidency fully endorses this approach.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me firstly to say that the Commission has received the initiatives of the rapporteur and of the Italian Presidency in relation to the Membersâ Statute with great satisfaction.
I sincerely hope that, after such a drawn-out debate over so many years, we will be faced with the real possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue which has been dragging on for such a long time.
I would therefore like once again to acknowledge the effort and work over all this time by Mr Rothley, who has worked in the most dedicated and tenacious fashion in favour of this House, and everybody should be grateful to him.
At the moment, the Commission does not wish to enter into the detailed content of this initiative, since we do not yet have the official proposal.
However, perhaps I could remind the honourable Members of the position we adopted following the approval of the Statute last June.
At that time the Commission issued an opinion which contained two general observations: firstly, in relation to the provisions of the Statute which are governed by primary law; secondly, with regard to the financial implications of the Statute.
In the first case we said that the provisions of the Statute cannot be modified by means of a fundamental act, on the basis of Article 190 of the Treaty, and in the second case, we indicated that the sums in question would represent a significant burden for category 5 of the financial perspectives.
Logically, all of this referred to a text which was different to the current one.
We will now have to see exactly the form the text takes in order to be able to give a detailed opinion.
In any event, Mr President, the Commission will always be constructive and of course we fervently hope that an agreement can be reached between the institutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me be quite frank and say that many of us feel ill at ease today.
Why?
If we were to take ourselves and our resolutions really seriously, then this oral question could not be put, and there would certainly be no resolution deviating from the Membersâ Statute adopted on 3 June this year.
Another reason why we feel ill at ease is that it seems strange that, four days after the collapse of the Intergovernmental Conference on âThe future of Europe â a European constitutionâ, we find ourselves, in a request for urgent debate, calling on the Council to agree on a Membersâ Statute, even though it has hitherto not done so or shown any desire to do so.
The constitution would be more important to us than the Statute, although there is no real connection between the two, but we do this nevertheless, and, all the same, the larger groups are tabling a joint motion for a resolution.
Why?
We do it because a statute for Members of the European Parliament is not about party-political, national, or individual interests or game-playing; on the contrary, the procedure and content should remain a matter of common concern.
We do it, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, because we deeply regret the dishonesty, the tactical considerations, the individual election strategies and the false conceptions of our roles that are involved.
The fact is that we are not meant to be engaging in dialogue with one another; it is for you to say âyesâ or ânoâ
to what we have adopted as a proposal for our Membersâ Statute, and because we want to abandon this shared path.
It is because we want to make it clear that it is the Council, which represents the national governments, and not this House, that must bear responsibility for this unsatisfactory state of affairs.
That is our final offer; our new message to you is that you must, by 15 January, say âyesâ or ânoâ.
Even though many of us regard the proposal on taxation as contrary to EU law, unjust and essentially wrong, we put forward this motion as a token of goodwill and of our awareness of the problems in the Council.
Taking discussions at national level on pensions into account, we are raising the pensionable age by three years.
Although a statute should also govern the functions of a Member of this House, we are dividing it and removing the elements of primary law, but that is where it stops, for we too have our dignity, and those who do not respect themselves will not be respected by others.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I hope that the moment of truth has come for the Membersâ Statute.
I would first of all like to acknowledge the perseverance and tenacity of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not as a member of my group but as a representative of Parliament as a whole, and also the perseverance of the President, because we have been working together for a long time and, before he was President, we had taken certain actions which I would like to remind you of in order to explain the points under discussion.
At the beginning of this legislature, after the adoption during the last one of the Rothley report, we created a working group in order to be able to define the most controversial elements of the Statute and I would like to point out that an ex-Secretary of the Council and an ex-Secretary of the Commission participated actively in that working group, as well as other important personalities, because we wanted to deal objectively with an issue with a constitutional dimension.
We always talk about the institutions, but people work in the institutions, and we, as representatives of the European citizens, must be equal when it comes to legislating.
It is not acceptable that we are creating legislation which is applicable equally to all citizens of the Union when we are in such a different, and in some ways such a questionable situation.
In this regard we must recognise that public opinion and the media are right when they make certain criticisms.
We must therefore resolve this issue.
The Constitution has not been approved â it is true â but during this year â and also with the participation of the Council â we have been able to take a step forward with the approval of the Statute on European Political Parties.
And it is not that we are soldiers of the political parties, but we are part of these formations which since the Treaty of Maastricht â when there were recognised â contribute to expressing the Unionâs democratic will.
Therefore, within this passionate and extremely complex debate, I believe that this is an occasion when â and I hope this is demonstrated in the vote â we have been able to achieve unity in the House â in Parliament â so that we can express ourselves clearly.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out, it falls to us to decide on the Statute which you have to approve.
I believe that the step we have taken responds to a philosophy of shared legislative power, which is what we have advocated for legislation in the European Union.
In other words, we do not want to do it against your will or in confrontation with the States and that is why Parliament is now stretching out its hand to you in order to be able to resolve this thorny issue.
On the three issues raised â which I hope will be approved in the resolution â which my group advocates, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has been very clear and explicit in relation to primary law, with the reimbursement of expenditure and with taxation.
He has also talked about the level of remuneration and I also believe that he has made an interesting observation on the problems it can prevent.
There is a final issue on which nothing has been explicitly said, but I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has also spoken on behalf of the next Presidency, expressing the Irish Presidencyâs desire to continue with a shared will with this process.
I therefore believe that before 15 January we may have a positive solution for the Statute, which I believe is one of the most important advances we can achieve in terms of dignifying the work of MEPs and the resolution of one of the Unionâs most difficult and complex constitutional issues.
Â Â  Mr President, I am running short of inspiration about what to say on the subject of the Members' Statute.
We have said it all before.
We say every time 'this is the last chance' and surely this must be it.
Perhaps I should begin where I left off in this Chamber in June when I offered an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group's abstention and my own national delegation's vote against the then resolution.
We said we could not give our support then, due to the inclusion of primary law and the lack of the possibility of national tax.
I could say on behalf of my Group that 'we told you so' as now, by and large, the majority of this House seems to have arrived at the same position â so we make progress.
But before I sat down last time I also said I hoped that the Council would make a better job of this than we did.
Well now we are back, offering the Council a clear and acceptable package.
Sadly, we all know that the Council did not have a very good weekend.
But here is a chance for it to deliver a success story for Europe before the end of this mandate.
It may seem a very small success, but its implications for the good name of European democracy are huge.
Next summer when we face Europe's citizens in elections we could have a Parliament with its own House in order, its Members across Europe treated and respected equally and on a transparent basis, or we could continue with the current disgraceful mix and muddle which leaves us all open to ridicule.
I have said it before, and I will say it again.
I believe we all come here to work on behalf of Europe's people, not to spend our time in debates about our own pay and status.
Council, you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the Union in the eyes of its citizens.
Please, please do not mess up this time.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, our parliamentary group is totally in favour of a Membersâ Statute.
We have always been convinced that we need to establish a Statute that guarantees equal political and financial dignity for the representatives of Europeâs citizens.
To this end, we have consistently followed and actively supported all the steps that have led to the current proposal now under discussion in the Council.
I would also like to say, quite clearly, that we are opposed to any delaying tactics.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calls for this Statute to be approved as soon as possible.
We feel that the principle of equality between MEPs is a necessary element of justice and transparency for our citizens.
Obviously, as is the case for all compromise proposals, we are not entirely satisfied with the one under examination, but we will not fail to make a constructive contribution, which will be open to dialogue between all the Parliamentary groups.
The issue that is still a matter of disagreement is the age of retirement.
The current proposal is to give MEPs a pension at the age of 63, while the Confederal Group of the European United Left believes that the age should be lowered to 60.
This proposal does not aim to protect the privileges of MEPs; we are putting forward the proposal because we are convinced that all European citizens should retire at the age of 60, at the very latest.
My colleagues and I have always opposed reform of pension schemes based on an increase in the contributions period, which I consider to be unfair.
We are convinced that there are sufficient financial resources to enable all European citizens, including MEPs, who are citizens like everyone else, to retire at the age of 60.
As regards the principle of the single salary, we are convinced that it represents a principle of democracy and equal treatment.
Why should an MEP from Estonia be paid far less than a German?
At the same time, however, we realise that, in certain Member States of the European Union, this could give rise to untenable situations, where an MEP receives a salary several times greater than that of their President.
This is why we have to be politically flexible.
Perhaps we could close the gap between differing remuneration of MEPs by basing it on the monthly salaries of senior State offices in that particular country; but, for us, the principle of the single across-the-board salary is an irrevocable one.
Finally, as regards the payment of the travelling expenses of MEPs, we would like to remind you that the Bureauof the European Parliament has drawn up a proposal that a majority in my group has asked to see put into practice when the Statute comes into force
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what our group now endorses with the utmost modesty is what we could have done months ago if we had listened to the smaller groups, but history is history and the future belongs to us all, and so we believe it to be a very good thing that we have ended up in our present situation.
One thing that this means is that we want to adopt a basic resolution to the effect that the same provisions apply to all Members of this House, since we all do the same work.
At the same time, though, we will, by adopting this, be taking a decision to put an end to the rules on billing for travelling expenses, which are far from transparent and, in my â our â view, quite simply not right and proper.
This is something we must always make clear.
By adopting the single statute, we are also voting to do away with reimbursements of travel costs that are utterly absurd.
It is important that this should become a matter of public knowledge.
Secondly, we are also making it clear that we are intelligent enough to make transitional arrangements possible, so that the enlargement countries will indeed have time to join in this joint arrangement, for it would be absurd if someone, on becoming a Member of the European Parliament, were, overnight, to start earning more than the Prime Minister of a country.
This is about opting in rather than opting out, for the same Statute will apply to us all.
Precisely when these statesâ MEPs join in, will have to be laid down by the Council in the form of intelligent rules â in other words, by an opting-in arrangement.
When one is in place, then the future of our statutes will be guaranteed.
A number of Members of this House are somewhat outraged at our having stipulated that our entitlement to a pension will begin at the end of our sixty-third year of age.
I would have thought that sixty-five would be right, for we should demand of ourselves what we demand, at the present time, of society as a whole, without getting special treatment.
I am, therefore, firmly opposed to the idea of reducing the figure adopted in this resolution.
To do so would send the wrong message to the public.
Let me sum up by saying that all is well that ends well.
Many thanks to all those who have lent a hand in this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we shall shortly be celebrating a silver jubilee: this Parliament has now been a directly elected body for 25 years.
Nevertheless, the legal status of the Members is a patchwork that is falling apart on all sides.
Pay according to national rules varies to such an extent that it bears no relation to responsibility and workload.
At the same time, travel expense reimbursement is running into figures that are increasingly out of proportion to the actual expenses, particularly owing to competition in air transport.
At the Amsterdam Summit in June 1997, a legal basis was incorporated into the Treaty enabling Parliament to draft a statute, which was to be adopted by the Council.
Now, six-and-a-half years on, that Statute has still not been adopted.
With the accession of ten new Member States on1Â May and the elections next June casting their shadow, it is now make or break time.
Do we mean to face the electorate once again with an unjustified system of expense reimbursement and an unaccountable difference in Membersâ pay?
It seems to me that it is time that we moved on to debate political issues of a different order.
A common statute for the Membersfrom all the Member Statesdoes justice to the ideal of equal pay for equal responsibility.
At the same time, it is at odds with subsidiarity.
As far as many members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are concerned, this is reason to retain a nationally determined legal status.
At the same time, the whole group wants to see a radical reorganisation of the reimbursement of travel expenses.
Year in, year out, our group submits a budget amendment to the effect that reimbursement be based on the travel expenses actually incurred, and every year a majority in this Parliament rejects that proposal.
Indisputable as that last point may be, it leads my Dutch fellow Members and me to the conclusion that reimbursement of travel expenses cannot be achieved on its own, but only in combination with a statute.
