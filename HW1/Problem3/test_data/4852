I will simply add something that a poet once said, which is that the most beautiful hymns are sung when bombs are falling.
I think the one we heard here yesterday was wonderful, for that very reason!
(Applause)
Mr Salafranca wishes to speak on another matter.
(ES) Mr President, yesterday there was a brutal terrorist attack in the city of Beirut, in which the Lebanese general FranÃ§ois el Hajj was killed.
As the House is aware, Mr President, Lebanon is linked to the European Union by an Association Agreement.
At the mini-plenary session in Brussels, Parliament adopted an important report granting macro-financial aid to that country and, to take an obvious example, a delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, made up of Mrs De Keyser, Mrs Gomes, Mr Belder and myself, visited the country last week, so that, like various ministers from the Member States, we could express our solidarity with the cause of peace, for understanding, harmony and reconciliation in the country.
I would ask the President to pass on our support to Prime Minister Siniora in response to this brutal terrorist attack and our unquestionable and irrevocable commitment to the cause of a sovereign, democratic, stable, viable and peaceful Lebanon.
(Applause)
Mr Salafranca, I think the applause from your fellow Members shows quite clearly that the assembly supports your declaration.
It will be passed on.
The last request to speak is from Mr Pirker, on a point of order, and then we will proceed to the vote.
(DE) Mr President, this does not really have anything to do with the debate, and I actually wanted to say this immediately after the last debate: it is simply unbearably cold in this House.
It may have been quite good yesterday because feelings were not running so high there as they would perhaps otherwise have been.
However, in general it is simply too cold and I wanted to suggest, in connection with the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea, that we try to achieve a reasonable temperature perhaps once with a Korean air conditioning system, should we not manage to do so with our European one.
I think we have covered everything we wanted to cover before launching into the vote.
The next item is therefore Voting time.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
(NL) Mr President, I should just like to say that I did not endorse the resolution on the EU/China human rights dialogue for a number of reasons.
In particular, I think that we in this Hemicycle have already churned out more than enough overblown texts, and that the European institutions rarely, if ever, follow these overblown texts and overblown statements with action.
With the Beijing Olympic Games around the corner, their European Excellencies will be once more attempting to curry favour with the Chinese authorities.
This is already clear from the present resolution, which, alongside very many sensible elements, asserts that, at the recent Chinese Communist Party National Congress - and I quote - 'perspectives ... arose towards the implementation of higher international human rights benchmarks'.
How unworldly of this House; as the reality in today's Beijing is one of intimidation, deportations, arrests and labour camps.
It is time the European Union abandoned its policy of double standards towards China.
(BG) I voted against the resolution on extremism because it is the fruit of that hatred it is called upon to condemn.
And who is lecturing us on extremism?
Comrade Schulz and Comrade Cohn-Bendit, these champions of Marxism and Leninism, that very ideology which massacred dozens of millions of Russians and Ukrainians in the beginning of last century?
Or Comrade Vigenin whose party held the Bulgarian people in its clutches for fifty years and killed thousands Bulgarians in its concentration camps?
Are you the ones to teach us what extremism is like?
Thank you.
(NL) Mr President, yes, that is the way it goes in this House.
Unless your name is Mr Schulz, you have to use the explanations of vote to be able to express your opinions.
This House has once again laid its periodic egg about the 'necessity' of combating 'extremism' - but is not talking about real extremism and real violence, for example that of the rising Islam in Europe.
Instead, it is talking for the umpteenth time about curbing the freedom of expression of those peacefully standing up for the right to individuality, the right to protect and preserve our languages, identities, cultures and freedom.
It is little short of tragic that this House is constantly speaking about freedom and human rights whilst imposing the severest, most drastic muzzling rules on people who have differing opinions on the matter and, for example, do not simply join the rest of this House in worshipping the sacred cow of the proverbial multicultural society.
I, for my part, do not take this resolution seriously and, as far as I am concerned, there can be no freedom without total freedom of political expression.
(NL) Mr President, I too voted against the resolution on extremism.
This is not because I feel that the term concerns me - the reverse is true - but because, for the umpteenth time, a legitimate political discourse against further mass-immigration and for a firm adjustment policy is being consciously bound up with extremism and violence.
Even the title of the resolution is misleading and biased.
Left-wing extremism is evidently something that by definition cannot exist, and clearly no-one here has heard of the rising Islamic fundamentalism.
This is straight out of Kafka.
It would be funny if it were not so depressing.
Anyone not falling into line with political correctness is criminalised.
Perhaps someone could explain how this kind of thing relates to the Charter of Fundamental Rights we signed yesterday.
(NL) Mr President, I too voted wholeheartedly against this resolution, as when the fox preaches, look to your geese.
I have rarely set eyes on a more hypocritical document than this motion for a resolution on 'rising extremism' in Europe - and God knows that Europe and this House have already broken records for hypocrisy.
After all, as my colleagues have already said, there is no such thing as left-wing extremism.
Indeed, the finger is not even pointed at Islamic extremism.
The suburbs of Paris burned, but the problem apparently lies with the small nonconformist minority that has become the bane of the life of this lofty institution.
Perhaps we should open the gates of the Gulag again for those who still dare to criticise the cult of Europe and the sacrosanct multicultural society - complete with an inquisition and banishment to Devil's Island for the heretics.
Only then will Europe be purged of its last critics, and the cult of Europe will be able to continue its conversion mission undisturbed.
(DA) Mr President, this resolution contains a justified critique of neo-fascist and fundamentalist movements in certain European countries.
However, it appears that as a whole it is unilaterally oriented towards a problem that is described as European citizens with fascist and racist attitudes, and it makes the resolution meaningless.
Repeated opinion polls in Denmark have indicated that immigrants from non-Western nations do not feel that they are being subjected to any form of racism or hostile treatment.
However, some immigrants from non-European nations have perpetrated very widespread violence towards both Danish citizens and other immigrants.
In the official crime statistics, immigrants from non-Western nations are disproportionately over-represented.
Week after week in recent months there have been many shooting incidents on the open streets involving immigrant gangs, as well as individual attacks.
Immigrant officials, who are themselves of non-Danish ethnic origin, have had their lives threatened and been told to leave their job, not by Danes, but by people from foreign cultures, who they are trying to help integrate into Danish society.
We have a prominent immigrant politician of Syrian origin.
He must be protected 24 hours a day, not against Danes but against fundamentalists of an Islamic background.
Our intelligence service is constantly involved in preventing violent attacks against Danes and Danish social institutions, not from Danes but from foreigners.
Therefore, from a Danish perspective this resolution is absurd.
In Denmark, violent racism is directed towards democracy and human rights.
On this basis I have been unable to vote in favour of this resolution.
(SK) Mr President, the Black Sea is becoming one of the main routes for increasing oil exports in this region and in recent years has unfortunately often been a place of frequent accidents involving tankers and cargo carriers.
Twelve vessels sank or ran aground here during a severe storm.
These events had serious consequences, affected people's lives and caused large-scale ecological disasters.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska more than 18 years ago is an example of a large-scale disaster, the consequences of which are felt to this day.
Considering that approximately 200 tankers travel the world's seas every day, I am of the opinion that the situation should be regularly and closely monitored not only in the Black Sea but also in other seas.
The Member States, as well as other countries neighbouring the European Union, should ensure more rigorous application of existing Community legislation and maritime safety standards.
In this context, I am calling on the Council to speed up its deliberations and to adopt common positions on the remaining legislative acts in the third maritime package on maritime safety.
(CS) Mr President, abolishing quotas and introducing monitoring of Chinese textile imports next year will undoubtedly result in improved control mechanisms.
However, I do not agree that woollens should not be subject to monitoring.
Our resolution is a political appeal to the Commission, an expression of our wish that greater emphasis be placed on demanding that international obligations are met, and it is a protest against Chinese barriers to imports of European products.
I welcome the fact that China will have to issue import licences, which will make it possible to carry out control procedures in Chinese ports and so better protect Europe from counterfeit goods.
At the same time it is the Commission's duty to protect European consumers against toxic substances, for example azo dyes that are sometimes present in Chinese goods.
Therefore, I call on the Commission to push for the confiscation of textiles presenting health risks at the borders of the European Union.
Written explanations of vote
The Council and the European Parliament have reached agreement on the additional financing for the Galileo satellite system and expenditure on foreign affairs, including the police mission in Kosovo.
To this end, they have increased the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework and used the flexibility instrument, and there have also been redeployments within the existing budget lines.
These redeployments could have been more far reaching.
The main things I have problems with are the adjustment of the previously agreed ceiling for EU funds for the period until 2013 and the use of the flexibility instrument for this purpose.
The use of this instrument must be avoided, and at all costs must remain limited to very exceptional circumstances.
Any changes in costs must be primarily absorbed by reducing other budget lines.
I am thinking mainly of the expenditure that does not concern the central objectives of the European Union and the budget lines whose implementation is already falling behind in respect of the planned expenditure.
in writing. - (PT) The agreement reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament for the 2008 EU budget reveals the true weight of the 'big countries' and the 'rich countries' as it responds to their demands to limit the EU budget ceiling as much as possible.
In spite of all the attempts to hide it, the truth is that the Commission's, the Council's and the EP's proposals for the EU budget, and this agreement, were below the figure for 2008 envisaged in the 2007-2013 financial framework.
That was also the case last year and in the 2000-2006 financial framework.
In reality, this EU budget for 2008 represents a reduction of more than EUR 9 billion in terms of payments as compared with what was agreed in the financial framework for 2008 - that is, in terms of payments, the EU budget has been reduced from 1.04% to 0.96% of the Community GNI.
On the other hand, the EU budget has progressively moved its priorities towards financing the neoliberal, federalist and militaristic policies of the EU.
We therefore reject this agreement.
in writing. - (SV) We support the basic principles of the EU budget for 2008 and stress that it must give the taxpayers good value for money.
The frameworks set by the financial perspective must be respected and we therefore welcome the fact that the budget will be kept within these frameworks by a good margin.
Agricultural support is one of the areas in which there is scope for cutbacks to the advantage of aims which are more in line with the Lisbon ambitions, that is that the EU should develop into the world's economically most successful region.
in writing. - During Budget negotiations, Parliament decided with Council to redeploy EUR 50 million from the Decentralised Agencies to part-finance the European GNSS programmes (EGNOS/GALILEO) and the European Institute of Technology.
It was not indicated which agencies would be affected.
The reprogramming concerns the agencies under heading 1A under which Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living standards, belongs.
Eurofound is based in Dublin.
This foundation provides an important service in the area of the labour market and working conditions, and a cut would be intolerable and counterproductive.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the proposed 2008 budget, firstly because the proposal is clearly in line with the principles set out in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
Secondly, because the proposal put to the vote, after being negotiated with the Commission and the Council, finally overcame the serious problems that arose concerning the financing of Galileo.
The solution to this is also very positive, making it possible to provide a reasonable level of financing for projects included in the trans-European networks.
Thirdly, I think that the treasury solutions found are very positive as regards the budget for payments for items financing European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund projects, which are very important for enabling Portugal to develop the projects it needs to achieve much higher rates of economic growth than in recent years and thus to come closer to the EU average.
in writing. - (FR) The paradox, or perhaps the hypocrisy of the European Parliament, is that it goes about preaching democratic principles and values but flouts them by refusing to apply them when it is inconvenient to do so.
Such was the case yesterday when the European Parliament, meeting in plenary, formally proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights amid general uproar, thus ignoring the protests from the separatists demanding a referendum for the adoption of the new constitutional treaty.
The European Parliament is discrediting itself by refusing any discussion and stigmatising its own elected Members who are committed to promoting the maintenance of national identity and sovereignty.
Freedom of expression only has value if one's political opponents enjoy it too.
According to the conservative political groups, it seems that some speech is illegitimate and needs to be prevented at any cost.
As the European Parliament compromises itself by laying claim to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the elected Members from the Front National are stating loud and clear that they do not have the same idea of human rights and will continue to fight for respect for the sovereignty and identity of the nations of Europe.
in writing. - (FR) I abstained on the resolution on EU-China relations because I am not keen to associate myself with these paternalistic reprimands or with the moralising discourse that resolutions of this kind convey.
A European Union that cannot adopt a Charter of Fundamental Rights that applies throughout its territory is ill placed to try and give lessons to the rest of the world.
in writing. - As a representative from a region, Northern Ireland, where Sinn Fein, affiliates of a terrorist organisation which recently murdered a young man, Paul Quinn, has been admitted to government in a coalition with exclusively democratic parties, I was encouraged to note and vote for Amendment 14 which was in the following terms:
'Deplores the fact that some mainstream parties have seen fit to give credibility and acceptance to extremist parties by entering into coalition agreements, thereby sacrificing their moral integrity for the sake of short-term political gain and expediency.'
in writing. - Whilst opposed to extremism in any form, UKIP does not believe that we, the British people, need to take any advice on this issue from the EU, and nor would UKIP call for the EU to take any action.
This, like all other matters, should be the prerogative of independent, democratic nation states.
in writing. - Whilst opposed to extremism in ny form UKIP does not believe that we, the British people, need to take advice on this issue from the EU, and nor would UKIP call for the EU to take any action.
This, like all other matters, should be the prerogative of independent, democratic, nation states.
in writing. - (FR) Front National, Vlaams Belang and FPOE are not extremist, racist or xenophobic parties.
Lumping them together in a way that is unhealthy and wrong, all the so-called 'conservative' parties are still trying to accuse them of being extremists solely because they want to promote the maintenance of national identity.
Democracy is certainly in danger, but those who are pre-appointed by the system as guilty are not the ones threatening it.
It is not in danger from the people who criticise and challenge policies, particularly on immigration, and who are therefore accused of being extremist.
It is in danger from those who systematically gag freedom of expression in the name of human rights and political correctness, and who are really only masking their own failure to solve the problems they are facing of immigration, lack of security and identity.
By massively increasing the amount of legislation to combat extremism in Europe, Parliament could have been proud of helping to maintain democratic principles and values.
Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Far from targeting radical Islamism or totalitarian communist regimes, Parliament is just feeding its anti-national and globalist obsession once again.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I categorically oppose racism, xenophobia and political extremism.
I do think, though, that in documents adopted under the aegis of the European Parliament a clear definition should be provided of such terms as, specifically, political extremism and xenophobia.
If this is not done, this may, under a noble banner, actually serve the opposite aims and become a field for abuses in politicians' public activities, drowning out free expression and the freedom to voice one's views.
One example of such selective interpretation of these concepts was provided by the situation that arose at the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg on 12 December this year.
How, for example, does the provision of an article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights that says that 'Any discrimination based on ... political or any other opinion ... shall be prohibited' square with the forcible snatching of pieces of paper with the legend 'REFERENDUM' from the hands of Members?
This was a peaceful expression of opinion by a few elected Members.
In view of this situation, I abstained from the vote on the resolution on combating rising extremism in Europe.
in writing. - (FR) It is astounding to see how hemiplegic the European Parliament can be: it can only look right!
The various resolutions proposed by the PSE, Liberals, Verts or even Communists only consider extremism on the part of the 'extreme right'.
What about radical Islamism and all those Trotskyites and communists?
Not once are these types of extremism mentioned.
This is an insult for all the victims of totalitarian communist regimes and for all those who suffer on a daily basis because of the dogma and practices of radical Islamism.
The European Parliament does not believe these types of extremism are objectionable.
They just do not exist, because they do not form part of the current standard vocabulary of political correctness within these walls.
Out of respect for the principles and values of democracy, equality and tolerance, the PSE Group is quick to welcome the dissolution of the extreme right-wing political group Independence, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) before calling for the conditions governing the formation of political groups within Parliament to be strengthened.
The leitmotiv of these elected members is to systematically demonise their political opponents in order to impose their conservatism on everyone.
These resolutions are a hypocritical, blind and obscurantist chore.
We will be voting against them.
in writing. - While I fully subscribe to genuine measures to overcome racism and extremism, this sort of resolution, generated by the Left, is not helpful and is merely intended to take forward their own distorted agenda.
In fact, there is little to distinguish the extreme Left and the extreme Right and they feed off one another.
However, the Left has been successful in taking the spotlight off its own extremes and promoting institutions and policies which assist its own objectives.
The EU, in its continuous efforts to extend its own reach, is often complicit in this.
I do not approve of EU quangos such as the so-called 'EU Agency for Fundamental Rights' or indeed funding from public money of the constellation of NGOs pushing the Left's agenda.
I therefore abstained on the resolution.
in writing. - I am opposed to extremism in any form, but I do not accept that the British people must take advice from the EU on this - or indeed on any other matter.
I was not elected to have the EU extend or expand its control over the UK.
This matter should remain in the control and prerogative of independent, democratic nation states.
In 1918, independent Montenegro voluntarily chose unification with the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia.
In 2006, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, the electorate of Montenegro, the last state to remain united with Serbia, decided democratically to end this union.
This made Montenegro the 49th independent state in Europe.
Now it is important that Montenegro become a normal state, rather than a larger version of Monaco: a paradise for rich foreigners wishing to pay low taxes, launder money and build palaces.
Montenegro must do more to combat environmental pollution and cigarette smuggling.
I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my amendments concerning housing and jobs for Serbian and Kosovar refugees.
Stateless persons cannot remain stateless for ever, and Montenegro must respect the agreements of the Council of Europe in this regard.
Even my proposal regarding the restoration of the north-south railway connections to NikÅ¡iÄ on the Bosnian border and Shkoder in Albania has been accepted.
Increasing road transport is not a valid solution.
Fortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Vernola - unlike in his previous annual report - is not calling for swift accession to NATO, nor an economic policy that is even more neoliberal than is usual in the rest of Europe.
Accession to NATO cannot be a prerequisite for admission to the EU.
in writing. - (PT) The resolution adopted today in the European Parliament expresses solidarity with the victims of the shipwrecks that occurred in the Kerch Strait - that is, the Strait linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov - causing an environmental disaster.
The environmental impact of the spillage of oil derivatives into the strait was exacerbated by the rapid dispersion of the pollutants due to the strong winds and high waves at the time.
In general, we agree with the positions contained in the resolution, stressing the important role of Member States in ensuring that ships on their national registers conform to international standards and in preventing maritime accidents and combating the consequences of such accidents.
Agreeing with the need to implement measures to reduce the environmental risk and to make progress in maritime safety, we think that any initiative taken at EU level in this framework should be based on enhanced cooperation between Member States, without compromising their responsibilities in this area.
in writing. - (FR) The enlargement of the European Union calls for our solidarity with the population of the 431 000 km2 around the Black Sea.
This solidarity is expressed by the agreement to open negotiations with Turkey, the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy with Georgia and Ukraine, and the strategic partnership established with Russia.
The violence of the storm makes us think about the effects of climate change, in our own neighbourhood too.
A risk management policy is required that combines both prevention and the protection of biodiversity.
We remember that the storm trapped four vessels and caused the death of eight sailors.
A Russian cargo vessel also broke in two, releasing 4 000 tonnes of fuel oil on a migration route for diving birds coming from Siberia.
The European Union sent a team within the framework of the Monitoring and Information Centre.
More should be done as part of this initiative.
To prevent future disasters, the EU must make sure that high safety standards are systematically applied to the fleet of Russian vessels.
The EU must impose the use of double-hull cargo vessels on its Russian partner, for transporting oil.
As the parliamentary assembly of the BSEC meets, we should be demanding the application of the standards in the European maritime safety package.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of Mr Ehler's report on deposit-guarantee schemes.
The rapporteur has presented a very good report, in which attention is drawn to the new challenges facing guarantee schemes because of the increasing integration of markets.
These challenges must be responded to if the stability of financial markets is to be ensured.
Deposit-guarantee schemes are a very important part in the EU financial market system and their operation should continuously be improved.
The rapporteur rightly draws attention to the problem of crisis management and the safety net for cross-border deposits in crisis management.
I agree that crisis management should rest on the foundations of improved early risk detection, better defined and planned procedures of interaction between all parties involved, and clarification of the point at which burdens are to be shared.
Differences between systems and the variety of parties involved in the public and private sectors must be taken into consideration.
in writing. - (FR) Mass imports, the perverse role played by a strong euro against a deliberately undervalued foreign currency, social and environmental dumping, counterfeits, piracy, dangerous products, and the existence of non-tariff barriers that hit European manufacturing: in the textiles sector as in others, every report and resolution by this Parliament on trade relations with China looks the same.
Why was China's membership of the WTO accepted under these circumstances?
We voted against it.
Why refuse to see that liberalising trade with countries that have decided not to obey the rules - and you never challenge this liberalisation - only leads to economic disaster and social disintegration for whole regions and sectors?
Why accept the end of textile quotas and the laying off of tens of thousands of European workers?
You are worried about it now, but you only talk timidly of possible means of commercial defence, safeguard measures and joint surveillance of exports.
It is not much, and it is not enough, but it is better than nothing.
Therefore, though this resolution is about as useful as a chocolate teapot, we will vote in favour.
in writing. - (PT) We are pleased at the adoption of our proposals that:
maintain that the double-checking surveillance system will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005 and that new safeguard measures are required;
repeat the proposal that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it, and help for SMEs;
We regret the rejection by the majority of the European Parliament of our proposals that, for example:
referred to the serious consequences of liberalisation in the textiles and clothing sector at global level with firms closing down or relocating, unemployment and serious socio-economic crises;
pointed out that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008, and therefore failed to understand why the EU had not followed suit;
maintain that a regulatory framework needed to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions were not met;
called for a stronger role for workers' representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making.
in writing. - (FR) The textile sector in France and in Europe since the end of the Multi Fibre Arrangement has turned some of our regions into economic and social deserts.
Poverty and deprivation reign there for the thousands of men and women who have lost their jobs.
The destruction of these companies, of this social fabric, in the name of globalisation and pro-European ultraliberalism, is the symbol of one of the greatest economic failures of the European Union.
For years, this approach has led to our manufacturing in all economic sectors, even where it was of a very high standard, being relocated to other countries throughout the world: to North Africa and especially to Asia.
This global rebalancing will not actually have given these third countries anything, except to worsen economic slavery for the benefit of a small elite in Chinese factories and to establish long-term unemployment in Europe against a background of persistent economic crisis.
Clearly, global competition, as encouraged by the WTO, is the main reason for the widespread impoverishment and lack of dynamism of Europe.
The European Union urgently needs to put an end to this madness, and finally to set up Community protection and preference.
in writing. - (PT) Amongst other things, this report contains a veritable misconception.
It acknowledges that 'poverty remains an unresolved and deepening problem in Korea which, according to OECD statistics, ranks among the three OECD members with both the biggest income gap and the greatest widening of the income gap' (we might add that it is not the only case, since within the EU the income gap between rich and poor has also widened, particularly in Portugal, where the difference between the richest and the poorest continues to grow, with approximately two million Portuguese living on the breadline).
The report nevertheless calls for a 'free trade' agreement between the EU and Korea and for trade liberalisation, when it is known that such policies have favoured and will continue to favour the concentration of wealth on the large economic and financial groups both in the EU and in Korea.
It is an agreement which will serve to place workers under even greater pressure to accept low salaries and lose rights and social advances gained in the name of 'competitiveness', and to increase the fabulous profits of the few.
In the meantime there is no mention of the shipbuilding industry...
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of accepting Mr Martin's report on the trade and economic relations with Korea.
The rapporteur has drafted a very good report, in which he points out the importance of Korea as a trading partner for the European Union in economic terms.
Conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Korea is part of the strategy to provide Europe with a global dimension.
A Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the European Union could constitute a basis for the promotion of high social and environmental standards and could serve as an example for other agreements that are currently at the negotiation stage.
I agree that every effort must be made to ensure that the European Union and Korea - under the aegis of the trade agreement currently being negotiated or through a separate agreement - themselves take on human rights obligations.

1.
Eastern Chad
The next item on the agenda are the six motions for a resolution on eastern Chad.
author. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to say that I am very disturbed by the intensification of fighting in Chad, but also by the lack of progress in finding a political solution to the conflict.
I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the role of the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operation.
The main aim of the European initiative, which is also supported by the UN, is to ensure security in the humanitarian zone.
Bearing in mind the ongoing Darfur crisis and the way in which it is destabilising the situation in the region, it is worth remembering here that the conflict has already crossed the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic.
I believe it is vital to put neutral forces from the Member States in place as soon as possible.
I would like to stress, though, that the success of such a peace mission is heavily dependent on the political efforts that must be made if a successful peace process is to be conducted.
author. - Madam President, I want to make a couple of important and essential points.
There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad.
There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see, but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission.
The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation's mandate.
We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort.
If that is indeed so, then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send.
I believe that clarity is lacking.
I do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security.
We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict.
We have also heard from leaders of many of the rebel groups that any intervention, and this intervention in particular, will be considered hostile.
That poses a huge difficulty.
I must also say - and, again, I disagree with my colleague - that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required.
I have to say, with the greatest of respect for France and her people, that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative, and I think it deeply unwise.
I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy.
The difficulties that have arisen - in this instance in relation to Chad - reflect very clearly why.
I think it is undoable, because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks.
For this reason in particular it is a great shame - if I may say so, coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral - that the obligations, responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union, and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty.
I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned.
To conclude, intervention in Chad is necessary.
However, the essential thing is how we go about this.
Any operation has to be focused.
It certainly has to be neutral and, above all, it must have prospects of success.
Madam President, I notice that there is no time displayed on the board.
Does that mean we will have the privilege of unlimited use of time this afternoon, or is there a technical error?
Mr Matsakis, we shall all abide by the time we know has been given us.
author. - Mr President, I initiated this urgency resolution in order to exert political and public pressure on getting the EU peacekeeping mission to the eastern Chad border region deployed as soon as possible.
The recent unrest in eastern Chad, including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army, underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from getting caught in the crossfire.
These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps.
Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel, but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry, restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance.
I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial, logistic and air support, including the necessary number of helicopters, as soon as possible.
The EU's credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it cannot mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational.
This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States, whether they are participant countries or not.
I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated.
This mission has troops coming from Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria and Ireland.
Furthermore, it will not be French led but Irish led.
Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission, and he will therefore be calling the shots - excuse the pun - concerning troop activities on the ground.
This operation is going to go ahead, and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups.
There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States, following Ireland's appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced.
It appears that one country has offered medical supplies, while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support, including aircraft.
Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees.
The time to act is now.
Our inaction will cost lives.
author. - (FR) Madam President, the resumption of fighting between rebel and government forces in Chad has left hundreds dead and wounded and caused renewed tensions in the border region of Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This situation has, de facto, restricted access to refugee camps for thousands of people and made the task of humanitarian aid workers considerably more complicated.
I should also remind you that at present in this region of the world, women and children are still the victims of particularly odious violence and that there are already more than 450 000 displaced people living in terrible conditions precisely where the conflict has restarted.
Against this background, we can obviously demand that the warring factions cease all combat, particularly where civilian populations are affected.
We also demand that they respect the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, which means respecting humanitarian areas and allowing the transportation of aid, as well as not attacking humanitarian personnel.
More generally, we are also particularly concerned about the fact that humanitarian law is more and more often flouted, if not totally ignored, by the parties involved in the conflicts.
The European Union needs to act specifically against this worrying development.
We also urge the authorities in Chad to systematically do all they can to prosecute those responsible for rape, war crimes and all forms of serious human rights violation.
However, I would say that our message is mostly aimed at the European Union, particularly the Council of Ministers, by which we undoubtedly have more chance of being heard and which we ask to assume its responsibilities.
On 15 October, the Council adopted a joint action on the EUFOR Chad/RCA operation to provide protection for civilians, humanitarian aid, and security for local and expatriate humanitarian personnel.
Just two months later, the deployment of EUFOR troops has still not materialised, due to a lack of resources and sufficient equipment.
This is unacceptable and the Council and Commission therefore urgently need to speed up the decision-making process to enable this operation to be conducted as rapidly as possible.
I would also like to point out that no peacekeeping mission in eastern Chad or the northern part of the Central African Republic will be effective without a general reconciliation process involving the whole region.
We already know that EUFOR's presence on Sudan's doorstep will make it more difficult for the rebels to circulate freely across borders and will therefore cause the displacement of some attacks.
The urgent and essential support that the European Union is committed to providing could therefore very quickly prove inadequate.
It is now also essential for the EU to do everything it can to encourage the resumption of peace talks at regional level, in partnership with all those involved in the conflict and the various representatives of the international community.
Finally, I would like to point out that we believe that the European force's neutrality is particularly important and very strategic here.
Since the rebels have already threatened to target it if it is simply a French mission in disguise, we are asking the other Member States to participate en masse in the composition of this force, so it is clear to everyone that it is indeed a European force.
author. - Madam President, eastern Chad has become a second Darfur, and the dÃ©jÃ  vu scenes of killings and destruction committed against innocent civilians are coming back to haunt us.
Meanwhile, we in the EU, being part of the privileged elite of this world, debate endlessly amongst ourselves on how to deal with the situation.
While we - most wisely, but very slowly - consider and reconsider our decision to send an effective peacekeeping military force to the region, those criminals who carry out ethnic cleansing continue their despicable acts unhindered.
One important - perhaps the most important - message that must come out of this debate today is our strong demand to the Commission and Council that EUFOR must be properly set up and deployed to the affected region most urgently.
Those in the Council or Commission, or elsewhere for that matter, who delay this action would be responsible for the further escalation of violence and tragedy that will inevitably follow soon.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I think that it is particularly significant that the three urgent resolutions that we are debating today have something in common in that they concern different types of violence against women.
This demonstrates that this type of violence is something that affects the whole world, although it has particular manifestations and forms in each case.
The first of the three cases that we are dealing with today, the situation in Chad, is a sad example of how, in a context of war, women frequently tend to be used as sexual objects, where rape becomes a weapon of war.
This situation occurs especially in refugee camps, but not only there.
The aim of this resolution is, at least for some of us, to point out that the international community, and in particular the European Union, needs to respond to this situation and take on our responsibility to protect the victims.
With this in mind, the deployment of a specific mission, EUFOR Chad/CAR, is a task that certainly needs to be done urgently, but also responsibly.
I would like to join with those pointing out that there is definitely a risk that the mission will be perceived as being excessively linked to one country, namely France.
I think that this would be damaging, and certainly counterproductive for the objectives of the mission.
I would therefore also like to stress that the composition of the mission should reflect the diversity of the European Union Member States, in order to avoid any confusion between that mission and the French deployment known as Operation Sparrowhawk.
We also need to condemn before all possible bodies, and I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to do this, the brutality of the attacks perpetrated on the civilian population by the Janjawid militias and other Chadian groups.
What is especially deplorable is the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and it is unacceptable for such crimes to go unpunished.
I therefore urge the Chadian authorities to take responsibility for investigating these rapes and abuses and to bring those responsible to justice.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, it has been said of the last Bourbon kings that they always took action too late on an idea, a government or an army.
This unfortunately seems to be the case today for the West and for Europe, because we have already allowed the catastrophe in Darfur and in eastern Chad to go on far too long.
The later we intervene, the more costly it becomes, not just financially, but militarily and politically as well.
I am therefore very grateful to Mr von Wogau for moving matters ahead decisively on military and security policy and I am very grateful to Mr Dess for doing the same in the humanitarian sector.
We ultimately have to take action.
However, the nations are procrastinating, not only on the equipment required, but also on the troops required.
We need troops and forces on the ground with local knowledge and experience.
I am very much of the opinion that there should be no disguised French operation, which nobody is talking about either, but we do need the local knowledge and experience of the French.
We also, however, need the cooperation of the African Union and the Arab League, which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof.
This should not, however, absolve us Europeans of our responsibilities.
I say very clearly: we want to get involved but we must not make the mistakes we made in Afghanistan, namely intervening without having a political strategy.
Anyone who intervenes there must also know that they must have a strategy for peace talks, for interethnic discussions and for a solution to the massive tribalism and other conflicts that exist both in eastern Chad and in Darfur along the artificial borders.
As the European Parliament, we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid, but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I will be very brief.
The second EU-Africa Summit was a complete failure: the two parties did not reach an Economic Partnership Agreement, and relations between those two parts of the world have been frozen.
The tense situation in eastern Chad has not helped much either.
One of the prerequisites for fruitful cooperation would be an end to the decades-long military conflicts in Africa.
When resolving the conflict in eastern Chad, the European Union must demonstrate that we are determined to reach a peaceful solution and send our peacekeeping military mission to eastern Chad as soon as possible.
(NL) Madam President, last weekend an EU-Africa Summit was held in Lisbon.
This intended to develop the basis for a new partnership between Europe and Africa: a partnership that, according to the joint declaration of the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, was to be based on shared values and principles, such as democracy, human rights and good governance.
Unfortunately, however, Europe's attitude to individuals such as Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya - to name but two; they were both welcomed with a red carpet - proves that there is still a yawning chasm between declarations of principle and reality.
The situation in Chad today also shows, if proof were needed, that a large proportion of Africa is far from ready to form part of this 'community of shared values'.
Therefore, if we Europeans want to remain credible with our discourse on human rights and not simply practise realpolitik, an intervention should indeed send out a clear signal that lawlessness and arbitrariness must make way as quickly as possible for the most basic democratic principles.
Unfortunately, the assessment of Chad also applies to a great many other regimes in Africa.
Chad is not the only sick man of Africa.
Thank you for the clarification.
I am required to announce the speakers who have registered to speak on behalf of their political groups.
Your political group, like everyone's here, is not in doubt, and everyone here knows which group you represent.
(FR) Madam President, to correct what you have just said about the last intervention: the PSE Group spoke through me; I was speaking as the author and on behalf of the PSE Group.
I would not like anyone to think that we were not concerned about this issue.
Madam President, we are all very aware of the appalling humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad.
This cannot be separated from the wider regional catastrophe in Darfur: 300 000 people massacred, two million displaced persons, four million people living on Western food aid.
For three years now, the international community has been wringing its hands.
I recognise that the European Union has sponsored large-scale humanitarian aid to the region.
That is the good side.
Politically, the EU's contribution is less commendable.
It fÃªtes the Sudanese dictator Omar El Bashir in Lisbon, along with Mugabe the oppressor of Zimbabwe, where in the ultimate sickening act of hypocrisy they sign up to a declaration on human rights and good governance.
The EU's other contribution is to try and engage in some half-baked military mission in order to stick the ESDP badge on another military operation.
The fact is this proposed mission is poorly conceived; the size of the force is inadequate; it lacks vital medical, logistic and transport support elements; it is already three months behind schedule and there is no contingency reserve if the situation should deteriorate even further.
We need only look at the random involvement in this mission - what is after all a largely French-driven operation - to understand why many in Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic, let alone our own military officers, have a seriously sceptical attitude towards this project.
Soldiering should be left to others.
As a matter of urgency it is the UN-AU effort that should be reinforced as part of a coherent strategy for the whole region.
This should be politically driven by the UN Security Council.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is looking very carefully at the worsening security situation in eastern Chad and is emphatic in its support for the deployment of EUFOR troops in full strength to protect refugees and displaced persons in the region.
The European Union will use every instrument at its disposal in eastern Chad to do this.
The Commission will provide not only EUFOR troops, but also more than EUR 50 million as part of a comprehensive plan.
With these funds, measures will be financed in the following three key areas, which extend from emergency aid to long-term development aid.
The first sector concerns humanitarian aid, for which ECHO has already provided EUR 30.5 million in 2007 in the form of emergency aid measures for supporting refugees and displaced persons in different sectors in Chad.
A similar level of funding has also been set aside to continue these measures in 2008.
The second sector comprises the organisation of a Chadian police force, which will be responsible for carrying out humanitarian protection measures.
In the context of the EU and UN missions in Chad, the United Nations are setting up, training and equipping up to 850 Chadian police forces and constabularies, which are to be deployed in refugee camps in eastern Chad.
The European Union is supporting this UN programme with EUR 10 million from the Instrument for Stability.
The third sector concerns reintegration and rehabilitation.
In 2008 the Commission will be providing EUR 10.1 million from the ninth European Development Fund for development measures promoting reconstruction, conflict resolution and the organisation of administrative capacities.
These are measures that are necessary for improving the security situation in the areas of the UN-EU mission.
Further measures are planned as part of the 10th European Development Fund, for which EUR 311 million are estimated from 2008 to 2013.
Returning displaced persons to their home country should be supported in the short term with these measures.
Their aim in the long-term is to stabilise the situation permanently in Chad and throughout the region.
The previous speakers have rightly referred to the flare-up in the battles between government-friendly rebels and President Idriss DÃ©by's troops in eastern Chad, which has clearly made humanitarian aid more difficult.
Even in the areas around the refugee camps, safety can no longer be guaranteed.
In addition, the precarious humanitarian situation is coming increasingly to a head owing to the rapid increase in the number of refugees from the combat zones.
In this deeply worrying situation, the restoration of security in the region is a task of the utmost urgency.
In order to cope with this task, a military presence is vital.
EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas.
They will, however, be successful only if the causes of the conflict are eliminated and if a political process is introduced at the same time, with the aim of calming the underlying tensions and reducing poverty by facilitating economic development.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at the end of the debates.
2.
Women's rights in Saudi Arabia
The next item is the six motions for a resolution on the rights of women in Saudi Arabia.
author. - (PL) Madam President, referring again to the October 2006 incident, while at the same time bearing in mind the lack of legal protection for women in Saudi Arabia, but above all on the basis of facts that have again been demonstrated by expressions of social condemnation of the voice of rape victims attempting to bring about a public debate on this subject, I call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to cease this type of practice forthwith.
Madam President, I would like to stress that the European Union should not remain silent in the face of the scandalous violation of the rights and personal liberties of women in third countries.
A state responsible for protecting its citizens may not resort to breaches of principles of the rule of law under the pretext of standing guard over maintenance of the principle of independence of the courts, as happened in the case of the sentence passed on the woman from Qatif.
I am therefore calling for a redoubling of efforts on the part of the government of Saudi Arabia in the matter of observing women's basic rights.
author. - (SV) Madam President, I have to say that it is immensely sad that abuse of and violence against women never seem to cease.
This applies to both this Resolution and the next one.
I want to thank all who have helped to bring this Resolution into being.
It is almost inconceivable that women in Saudi Arabia are, in 2007, still deprived of all human rights.
It is apparently not enough that women have to be subjected to degrading and scandalous gang rapes.
They also have to be punished by the authorities, while the perpetrators go free.
I think that all of us, both women and men, must do all we can in the name of solidarity to ensure that human rights apply to women in Saudi Arabia too.
We call on the Commission and the Council and of course all the Member States to raise these matters in contacts of all kinds with Saudi Arabia.
We have a multitude of international conventions and we have had pronouncements from the EU in many contexts.
Sometimes it is frustrating that we talk and talk and this violence just goes on and on.
Thanks to everyone who took the initiative and helped in the work on this Resolution.
author. - Madam President, recently King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was afforded a controversial state visit to the United Kingdom.
Our Deputy Foreign Minister praised the shared values of the UK and Saudi Arabia.
I found this sycophancy absurd, as my values of democracy, human rights and gender equality are alien to Saudi tradition.
Of course, the EU's relationship with the House of Saud is based on regional stability and on important commercial ties, in particular oil and arms trading.
In fact, the relationship is so important that a three-year UK inquiry into alleged bribes paid to Saudi ministers by an arms contractor was killed by orders of Prime Minister Tony Blair on the grounds of national security.
Worryingly, Saudi Arabia's brand of fundamentalism, Wahabi Islam, is being exported globally.
In London - my constituency - textbooks at a Saudi-funded school were found to contain hate-filled passages about Christians and Jews.
This case of the Qatif gang-raped woman sentenced to 200 lashings has horrified the world.
Parliament's joint motion for a resolution expresses revulsion and repudiation of the Kingdom's values.
Twenty years ago a British TV documentary similarly recounted a story of a Saudi princess who was publicly executed for adultery.
The EU and Saudi Arabia have shared vital foreign policy interests, such as supporting the Middle Eastern peace process, encouraging the Saudis as Sunni Muslims to contain expansionist Shia Iran and supporting the Saudi fight against al-Qa'ida, many of whose adherents, unfortunately, come from Saudi Arabia originally.
But we also need to hold the Saudis to their UN Convention obligations to remove discrimination against women, who cannot even drive a car or vote in their limited local elections.
But let us not kid ourselves that we share values with this fundamentalist and medieval regime.
author. - Madam President, I will speak in a personal capacity on this matter.
Saudi Arabia is governed by a ruthless dictatorship which is, to a large extent, shamefully legitimised in most of the Western world, including many EU countries, because Saudi Arabia is immensely rich in petrol dollars, some of which it uses in Western states in order to bribe them into pretending not to see, not to hear and not to understand what is going on in that country.
But even schoolchildren know that the comical rulers of Saudi Arabia, consisting mostly of the family of one man, His Most Royal Excellency godlike King Abdullah, are imposing on their people a brutal repression.
One obvious example is that they treat women as slaves or as pieces of domestic furniture yet, as mentioned just now by Mr Tannock, Mr Abdullah and his six plane-loads of entourage were given a lavishly glorious state welcome in the UK and the Vatican only a few weeks ago.
And not a single word about human rights managed to escape through the honourable lips of the Queen of England, or the UK Prime Minister, or the Pope.
So much for hypocrisy and double standards, one might be tempted to say.
author. - (ES) Madam President, back in 2005 we had the opportunity to talk about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia, and in that context we did so in relation to the municipal elections and the fact that women were unable to vote.
As well as this discrimination in terms of political rights, however, there are many other types of discrimination that have been reported in various media, recently and continuously, which motivated this second resolution that we are debating today.
The trigger was certainly the incomprehensible sentence passed against a women, known as 'the Qatif woman', who was sentenced to 200 lashes for having been found in a car talking to a man who was not part of her family.
Not only are the alleged crime, and hence the sentence, unacceptable, but they are also aggravated by the fact that the convicted woman was unable to receive adequate legal advice.
Unfortunately this is not the only case in which one can deplore clearly discriminatory sentences for crimes and the failure to defend women in the legal system.
This is, unfortunately, more the norm than the exception.
How can a system be considered fair, for example, when it finds the victim of a rape guilty of that atrocity?
Structural change is needed in Saudi Arabia, and the European Union needs to help those who are working both outside and within the country to achieve this.
There are no relativisms here that carry weight.
Human rights, which include women's rights, are and need to be universal and defended in any context.
I therefore join in the request made by Mrs Svensson, and I ask the Commission and the Council once again to take any opportunity they can to ask the Saudi authorities to make the appropriate structural and institutional changes, in order to eliminate any form of discrimination against women, including recognising all their rights, in both private and public life, and more specifically, in the political, legal and judicial spheres.
author. - (PL) Madam President, Saudi Arabia is a country in which the law is put into effect according to Wahabi principles, this being the most radical Sunni trend in Islam.
Political, social and religious freedom is significantly restricted, and punishments by flogging, the amputation of hands or feet or the death penalty are meted out on a daily basis.
In a country that has been called 'a human rights desert' by Human Rights Watch, it is mainly women who fall victim to numerous forms of discrimination in private and public life.
The identity of women was only formally recognised in 2001, by issuing them with identity documents containing a photograph.
Before that they would prove their identity using a family identity document bearing a photograph of their husband or father.
Even if they can afford a car, they are not allowed to drive it.
They may study, but lectures given by men are watched by female students on video.
They are deprived of the right to vote, and decisions on divorce and child care are the exclusive prerogative of men.
Women are repeatedly the victims of unjust and offensive court verdicts.
The instance of the girl from Qatif concerns a 19-year-old gang-rape victim who was condemned to 200 lashes and six months in prison for being alone with a strange man at the time of her abduction.
Despite having signed it, Saudi Arabia does not observe the obligations arising from the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.
The authorities must start by lifting all restrictions on women where freedom of movement is concerned and take steps towards gradually increasing the involvement of women in political decision-making on an equal footing with men.
Women must have general access to employment at all levels of administration and the opportunity to carry out all public functions.
The introduction of a total ban on the use of flogging and other degrading corporal punishment must also be demanded, as this is a violation of international law and the UN Convention against Torture, to which Saudi Arabia is a signatory.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, I should like to add my voice to those of all the other members who have spoken and in particular to point out that we are celebrating the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, and equal opportunities, by definition, can have no borders, and we simply cannot remain indifferent to what is happening to women in Saudi Arabia and also in the rest of the Middle East as a whole.
I should like in particular to take up a question raised by Mr Tannock concerning specifically the right to drive a car.
The Committee of Demanders of Women's Right to Drive Cars was set up in Riyadh on 27 September.
On 6 November the committee commemorated the 17th anniversary of the demonstration against this ban, it has already collected a thousand signatures, and it has enormous strength.
It is led by four Saudi women. I should like to call on the whole House, in particular the Presidency, to lend full support to this Saudi Arabian initiative and I should also like to remind you that, in addition to Saudi Arabia, there are at the moment even more serious situations in Iraq.
I would remind you of the execution this year in Basra of 40 women for failing to respect the dress code currently being imposed in Iraq, a country where women had the vote before the women of Portugal did, and where today the most barbarous fanaticism is being introduced.
We cannot remain indifferent to that situation either.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, when addressing the issue of women's rights in Saudi Arabia, there is something that we need to keep in mind. This is that in Islamic societies there is no separation of religion and state.
The state is the religion and vice versa.
The lack of regard for women's rights derives from Islamic law, and by comprehending and taking into account this simple fact we might move a step closer to improving the situation.
We cannot impose our values, which have gone beyond our Judaeo-Christian traditions, but we can open a dialogue calling for mutual understanding and preparing the ground for a reform, as several conceptions that do not correspond to our worldwide view are now being disproved.
Having said that, the situation of women in Saudi Arabia is dreadful, and something needs to be done urgently.
I therefore urge my colleagues to support this report unanimously.
(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion we are holding here today on Saudi Arabia, particularly the dreadful situation regarding women's rights, should actually be extended to cover a large part of the Islamic world.
Only a few, such as the Dutch citizen Ayaan Hirsi Ali, dare come out with it.
The discrimination and subjugation of women is rooted in the holy texts of Islam itself.
Discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia and almost throughout the Islamic world has its basis and justification in the Koran.
This is a fundamental truth that we must dare to acknowledge in this debate.
It was demonstrated just recently in Sudan, where a 54-year-old teacher was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment for calling a teddy bear Mohammed, until being pardoned thanks to pressure from international diplomacy.
In Saudi Arabia, a 20-year-old woman fell victim to gang rape but was herself convicted.
It does not get any more symbolic than that.
However, Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US, of course, and can get away with that bit more.
After all, like China, Saudi Arabia is a rich country and we can venture to be rather more flexible when the noble principles we have been discussing so often this week are at stake.
Europe should thus also call on Washington to throw all its weight behind improving the situation in Saudi Arabia.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is extremely grateful for the opportunity to be able to say something today about the situation regarding women's rights in Saudi Arabia.
The case underlying your resolution gives us cause for the greatest concern.
A young woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months' imprisonment after being gang-raped by seven men.
The EU dealt with this matter immediately.
The EU Troika made representation to the Saudi Arabian Government in Riadh and expressed the EU's dismay at the verdict of the court in El Katif.
The verdict is not only clearly in breach of Saudi Arabia's international obligations, particularly against the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but also turns the principle of guilt upside down by declaring the victim to be guilty.
This case brings under the spotlight a country in which discrimination against women is unfortunately part of everyday life.
The European Parliament has justifiably asked the Saudi Arabian Government on several occasions to remove the limitations on women's free movement, including the driving prohibition.
This request also applies to the restrictions on women's access to employment, on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial processes.
I unreservedly share Parliament's concerns about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia.
At the same time Saudi Arabia is bound as a member of the UN Human Rights Council to protect and promote human rights.
Saudi Arabia is a contracting party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
Admittedly it has ratified the Convention with one reservation: in the event of a conflict between the clauses of the Convention and the standards of Islamic law, the Kingdom is not obliged thereafter to comply with any clauses of the Convention conflicting with this law.
The European Union has repeatedly called on Saudi Arabia to lift its reservations on this UN Convention - particularly with regard to granting equal rights for women and men in relation to the nationality of their children - and will continue to do so.
Human rights issues such as the situation of women are regularly the subject of representations by the European Union to Saudi Arabia.
The European Union is reminding Saudi Arabia of its obligations according to international human rights standards, is broaching the issue of the need to treat women and men equally and to combat violence against women and is asking Saudi Arabia to protect and promote women's rights.
Two recent changes that we have observed could - I say this very cautiously - could perhaps be a sign that Saudi Arabia is, making some progress.
The Saudi Arabian National Society for Human Rights produced its first report on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia in May of this year.
Violations of the rights of women, prisoners and workers are published in this report, as are court judgments.
The results and recommendations of this report should be acted on and followed up without fail by the Saudi Arabian Government
Furthermore, in October King Abdullah announced a fundamental judicial reform, reinforcing the independence of judges and simplifying fact-finding according to Sharia law supervised by the Supreme Court.
For a country like Saudi Arabia, these are encouraging steps.
We should therefore not only be drawing attention to human rights violations in Saudi Arabia where necessary, but also be welcoming and supporting the reforms that have recently been discreetly emerging.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at the end of the debates.
3.
Justice for the "Comfort Women"
The next item is the five motions for a resolution on justice for comfort women.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I have to say that, as the driving force behind this resolution, I am particularly satisfied that finally we have found the space and sufficient consensus to table it, because I sincerely believe that the subject deserved this, and much more.
We are talking about almost 200 000 women, euphemistically known as 'comfort women', who were forced to be sexual slaves during and before the Second World War by the Japanese Imperial Army.
After 62 years, the survivors are still seeking justice.
During their lives they have suffered from poor physical and mental health, isolation and shame, and often extreme poverty.
So far the Japanese Government has not complied with international rules on reparation, which include restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction, including full disclosure, apology and guaranteeing that the action will not be repeated.
This is particularly significant given that Japan is one of the main donors of aid in post-war times.
There was, therefore, an urgent need to react and to point out, as the survivors do, that truth must be linked to justice, and that an apology is empty if it is not accompanied by an acceptance of responsibility.
I would like to stress that this is not only about the rights of an individual victim, but about collective rights, which bring with them the responsibility to remember, so that this type of violation does not happen again.
This means that we must ask the Japanese to conduct an exercise in historical honesty and not only acknowledge the facts but apologise on behalf of their predecessors, and to compensate the victims.
Finally, I would like to express my great respect and recognition for the women who had and continue to have the courage to speak out and demand justice, and for the organisations like Amnesty International that are supporting them on this journey.
author. - (SV) Madam President, the Resolution calls for justice and redress for the hundreds of thousands of women, so-called 'comfort women', who were forced into providing sexual services before and during the Second World War.
All these degraded women who were held in sexual slavery are still waiting for justice and redress.
The Japanese authorities have indeed done a certain amount but, as the Resolution shows, a great deal remains for the Japanese Government and authorities to do in order to give those women justice and redress.
The majority of the women who were forced into this dreadful situation were very young at the time.
That means that their whole lives have been destroyed by these terrible experiences.
They have been forced to live out their lives in poor physical and psychological health, isolation, shame, and often extreme poverty.
The fact that these women have not had full justice and redress also means that those who committed these crimes have effectively enjoyed immunity for their acts.
Again the victims, women, are punished while the perpetrators go free.
This Resolution is also important for the reason that it highlights what always happens in war and conflict zones, that it is always women who are the main victims.
It is therefore important that we draw attention to this matter.
We must try to put a stop to this.
author. - (PL) Madam President, when we talk about crimes and when we think about crimes of the 20th century, we think above all of the crimes committed by the Germans and the Bolsheviks, or rather, to put it more broadly, the Communists.
In Europe we are less aware of the fact that in the Far East Japan committed immense crimes from the 1930s until the end of the war.
One of the greatest of these crimes was the sexual exploitation of women at this time.
Some 100 000 women from conquered countries in the Far East were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan.
This sexual slavery, which was in itself totally criminal, had further consequences too.
These consequences were enforced abortions, mutilations and murders on a large scale, and large-scale instances of suicide among these women.
Obviously any of these women who are still alive today are very old.
It must be conceded that during the post-war period the Japanese Government did much to compensate for these dreadful offences against the women who experienced them.
Today this resolution calls on the Japanese Government to make a final political, moral and financial settlement upon those women who are still alive and with the families of those who have died.
This is most certainly their due.
author. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with these women - I believe on behalf of all of us.
I am pleased that this is on the agenda, as it has taken a very long time.
The European Parliament has been wavering for five months over whether human rights for women should actually be a priority or not.
Mr Dillen, who has now left, has just said that oppression of women is typical of the Koran - which is complete nonsense, as the matter of 'comfort women' shows that men do not need the Koran to repress and abuse women.
I am actually also rather disappointed with the attitude in the European Parliament.
As I have just said, this House wavered over this for a very long time, and I have heard even Members of this Parliament coming up with arguments such as 'Well, yes, but 90% of these women did it of their own free will' and 'Oh well, it is their culture, you have to understand that'.
To be frank, I find this sickening.
It is rape, and rape is without exception a crime in all ages and all cultures.
I now gather that Japanese school textbooks have been adapted; but I then hear from the Japanese embassy that the tale has to be told very cautiously, as pupils do not yet know much about sexuality and could incur psychological damage.
No-one talks about the psychological damage to the 'comfort women' themselves.
To be frank, I find that quite shocking.
Anyway, I am pleased that this is now on our agenda and that we are just about to adopt it.
I think that it is important that apologies be sincere and unequivocal.
It is not a matter of a formality.
With the previous Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, once more casting doubt on the whole issue, it is not sufficient for the current government to then say 'Oh, but we shall continue with the previous policy'.
Sincere and unequivocal is what is needed.
Also, when I hear the arguments that have been forthcoming from the Japanese embassy in recent days - incidentally complete with a recognition of everything that has already been done - I think that much progress remains to be made on sincerity.
I hope, therefore, that this resolution expresses the solidarity of all of us with the victims.
author. - (DE) Madam President, I am very grateful to the previous speaker for having drawn attention to the fact that no religion on this earth is immune to massive human rights violations against women, but this is more to do with dictatorship and authoritarian systems than with a specific religion.
Hundreds of thousands of women before and during the Second World War were forced into prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces.
Historians' estimates assume that around 200 000 of these 'comfort women' from Korea, China, Taiwan and the Philippines were handed over to Japanese soldiers as sex slaves.
The 'comfort women' system is one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century and led to gang rapes on a massive scale and to forced abortions.
After the end of the war, many women were murdered by the armed forces or prevented from returning home.
Many of the survivors remained silent out of shame about their past and were stigmatised and relegated to the fringes of society.
The issue of forced prostitution was not broached at the war crime trials and there was no talk of reparation.
Not until the end of the 1980s did the fate of the comfort women come to light again.
The reason for this was not an automatic change in awareness, but the rapidly growing women's movement in South Korea.
Little by little, women who had been forced into prostitution spoke out publicly.
In 1992 weekly demonstrations began in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul with the words: the Japanese Government should be ashamed, not us.
In 1997 the Japanese Government was asked for the first time to take legal and moral responsibility internationally for the most severe human rights violations committed against women.
In her report the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women demanded financial compensation for the victims and court sentences for the perpetrators.
The reaction of the Japanese Government at the time was an out and out rejection of these demands.
It has already been said several times today that the truth must be taken into account.
We are therefore asking the Japanese Government publicly to reject any assertions that deny or question the subjugation and enslavement of the comfort women and we are likewise demanding that they accept moral and legal responsibility for the enslavement of 200 000 people.
We are calling on the Japanese Government to implement mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims and their families as quickly as possible.
Many victims of the comfort women system have passed away or are at least 80 years old, which means speed is of the essence.
We are also calling on our colleagues in the Japanese National Assembly, however, to make their contribution in parliament to help get these mechanisms accepted.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, there are pages in the world's history we would wish not to be repeated anywhere, ever.
One of these pages is the story of 'comfort women'.
I refer to the officially commissioned acquisition of young women by the Government of Japan, from the 1930s and during the Second World War, for the sole purpose of sexual servitude to the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces.
We do not know exactly the numbers of women who were enslaved but we know that the 'comfort women system' included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation and sexual violence, resulting in mutilation, death or eventual suicide, and that it was one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century, involving not hundreds but thousands of women.
Today, the remaining survivors are 80 and more years of age and one could argue that the problem is no longer an important issue.
But I fully understand the wish of these women and their families to clear their names.
Today we express our solidarity with the women who were victims of this system.
We call on the Japanese Government to formally acknowledge and accept historical and legal responsibility and to implement effective administrative mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims of the 'comfort women system' and to the families of deceased victims.
Taking into account the excellent relationship between the European Union and Japan, based on the mutually shared values of the rule of law and respect for human rights, I hope that the Government and the Parliament of Japan will take all necessary measures to recognise the sufferings of sex slaves and to remove existing obstacles to obtaining reparations before Japanese courts and that current and future generations will be educated about these events.
I am sure that official recognition of the existence of the 'comfort women system' and an apology on behalf of the Japanese Government also would do much to help heal the wounds of our painful common history.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, people can be forgiven for their sins, but people's crimes cannot be forgotten.
This applies as much to Japan as it did, for example, to Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia.
The Japanese committed immensely barbaric war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.
To some extent, they paid dearly by having two of their cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, annihilated by the mighty nuclear holocaust brought upon them by the US.
However, Japan inflicted many dreadful evils on the world in the past, and one of these - the sexual slavery of 'comfort women' - only came to prominence relatively recently.
Some of these poor and now frail elderly ladies are still with us, as the remnants of a past that is inconvenient for Japan but torturous for them.
These women are asking for two very simple things from today's rich and powerful Japan: an official apology and very modest humanitarian aid.
Certainly, the European Parliament, with this joint motion for a resolution, expects and demands that the Japanese Government must do both and fast.
Otherwise, aside from the stigma of shame, the EU must consider taking particularly effective action against ex-imperial Japan.
Madam President, the subject of today's debate is a violation of human rights that took place during the 1930s, during the Japanese occupation, when young women in the Imperial Armed Forces were sexually exploited and forced into prostitution, despite the fact that the Japanese Government had signed international conventions on combating traffic in women and children and supported the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.
The sincere sympathy of the Japanese premier is currently being undermined by Japanese officials in connection with the closure of the Asian Women's Fund programme and mandate in March 2007, out of which only monetary compensation was paid to women.
In supporting the resolution and the demand for compensation, we would, however, point out that in modern times, too, the boundary between the normal and the pathological is being eroded, and this flies in the face of moral norms, so there is a need for radical moves to combat prostitution as a form of modern-day slavery.
Prostitutes are not just victims of wars that took place 50 years ago; it could also be women of today who are being exploited, in the Belgian Congo, for example, as reported in the press, and indeed in many other countries, even rich ones.
In the name of respect for the human being we should also unmask the spread of a hedonistic and commercial culture that is pointing towards abuse in the area of sex, drawing even very young women and girls into the sphere of prostitution and other forms of demoralisation.
Respect for the identity and dignity of women is not based solely on uncovering crimes or abuses in the sphere of sexual discrimination or other injustices; it is based primarily on the drafting of development programmes and on the real-life practice of principles embracing all areas of a woman's life.
These principles must be rooted in a new realisation of the worth of a woman as wife, mother, carer or employee, as a human being and a person who is the equal of a man, despite being different.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1993 the Japanese Government spokesman at that time, Yohei Kono, extended Japan's 'sincere apologies and remorse to all those ... who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women'.
In 1995 the Prime Minister at that time, Mr Murayama, also apologised publicly to the comfort women on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
That same year the Asian Women's Fund was set up to grant reparations and medical aid to survivors on behalf of the Japanese Government and people.
These attempts to obtain reparations for the comfort women and a renewed public apology from the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 2005 are positive steps by Japan.
Japan has thereby recognised its responsibility for these unspeakable human rights violations.
Only a few days ago, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the declaration of the government spokesman, Mr Kono, which I quoted at the beginning, as Japan's official position.
We now have the moving testimony of survivors, and this moving testimony has again aroused interest in this terrible period, in Europe as well as in the United State, Canada and Australia.
Our actions here are not simply about the past; they are about drawing the right conclusions from the events and doing everything in our power to combat today's forms of slavery, sexual exploitation and human trafficking.
With the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission is actively supporting NGOs throughout the world involved in preventing violence against women and children and combating human trafficking for the purpose of sexual slavery.
On 23 November 2007 the Commission sent out a further signal on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, by having affirmed its emphatic commitment to combating gender-based violence.
The European Union is conducting a regular human rights dialogue with Japan, touching on all the EU's concerns - including women's rights.
Japan is a like-minded global player cooperating constructively with us in multilateral forums in order to improve respect for and protection of human rights.
Together with the European Union, Japan has therefore issued a resolution on human rights in North Korea and denounced the actions of the regime in Myanmar.
The debate is closed.
The vote on these three topics will take place at the end of today's sitting.

Results of the European Council meeting of 13 and 14 December 2007 in Brussels - Report on the six months of the Portuguese Presidency (debate)
The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the results of the European Council of 13 and 14 December and the report on the six months of the Portuguese Presidency.
I should first of all like to thank the Portuguese President sincerely and to recognise how very successful the Portuguese Presidency has been.
I should also like, even though I cannot name them all, to mention a few representative people: the President-in-Office, Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates, Foreign Minister LuÃ­s Amado, Secretary of State Manuel Lobo Antunes and also, of course, Ambassador Ãlvaro MendonÃ§a e Moura.
Many thanks to you and all your colleagues who have assisted you.
My sincere thanks also to the Commission and its President, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso.
I should also like to say here once again (I have already said this briefly to the European Council) that the fact that we have been able to reach a result on the important issue of the Galileo Project is also due to the fact that the European Commission and the European Parliament have cooperated so well together and we have in the end been able to achieve a good result together with the Portuguese Presidency.
Many thanks to the Commission too in this respect.
Ladies and gentlemen, the past week has been very eventful.
First of all the signing of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on Wednesday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, followed by the signing of the Reform Treaty on Thursday in Lisbon and finally the Summit on Friday in Brussels.
I must say, President-in-Office, Mr SÃ³crates, that the ceremonial signing of the Treaty at the Hieronymus Monastery in Lisbon was a very beautiful, symbolic expression of our many common interests.
We hope that all the parliaments and peoples will now follow Hungary's example and quickly adopt the Treaty as well.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency and I myself have reached the point of reporting on our Presidency to Parliament with the feeling that we have done our duty.
I think you will agree with me when I say that Europe and the Europeans have good reason to feel satisfied with political developments over the last six months.
Indeed, I am convinced that Europe today is stronger, more self-assured and more confident.
At the end of these six months it is a better Europe; better in relation to itself, but also better in relation to the rest of the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are well of the three priorities of the Portuguese Presidency.
The priorities, I would recall, were the Treaty and the EU-Brazil and EU-Africa summits.
As I had the opportunity to say here in the session launching the Portuguese Presidency, they were always the three main priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, right from the beginning.
I am very pleased to tell you that we have achieved all the goals we set ourselves for these six months.
But let us begin with the goal that was the most important of all: the Treaty.
The Treaty, the new Treaty for Europe.
This was always the top priority, and the new Treaty that we signed in Lisbon and named the Treaty of Lisbon is, of course, a treaty that resolves Europe's institutional deadlock, a treaty that responds to Europe's institutional crisis.
I must tell you that no sign of confidence was of greater importance for the European project, for Europeans and for the European economy than overcoming that deadlock and that crisis.
But this Treaty also responded to the three major challenges facing Europe.
First, the challenge of European citizenship.
The challenge of affirming the values underlying our political project and that affirmation of values and of European citizenship is contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaimed in this Parliament but which has legal force through its inclusion in the Treaty of Lisbon.
That was the first challenge.
The second, of course, was to give Europe better decision-making ability.
Anyone who is familiar with Europe clearly understands that a Europe of 27 had to change its rules.
Changing the rules, keeping the rules democratic, but allowing the institutions to respond more effectively and efficiently on behalf of all Europeans to the challenges of the new world.
This challenge was also addressed by the Treaty of Lisbon.
Finally, the challenge of having stronger and more capable institutions, institutions equal to the new demands that Europe is facing.
This challenge is also now addressed by the Treaty of Lisbon.
And if we want to attempt to sum up the Treaty of Lisbon it is precisely here that we should do it.
It is a treaty that meets the three major challenges: transforming Europe into a political project that affirms its values and affirms European citizenship, a Europe that is now better able to take up the challenges of modern times, that has the conditions for more effective decision-making, and also a Europe that has strengthened its institutions to respond to Europeans' aspirations and also to what the world expects of Europe.
This is an important treaty for Europe, but it is also a treaty that makes Europe stronger to serve a better world.
It is not only a treaty for the Europeans, for the European economy, it is also a treaty that gives a clear signal to the world that Europe is back and is back to pursue a European project in a form to inspire many continents all over the world.
The Treaty: this priority was achieved under the Portuguese Presidency.
But while the Treaty was perhaps the greatest contribution that we made to a stronger Europe, I would like to emphasise the other two priorities.
First, the summit with Brazil.
Why Brazil?
For the simple reason that EU external policy already included annual summits with India, Russia and China but has never had an annual summit with Brazil.
By approving a strategic partnership at that summit we are transforming the EU's external policy into a more coherent and more understandable policy.
We now have a policy with BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - that serves a Europe that wants to be a global political player.
This summit with Brazil and the strategic partnership that we established has enhanced Europe's external policy and established better conditions to bolster the European economy, and also to endorse the values and aims of the European project.
Thirdly the summit with Africa.
The Africa summit.
When we embarked on the Africa summit we were well aware of the difficulties we were facing, but we overcame them because it was clear from the start that we were right, that Europe was paying the price of seven years with no political dialogue with Africa, that this was bad for Africa, bad for Europe and bad for the world.
There was no reason not to have a broader and global political dialogue with Africa.
And perhaps Portugal's sensitivity made it better placed to appreciate that this was a mistake.
We corrected this mistake with the Africa summit.
The summit was a success, because for the first time in the history of the world, Europe has a joint strategy with Africa.
Let us not deceive ourselves; it is not a European strategy for Africa, or vice versa.
No, it is a joint strategy of both continents and a joint strategy that is being pursued on the basis of five main themes that are important to both continents: peace and security, climate change, human rights, areas that are - migrations too, excuse me, I was forgetting that area of major importance - those are the five structuring themes of a political dialogue with Africa that, as I said, concerns Africa, Europe and also the world as a whole.
But we did not restrict ourselves to approving a joint strategy, we also laid down an action plan and a mechanism for implementing the strategy, and we are now setting up an institution between the European Commission and the African Union, the African Union Commission, to enable them to work together to implement what we have agreed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am in no doubt that anyone at all familiar with these issues, anyone interested in human rights, in issues of climate change, of migration and immigrant advocacy, of development or security, will be pleased to see that Europe and Africa have at last set up a political framework for negotiation and dialogue.
I am in no doubt that Europe's external policy is better and richer since the Africa summit and I am therefore pleased to tell you that over these six months we have succeeded in overcoming obstacles and deadlocks, and that we have also succeeded in overcoming prejudices so that we can claim today, at the end of the Portuguese Presidency, that Europe has become stronger not only internally but also in its external policy.
We now have a coherent policy in relation to the BRIC countries and a political dialogue with Africa that everyone involved in external relations thought it was a mistake not to have in recent years.
The Treaty, Brazil and Africa are achievements, and achievements for the benefit of Europe, but I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, that there is not time here to recount, even in summary, all the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, but I would like to tell you, albeit briefly, that this Presidency has left its mark on the main items on the European agenda and I would like to begin with the agenda regarding freedoms.
This Presidency left its mark on the freedom agenda the moment we proclaimed here the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that was a decisive moment for the European project, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as I have said earlier, now has legal force in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It was also under the Portuguese Presidency that we succeeded in establishing the European Day against the Death Penalty and this honours European values and gives a clear signal to the world of Europe's defence of the value of life.
I would also like you to know that it was during the Portuguese Presidency, at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, that a moratorium on the death penalty was agreed and that vote came as a result of a European proposal that honours European traditions and values.
Moreover, I would also like to highlight in this freedom agenda the efforts that the Portuguese Presidency made to extend the area of freedom of movement to the new Member States.
On 21 and 22 December, with the President of the Commission, and a number of ministers, I will have the opportunity to be present at the borders where controls are to be abolished, with nine countries entering the Schengen area, thereby fulfilling the greatest aspiration of those citizens who want to be part of Europe, to have freedom of movement while at the same time belonging to an area that safeguards their security.
SISone4all is a nice story, because it was at Portuguese insistence that on 31 December 2007 these internal border controls will be abolished, because it was a Portuguese minister who would not accept the idea that it was technically impossible to connect the databases of the new countries to the databases of the Schengen system, and because it was a Portuguese firm that proposed a technical solution to the problem.
On 21 and 22 December we will be in those countries telling them that Portugal is very proud to have been able to contribute with Portuguese technology and Portuguese political will to enable those countries to give their citizens full freedom of movement, because that is the highest aspiration of the European peoples.
I am from a country that experienced that moment; I remember well the moment when border controls between Portugal and Spain were abolished, and indeed for the first time we felt part of the European family.
It is for that reason that if there is a symbolic moment of this Presidency it will be when the Portuguese and other politicians, and the President of the Commission, are present at those borders to mark the moment when controls are abolished, thereby realising a European dream and aspiration to create that area of freedom of movement and security that the Schengen area represents.
We did leave our mark on the freedom agenda, but also on the social agenda.
I would like to remind everyone that it was during the Portuguese Presidency that an agreement was reached between European trade unions and employers' associations, and it is a very important agreement that underlines the challenges for the European labour market, but it was also during this Presidency that all the countries agreed on the common principles of flexicurity, so acting as a driving force, moving ahead with this European model designed to make the flexibility that is indispensable to competitiveness compatible with security for workers, which is peculiar to the European social model.
Finally on this social agenda, I would like to highlight the attention that we gave to migration policy.
Over the six months we placed much emphasis on this issue.
We held an international conference in Lisbon because our goal was and is to help lay down or set out the broad guidelines for a European migration policy.
At the latest Council, the President of the Commission had the opportunity to present the Commission's document defining the bases of that policy, a migration policy that essentially has three pillars: inclusion of immigrants, combating illegal immigration, and cooperation with countries of origin, so as to regulate migratory flows and thereby protect immigrants.
That is a landmark, an important item on the European social agenda and Portugal is very proud to have helped make progress on that European migration policy.
The Portuguese Presidency also made its mark on the economic agenda, by which I mean, as the President of the European Parliament said, our approval under this Portuguese Presidency of the Galileo project, which for many years was dragging its feet, damaging Europe and sending out a clear signal to the whole world that Europe was incapable, in such a decisive sector, of having its own project.
This Galileo project is perhaps one of the infrastructure projects for raising Europe's profile in the world and endorsing Europe in the highly competitive field of telecommunications.
That is why we are very proud that it was under the leadership of the Portuguese Presidency and of Minister MÃ¡rio Lino that agreement was finally reached that distinguishes Europe and the European project.
Also on the economic agenda, I would like to highlight our contribution to a Europe-wide maritime policy, with the approval of the Framework Directive on the marine environment strategy as a basic condition for Europe to have a consistent approach between all countries in their relationship to the sea.
As regards energy and climate change, I would like to highlight just two points: the first was the conclusion of the strategic plan for energy technologies.
That is an absolutely fundamental point marking Europe's ambitions in this area and its will to invest as much as possible in innovation and research so that we can meet the challenges of the future.
I would also like to point to the Bali agreement, achieved under the Portuguese Presidency, which provides us today with a clear roadmap for negotiations so that in 2009 we can again reach a global agreement to respond to the challenges of climate change.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we also left a mark on the agenda for the future of the European Union meaning, of course, the Declaration on Globalisation that we approved in the latest Council.
This declaration means the following: firstly, Europe has solved its institutional problems and is now looking to face the challenges of this changing world to assume a position of leadership in institutional reform, to address education, training and research as a central issue to solve Europe's role in a globalised world, but also to combat all the environmental challenges threatening the world.
This European globalisation agenda means that Europe is back, and Europe is back to discussing absolutely fundamental issues that it had unfortunately put very much on the back burner because in recent years it was so tied up with its institutional problems.
A declaration on globalisation, but also an agreement on the Reflection Group.
At the recent Council we adopted a mandate for this Reflection Group to enable it to contribute to a general reflection on this issue and the future of Europe between 2020 and 2030.
To enable it to help anticipate and meet the challenges, we also approved the leadership of this group - Felipe GonzÃ¡lez, who is one of the great Europeans in European History, returning to political life to lead a reflection group serving what for him has always been one of his noblest ideals: the European project, together with Vice-Chairs Vike-Freiberga and Jorma Ollila who will join him in leading the group that has been formed in the meantime.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, I am not going to describe every detail of the Portuguese Presidency's achievements, but I would like to tell you that I am very proud of this Presidency and very pleased about it.
We achieved all the goals we set ourselves; the most important ones and even those we doubted we would achieve.
The Treaty, Brazil, Africa, but also the marks we made in the economic agenda, the social agenda, the freedom agenda and the agenda for the future.
This Presidency, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is a Presidency of a pro-European country, a country that clearly understands that it is defending its own interests through the European project, in a country committed to European ideals, in a country led by European politicians who clearly understand that what Europe needs is to develop the European project and that this European project is probably the most generous, most critical and most important project of modern times, that this European project is important for Europeans, for the European economy, and also important for the world.
If you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to finish with some thanks, and with a very personal thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is sitting here beside me, who has accompanied me throughout these six months, to the Secretary of State for European Affairs, who is here with me, but I would also like to thank the Portuguese diplomatic corps, which organised everything, working in the background and often unacknowledged for the fruits of its labours; I want to thank the whole Portuguese diplomatic corps that gave of its best for its country and for Europe and was headed by one of the great Portuguese ambassadors, ambassador MendonÃ§a e Moura, who is here with me.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we began this Presidency with the motto: 'A stronger Europe for a better world' and we have reached the end of these six months convinced that we have honoured that motto, that we gave of our best as a country so that Europe might present itself as a stronger Europe, a Europe that better serves its citizens and a Europe that is better equipped to play its role in the world.
We did it all for Europe, in the service of Europe, because that is how to defend the interests of Portugal, of Europe and also of the world.
I would like to thank all the Parliamentary groups that gave us so much support over this period; I would like to thank the Commission for its support and I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for his constant help that he never refused the Portuguese Presidency.
I am very proud of and very pleased about the Presidency and so I would like to share my happiness with you which is a happiness for Europe.
(Applause)
Many thanks, President-in-Office, for this speech and once again for your great dedication.
Commissioner. - (PT) Mr President, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over the past six months we have had an excellent illustration of what we have championed as the two ways of making progress in Europe.
Namely, at the same time as endeavouring to resolve institutional issues, we are endeavouring to make progress in terms of practical results, to demonstrate to our citizens that Europe is truly at the service of their aspirations.
2007 showed that Europe is capable of taking up these challenges.
We have just seen the negotiation, agreement and signature of a treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, that will give Europe the institutions for the future, so that it can respond to the challenges of the 21st century.
At this point, I would like once again to pay tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and especially to Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates for his competent leadership of the European Union.
It is also only right to acknowledge the important contribution of the German Presidency and Chancellor Merkel when the mandate was obtained that enabled positive progress to be made on this agreement that is so important for Europe.
Certainly at the beginning there were many who doubted the need to make this effort, but the truth is that a few days ago, in Lisbon, the 27 EU governments were able to come together on a treaty that they themselves had negotiated.
That political achievement now has to be put into practice.
The Member States have agreed on and signed the Treaty and also agreed to ratify it, so that it enters into force on 1 January 2009.
This undertaking by the Member States must be taken very seriously.
By signing the Treaty, the governments have taken responsibility to defend the Treaty before their parliaments and public opinion.
They must be successful in those tasks if Europe is to move forward.
Mr President, I wish to warmly salute Hungary for the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon yesterday.
The Treaty was ratified with an overwhelming majority: 385 'yes' votes and only five 'no' votes.
(Applause)
I think it is a very symbolic fact and a very positive political signal that one of the new Member States is the first country to ratify the Lisbon Treaty.
Hungary deserves our applause.
At the same time, during this period and specifically in these six months, we have seen the European Union taking a lead on policies that affect every European every day: economic growth and job creation, climate change, energy, migration and innovation.
These are the issues that will determine the success of Europe now and in the future.
Prime Minister SÃ³crates has already spoken about many of the achievements of the Presidency.
I will not repeat all of them.
I could, of course, agree with everything he said: the importance of the European Union-Africa Summit, the first summit with Brazil on the strategic relationship with that very important country, the agreement it was possible to reach on Galileo, and the very important agreement by the social partners on the principles of flexicurity.
I could also add some other points and underline some that sometimes have deserved less attention but are also important.
For instance, the general political agreement reached with the European Parliament on the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology - a very concrete project and a real flagship for innovation in Europe - and also the launch of an integrated maritime policy for the Union.
This brings to fruition extensive work begun by the Commission almost three years ago, in March 2005.
Following a wide public debate on a Green Paper issued by the Commission in June 2006, we have now reached a clear consensus in the European institutions on how important maritime policy is for the Union to meet the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, of climate change and energy, and to maximise the potential of our oceans and seas in a sustainable manner.
Following in the footsteps of the European Parliament's excellent five-committee report of July, the Commission's vision of an integrated maritime policy for the Union and an action plan were fully endorsed by the European Council last week.
A particular note of appreciation is due to the Portuguese Presidency for making this a priority for the Union.
How were all these achievements made possible?
Central to this has been the effective cooperation between the three core institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers have been able to work together to develop a real consensus across a wide range of the European Union's work.
We have also benefited from a growing realisation that the European Union offers the right vehicle to address today's big challenges.
Just look at the Eurobarometer figures released today.
These confirm the figures from spring this year that overall support for the European Union is higher than at any time over the past decade.
We are winning the trust of European citizens; now we must show that we deserve that trust.
Last week, in a matter of days, we saw the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the three institutions in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon and, following those very important moments, a European Council focus on key issues of direct interest to citizens.
After the historic steps of Wednesday and Thursday, on Friday the European Council returned to the crucial task of turning the Europe of results into reality, and we now have a framework in place for the results the European Union should deliver in 2008.
Critical to our future action is the importance of globalisation.
It was not so long ago that policy-makers tended to shy away from globalisation.
Globalisation was seen as being too difficult and too divisive, and sometimes we even wanted to avoid the word.
The Declaration on Globalisation approved by the European Council has turned this around.
We know now that Europe can unite around an activist, proactive approach to globalisation.
Not all the impact of globalisation is positive - we know that - but that is no reason for passivity.
It should rather redouble our efforts to make the most of the opportunities for Europe offered by globalisation.
The European Union has every reason to feel confident about its future in the age of globalisation.
It is showing how the values which govern European society are fully compatible with the proactive approach to globalisation.
That is the message to come out of the Declaration on Globalisation.
There is now a real sense of momentum in our agenda for succeeding in the age of globalisation, a momentum we will keep up by a series of Commission initiatives in the coming months.
I was pleased that the Portuguese Presidency decided to devote particular attention to migration.
If we manage the issue of migration well, everyone can benefit: Europe, the European Union Member States, but also the countries of origin and the migrants themselves, because, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us, this is also a social issue.
The European Council backed the integrated approach proposed by the Commission early this December.
To back up the proposals we already have on the table, such as illegal migration, undeclared work and the blue card for highly-skilled workers, we will come forward with new proposals next year to build a truly comprehensive approach at European level regarding migration.
Before this, we will come forward with our package of measures to realise the Union's promises on climate change and energy.
This is another point about globalisation: climate change and the need to have a global solution to a global problem.
I am happy to say to you that Europe is really leading this issue worldwide.
I am proud that the European Union and our 27 Member States spoke with one voice at the Bali Conference.
The declaration is an important step in the right direction on the road to Copenhagen in 2009.
I know that some of us would have wished for more - I personally would have preferred more - but the fact that there was a consensus at a United Nations Conference and a commitment to a target date and a post-2012 regime was in itself a success and, let us be frank, that success would not have been possible without European leadership and European unity.
The focus is now on the need to ensure the follow-up and insist on ambitious, binding targets for the reduction of CO2.
Just a few days after Bali, there is a palpable sense that the wind of change is blowing in our direction.
Some of our main partners who have not yet changed their minds - Australia already has - will change their minds.
But we need to keep up the pressure to give meaning to our leadership.
The best way to do this is to show we mean business by driving on with our own proposals.
I want to work closely with this Parliament over the next year and agree a common goal of a political agreement on the full package by the end of next year.
The European Council also took the opportunity to look further ahead, not only in terms of a declaration on globalisation but to come up with some ideas.
The reflection group is an innovative approach, one which can pay off.
Looking ahead to 2020, 2030 requires discipline and imagination, but the result can help us to keep the focus on the big picture, in particular on the global challenges.
The group can count on the support of the Commission when the full team starts its work later next year.
I also welcome the choice of Felipe GonzÃ¡les, a very experienced statesman and a committed European, as Chairman of the Group, and the two Vice-Chairs, Mrs Vike-Freiberga and Mr Jorma Ollila.
The European Council also looked at more immediate challenges.
The stability of Kosovo is heavily dependent on a united European Union, and a solution for Serbia and Kosovo lies in Europe.
They know that and we know that.
We must carry this through into determined and united European Union action.
This is a stern test for Europe, one that we cannot afford to fail.
The European Commission encourages the Member States to keep a united and coherent approach regarding the Kosovo issue.
Before I finish, let me say that the Commission is extremely satisfied that European consensus on humanitarian aid has been adopted by Parliament and the Council.
The declaration that I have the honour of signing after this sitting with President PÃ¶ttering and Prime Minister SÃ³crates is a wide-ranging policy statement about our objectives, principles and good practice approaches to humanitarian aid, delivered both bilaterally by Member States and by the European Community.
The consensus is a milepost for European Union humanitarian aid.
The European Commission alone is the second largest humanitarian donor in the world and, by driving forward this consensus, has responded strongly to the increasingly challenging environment facing humanitarians.
The raising of the Commission policy voice in this area, in the light of its considerable experience in the provision of humanitarian aid and its unique role at the heart of the European Union, is positively welcomed by the Member States, Parliament and also humanitarian partners.
Internal work has now been launched to translate the commitments contained in the consensus into a draft action plan that should be presented in the first semester of 2008.
Finally, as President-in-Office of the European Council, Prime Minister Socrates has just said, this year's work is not yet over.
I will have the honour before the end of the year to join him in very symbolic acts of opening our internal borders.
As of 21 December 2007, we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders.
This is a unique and historic accomplishment.
Estonia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia will lift internal border controls.
This will make travelling for all Europeans quicker and easier.
From 21 December 2007 travel will be possible from the Iberian Peninsula to Poland, from Greece to Finland without border checks.
I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its strategic leadership for the successful implementation of the Schengen Information System project: the 'SIS One For All'.
The lifting of the European Union's internal borders brings opportunities for people living, circulating and doing business in Europe.
It is important to explain to our citizens that, at the same time as we are lifting border controls and promoting freedom, security standards are also being reinforced, because this also means efficient checks at external borders.
We should not forget that now, for example, the Spanish border is the Polish border and the Polish border is also the Greek border, so we can do this without a reinforcement of our security at the external borders and we are moving ahead only because those Member States have made the effort required.
So I believe that - not only from a symbolic point of view - this will be a very important development of our new, enlarged, committed Europe.
The overall message from 2007 is one of great hope, and no little expectation.
The eyes of Europeans are turning to the European Union for the answers to so many questions.
The past few months can give us confidence that we are up to the task.
(Applause)
Commission President, many thanks for your speech and your dedication.
Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today this Parliament celebrates a fully functioning Europe.
The Treaty of Lisbon is signed.
Its ratification has begun.
I congratulate Hungary, the first of our Member States to have ratified it.
With the Treaty of Lisbon, our shared values - democracy, freedom, solidarity - and our objectives - peace, security, environmental protection and prosperity - reaffirm our common destiny.
Yes, the Treaty of Lisbon gives our Union greater cohesion.
The integration process we began 50 years ago is still ongoing: we are still united in diversity!
It is this diversity of origin, culture and language that makes Europe truly rich and that is established in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is from inclusion that pluralist Europe draws its strength.
We, the law-makers, have a duty of explanation towards our fellow citizens.
Let us make it as simple as possible.
The European Union and the Member States are united.
They share their competences.
They have decided to exercise part of their sovereignty jointly.
Let us ask of Europe the things in which it has competence and let us ask of the Member States the things in which they have competence.
My group will continue to campaign for the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which puts the seal on our shared values.
Let us hope that this is explained, understood and above all respected by everyone, and that this Treaty also gains the support of the greatest number of our fellow citizens.
From 2009, the new institutional framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon will increase this Parliament's powers.
It is important to know that from June 2009 the results of the European elections will determine this Parliament's composition and will affect the appointment of the President of the Commission.
Obviously my group hopes to convince as many of our fellow European citizens as possible to vote for EPP-ED leadership, a leadership capable of pursuing a socioeconomic strategy to deal with globalisation and an ageing population, a leadership capable of investing in research and development, of developing a European area of justice and security to fight crime, illegal immigration and terrorism more effectively, a leadership capable of making the right choices for the protection of our environment, sustainable development and our energy independence, a leadership capable of conducting a foreign policy that enables Europe to speak with one voice.
That, for us, is the basis of the competences of a united Europe and of future governance, European governance.
That is what is needed in Kosovo today to keep the peace.
Peace and stability in the Balkans, at the gates of the EU, is very much a matter for Europeans.
Good governance of Europe also has a medium- and long-term vision, however, and we support the European Council's decision to set up a Reflection Group to measure the future impact of decisions taken today, here, at the heart of our democracy, which will seek solutions to the challenges that a united Europe will have to face in the next 10, 20 or 30 years, which will reflect on EU development strategies.
Only strong governance can dispel the reluctance and opposition to the fight against climate change.
The assessment of Bali is a striking example.
Europe needs a leadership role in order to tackle climate issues, first in Poznan in 2008, where the next negotiations on the climate will take place, then in Copenhagen in 2009.
We European politicians have a major responsibility there.
Mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future would be a crime.
It is up to us to convince our American partners of this.
Climate and good governance in Europe are also matters to be dealt with today, here in Brussels, as the Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries meet for their annual marathon of discussions on production quotas.
Let us not forget the impact of climate change on food production.
We have already experienced large increases in the price of food products, last August.
Yet another has occurred, with wheat and rice reaching record prices.
Once again, European citizens are waiting for answers from Europe, as well as concerted, coordinated action.
Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we have built 50 years of peace, we have managed to create a single market, we have abolished internal borders, we have a Central Bank and a European currency, since Amsterdam we have been working on a common foreign policy, and we have Europol and Eurojust.
We are creating an area of security and justice by enlarging and expanding the Schengen area.
Europe's demand is greater.
The Treaty of Lisbon is bringing the EU out of its downward spiral.
For me and my group, the construction of Europe in the 21st century is once again becoming synonymous with enthusiasm and ambition.
From a free trade area to a true political Europe, we are starting to talk about the European project again and are ready to make choices.
In this new globalised world, there is no place for 'everyone for himself'.
Our Member States, however large or densely populated they may be, have no chance of prosperity without integration.
Thank you to the President, thank you to the President-in-Office of the Council, thank you to the President of the Commission, season's greetings to us all and above all our best wishes for the adoption of the Treaty in 2008 by the other 26 countries.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency has been a success and I congratulate you, Mr SÃ³crates, and your entire government, on this success.
The Lobo Antunes family has given us not only a good Secretary of State, but also a distinguished writer who has written an interesting novel entitled The Splendour of Portugal, a line from the national anthem.
Portugal's reputation has grown with this Presidency, specifically thanks to three things, which you yourself have mentioned.
Yes, indeed, in relation to Europe the Africa Summit has given back to Africa part of that dignity of which we Europeans have deprived Africans for a long time.
This has been one of the successes of your Presidency.
The fact that you have organised a summit with Brazil shows that policy on Latin America has to be given greater attention in European policy because it is in fact based on common traditions (Portugal, Brazil, Spain, South America, Central America), but also today specifically on common values as well, which we share above all with a region of the world - Latin America.
Organising this summit with Brazil was therefore the right step.
While we are on the subject of common values, I would like to thank you especially, on behalf of my Group, for focusing your activities on the battle to abolish the death penalty and for creating a European Day against the Death Penalty, one of the glories of the Portuguese Council Presidency.
(Applause)
However, we also have challenges ahead of us.
The Treaty has been solemnly signed, but I have already experienced the solemn signing of a treaty and I have seen all those who solemnly signed it.
I have also seen the undergrowth into which they subsequently disappeared, those solemn signatories!
Some are no longer in office and this may also be a good thing.
Now that this Treaty is being ratified, there is something to fight for.
We have already expressed our thanks to Hungary.
But if we want to be successful in 2008, we also have to look at precisely what is contained in the conclusions of the Council session held after the ceremonial signing.
On behalf of my Group, I welcome the fact that the Council acknowledges that the guidelines on an integrated economic policy must be revised.
I hope the Commission takes this seriously and provides an appropriate statement.
I also welcome the fact that the Council is asking for a Commission statement on services of general interest, which is also one of our Group's demands.
I have written to all the Heads of Government on this.
I hope that you, Commission President, will now finally take this seriously, because you said only a few weeks ago that we did not need a statement of this kind.
The Council disagrees with you here and, as Socialists, we are on the Council's side.
You have said, Commission President - and that is why I am appealing to you now - that our work is not yet over.
You referred here to Schengen.
Together with Mr SÃ³crates you are going to open the borders.
That is fantastic.
But I know you will still have your work cut out tomorrow.
The Commission wants to conclude the draft Directive on cross-border health services tomorrow.
I do not know whether it makes sense for a decision like this to be made quickly at the Commission with one day to go before Christmas or before the Christmas holidays.
Bolkestein was also decided quickly one day before the summer break and subsequently cost us the ratification of the Constitution.
I would therefore say to you: if you adopt it tomorrow, please be aware that everything outside the framework of the Services Directive, i.e. outside the country of origin principle, is subject to the following interpretation: we have set a clear framework in the context of the Services Directive.
If we try to force the country of origin principle through the back door again with specific directives, we will be up against the opposition of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Bear this in mind for the resolution tomorrow!
We need ratification to be successful in 2008.
Europe's citizens have seen that the Portuguese Council Presidency - together with the German Presidency, too, I happily acknowledge - has led this Union out of stagnation in 2007.
We have begun to move, we now have a new basis for the Treaty, but one which is not yet in force.
If we want it to come into force, then we need the trust of the people.
If we want to gain this trust, however, we have to say to the people: 'Europe is organised on the basis of social responsibility'.
The 'Chicago Boys' in your Commission cannot come riding up again behind Father Christmas!
What we do need in Europe is a clear commitment from the Commission as well that Europe is socially responsible.
Otherwise it will fail.
With that I wish you all a Happy Christmas!
(Laughter and applause)

There has been some talk about the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency to abolish the death penalty and achieve a moratorium.
You will certainly all have noticed that the US State of New Jersey has abolished the death penalty.
I have written to the Governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, today and congratulated him and the Legislature on this decision.
(Applause)

on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is often said that the exception proves the rule and this Presidency proved no exception!
Too often we are proffered fine words and vaulting ambitions from Presidency programmes honoured more in the breach than the observance.
But, by resurrecting a Treaty that we all thought dead and buried, you have showed the improbable is indeed possible.
From here on in, Lisbon will be etched on our memories as the moment Europe gave itself the tools and tenacity to make globalisation work for us, not against us.
Politics would not be politics if we let major successes obscure minor failures.
While the Lisbon Treaty is an undisputed success, one should beware of hubris.
The Lisbon Summit, while symbolically important, may have pushed Europe and Africa further apart.
Consensus on EPAs is receding as swiftly as EU assurances to put trade at the service of development.
What happened to the great debate on flexicurity? Your big idea for revitalising Europe's economy, which fizzled out before we failed even to define it?
Where is the blue card for migration?
Or greater labour mobility within the Union?
Or linking the Lisbon and Gothenburg Agendas through full unbundling and cuts in CO2?
You say you have left your mark on justice and home affairs, but watch out.
Data-sharing arrangements are dangerously ahead of arrangements for data protection and data security.
On the positive side of the ledger: European leadership in Bali, an excellent agreement on next year's EU budget, the constructive abstentions you engineered to give us a common policy on Kosovo are tribute to the skills of your ministers.
And, thanks to your courage and determination, Prime Minister, Europe's bigger Member States can only retard rapid progress for so long.
For, come 2009, when qualified majority voting is in place, when Parliament holds power of codecision and vetoes can no longer hold Europe hostage, the progressive majority, the centrist majority will succeed in making Europe's choices black and white, unblemished by any blotch of brown.
Europe may have lost Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy', but you have understood well what Shakespeare called the 'the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world'.
And, as befits the leader of a great seafaring nation, you have caught it on the ebb.
(Applauses)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like - I do not think any of my colleagues have done it officially - to congratulate the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr SÃ³crates, on a very successful Council and, most importantly, on getting the signing of the Lisbon Treaty.
The point you rightly raise yourself with regard to the issues of how Europe can move forward and face the challenges that are before us is one that has been hindered or retarded because of the lack of efficient decision-making within the Union institutions.
And, whilst some in this House might not agree with the final agreement in the Lisbon Treaty and others feel that it went too far, the reality was that the existing Treaties did not equip us well for dealing with those problems.
And, if anything, the Conference at Bali proved how important it was that Europe can speak with a single voice on those areas where the European Union has the powers to make those decisions and the ability to act on the global stage.
Obviously, what took place in the Council afterwards is slightly different.
And that sets out more guidelines and the way forward that we want to see happening.
I should just like to revert back very briefly to what I consider to be the single greatest achievement of the Portuguese Presidency and that is your perseverance with the Africa Summit.
Because, no matter what anybody else says, our nearest neighbour in development terms, in humanitarian aid terms and in risk terms is the African continent and for too long too many Member States, too many prime ministers of Member States have been standing on their high horse showing high indignation because one particular person in Africa was wrongfully abusing people's human rights and freedoms.
But then we condemned all of Africa through a failure on our part in Europe to help them to build joint and common strategies with regard to how we process development and allow Africa not just to grow economically or in trade terms but to allow them to take leadership roles to help those countries in Africa that have been successful and to give guidance and direction to other countries that need to be brought forward.
In a lot of ways this is mirroring what the European Union did at its very early stages, when the vision of the founding fathers of the European Union came together after the horrors of the First and Second World Wars.
Through their vision they tried to encourage other countries to come forward until such time as we see now: former dictatorships, former totalitarian regimes are now part of the body of democratic families within the European Union.
Prime Minister, I congratulate you and all of your ministerial team, but in particular all of your civil servants, because they are the people that do all the background work and create the opportunities for us to shine and to rise.
Finally, if I could thank the Commission as well, because they have had a great role to play with ironing out some of the creases and the difficulties that have been faced in this whole process.
I wish you all success for the ratification process.
In my country, Ireland, we have a referendum when people will have an opportunity to vote, but I congratulate the Hungarian Parliament for their decision today on the ratification process.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its honest and openly pro-European effort over these six months, and I also think that probably not all but some of the deficiencies that were also pointed out by Mr Watson are more the responsibility of the team than of the Presidency in that, since you cannot get blood out of a stone with the Council we have, it is rather difficult to achieve much more important results.
I wanted, very briefly, to mention the three priorities of the Presidency and then make a quick comment on the subject of climate change as part of environmental issues.
On the subject of the Treaty of Lisbon, I believe - as you know, Mr President - that our group has always thought that had we taken a less defensive attitude, it would not have been left solely to the anti-Europeans to define the agenda.
I think that what Prime Minister Gordon Brown did was a scandal, and the way he treated all of you and also all of us I think was equally scandalous.
I think that we should no longer extend patience towards them and I also think that the way the United Kingdom, but also the other Member States, have got practically everything they wanted in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, which represents a step backwards with respect to the Constitution or the Constitutional Treaty, should be something that should really make us reflect on the future of Europe.
From this point of view, the mandate of the Reflection Group is no big deal, it seems to me, let us be serious!
Because it cannot do this, it cannot do that and it cannot do the other!
I say this because my group agrees with Spinelli, the only wise man, the only sage of the European institution and the European Parliament; it also suits me that this group of wise men cannot do much, though I do not really know what the Chairman, Felipe GonzÃ¡lez, can do with his mandate, but we will obviously read his work with great interest.
On the question of Brazil, our basic puzzlement lies in the fact that nobody is focusing any more - or nobody is appearing to focus any more - on the regional dimension of our strategic relations with this part of the world and exactly the same could be said about Africa.
I would like to know - you said you did not have time to say - but what is the strategic content of this partnership with Brazil really, in concrete terms?
Frankly, it seems to me and to my group that the only thing to emerge clearly is that the European Union's interest in Latin America, and in Brazil in particular, is the interest of its businesses, some more than others.
Yet we wanted a clear strategy towards Latin America aimed at reviving the dimension of regional integration and defining a policy focused on greater collaboration on climate change, that did not simply turn out to be relatively empty support for President Lula's marketing of bioethanol.
As regards Africa, I must say that my group has always been very critical of an approach, of a policy that is stubbornly ideological, as it has been particularly on the part of the Commission, regarding the economic partnership agreements.
This Ã  la carte approach concerns us, in that since the African dimension is failing, as our partners have said very clearly, an attempt is being made to reach a bilateral agreement with each of the African countries individually.
This puts me in mind of what the United States did with the International Criminal Court: it is negative and wholly goes against our values as regards development policy.
The economic partnership agreements are not an instrument of development policy, and I believe our African partners have told us this loud and clear.
Finally, Mr President, I wanted to thank the Presidency, but also the Commission, for the work done in Bali, but I think that the hardest part will come now, with the translation of all the commitments we made on climate change into laws and regulations.
It is great to go and put on a good show and really stand firm in Bali, but then we also need to stand firm within the European Union with clear laws and regulations on this.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, we have just heard much self-congratulation.
I think, however, that the end of an EU Council Presidency should logically also be a chance for the Heads of State or Government to make a critical assessment of their action in view of the challenges to be faced.
A check-up of this kind is particularly important at a time when a financial crisis is flaring up, when mobilisation against global warming is causing a struggle, the outcome of which is uncertain, and when the international community is attempting to revive a peace process aimed at resolving the conflict that most epitomises our era.
Let us start with the financial crisis.
