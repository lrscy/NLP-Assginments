The Commission's objective at the 4th World Water Forum is to highlight and promote policies and means agreed between the European Union and other interested parties, such as the European Union water initiative, the ACP-EU water facility and numerous aspects of the Agenda 21 action plan.
In addition, the Commission will provide information on the results of the innovative water technologies of the Community framework research programme and the results of the review of integrated water resource management works.
As far as water management and the internal market are concerned, the Commission may, if it appears necessary, explain the position of the European Union, by which I mean that the current rules in the European Union are neutral on the question of the ownership of water and water companies.
The Commission considers that a regular supply of drinking water is, as the rapporteur also said earlier, a basic humanitarian need and that the policies applied for sustainable development must address the problem of the equitable and sustainable management of water resources in the interests of the whole of society.
This stance is also reflected in the European Union water initiative.
At the stage we are at today, the question of whether there needs to be an international agreement on safeguarding a constant supply of water to all areas of the planet still remains open.
In all events, the World Water Forum is not the appropriate platform for such a debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, aid from the European Union and the Member States to improve the worldâs water situation totals EUR 1.4 billion a year, which makes us the biggest single contributor of aid.
Considering how large this sum is, it is clear that the EUâs message will also be heard at the World Water Forum starting this week, and that the Unionâs message is therefore not insignificant.
The figures are alarming: 3Â 900 children die every day because of a lack of clean water.
One fifth of the worldâs population, some 1.1 billion people, suffer from a lack of clean water.
More than 40%, meanwhile, are without proper water and sewage services.
The figures are also a reminder that talk of looming water wars must actually be taken seriously.
This is not just a matter of unsustainable development: it also has to do with a threat to security.
The report by the UN which was published last week, entitled âWater: A Shared Responsibilityâ, says that the reason for the unsatisfactory situation in the world with regard to water is largely poor administration.
Aid reaches its destination more slowly because of bureaucracy and hierarchical decision-making.
Decisions regarding how and when water should be distributed, and to whom, are not just made at national level, but also by local authorities, in the private sector and within the domain of civil society.
Aid is needed in particular in order to increase regional decision-making and cooperation, and in a spirit of fairness.
The issue is surely not helped by the fact that many of those countries suffering a serious water shortage are also high up on the corruption list.
For example, in India millions of dollars are wasted every year in the water sector on political corruption, according to Hindu.com.
Nearly a third of Indians who replied to a survey say they have had to pay bribes to receive water and sewage services.
I would also like to remind everyone that improvements to the regional water situation cannot be separated from other areas of development policy.
Recently, studies have been published showing that merely solving the water problem could even make the situation as a whole worse if it causes population growth to accelerate, which would lead to food shortages.
Simply building a well is therefore not enough.
In all development aid we have to take the overall view so that solving one problem does not lead to new shortages, which we obviously do not want.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the World Water Forums represent a unique opportunity to bring together all those groups in the world that are involved with water, be they official agencies, development banks, states, professional organisations, NGOs or local authorities.
These meetings make it possible to define a fairer and more unified world water policy and to ensure that peopleâs right to water is upheld as a crucial element of human dignity.
The organisations have chosen to steer the debates in Mexico City by establishing âLocal Actions for a Global Challengeâ as the main theme of this forum.
The aim is to make local authorities the central actors with regard to water management.
In order for this to happen, developing countries must be encouraged to delegate the budgetary resources and the management of water policy to their local authorities.
Water policy should always be developed on the basis of the specific nature of the terrain and by taking account, as far as possible, of the usersâ needs.
Parliamentâs resolution calls on the Commission to do more to acknowledge and make use of the fantastic level of human resource and financial expertise present in Europeâs local authorities.
With a wealth of successful experiences and technical skills behind them, the towns of the North are keen to help their counterparts in developing countries.
In order to facilitate these cooperation operations that are decentralised from town to town, the Commission is requested to encourage and prioritise the funding of projects presented by towns of the North.
As far as the allocation of resources from the European Water Fund is concerned, the Commission could, in particular, restrict eligibility to receive these funds to those operators best placed to help the authorities of the South.
The results of the first call for proposals by the ACP-EU Water Fund show that scarcely 3% of the projects accepted were projects presented by local authorities.
That is highly unsatisfactory given the added value that local authorities provide in this area.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the role of the ACP-EU water facility to which the Commissioner has referred.
It has also been discussed recently in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Social and Environmental Affairs Committee.
I welcome the decision by the ACP-EU Council to launch the EURÂ 500Â million water facility in 2004, but there has been a lot of disappointment because of the slowness with which the initiative was implemented.
Indeed, the claim has been made that not one person has yet received clean drinking water under the ACP-EU initiative.
It is important that due regard be given to process and that high standards of administrative probity are adhered to, especially with so much money involved, but the final evaluation of proposals took place in January this year and 97 proposals were at last selected.
So I would like to know whether we are now on course to provide 10Â million more people with access to drinking water by 2010 as planned and, when it comes to the second call for proposals, whether the process will take less time to complete.
Â Â  MrÂ President, 1.2Â billion people have no access to drinking water, and so 15 people die in the world every minute, half of whom are children.
We are therefore involved in a real race against the clock.
That is why the World Forum must put forward three kinds of proposal.
Firstly, the question of rights.
Water belongs to all of humankind, and having access to water is a fundamental right of human beings.
This right must be established by an international treaty.
Next, the question of resources: to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without access to water is an ambitious target.
An extra USDÂ 100Â billion needs to be found each year.
For that to happen, we need to harness all of our resources by increasing official development assistance (ODA) and the resources allocated to the tenth EDF and by obtaining the support of innovative partners in the public and private sector or of operations designed to exchange debts for investment.
Lastly, the question of management.
Water policies must be developed using a participative and democratic approach that embraces users, civil societies and the role of women and be managed at local level, accompanied by the implementation of pricing policies that guarantee the most underprivileged citizens access to water at affordable prices.
I hope that the Commission will champion these guidelines at the World Forum in Mexico City.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, you said that no new positions will be taken up at the Fourth World Water Forum.
What is clear is that you will have a lot of work to do.
You described the right to have access to water as a human right, but that is precisely what the disputes were about at the last Water Forum.
The cause of conflict at it was an argument about whether the availability of clean water was a human right that had to be guaranteed by the State, or whether it was a need that should be met by the market.
Despite massive protests by the campaigners present, the ministers at the forum refused to say anything in their final statement about access to water being a right.
I wish you much success in getting its status as a human right recognised in Mexico City.
As for the forthcoming World Water Forum itself, we will also have to consider what democratic legitimacy it possesses.
It is organised by the World Water Council, which is largely dominated by private industry and businesses.
Since its chairman is the head of a subsidiary of French water companies, we must of course ask ourselves to what degree it is influenced by the industry and just how useful are the solutions that may emerge from it.
What I would like to see â perhaps at a future meeting of the United Nations, which would have the appropriate democratic legitimacy â is debates held without the massive influence of the companies that are making themselves rich from water supply and drainage in many countries around the world.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate demonstrated that we have the same views on the World Water Forum on numerous counts and I hope that the Commission will benefit from taking part in the discussion at which, as I said earlier, we do not expect decisions to be taken, whether or not they are necessary.
In all events, no decisions are expected but, of course, there will be a serious discussion and there will be an exchange of views from all over the world on these very important issues, the significance of which you also highlighted.
In particular, we shall, I hope, be addressing the question of the local actions on which the 4th World Water Forum is concentrating and we expect interesting ideas on water management to be put forward.
I should like to say that this year we have started financing the first plans and we shall start the second stage of this financing in June.
We hope and intend that 10 million people will have drinking water in 2010 and 5 million will have access to sanitation services.
I should like to thank you very much for the interest which you have shown and expressed and I hope that, together, we shall be able, in close cooperation, to promote joint efforts on this very important issue to mankind.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolution(1) tabled under RuleÂ 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies (COM(2005)0113 â C6- 0181/2005 â 2005/0052(CNS)) (A6-0027/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for the truly excellent report which we are debating today.
The objective of the Commission proposal to establish a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies is to safeguard a single financing framework for civil protection actions.
These response and preparedness actions are currently covered by various financing instruments, such as the action programme or the Community civil protection mechanism.
However, what is even more important is the fact that the proposed financing instrument takes account of the calls by the European Parliament and of the Council for the strengthening of the response capacity in the civil protection sector in Europe.
The basis for the further development of cooperation in the civil protection sector is through strengthening the work already carried out and through launching new actions.
Two innovations need to be highlighted here: firstly, we are proposing to finance the cost of moving assistance within the framework of civil protection.
On numerous occasions we face situations in which the assistance was available but there were no means for moving it to the scene of the emergency.
As a result the assistance was either not provided at all or was provided late.
That is why the Commission is proposing that the European Commission be given the facility to hire the necessary means of transport either from third countries or from private companies.
There is a similar problem with civil protection equipment: in the case of emergencies which affect several European countries at once, such as forest fires in the summer or floods in spring or even simultaneous threats of terrorist action throughout Europe, the Member States may face difficulties in providing assistance to another Member State due to the need to address their own requirements.
In such cases, the Community must be in a position to provide assistance to the Member States affected.
Thus, the Commission is proposing to establish a backup financing network at Community level which will allow additional equipment to be hired.
Ambitious but necessary reforms, such as those we are debating today, obviously require important financial resources and, to quote Demosthenes, 'money is the root of everything'.
The Commission is certain that the European Parliament understands, as the report we are debating today illustrates, the importance of the benefit which derives from these reforms.
Reinforced cooperation in the civil protection sector will result in better protection for the citizens of the European Union and the populations of third countries.
This is the only way to ensure that the Community will be able to provide more coordinated, more effective and more prompt assistance to any country affected by a major emergency.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I agree with Mr Dimas that we need to do more in order to make the way in which the European Union addresses extensive natural disasters, both those which affect Europe itself, such as floods, drought or fires, and other natural disasters beyond our borders, such as the tsunami or the hurricane in Mississippi and Louisiana, stronger and more effective.
What we want, therefore, is to do more and to do better all together.
If we succeed and respond to the demand by European citizens for improvements to their safety and quality of life, we can also achieve economies of scale, because a more effective European mechanism can result in savings in the resources of each Member State individually.
I should like to point out that the challenge before us is to set up an effective civil protection mechanism.
If we are to succeed in this, we need, apart from what Demosthenes rightly spoke about two and half thousand years ago, for the Council to agree as well.
The Council must increase the resources available.
The Commission and the Council agree that we also need to be able to find ways of strengthening assistance for addressing emergencies outside the borders of the European Union.
Consequently, we also need to finance this facility and, if we make more and better perspicacious investments in strengthening our cooperation now, we can also avoid large losses of human life and painful damage to property which will cost a great deal more to the Union budget to address at a later date.
I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for the excellent cooperation which we had within the framework of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and which resulted in my report and certain amendments to the Commission's initial proposal being approved almost unanimously, by 49 votes in favour and just one against.
My amendments, which were adopted by the Committee on the Environment and are included in the report, focus on four main points:
The first point is the change to the legal basis, which will allow the European Parliament to put things in the right framework and, most importantly, not to confine itself to a purely advisory role, but to be involved in the codecision procedure, so that this institution, which is closer to the European citizens, will then also have the facility to exert greater influence on decision-making.
The second change is the inclusion of prevention in the scope of the instrument.
It goes without saying that the integrated management of situations caused by natural disasters must include, in addition to preparedness and rapid response measures, investment in prevention.
Prevention is one of the pillars for addressing the problem and I am delighted that, on this issue, we have the same perception as both the Commission and the Council.
This also applies to the third point, to the need to extend this instrument and its action to countries outside the European Union, because natural disasters do not recognise borders.
The fourth proposed amendment is to include public health in the scope of the instrument, which is especially important at a time when there is a serious danger of an avian influenza pandemic.
To close, I should like us to use tomorrow's vote to send, with the same assent we had in the Committee on the Environment, a clear message both to the European citizens and to the Council, as we have also done in the past with a series of motions on natural and manmade disasters.
This message is necessary, because it will help us to achieve cooperation between the three institutions, so that we can quickly achieve a positive result.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what MrÂ Papadimoulis said with regard to the additions that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety made to the Commission proposal through the principle of extending the scope of the regulation to include marine pollution, I should like to add that there are currently no other specific instruments designed to manage the consequences resulting from marine disasters.
Having expressed all but unanimous support for the work done by MrÂ Papadimoulis, the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety approved other specific amendments that I tabled, including the centrality of environmental issues in the management of disasters.
The Commission has been asked to ensure, within the scope of the various Community mechanisms and instruments in the field of civil protection, that greater attention is paid to those regions that are isolated and more remote due to geographical, territorial and socio-economic characteristics and to integrate civil protection measures into teaching modules and communication and information campaigns with a view to increasing awareness of the need to prevent, prepare for, and respond rapidly to, major emergencies and to guaranteeing the involvement of civil society in prevention and response measures.
In other words, we need to focus on young people and on education in schools.
A final important amendment was approved by the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, namely the one designed to raise the profile of voluntary work, whether done by groups or individual citizens, since volunteers can provide vital services in the absence of the emergency services, which may be delayed in the wake of a major catastrophe.
I believe that, with these proposals, the regulation adopts a far broader outlook in terms of the management of major emergencies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you, MrÂ Papadimoulis, for your thorough work on this report.
We live at a time when disasters seem to be becoming ever more common.
A few years ago, Iran was hit by a terrible and disastrous earthquake.
I remember the event very clearly because, every day, I could see from the television that the Iranians were receiving no help in digging the survivors out of the ruins.
Just over a year ago, South-East Asia was hit by the disastrous tsunami that also dealt a severe blow to my own country.
There are reports from that disaster of how certain EU Member States rescued their own citizens but left other people to their fate.
What is, in any case, clear is that the rescue efforts would have been more successful if there had been better EU cooperation.
It is also true that aid could have been provided more efficiently on those occasions that the EU Member States have been hit by, for example, major floods and forest fires.
Moreover, this type of disaster will presumably become more common as climate change progresses.
That is why this instrument is extremely important.
We Social Democrats have particularly emphasised the need for this instrument to operate both within and outside the EU, partly in view of the fact that our own citizens are often outside the EU but, above all, out of solidarity with other people.
We also think it extremely important for the EU also to cooperate with the UN â its natural partner â in this area.
We have also tabled an amendment of our own on the budget for this instrument.
We hope that everyone will be able to support this amendment, because it states the obvious fact that the budget will depend on the outcome of the negotiations concerning the financial perspective.
We also support the rapporteur when it comes to the legal basis and to extending the instrument so that it also covers disasters affecting public health.
If we need to set priorities where the ongoing work on the budget is concerned, what will be most important for us Social Democrats are direct efforts and the preparations for these, both within and outside the EU.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the tragic South Asian tsunami heightened public awareness, for the first time, of the possibility of similar extreme events threatening our homes and livelihoods.
Although on a lesser scale, just weeks later, a major storm in Carlisle â a town in my constituency â coupled with hurricane winds and high tides produced exceptional rainfall, leading to the overtoppling of defences and flooding of 3 000 homes and hundreds of businesses, drowning two elderly ladies in their beds and forcing thousands of people from their homes, some for many months.
I felt the devastation in Carlisle as deeply as I felt the aftermath of the tsunami and the earthquake in South Asia some months later.
The EU suffered personal tragedies in all cases, as our holiday-makers in Sri Lanka and Thailand were washed away and our friends and families in Pakistan and Kashmir were lost in the rubble.
The positive side of all this was the strengthening of our collective belief in the force of community across the globe, with the outpouring of aid and goodwill from governments and individuals alike.
In that adversity we saw the best of human nature.
Yet even the best suffer fatigue and it became clear in November, as the Kashmiris faced a second wave of deaths from disease and exposure, that the donor community cannot be relied upon to respond decisively where political will is lacking.
The EU's Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument must fill this void and work closely with the UN system to take advantage of our pooled resources and see to it that when our friends need us we come to their aid.
Given the impact of climate change, we must accept that extreme events will continue, and with increasing frequency.
In Carlisle we have a new strategy for flood management â making space for water, undertaking integrated urban drainage pilot schemes to investigate how the threat of floods can be better managed.
Prevention is crucial and environmental concerns such as the sound management of natural resources like forests and wetlands are key tools in the evasion of disasters, lessening their impact on people, homes and livelihoods.
Whatever prevention strategies are put in place and however much is invested, it is unrealistic to think that these disasters can be eliminated.
We must learn from them.
Large sums need to be invested in warning mechanisms, risk maps and public awareness campaigns to ensure our citizens are aware of the risks.
We must ensure that prevention, detention and warning mechanisms for natural hazards in Europe and across the globe are robust and put our citizens â from Carlisle to Kashmir â in the best position to prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters.
In this report Parliament has significantly improved the Commission's proposal and it is one that I can fully recommend to this House.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank MrÂ Papadimoulis for his excellent work.
When talking about the EUâs ability to react to catastrophes, we should remember that in recent decades the number of weather-related disasters has increased, and that it is predicted to rise further as a result of climate change.
Consequently, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the main way of curtailing the number of destructive floods and storms in the future.
Every year since 1990, the world has seen at least 20 weather-related events classified as major disasters, a figure which only occurred in three of the previous 20 years.
Since 1990, according to insurance company statistics, the annual damage due to weather catastrophes has more than doubled and the compensation paid out has quadrupled.
Researchers say that storms and floods are not only becoming more common, but more powerful too.
The World Wildlife Fund recently published a study showing that climate change is adding to the number of storms that occur in Europe, mostly around the North Sea, in the British Isles, in the Netherlands and in France.
The highest wind speeds could increase by as much as 15% by the end of the century.
Experience shows that in the United Kingdom such a rise in wind speed could increase storm damage by 50%, and in the Netherlands a 6% rise in wind speed could result in damage increasing fivefold, because of the liability of flooding.
In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we have to understand that climate protection is a crucial factor in reducing the number of weather-related disasters in future.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join those who have thanked our fellow MEP, Mr Papadimoulis, and expressed appreciation for his work in drafting this report.
The European Union has recently experienced an increased number of natural, technological and industrial disasters.
I agree with, and fully support, the idea of combining efforts to prevent these disasters and to ensure a rapid response in the aftermath.
Both activities are in fact inseparable, but we can only speak about the prevention of a potential disaster if it can actually be identified before it occurs.
Many disasters are impossible to predict, and as such there can be no prevention; therefore, we can only deal with the consequences of the disaster.
I am pleased that my amendments to this report have been accepted.
The main purpose of the Regulation is to protect people, but it is also necessary to specify the nature of this protection, particularly the protection of public health and security.
By the same token, it would be appropriate to include, in accordance with the solidarity principle, third countries in this process.
We must realise that natural, technological, and industrial disasters, as well as terrorist attacks, recognise no borders.
I would like to point out that it is also essential to protect the financial interests of the Community, and therefore I recommend amending Article 12 of the draft as follows: âIf a financial aid beneficiary cannot satisfactorily document the use of the aid and, after being urged to do so, cannot demonstrate that the aid has been used in accordance with the Regulation, then there must be clawback provisions in place.
The Commission must, rather than may, discontinue financial aid and must demand that the funds disbursed be repaid.â
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work.
It is clear from the outcome of the vote that he has worked with all the groups and has spoken on behalf of the whole House.
I would also like to thank the Commission for the holistic approach it has taken to this area of responses to crises and the management of natural disasters.
The crisis response instrument that is under consideration is, after all, but one part of the overall framework with which the European Union is attempting to overcome calamities or find ways of responding to them.
While I am on this subject, I might also mention that I too am from a region that has suffered from flooding, and that the Commission, last Friday, committed a substantial sum of money to alleviating the consequences of this disaster.
So let me take this opportunity of saying how grateful I am for European solidarity.
What is crucial is that we should do as the rapporteur recommends and alter the legal basis.
I also believe that Article 175 is the right one to use as a means of creating a suitable legal basis for this instrument.
It also strikes me as essential that the scope be extended to include prevention, civil protection in third countries, and maritime pollution as well.
What can be said in general terms is that this presents us with an opportunity to respond to the European publicâs concerns and questions by providing aid quickly and without bureaucracy.
This is where the Community really can be made visible, and this instrument should be used to do that.
It is no use to anybody if the EU expects them to go through complex bureaucratic procedures or points them towards committees that have yet to meet, when what they really need is quick and unbureaucratic help, which would achieve much more than expensive information campaigns that only end up running into the ground.
I would like to conclude by saying that the French statesman Talleyrandâs dictum about the need for not too much zeal is utterly inappropriate in this context; one cannot be zealous enough when it comes to alleviating the consequences of natural disasters.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report.
In recent years, as other speakers have mentioned, there has been an increase in the number of natural disasters due to, , climate change, damage to the environment and lack of land-use planning.
In order to respond quickly and effectively to serious emergencies, the EU has at its disposal a range of instruments, such as this regulation, which is at the development stage.
The terrible natural disasters of the summer of 2005 â significant flooding in Central Europe, severe drought in southern Europe and fires destroying thousands of hectares of forest in my country, Portugal, and in Spain â require appropriate and rapid prevention and response measures in the area of civil protection.
In working meetings with the local, regional and national authorities of the six countries stricken by natural disasters that I visited in my capacity as rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the initiative report on natural disasters, the call was always for simplification and flexibility; in order to help communities, the Community's emergency response instruments need to be simplified and the rules of application made more flexible.
Stronger European-level coordination and, of course, increased financial support were also recommended.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the members of the European Parliament for their very constructive interventions.
You have tabled a series of very important amendments which are designed to strengthen civil protection facilities at European level and which concern prevention, the need to safeguard financing for civil protection operations in third countries and effective early warning and alert systems.
The Commission supports most of the proposed amendments.
I should like to comment in particular on prevention.
It is worth noting that its particular aspects, such as the prevention of forest fires or floods, are already covered by special Community financing instruments.
The Commission wishes to avoid overlaps with existing financing instruments.
Nonetheless, we recognise the need to strengthen the general aspects of prevention within the framework of civil protection and we therefore gladly include the proposed amendments in the proposed financing instrument.
However, although the Commission can accept most of the proposed amendments, there are some which cause problems and cannot be accepted as they stand.
Firstly, the Commission considers that replacing the legal basis with Article 175(1) of the Treaty is not necessary for a civil protection financing instrument.
As the Treaty has no special legal basis for civil protection, Article 308 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community has always been used for this purpose.
The existing civil protection financing instruments, the action programme and the Community civil protection mechanism are based on this article.
In addition, the proposed legal basis refers to environmental protection and public health, whereas civil protection actions also need to cover the protection of people and property, including the cultural heritage.
As regards the integration of interventions in emergencies outside the European Union into the financing instrument, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament on the need to safeguard this type of financing action.
The Commission decided to divide the financing of internal Community actions from external actions by adopting separate legal instruments.
In this way, civil protection actions adopted in the countries participating in the civil protection mechanism are covered by the rapid response financing instrument, while civil protection interventions in third countries will be financed from the instrument for stability.
In all events, in order for the instrument for stability to constitute a clear basis for the financing of actions of this type outside the European Union, express reference needs to be made in them to civil protection.
This is the issue on which the Commission's position differs from the European Parliament report.
However, I should like to stress that these differences of opinion should not overshadow our common objectives, which are very, very important.
We agree wholeheartedly with the European Parliament's ambition to develop a stronger European facility for civil protection interventions, both within and outside the European Union, and the need for increased financing.
On this point, I should really like to thank you for your support.
I would, however, emphasise that, with the existing instruments, with the existing facilities and with the existing competences, civil protection and the mechanism which we have in the European Commission responded very, very well to last year's crises, by which I mean the various fires, for example in Portugal, and the floods in countries such as Bulgaria and Romania.
We had thirteen such interventions and, of course, the two very big crises in South-East Asia with the tsunami, where the European Union was, through the civil protection mechanism, the first to send representatives to the area.
Also, the European Union responded to the destruction caused by hurricane Katrina by providing the assistance which it had proposed three days earlier to the competent authorities in the United States, which is why, of course, we also had the relevant favourable mention from the European Council.
It is no bad thing for us also to remember and emphasise certain things which happen under â I would stress â the existing facilities.
Of course, we need, as Mr Papadimoulis's report says, to strengthen civil protection.
I should like to file the full list with the Commission's positions on the amendments with Parliament's secretariat(1). I also wish to thank the rapporteur and all the honourable Members once again for their suggestions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The violence of recent natural disasters reminds us how vulnerable our societies are to risks in nature: in 20 years, natural disasters have killed 1.5 million people worldwide.
In order to be effective, our handling of this problem must include looking ahead, by means of risk assessment, prevention, education and information for the public.
The EU has made prevention and emergency aid a top priority, by setting up ECHO in 1992, the Dipecho programme in 1996 and the EU Solidarity fund in 2002.
In 2005, it also decided to create a European coordination structure that could call on a European body of humanitarian aid volunteers.
The Commission proposes to set up a new rapid response and preparedness mechanism for major emergencies for the period 2007-2013, and we are of course delighted with that.
However, the legal basis for this mechanism should be amended to use Article 174, which involves codecision; and the preventative measures should be extended to cover civil protection in third countries and marine pollution.
Finally, the budget for this mechanism must ensure that emergency aid is as effective as possible, in terms of both flexibility and responsiveness, and must increase the visibility of Community solidarity within and outside the EU.
I am pleased to say that there are 52 amendments which the Commission can support fully, in part, or in principle.
These are amendments 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73 and 75.
The Commission cannot accept amendments 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 35, 42, 46, 53, 54, 63, 64, 65, 71, 72 and 74.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Community strategy concerning mercury (2005/2050(INI)) (A6-0044/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly, I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the very constructive cooperation afforded to me in the preparation of this report.
I also thank all those who submitted amendments and are contributing to the debate on the subject-matter of this strategy document.
Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans and wildlife.
After mercury changes in the environment to methylmercury, the most toxic form, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and can cause severe neuronal damage.
It also speedily crosses the placental barrier and can therefore affect foetal neural development.
Mercury poses a global threat as it travels long distances through the atmosphere, crossing national boundaries and contaminating European and global food supplies at levels posing a significant risk to human health.
As the EU is the largest mercury exporter in the world, EU leadership in dealing with global mercury hazards is, therefore, clearly an economic, political and moral imperative.
EU action, as well as international commitment, is necessary for the protection of human health and the environment.
The Community strategy concerning mercury, with its integral approach is, therefore, an important contribution in tackling this global threat.
In broad terms, the report welcomes the Commission communication and emphasises the overall approach taken, with the objective being to reduce and eventually phase out emission and supply of and demand for mercury at European level, as well as to manage the surpluses of mercury and to protect against exposure.
In particular, the strategy deals with matters such as: implementing an effective export ban and safe storage; introducing emission limit values for mercury from combustion plants, and other related activities; banning mercury in measuring and control equipment where possible; collecting and treating mercury waste; ensuring the provision of sufficient information and the monitoring of vulnerable population groups; and supporting and promoting international concerted action for dealing with the mercury threat.
Of note is the recommendation to achieve a ban, where an appropriate and safer alternative exists, in the use of mercury in the manufacture of vaccines.
Also of note is the exemption from the strategy of instruments of historical importance.
With regard to the 13 final amendments before you, I would support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
Of special significance, I feel, is Amendment No. 10, which essentially reintroduces my original Article 17 on dental amalgams.
On that issue I wish to say the following.
Article 17 basically asks the Commission to put forward proposals by the end of 2007 to restrict â not to ban immediately â the use of mercury in dental amalgams.
The reason is that it is quite unacceptable, in my view, to continue inserting such a potentially toxic substance in people's mouths when safer alternatives exist.
In fact, many dentists â my own included â have long since stopped using mercury-containing amalgams, as the more modern alternatives â the white-coloured amalgams â are safer, more aesthetic and cost the same.
So, I urge you to vote positively on Amendment No. 10.
Once again, I thank all those who have contributed to the work on this report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation for the very good job done in the report we are debating today.
In particular, I should like to thank Mr Matsakis for his exceptionally constructive and substantial contribution to it.
I should like to comment briefly on the basic purpose and the objectives of the strategy concerning mercury.
The basic purpose of the strategy is to reduce mercury levels in the environment and man's exposure to mercury, especially methylmercury contained in fish.
Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to man, ecosystems and wild birds.
High doses can prove to be fatal to man and, even in relatively limited doses, may have serious repercussions on human health.
The strategy has the following six objectives: to reduce mercury emissions, to reduce the available quantities of mercury by cutting the relative supply and demand, to resolve the long-term problem of limiting surpluses and stocks of mercury in products which are still in use or have been stored in recent years, to protect against mercury exposure, to improve understanding of the problems caused by mercury and its unavoidable uses and to support and promote international action to address the question of mercury.
Over recent decades, numerous actions have been taken at Community level to address the problem of mercury and reduce emissions and uses of and exposure to it.
At the same time, this and everything we have done to date is not enough.
A great deal more needs to be done.
At the strategy preparation stage, the Commission paid particular attention to identifying the most important aspects of the mercury problem which continue to exist and the sectors in which it would be possible for further action to be taken on the part of the European Union.
The main sectors examined and for which action is proposed in the short term are as follows: the supply of mercury to the market and mercury exports, mercury surpluses from the chlor-alkali industry, the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment and mercury emissions from coal burning.
We should not forget that it will take decades to completely wipe out the problem of mercury.
Today's levels are due to past mercury emissions and it will take time for these levels to stabilise, even if there are no new mercury emissions.
I should also like to emphasise the importance which joint international action has, of course, with the initiatives being taken at European Union level.
Mercury is a global pollutant and the Commission intends to organise an international conference in Brussels on 26 and 27 October of this year in order to strengthen the momentum which exists on the international field as regards addressing this issue.
To close, I would like to thank Mr Matsakis and Parliament as a whole once again for their work and to repeat my promise to help shape even stricter European Union policies for better protection of health and the environment.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Matsakis for all the work he has done on this report.
The outcome of the votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is a report that is the first step towards a coherent approach being taken towards mercury and the ultimate reduction of mercury levels in the environment.
That is a tribute to the work that Mr Matsakis has done.
The PPE-DE Group has tabled two amendments to the report that was adopted in committee.
One of those amendments â that concerning traditional measuring instrumentation, such as barometers â would allow the extremely small number of people in the EU who repair, maintain and recycle barometers to continue to operate under very strictly controlled conditions.
A ban would see the end of the tradition of barometer-making and craftsmanship, which began over 400 years ago when mercury barometers were first introduced.
If those businesses are forced to close, people will be unable to have their instruments properly repaired and they will potentially dispose of them straight into household waste, which would be in nobody's interests.
I am, however, completely in favour of legislation to protect the public from the highly toxic substance that mercury is, but the approach that we should take on environmental issues must be proportionate and it must be balanced.
A complete ban, in my view, would be a disproportionate response.
Barometers are made by only a small group of people in Europe and those operators, who have an extremely good and safe working understanding of mercury and all the hazards it represents, are best placed to help reduce that pollution.
Appropriate product safety warnings and the licensing of suitable establishments would enable the usage of mercury to be controlled and monitored and people could continue to use their barometers, as they have for centuries, without a threat to the environment or to health.
The second amendment concerns mercury-cell chlor-alkali plants.
I believe my colleagues will speak about those later on.
Â Â  . Mr President, we share your objectives, Mr Matsakis: both the elimination of mercury emissions at European level and the ban on exports of mercury which, like its compounds, is highly toxic for human beings and the environment, as other speakers have pointed out.
Although the European Union is the worldâs main mercury exporter and a ban on its export will make a considerable contribution to curbing the trade and reducing world surpluses of this metal, I would appeal to the Council to ensure that the European Union continues to participate in international fora and activities, makes bilateral commitments and implements projects with third countries, particularly in the field of the transfer of technology, in order to deal with the problem of mercury pollution.
In this context, binding legal measures should be adopted at international level.
I would also call upon the Commission to increase awareness amongst the population, organising information campaigns on the health risks of exposure to mercury and the environmental problems caused by it, since I fear that citizens are not yet sufficiently aware of its toxicity.
Another issue that worries me in particular is the use of mercury in the form of thiomersal in vaccines, since it could be harmful to human health, and we should therefore bear in mind that countries such as Denmark have not been using it in vaccines for children since 1992.
I am delighted that the Councilâs conclusions recognise the environmental and social problems resulting from the closure of the mercury mines that have been operating for a long time in AlmadÃ©n, as well as the possibility of using these AlmadÃ©n mines for the safe storage of the existing metallic mercury stocks or metallic mercury sub-produced by industry all over Europe, but never its waste, thus making use of the infrastructures, local manpower and technological expertise existing there.
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur and all of the shadow rapporteurs, because their work has been truly excellent.
Â Â  I wish to thank MrÂ Matsakis for his exemplary work as rapporteur.
As long ago as 1990, when the PARCOM Agreement was concluded, it was agreed that the chlor-alkali industry should phase out mercury by 2010.
Now, we must bring about an export ban that enters into force before this. Otherwise, the chlor-alkali industry, which has the largest stocks of mercury in Europe, will export huge quantities of it.
It is important to have an export ban before 2010.
We talk about safety where deposits are concerned, but the second most extensive use of mercury today is ten centimetres from our brains.
I was given my first amalgam-free filling 21 years ago, and it is still there.
It is of fantastically high quality.
A mere 0.05% of Swedish childrenâs and young peopleâs fillings now contain amalgam, while the corresponding figure for adults is two percent.
Moreover, the figures are falling all the time.
The Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate has shown that it is mainly for reasons connected with the environment and public health that we must do away with mercury, for which there are sound alternatives.
You can see how three quarters of mercury discharges stem from amalgam, with the majority of them originating in dental clinics.
This means that amalgam fillings account for by far the largest portion of discharges of mercury into our sewers.
I therefore call on you to vote in favour of my AmendmentÂ 10 in order to get rid of these problems.
Thank you again, MrÂ Matsakis, for your constructive work.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I wish to express our congratulations and thanks to Mr Matsakis for his report; he made a serious effort to incorporate the views of all the honourable Members in the motion for a resolution.
Despite the positive elements of the document, we are of the view that the Community strategy concerning mercury could and should have been strengthened further.
We are of the view that a ban on mercury exports from European Union countries should be brought into force by no later than 2008 and not 2010, as supported by the majority in committee.
At the same time, we would stress the importance of establishing a stricter regime on exemptions from the aforementioned ban.
To be specific, exemptions should only be allowed if there is no suitable alternative solution.
Finally, we support the fact that the EU should also help developing countries to wipe out mercury by offering not only technical but also financial assistance.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on deciding to eliminate mercury.
That decision is long overdue.
We have known that mercury is dangerous for a long time.
I want to congratulate MrÂ Matsakis on an excellent report that goes further than the Commission, especially in identifying for the Commission one of the most dangerous uses of mercury today: thermerasol â mercury directly injected in commonly-used medications such as flu vaccines.
Since removing mercury from paediatric vaccines in California, cases of autism are continuing to increase.
However, for the first time in over 20 years the rate of increase has significantly slowed down.
Commissioner, please ensure that, if there is an avian flu jab, it will be mercury-free.
There is one more source of mercury that I would ask you to eliminate.
The Irish Government pollutes the Irish water supply with hexafluorosilic acid, a waste product of the artificial fertiliser industry which, in addition to mercury, contains other toxins such as lead, arsenic, beryllium, vanadium, cadmium, radionuclides and silicone.
Please tackle that.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Matsakis for his good, constructive and frank cooperation on this report, which is by way of preparation for legislation, so that we are pointing the way forward whilst not yet taking any final decisions.
The legislative measures must follow later.
It has by now become a matter of common knowledge that mercury is highly toxic, and that is of course reason enough why it needs to be taken out of circulation.
So, then, by aiming for an export ban from 2010 onwards and for the secure storage of mercury that has been taken out of circulation, we are sending the first vital indications of the direction in which we need to go.
It is already evident that the principle of substitution applies here, and that is made all the more important by the fact that mercury is not bio-degradable and so it is permanently in circulation; every single microgram of it will keep on coming back to human beings through the food chain.
People living by the sea who frequently eat fish already have in their tissues concentrations of mercury in excess of the permissible threshold values.
Unfortunate though it is that nothing can at present be done to change that, and that no direct consequences result from it, it does, in terms of environmental medicine, indicate the need for an absolute ban.
As things currently stand, I am also less than satisfied with the wording relating to dental amalgam, which remains strongly suspected of playing a part in a range of conditions, of which I shall cite as examples immune deficiencies, Hashimotoâs Thyroiditis, Alzheimerâs disease, multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and damage to the unborn child in the womb.
Even if the experts have not yet arrived at their final judgment on this, I see the tendency and the risk as being beyond doubt, so what is needed above all else is prevention and care before we think about experimenting on live subjects.
I will not be recommending amalgam and mercury products to the people and patients entrusted to my care and will do my utmost to ensure that mercury is taken out of circulation â as far as possible and as soon as possible.
Â Â  . â Mr President, generally speaking, I agree with Mr Matsakis and his excellent report.
All of my amendments were accepted by the committee.
I should like to briefly underline their content.
Public information is crucial in this case.
Everybody should understand the health and environmental risks of mercury.
As pollution does not stop at borders, we must also urge our neighbouring countries to implement our strict mercury policy.
The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is a primary tool to encourage those countries to take the right action in the field of the environment.
The same goes for the labelling of gold that has been mined without using mercury, both inside and outside the European Union.
Last but not least, I call upon the European Union to be cautious about dental amalgam.
The real risk should be avoided, but we have to allow more time for research and consideration of the scientific facts.
I believe that at this moment in time a total ban would be too radical a step.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Matsakis and the shadow rapporteurs on their excellent work.
Mercury is a toxic element which has a negative impact on health, and the Commission is therefore proposing its safe storage and, at the same time, a reduction in its use and an end to the trade in it, but, as point 9 of the Communication states quite rightly, there are many gaps in our knowledge of its effects on human health, of how it is disseminated and accumulated in the environment, of its toxicity and of the sensitivity of ecosystems.
I believe that it is important and should be a priority that all of these issues be investigated and that decisions be taken on a scientific basis and not on the basis of mere suppositions, which are sometimes alarmist and which have been exaggerated by the media.
Furthermore, Commissioner, the only region in Europe that produces mercury, although its mines are already closed, is AlmadÃ©n.
This region was very prosperous, thanks to the mercury that it has extracted from its mines since Roman times, but it is now depressed, also as a result of mercury.
It must therefore be compensated by means of specific support, measures and infrastructures which can partially alleviate the effects of the measures taken.
It is there that, amongst other things, the safe storage of the liquid mercury that is going to be withdrawn from the market must take place.
The chloroalkaline industry has signed an agreement to put an end to the use of mercury completely by 2020.
This agreement must be respected and compliance with it monitored.
Out of interest, I simply wished to say that I have lived in the region of AlmadÃ©n, that I have held mercury in my hands on many occasions, that I have had mercury dental amalgams, which I no longer have for aesthetic reasons, and I can assure you that I have not had any health problems, and nor have the people who live there, nor the animals nor the plants, because, as the toxicologists say quite rightly, the poison is in the dose.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Dr Matsakis on his report and on the draft resolution that he presented to our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I would like to thank the Members in that Committee for their contributions, which have improved the text that we are currently debating.
For more than 22 years I was a Member of Parliament in Spain for the province of Ciudad Real, in which AlmadÃ©n and its mines are located and where the majority of the mercury extracted in Europe and the world has been produced for twenty centuries.
This region, which has experienced a thorough process of diversification, will be affected once again by the prohibitions laid down in the Community mercury strategy on the production and export of that metal.
The drawing up of Dr Matsakisâs report has been followed with interest in and around AlmadÃ©n, and the text of the resolution that we will approve tomorrow responds to the expectations of my countrymen by recommending that they receive significant European Union compensation to ensure the social and economic revitalisation of those territories.
They have also been sympathetic to the idea that has been mentioned here several times that the metallic mercury store envisaged in the Community strategy should be in AlmadÃ©n, since it is there that the experience, technology and workforce necessary for managing that store with the proper guarantees can be found.
I would like to take this opportunity to invite you, Commissioner, to come with Dr Matsakis and myself to AlmadÃ©n and to witness the great beauty of its countryside, as well as the warmth of its people and their European enthusiasm for moving forward.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your understanding and solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, of course your invitation is welcome.
First of all, allow me to thank all of you for your very constructive comments.
The contribution of the European Parliament is very important and it is only in close cooperation with the institutions that we shall be able to secure for the European Union effective ways of addressing the negative repercussions of mercury on human health and the environment.
That is why I welcome the support which you expressed in your report and interventions on the strategy.
I note with particular satisfaction that Parliament shares our views on the main actions of the strategy concerning mercury.
That is a very strong foundation for the adoption of specific new measures to apply the strategy.
These measures are already at the preparation stage.
I should like, so as not to take up too much time, to say a couple of words about the points raised by Mr Callanan.
The environmental repercussions from mercury are still important and there are suitable alternative solutions.
Similarly, suitable adaptation is not a problem for small producers, which is why the Commission too has proposed a ban on the use of mercury in these measuring devices.
As regards the question of dental amalgams, the Commission will ask the relevant medical working party to study new measures and will call for the opinion of the scientific committee on the danger to health and the environment.
To finish, I should like once again to thank Parliament and Mr Matsakis in particular for his particularly positive stand on the strategy.
The Commission wishes to continue this exceptional cooperation with Parliament on this particularly serious issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item â todayâs final item â is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the free movement of workers and transition periods, by IstvÃ¡n Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, Graham Watson and Ignasi Guardans CambÃ³, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0013/2006 â B6-0012/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, this year was designated the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
By 30 April, each Member State must decide whether they are going to open up their labour market or not.
This decision will determine whether this year will actually be the year of workersâ mobility, or a parody of it.
We cannot tolerate a situation where workers from new Member States continue to be second class, and in certain respects even third class players on the labour market.
The free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms, a fundamental idea of the European Union.
In the course of the March summit, the European Heads of State or Government will discuss the Lisbon process. The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market.
And this cannot be achieved without the liberalisation and freedom of the labour market.
The Commission has recently published an assessment which showed very clearly that the fears and anxieties persisting in the old Member States are groundless.
There have been fears, for a long time, of a massive influx of workforce into Great-Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, the three countries that have opened up their labour markets. This has not happened.
The rate of unemployment has not increased in these countries, against all expectations.
On the other hand, âblack workâ was reduced, public revenue increased, and the competitiveness of companies has improved.
Illegal employment is still considerable in countries that continue to restrict their labour market.
This has led the Commission to the unequivocal conclusion that the winners of this process have been the countries that have liberalised the movement of workforce from new Member States.
So far I have been talking about the fact that the second class citizens on the labour market are the citizens of the new Member States.
However, since 23 January, they have actually become third class citizens in a certain respect, because this was the date when the Directive stating that the European Union shall grant the right to employment and residence to third country nationals who have been residing legally within the territory of the European Union for at least five years came into effect.
We do not have any problems with this. But this means that even these nationals are in a more advantageous situation than the workers from new Member States.
This is why I ask the Commissioner: how does he envisage the rectification of this problem, how can it be ensured that workers from new Member States do not feel like third class citizens on the labour market?
And at this point I would like to welcome the decision of Finland, Spain and Portugal.
These are very positive decisions for the liberalisation of the workforce, but we are waiting for France, the Netherlands and Belgium to join in and liberalise their labour markets, as this is in the interest of everybody.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, the Accession Treaty provides for a nuanced approach and clear solutions which allow both the long-term residents directive and the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers to be applied in full legal compatibility.
Let me explain this in detail.
First of all, there is the question of first-time access to the labour market.
In such a case the Accession Treaty â during any period in which any old Member State applies transitional measures â provides that it must give preference to nationals of the new Member States over third-country nationals as regards access to the labour market.
The second situation concerns nationals from the new Member States who are already resident in an old Member State.
In that case the Accession Treaty again provides that nationals of new Member States who already reside and work in a Member State applying transitional measures must not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries also resident and working in that Member State.
This means that where by virtue of the directive, a third-country national has been given long-term status, the Accession Treaty operates so as to ensure that the old Member States must treat citizens from new Member States who are already legally resident and working in the territories at least according to the standards guaranteed in the directive â thus including the right of free access to the labour market.
The same logic also applies in the third situation covered by the directive: movement by long-term residents between Member States.
Here the rule is the following: workers from a third country who are long-term residents in a new Member State should not be treated more favourably than nationals of that state.
In other words, in the situation of mobility to a second Member State, an old Member State cannot give free access to its labour market to a long-term resident who is a third-country-national if and where the same free access is not given to a national of a new Member State.
The same applies to equivalent situations between two old Member States.
In both cases of mobility between Member States, if both the national of a new-Member-State and the long-term resident are subject to national measures such as a work permit, Community preference would operate in favour of the national of the new Member State, who is a European citizen.
From the above, it results that the rights provided by the directive can be reconciled with the provisions of the Accession Treaty.
There is no need to submit proposals to change the rules, because it is impossible to have less favourable treatment for citizens of the new Member States of Europe.
The Commission agrees, however, that there is a need for better information clarifying the issue to be sent to the Member States and I intend to do this by sending all Member States a letter clearly stating the existing rules.
Â Â  Mr President, an oral question is submitted to the Commission.
The question concerns the issue of the free movement of workers from new Member States, and seeks an answer to whether, within the current regulation frameworks, certain groups of non-EU nationals are enjoying considerably more advantages than citizens of new Member States in respect of movement between Member States for employment purposes.
If this were true, then this situation would be obviously wrong, and we would have to rectify it, to avoid any prejudice to the preference principle stipulated in the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty.
However, Article 21 of Directive 2003/109/EC stipulates that third country nationals who have obtained long-term residence permits in a second Member State shall have access to the labour market.
The expression âshall have' must be interpreted to mean that the issue of a work permit cannot be denied if the persons concerned have already obtained the right to long-term residence.
Consequently, a long-term residence permit issued in the second Member State practically includes the work permit.
This means that if companies in the target state are willing to accept them, the access to the labour market of non-EU nationals arriving from other Member States is automatic and unrestrictable, while the access of citizens from new Member States is unequivocally restricted and restrictable.
We must obviously welcome an objective that aims to achieve greater mobility and a more flexible and more unified labour market.
This is the obvious aim of Directive 2003/109/EC, too, but attention must be paid to the right sequence.
I personally welcome the argumentation that I have also heard from the Commissioner, and would like to call attention to the fact that we need more than just a letter â we need some kind of a procedural regulation that explains what exactly needs to be done when a third country national and a European Union citizen are in a competitive situation.
What I mean is that we need more accurate and more detailed guidance, and this is what I would expect from the European Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that, notwithstanding the responses to what is happening and the various interpretations of the Directive, this is also a good opportunity to raise our voices, and I would like to add mine to those that believe that this problem is not going to be resolved until we finally put an end to this transition period.
Let us hope that it ends as soon as possible, so that all Europeans may be equal and so that we may make the mobility of workers an important tool in terms of our competitiveness, our employment and the construction of the European Union.
I would therefore like to join with those people who are calling for an open door policy, and the sooner the better, and in this regard I believe â and, as a Spaniard, I am pleased about this â that my countryâs governmentâs announcement that the restrictions during this transition period are to be lifted is very important.
We have done this, Commissioner, because we are a country with a degree of experience, being a country of immigration and one of emigration.
Furthermore, we have seen clearly once again over these two years that these restrictions imposed on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Europe of 15 must be lifted, for reasons of justice and solidarity, but also for reasons of rationality and common sense, today more than ever, in this year of mobility.
We must firstly look at this from the point of view of justice and solidarity.
We Spaniards also had a seven-year transition period and we felt humiliated and unfairly treated as a result of a situation that was not justified, because it became clear that many of those xenophobic and racist arguments were mistaken.
There was no avalanche of workers.
Spanish workers never created problems in the host countries; on the contrary.
We have seen the same thing happening over the last two years with the workers of the new Member States: not only have they not created problems, but they are in fact resolving labour shortages, improving their skills and enhancing the global concept of Europe.
What I would ask, therefore, is that the study carried out by the European Commission should serve to persuade more countries to lift the restrictions and that the day should come when Europe is genuinely a Europe in which all European citizens and all European workers have the same rights, because that would be consistent, because it would be very good for mobility and because Europe needs mobility if it wants to win the productivity and competitiveness battle with the United States.
We need to create that great market of free citizens in which there will be no problems and which, furthermore, will enable us to improve our competitiveness, to improve our capacity and to improve the lives of our citizens, so that, as well as resolving specific problems, we may create something of a vision for the future in terms of removing those obstacles.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can totally identify with what the previous speaker said and I would also like to bid Commissioner Frattini good evening for the third time today.
There is no need to explain why citizens from the new countries should gain access to the labour market â quite the contrary, in fact.
It is the countries that continue to protect their markets that have to explain why they continue to deny fully-paid-up fellow EU citizens their basic rights.
It also makes good economic sense, of course, to lift the restrictions.
The European economy and the labour market need people.
If we, in the European Union and its internal market, want to compete with major markets outside Europe, we will need dynamic, young, well-trained people who are also mobile.
That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy, and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off.
Moreover, it is an illusion that these restrictions stop Eastern European workers from coming over here, for they have been around for a long time, even though they are being exploited by fraudulent employers and live in degrading circumstances in our countries â something that I regard as a disgrace.
Considerations of civil rights, the economy and solidarity therefore require that the restrictions be lifted.
I am pleased, then, that my own county, the Netherlands, will probably do that â at any rate, it appears that a majority is in favour of it â and I should like to urge all Member States, in the year of mobility, to do likewise.
Â Â  â Mr President, what is going on in the countries that want to keep the transitional rules is no more than the semblance of a debate, and, of course, Germany is one of them.
The fact is that one way to achieve popularity is to tell people things that are not true, particularly if you tell them that the transitional rules can protect the labour market.
Yet the opposite is the case; the transitional rules do not keep migrant workers out.
Instead, since they cannot become employed legally, the black economy is the only option left to them.
In the border regions of Eastern Germany, from which I come, the black market is burgeoning and there has been a massive increase in fictional self-employment, quite simply because the transitional rules encourage these things.
As a result, higher wages come under even more pressure.
Unlike in the case of legitimate employment, illegal employment is not capable of being controlled and monitored.
That results in workers being subjected to exploitation and discrimination.
What is needed in Europe is a well-ordered labour market with minimum standards and underpinned by the principle of the same pay for the same work in the same place.
The effect of transitional rules is, quite simply, to put off to another day these urgently-needed reforms and efforts; more than that, they give the populists of the Right material for their speeches, and most of all, they undermine the European ideal.
Let me, then, as a German, make my appeal for the transitional rules not to remain in place, but, instead, for the market to be opened up in Germany too and for proper conditions to become the order of the day there.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the basic weakness of the European construction is that when national interests are perceived to be at stake Member States will look after themselves.
That is how politics works, never mind promises of solidarity and Treaty obligations.
This particular complaint is that we do not have equal treatment of workers from third countries across the Union, but nor do we have a free market in services, nor do we have anything approaching a uniform application of European Union law.
Perhaps the most glaring example of broken rules is the Stability Pact, and without budgetary discipline the euro currency will not last for very long.
Whenever some states misbehave we ask the Commission to do something, but the Commission cannot do very much and I am not convinced that Mr Frattiniâs information drive will help.
If the Commission demands equal treatment of workers, some nations will still just say ânoâ, or if they are persuaded to say âyesâ they will easily find ways of reneging.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the situation we have had to cope with since 1Â January of this year is a paradoxical one.
On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market.
On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned.
This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market.
The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union.
Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1Â MayÂ 2004.
Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1Â May of this year.
Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day.
MrsÂ Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany.
Such fear is entirely groundless.
The European Commissionâs statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement.
With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10Â new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population.
In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs.
The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions.
MrÂ President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe.
Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas.
Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work.
Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Unionâs labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years.
That is why it is essential for the European Commission to take action to eliminate the contradictions in Union legislation and to extend the free movement of workers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I recall how almost two years ago now, a few days after the historic enlargement of the European Union, I took the floor in this House and called on the governments of the so-called old Union to be brave and to abandon transitional periods.
I called on them to open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States.
Unfortunately, only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time. I refer to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden.
The remaining 12Â Member States gave in to the fears or maybe even the pressures of their own public opinion and citizens and barricaded themselves against an influx of workers from the new Member States, especially from Central and Eastern Europe.
What conclusions can be drawn after these two years?
Clearly, those who have benefited the most are the very same three countries that dared to open their labour markets.
The European Commission communication issued about a month ago, in February if I am not mistaken, makes it very clear that unemployment has not increased in countries that decided to open their labour markets. Social problems have not either.
What has happened is quite the opposite.
The economy has gathered additional pace, and income from taxation has increased.
Such are the benefits of the practical implementation of one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty. It could even be deemed the most fundamental of them all.
It is part of the foundations upon which the Union is built, and we should be striving to implement it across the 25Â current Members of the European Union.
On the eve of the expiry of the first transitional period I am delighted that a couple more governments are reconsidering opening their labour markets.
It must however be pointed out that the way things stand, they still constitute a minority of the old Fifteen.
This is a serious problem, and I should like to send out the following appeal.
As we each take the floor in the near future to debate Parliamentâs resolution, we should send out a clear call to the governments of Member States not simply to consider opening up their labour markets. We should appeal to them to go ahead and open them fully to allow the free movement of workers.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, IstvÃ¡n Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, for the inclusion of this topic on the agenda once more; this is not only important to the Member States, but to all of Europe.
I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.
The aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted.
We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union.
Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.
It is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake.
I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.
We must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market.
This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries.
In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States.
In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness.
Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.
Many thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.
It is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States.
At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini.
What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market.
In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries.
In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise.
Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States.
Â Â  â What more can I add to the comments made by all those colleagues who spoke before me?
The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms which is guaranteed, but as yet only declared in European Community law.
The new Member States expect the European Union's old-timers to open their labour markets to the newcomers as soon as possible, believing that the old-timers will only benefit from this, although it is the sovereign right of each one of the old Member States to do this before it actually becomes compulsory.
According to European Commission statistics, the flood of labour from the new countries was not as great as had been threatened.
Having admitted workers from the new members, England, Ireland and Sweden only benefited.
We must congratulate several states on their decision to open their labour market to the new members of the European Union from May.
The free movement of labour, the liberalisation of the services market and other measures would contribute to the competitiveness of the European Union, and moreover, it would increase citizens' faith in European Union membership.
The clarity or ambiguity of a complicated situation reduces faith in the European Union. In my opinion, members of the European Union must take measures to immediately abolish discriminatory restrictions to legal employment faced by the citizens of Lithuania and other new Member States.
This would allow people to truly benefit from their rights and would give them the opportunity to pay taxes legally.
It is time to break the stereotypes of the old way of thinking and to understand that freedom and healthy competition are the engine of progress in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the plain and uncomfortable truth is that the old Member States were more than happy to open up markets where they held the competitive advantage, namely concerning the free flow of capital.
I would point out that where the new Member States held the competitive advantage, the markets remain closed.
One example is the services market, and the labour market could serve as another.
From 23Â January, following final implementation of the directive concerning residents, the situation regarding access to the labour market by third-country citizens may actually be better than that of citizens of the countries that recently joined the Union.
I found your explanations interesting, Commissioner, but they failed to convince me.
I think the House should hear more on this subject.
All this is in clear contradiction to the provisions of the Treaties on Accession.
It is worth emphasising yet again to the House that not one of the countries that opened their labour market has recorded an increase in unemployment or in other social problems such as benefit fraud.
On the contrary, the cheaper labour force from the new Member States has reinvigorated the economy.
Two years down the line we can state categorically that there is no economic justification for these restrictions.
Pursuant to the Commissionâs plans, this year is the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
It should be emphasised that low worker mobility is also related to the closed labour markets in most of the Member States.
If Member States insist on maintaining the unjustified closure of the labour markets, 2006 may well turn out to be the year of European hypocrisy rather than the European Year of Workersâ Mobility.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we are having this debate, since I am not one of those who want to settle this issue by creating winners and losers, by playing the old off against the new.
We live in a Community.
It is vitally important that we should make it abundantly clear that the four freedoms are among the fundamental rights of the European Union, one of whose principles is the ban on discrimination.
The four freedoms are at the heart of the internal market; their implementation makes it a domestic one.
These EU principles â the political goals â are clear, and they unite us.
We must implement them as soon as possible; the reason why we have not yet done so is that our policies are subject to different framework conditions, to different social legislation, different wages, different tax legislation, different labour laws.
With 19 million unemployed, we have differing growth rates, which are â thank heavens â higher in the new Member States than in the old ones.
The result of this is fear and worry on the part of the public.
Not least in my own country, which has the longest external border with the new Member States, there are more and more citizens of the new Member States in the workforce.
What we have to do, though, is look into the Treaties and Community law for ways in which we can take public concerns and fears into consideration.
Rather than standing in the way, we are seeking acceptable transitions, but transitions are not our goal; what we are aiming to do is to make the four freedoms a reality, to lay fears to rest and join together in seeking joint solutions.
Rather than apportioning blame, we need to meet each other halfway.
Â Â  â Mr President, even if mutual understanding is sometimes made rather difficult by our linguistic differences, it does make sense that it should be the competent committees of this House that work through the Commissionâs reports, assessing and debating them.
This matter is meant to be handled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but this debate, and the question on this point, are pre-empting its deliberations, and that I really do think is something we can do without; there may be reasons for it, but it is, I think, something we can do without.
Let me start by saying that the Commission communication, which is meant to help do away with the transitional period for the free movement of workers, is, I think, still defective in terms of its substance and â in the form in which it is presented to us â not yet watertight in economic terms.
Nor are the authors of todayâs question looking at the facts from the right angle when they talk in terms of the citizens of the ten new Member States being put at a disadvantage vis-Ã -vis the nationals of third countries.
The fact is that, in Germany, people from the ten new Member States are 3% more likely to be in work than those from third states.
In Austria, the difference stands as high as 6%.
The advantage enjoyed by the ten new States is even more pronounced in Great Britain and Ireland.
More to the point, data relating to only one year since accession cannot serve as a credible basis for a prognosis of medium and long-term changes in the labour market of the kind that the Commission is putting forward.
When one considers the period to which the evaluation refers, the conclusion at which the communication arrives, namely that the opening-up of the labour market has a positive effect on economic growth and employment, is quite simply wrong.
In 2005, there was markedly less economic growth in the EU of 25 than in 2004.
This was particularly the case in the United Kingdom, where there was a 1.4% decline and where immigration was ten times greater than the British Government had predicted.
In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so I call on the Commission to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining worker migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way.
That will be beneficial not only to the Commission, but also in terms of continued rational dialogue.
I would add that, while I too would like to see an early reduction in the transitional periods, that will require good accompanying measures in a suitable framework, and the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive.
That would be to the benefit of all concerned, in that it would allay one sideâs fears and concerns, and make both sides better able to engage in dialogue, but the sort of debate we are having today I regard, quite simply, as wrong.
Â Â  It has been two years since the start of the latest stage of the enlargement, and the first part of the seven year transition period is coming to an end.
The old Member States must come to a decision on the extension or abolition of the transition period.
The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened their markets immediately and benefited, and at the same time encouraged the new Member States to view their own labour in a somewhat different light and evaluate it better.
The job market of EU-15 has not been flooded by labour from the new states.
Expansion has encouraged the legalisation of previously illegal jobs.
No transition periods will stop a person who wants to leave.
A person's freedom of movement is the cornerstone value of the European Community.
On 26 January, a Council Directive entered into force allowing the citizens of third countries, who have lived in the EU for five years, to move freely, come to study, work or simply live in any EU country.
Why did the Council adopt a Directive which is discriminatory with respect to the new countries?
Why is there such huge opposition to restore justice?
It is good news that Finland, Spain and Portugal plan to abandon the transition period.
Austria and Germany initiated the introduction of the transition periods.
The results of the two years have shown that the new states do not pose a threat.
I urge Austria and the other remaining states to abandon the discriminatory transition period and this discriminatory view of the new Member States.
Â Â  I would pose a broader question â why do the new Member States feel that there is an increasing rift between themselves and the old Member States?
I will begin by mentioning the Services Directive.
It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europeâs fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper.
There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting âsocial dumpingâ, and the mythical was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States.
This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings.
The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions.
But Eastern Europe opened up its market long before it joined the European Union, and as a result large companies from the old Member States have for years simply bought up companies in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a services directive.
They came to our market and bought it, but when our turn came, the door was closed.
It is the small companies and citizens of the new Member States, as well as consumers in the old Member States, who suffer as a result of this.
Secondly, the restriction of the free movement of labour makes the new Europeans into second-class citizens.
Some citizens of the EU are entitled to move freely, while others are not â on the basis of their citizenship.
Neo-protectionism in the EU limits the civil rights of citizens of the new Member States, often using xenophobic rhetoric, as we noticed in the case of the debating of the Services Directive.
Although the labour market is closed, the old Member States have for years gladly picked out those workers they lack â for instance, doctors, nurses and IT specialists.
They would not consider insulting these workers by branding them with the label of dumping, because their recruitment is often even funded by state subsidy.
Thirdly, we have now seen the implementation of a directive stipulating that non-citizens who have lived in an EU Member State for five years are entitled to freedom of movement, but citizens of the new EU Member States lack that right.
What can one conclude from this?
Citizens of the new Member States are not only second-class, but even third-class citizens.
My question is this: what action does Europe plan to take to ensure that this intolerable protectionism and obvious discrimination does not split the newly reunited Europe?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have read with interest the Commission report of 8 February clearly indicating that worker mobility within the European Union has had positive effects.
Migrant workers have helped eliminate labour market deficiencies, increasing the skilled labour force in the EU, decreasing the potential for illegal employment, and contributing overall to better efficiency in Europe.
A month ago we debated and approved in the first reading a report on opening the services market in the European Union.
I am mentioning the Services Directive because a point may come when it will touch closely on the freedom of movement for workers.
A critical moment could be reached if, on the one hand, the Services Directive becomes effective and, on the other hand, a country still chooses to frustrate the free movement of workers.
This would impose constraints on workers in their desire to switch employers, even though such changes would benefit not only themselves but also the destination country.
A country may eliminate this risk by cancelling the transition period.
Ladies and gentlemen, in itself the free movement of workers is, of course, not a solution for sustaining the social model of a given state.
Inefficient models cannot be sustained in the face of the deteriorating public finance deficits that result from globalisation, technological change and ageing populations.
The free movement of workers, however, is definitely not, and cannot be, the source of these problems.
European legislation cannot dictate to the Member States whether they should or should not cancel transition periods.
These states, however, should take every measure to tackle the true causes of their economic problems.
They will then view the free movement of workers as an advantage and not as a threat.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The VVD Group in the European Parliament is in favour of the âoldâ Member States lifting the restrictions on workers from the new ones.
All European countries derive economic benefit from opening up their borders.
In the Netherlands, for example, we are short of manpower in the metal, horticultural, agricultural and health care industries.
The open borders policy in Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden has proved to be a success.
If we unlock the front door, at least we will have a say in who we allow in, instead of frantically trying to keep illegal entrants away from the back doors.
That has proved impossible, for every year, we notice that seasonal labour, in particular, is carried out by illegal workers.
Â Â  I declare the 2005-2006 session of the European Parliament closed.
Â Â  I declare open the 2006-2007 session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0036/2006) by Reino Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a European information society for growth and employment (2005/2167(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I started drafting the report the telecommunications sector was in a rather miserable state.
Most Member States had not yet even delivered their national communications on the progress they had made in implementation.
The situation now is better: all the national communications are with the Commission, and in almost every Member State five directives have come into force one way or another.
Meanwhile, however, many Member States have been protecting their monopolies for many years, and so they have had the money to penetrate the markets in those Member States which opened up their markets on time.
Nevertheless, these directives are already obsolete.
This industry is developing at such a rate that new legislation is necessary to guarantee the viability and development of the market and its potential for providing employment.
For this reason, it is good that the Commission has decided to propose the i2010 strategy, which aims to create a viable common knowledge-based area.
We need to safeguard investment and appropriations for research, and all Europeans need to have access to this system, including the poor.
Technology changes more rapidly than legislation, and this is why I adhered to the basic premise that the strategy proposed in my report should be as transparent as possible, and that technology should be neutral.
This will allow it to create incentives for access to the market for all kinds of new inventions and alternatives, and also competitors.
We will change the world more with technology than with politics.
But who should lead this change?
We should be talking about the ubiquitous information society.
Information and communication technology no longer mean audiovisual technology.
Information is transmitted, for example, between a tyre and a car, between a refrigerator and portable terminal equipment, a wallet and a key ring, home air-conditioning and a navigator.
We are, then, dealing with digital technology, which is present everywhere all the time.
How much cleverer is a person in intelligent clothing?
He is a mobile source of, and a target for, information.
I just wonder when we will be starting to control him like a robot.
Digital technology also makes life for many very easy, with the result that we are starting to look for stimulation outside this environment.
It has been calculated that 80% of our national wealth is intangible, which is to say education, knowledge, administration, and just 3% is made up of natural resources.
It is therefore alarming that in that 80% range we are lagging with indifference behind our competitors.
We are not investing, not researching, and not implementing directives properly and at an acceptable rate.
It is only mainly the Nordic countries and one or two others that are exceptions to this trend.
Information and communications technology is the fastest growing sector of industry.
It creates most jobs in industry.
Unless we pull ourselves together, disaster awaits us.
Those investing in the sector will look for their partners in countries such as China and India, and the old declining economies, which is to say us here in Europe, will be left behind.
Already highly trained people from China and India are entering this sector, a lot more than from Europe.
The day before yesterday the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Europe about this change.
Is it not then time to act, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commission is also suggesting?
Some amendments have been made to my report.
My colleague, MrsÂ Riera Madurell, and I drafted three of them, which can be kept in the form of these summarised versions, as compromises.
Their purpose is to take clear account of equality between women and men and the opinion of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, but to shorten this opinion slightly.
I hope this approach will be looked upon favourably.
Furthermore, my colleague, MrÂ Guidoni, has drafted a few amendments, which we on the committee voted against, mainly because of a translation error.
I also believe that I am able to support them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall firstly express my thanks to Parliament and particularly to its rapporteur, MrÂ Paasilinna, for his very detailed report.
He has been working very closely with the other rapporteurs and has gathered their opinions.
To all of them I express my thanks.
It is very encouraging to see that Parliament shares the Commissionâs main concerns and the policy priorities for the information society over the next five years.
As the various committees and rapporteurs have shown, it is very difficult to predict today how the information society of tomorrow will look, and that is why we opted for a broad and ambitious strategic framework, instead of a detailed action plan, because this strategic framework allows for review and adjustments in response to emerging challenges.
The i-2010 framework thus seeks to provide a future-proof policy framework.
I am very pleased to note that Parliament and the Commission share a position on the key elements of i-2010: commitments to make ICT legislation forward-looking and responsive to the changes brought about by converging.
So, it must be technologically neutral and supportive of competition, and at the same time Member States must implement fully the existing regulatory framework which, unfortunately, is not always the case, but you know that I am fighting to get that done.
We see a similar need for the approach to spectrum management which can respond to rapid technological developments and changes in demand and which is supported by regulators, operators and others involved.
Here we will have a lot of work in the next few months.
Our shared priorities also include support for the EUâs creation and distribution of European content, the protection of intellectual property, the promotion of security and the protection of users against harmful content.
The Commission and Parliament are also of one mind when it comes to urging Member States and businesses to invest more into ICT research, and we see the same need for ensuring appropriate financial resources for ICT in FP7 and CIP.
We also agree on the need to promote and protect citizensâ rights in the information society and that is why we need to raise the awareness of citizens on how their rights, freedom of expression, privacy, personal data protection and right to receive or communicate information can be exercised in the information society.
Together with Parliament I would urge the Member States to use their national reform plans in order to address their own ICT priorities, to improve their public services, such as e-government initiatives, where I see a lot of progress in the move to invest more in the exploitation of ICT in public-sector services.
Like Parliament, I am worried about the digital divide.
We have to ensure that everyone can participate; not only people who live in cities; not only people who have a certain level of education; not only young people.
This is a very strong goal and an opportunity to be seized.
We will work together on steps to bridge this digital divide.
When I refer to âdigital divideâ, I also mean the promotion of digital literacy for all, which leads me to the participation of women in all ICT-related fields of academia and business.
There is good news: our statistics show that gender is no longer the main factor in the digital divide; that factor is diminishing very rapidly.
I am encouraged by this, but that does not mean that we should not do anything to solve the residual problem.
We have to work together and continue our efforts to promote greater gender balance in ICT-related fields such as science.
In many governments, initiatives are being taken to that end.
I agree with you on the crucial importance of the Internet for an economy based on information.
That is why the EU also played an active role in brokering the agreement on the progressive internationalisation of Internet governance at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis last year.
In my view, that is the best approach to Internet governance.
The Commission, together with Parliament, will proceed by organising a forum later this year.
I am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue.
The working paper is going to be a stock-taking exercise to capture the wide range of different circumstances across the Member States, but at the same time â and I keep reiterating this â my views on ownership and media pluralism have not changed.
Ownership issues are a matter for Member States: they must take their responsibilities and exercise them in an effective manner in line with the subsidiarity principle.
That is why the Commission simply supports the Member States; it does not dictate to them in this important area of national life.
Having said that, I promised you that I would follow this up and cooperate with you in that regard.
I will shortly be proposing measures to that effect to this House.
Concerning your call to speed up the e-inclusion initiative â which is planned for 2008 â I urge you not just to see the date of 2008, because 2008 is the time when we will have reached our objective.
In order to reach it, we are preparing things now.
So I have spoken with the forthcoming EU Presidencies of Finland, Germany and Portugal, and practical actions will be built up until we reach the e-inclusion initiative in 2008.
Since the publication of the i-2010 action plan, we have significantly raised awareness of ICT issues.
We have started to make progress on key objectives, with the adoption of several proposals, with other proposals in the pipeline and with initiatives that were not inscribed in the i-2010 initiative.
The flexibility of the action plan allows us to add initiatives whenever necessary.
The latest one I took involves consultation on RFIDs, which bring together economic necessity and the necessity to protect the privacy of our citizens.
However, achievement of our ambitious objective requires adequate financial resources.
As soon as an interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective is reached, we need to see important decisions and adjustments named in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme.
I therefore urge you to ensure that those two programmes are granted the basic necessary financial resources in order to support ICT as a driver for competitiveness and growth.
I am very glad to see that this is a shared opinion and goal not only in this House but also in the three institutions, and that is a guarantee of success.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur on his wonderful work and then express my agreement with the Commissionerâs view and say that, in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives, it is essential to create a fully inclusive information society, in which everybody has access to the new information and communication technologies and can benefit from them under equal conditions.
In this context, the scant presence of women in the fields relating to these technologies demonstrates that there is a real digital gender gap in the European Union, which has clear repercussions in terms of employment and which must be dealt with by means of specific actions.
We must tackle the causes of this division, and it is therefore necessary to promote training actions aimed at increasing the number of well-trained women in the field and at all levels and to achieve a greater presence of, and participation by, women in all of the bodies that take decisions and formulate policies related to information and communication technologies.
There are still very few women in this area.
We are calling for special attention for women living in rural, isolated and geographically remote areas, for whom information and communication technologies may provide an effective means of participating in economic, political and social life.
For all of these reasons, it is essential that we have reliable data, broken down by gender, and a legal framework that deals with the gender perspective and allows us to identify and tackle the causes of discrimination.
On this aspect, the role of the new European Institute for Gender Equality may be fundamental.
Our report also refers to the sexist use of pictures of women in the media, and particularly in the digital media, and we are therefore calling on the Commission to promote the drafting of a gender equality code for the media, which will help to promote gender equality in the media, both in terms of the information they convey and in the media organisations themselves.
I do not wish to end without calling on the Commission to pay particular attention to the criminal use of the new information and communication technologies, such as the use of the Internet for the trafficking of women and children.
In this regard, we would ask that all legal and technological initiatives necessary to put an end to it be promoted.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report constitutes a significant advance towards an understanding of the concept of an âinformation societyâ.
Specifically, I would particularly like to point to one aspect of the report: the fact that it gives a precise indication of the extremely close relationship between current impressive developments in technology and the fate of democracy.
The report was right to show the effects that the information society has on growth and employment and to present the benefits, problems and the solutions.
The implications, however, go much further: the media have already become key in conditioning the ideas and behaviour of billions of people. Their role is therefore socially important and often decisive.
Media ownership cannot be distinct from responsibility towards society, and the effects of the media must not be seen solely in terms of the market.
At stake on this issue are all our values, our rights, and even the fate of peace and the survival of humanity.
We face not merely a set of economic and technical problems; what is at stake are fundamental rights such as the right to be informed, to be able to express oneself and to communicate, particularly given that the information society will increasingly be a society of the moving image.
This will be the dominant language of the future.
Those unable to decipher the images and prevent themselves from being manipulated by them will not be free: helping our children to learn this language will be the only way to make them into citizens with awareness.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Commissioner for the report drawn up by the Commission.
Thanks to that report, I believe that we have been able to hold an extremely interesting debate, because it stresses once again what I believe to be absolutely fundamental in the Lisbon Agenda.
If there is one decisive area in terms of the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, it is the information and communication technologies, which constitute a priority issue for this House and for the European institutions.
I would like to take this opportunity to refer to the budgetary issues, which have yet to be fully defined.
For example, with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, we must not forget the essential and decisive role of the information and communication technologies in the Lisbon Agenda.
I am going to mention just two aspects of the debate that we have held in my committee, in which we have reached an agreement on this report.
Firstly, with regard to Article 66, which was approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which refers to the need not to forget deregulation.
This is necessary to the sector, which only needed to be regulated for a limited period and in response to the demands of the time.
I believe that it is very important not to forget deregulation, because if we do not take it into account and vote in favour of it today, we will be going against the Lisbon Agenda.
Finally, on the issue of women, all of the groups reached a compromise amendment and we voted in favour of it, but then eight amendments appeared dealing with the issue of women, which Mr Paasilinna is now telling us are being reduced to three.
Women do not need to hear things repeated.
Women need decisive action.
Where there are problems, they do not need the same thing to be repeated twenty times, but rather they need something serious and decisive to be done once and for all.
We are therefore in favour of the compromise amendment, but not in favour of more and more rhetoric, like that contained in these additional amendments.
Â Â  . The knowledge-based society cannot be achieved unless we can bridge the digital divide in all its forms.
There is a digital divide between rich and poor countries, but it also exists within the EU itself.
If we are to combat this problem effectively, we need to tackle all of its various aspects, both technological and socio-economic.
Indeed, knowledge of ICT is the best response we can give to this problem.
The aim of the i2010 strategy is to develop the effective use of the goods and services provided by ICT and to encourage active and critical participation in the information society for all and to everyone's benefit.
This plan of action is therefore particularly to be welcomed.
The intention of our amendments was to ensure that we do not forget about vulnerable people such as the elderly, the disabled, and those who live alone or have social difficulties.
I also think it would be worthwhile to undertake an analysis of the economic, cultural and social effects of the move towards an information society, in order to improve our understanding and the monitoring of the plan, because I believe that we cannot be competitive if we do not share knowledge and skills.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, innovation in the field of ICT is progressing so rapidly that there is a risk that the European Union, which invests only EURÂ 80 per capita compared with the equivalent of EURÂ 350 in Japan and EURÂ 400 in the United States, will soon be left behind.
The EU must therefore increase investment in research and urge the Member States to do the same.
On the other hand, the fast pace of innovation means that there is a risk that the digital divide, and therefore social divides, will widen, to the detriment of the social and territorial cohesion that we are working towards.
It is therefore vital that we build an information society based on inclusion, and on broad take-up of information and communication technologies in public services, SMEs and households.
The success of the i2010 strategy requires the European Commission to put forward proposals to make these technologies accessible to all citizens, taking account of the crucial role given to the regions, to safeguard the principles of freedom and pluralism of the media, and to set out clear actions to protect against illegal and harmful content and to protect minors and human dignity, while also protecting privacy.
The Commission also needs to put the emphasis on effective use of ICT in public services, particularly in health and education.
Finally, although I am in favour, in the medium term, of opening up the market following a period of transition towards the implementation of general competition rules, I would point out that the Treaties define the rules for free competition, and at the same time call for economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Freedom of competition in the field of ICT must not result in the private sector refusing to invest in unprofitable infrastructure.
The role of states and regions will therefore be a determining factor in encouraging the development of the necessary infrastructure.
It is up to us to make ICT a real tool for economic development and for social and territorial cohesion in the European Union.
I would like to thank MrÂ Paasilinna for the high quality of his work, and my fellow Members for their contributions to the debate.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, information technology is a key element in constructing a society that is culturally richer and more cohesive.
The information society ought to be open to all, and ought to be a democratic tool that takes cultural diversity into account and promotes participation by citizens as protagonists, and not just as consumers.
We must tackle the elimination of the digital divide, which is a problem of balanced development and above all social justice.
The role of public investment in safeguarding the open nature of ICTs should be considered fundamental, in order to guarantee the development of technical resources and cultural tools permitting all citizens to benefit from an ever-increasing volume of communication and information services.
In order to put good governance into practice and provide all Europeans with full citizenship, we should adopt a European Charter of consumer rights in the digital world â so-called e-rights â with shared principles and guidelines, defining a framework of citizensâ rights.
The charter should include, in particular, the right to free access, free of charge (which would therefore be non-discriminatory), to transparent, comprehensive and complete information in a secure environment via telecommunications services and platforms based on open, interoperable standards, such as e-mail address portability.
With the I-2010 Directive, Europe has the vital role of meeting the target of making the information society accessible to all.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to welcome two documents, the report before us and the Commissionâs communication.
I will refer briefly to a number of issues.
In their broadest sense, ICT services, especially the Internet, must be understood to impact on human beingsâ consciousness and indeed on their subconscious too.
Accordingly, it is essential to put in place technological, distribution and legal safeguards to ensure these facilities are not used to transmit harmful content.
I have in mind content likely to deprave, to incite hatred or to promote criminal behaviour.
It is also necessary to provide effective protection for financial and administrative services, to prevent unauthorised individuals from accessing them.
Particular care should be taken over material aimed at children and young people.
The promotion of broadband information networks must be a priority.
More widespread use of home electric networks for data transmission should be encouraged.
Educating and informing society on the subject is tremendously important.
As we identify the tasks to be accomplished in this area we should keep in mind that this is not only a problem for the Union but also for the whole world.
Let us therefore do all we can to ensure that access to the information network becomes a reality for all our citizens and that they derive the maximum possible benefit from it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the technological developments and changes taking place nowadays in the ICT sector are proceeding at a giddy pace and are hard to keep up with.
Thus, a digital divide is appearing between Member States, a digital divide is appearing between regions and, most importantly, a digital divide is even appearing between persons with a small age difference.
I shall comment on two points which I consider crucial to the achievement of the objectives of i2010.
The first point is the institutional framework and the second point is the financing framework.
As regards the first point, with the i2010 strategy which we are debating today, the need is being identified and the review is being planned of the existing institutional framework on the basis of the new situation as regards digital convergence.
This constitutes a major challenge, given that the new institutional framework must: a) be flexible, so that it can adapt to rapid technological developments and the needs of the market without restricting innovative ideas, b) protect the development and production of content and safeguard unimpeded access for every citizen to information.
Some of these are contradictory parameters; nonetheless, drastic action must be found which will resolve the problems at the bottlenecks and will allow Europe to be competitive and to take the lead.
As regards the second point, the new strategy lays down ambitious objectives.
Nonetheless, as regards financing for research and innovation in ICT sectors, even with the 80% increase in resources proposed by the new strategy, Europe is still behind; to be precise, I would say a long way behind its competitors.
This fact makes me pessimistic and I consider that it is one of the most basic points on which we need to focus.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, objectives without resources to achieve them are not objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report.
This was of course is one of the top 10 priorities of the UK Presidency, essential for achieving the Lisbon goals.
Now ICT accounts for 40% of Europeâs productivity growth and for 25% of the EUâs GDP growth.
One of the key issues for me â as it is for the Commissioner and the rapporteur â is not just the economic goals of Lisbon but that the goals of Lisbon should embrace all.
Social inclusion is of course a key factor.
I know of poor single parents in Ely in Cardiff, where I was brought up, who do not have a car.
When they want to do their weekly shopping it is impossible for them to take a bus; they have countless bags to carry and young children to take with them, and so they book a taxi at the cost of about GBPÂ 10.
Now if they were to shop online they would not have to pay that GBPÂ 10, and this would make a huge difference to many poor families.
The demonstration of the practical advantages of ICT is important to ensure that poorer members of our society embrace new technologies.
Finally, we have to be realistic in relation to ICT.
The prime investment for the sector has to come from the private sector.
The state sector cannot respond quickly enough to changes in technology.
Our responsibility is to provide a stable legislative framework for this kind of investment.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to our rapporteur for his good report and also for his constructive cooperation.
Digitalisation is bringing massive change into the media and communications landscape; in future, the distinction between infrastructure and content will become less important, for every kind of content will be accessible on any platform.
Every type of content will end up being accessible using every kind of technology, be it the television set, the computer or the mobile phone, and another revolutionary thing is, of course, that all this content is available, to high quality, on all platforms and via all technologies even now.
More and more service providers are competing with one another in a market place that includes telecoms companies, cable operators, satellite broadcasters, mobile telephone companies, content providers, ISPs and so on and so on and so on.
All of them are devising their own business models, and none of them knows â any more than do we â which of these models will end up prevailing and what, at the end of the day, viewers actually want to access, what they want to see, or the sort of content they would like.
That does of course present us, as European lawmakers, with problems, since we have to draw up the legal framework and must, in so doing predict these imponderables and the way these things will develop, about which there is no certainty.
Over the coming weeks and months, we will have a very large number of questions to answer.
I am very grateful to Mr Paasilinna and to all the Members who have contributed to this report for reformulating essential issues in it and summarising them.
Let me mention a few of them.
How much regulation will still be needed in future in the telecoms field?
How much influence should the European Union have on that?
How do we want to shape frequency policy?
One problem that is extremely vexatious to the public is that of international roaming, for they still incur far too many charges when phoning across borders on mobiles.
Over the coming weeks and months, we will be occupying ourselves with these questions.
I look forward to an interesting dialogue with you, and I think that the digital world, which presents legislators such as ourselves with so many challenges, will certainly keep us busy over the coming weeks and months.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to stress in this minute-long speech how vital it is to obtain relevant information.
If members of the public do not receive information that is essential for their lives, development will not be sustainable.
Essential information lies at the heart of the information society: it is its most important aspect.
This is now being obscured by games and an unrealistic world of entertainment, one in which it is difficult to find and glean essential information that people can use to take control of their lives and participate in democracy.
This is therefore an essential matter as far as democracy is concerned.
I assume that the Commissioner has pondered this issue and I would like to hear her opinion on the subject of relevant information now, at the same time as she greets this important official.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, allow me to thank the draftsmen of the opinions and all the Members who have been involved in this issue, which is extremely important not only for economic and industrial development, but also for the welfare of our societies.
I would like to start by responding briefly to MrÂ Paasilinna's question regarding information.
There are two levels of information, the first being benchmarking, which takes place on an annual basis.
I am aware, MrÂ Paasilinna, that this benchmarking and these figures could be improved.
I too sometimes find it frustrating not to have statistics underlining the importance of the sector and its development.
One of the difficulties is that the sector is not stable, but moving fast.
We therefore need to review our information virtually every two or three months.
The second level is the information received by consumers.
In this respect, it is very important that we take things in hand.
For example, I have just launched a survey and consultations regarding RFIDs, because I think we need to develop the RFID economy and industry and also to discuss, with consumer associations and privacy protection bodies, the influence of new technologies on citizens and also, perhaps, the measures that we need to take to protect citizens better.
Efforts are thus being made, and I am counting on the European Parliament to be the spokesman for these discussions on citizenship.
MrÂ President, allow me to respond briefly to some of the questions raised.
Almost all of the speakers have quite justifiably mentioned Internet security.
The Internet is a wonderful thing, but, just like any other wonderful thing, it also has a negative side: that includes abuse of the Internet.
That is why, in the coming weeks, we are going to present a communication on spam, spyware and malware.
This was the subject of a seminar on 'Trust in the Net' held in February under the Austrian Presidency.
It is why we are working with child protection and women's protection bodies.
There are criminals operating on the Net and we need to put up barriers to stop them.
To this end, in terms of research, in 2007 we are going to present the European Security Research Programme covering all the fields âÂ encryption, biometrics, smart cards, authentication, RFIDs, and so onÂ â in which security problems must remain uppermost in our minds.
Another recurrent theme, which was quite rightly brought up by all the speakers, is the digital divide and regional development.
If we give competition free rein, it will of course develop in places where there will be a return on the investment, in other words in our towns.
Our policies therefore need to enable new technologies to develop outside our towns as well.
The Commission will be presenting an initiative in this connection at the end of this month, covering both rural and regional development.
A third theme that was raised by some Members is skills levels and in particular the need for specific measures for women.
With respect to skills, we are already aware that, in the technology sector, economic development is currently displaying a deficit of 15% due to a lack of technicians and engineers.
It is therefore of prime importance that we reform education in this field.
We also have statistics showing a lack of women in the sector.
I must admit that those statistics are not as bad as I had initially thoughtÂ âÂ women are doing better than is generally thought.
We should therefore not be too alarmed, but we do need to take action.
Therefore, together with the Commissioner responsible for education and the Commissioner responsible for research, we are going to draw up a roadmap to improve the involvement of women both in science training and in research.
We are also encouraging women researchers to get more involved in technology research.
In 2007 we are also going to present a European guide to best practice in the field.
I fully support the call for funding for ICT research.
I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that today's technological successes âÂ GSM, for example, which has become a worldwide standard, is based on European researchÂ â are based on research from the 1980s.
If we want to remain at the cutting edge of global technological progress in future, it is today's research that will provide tomorrow's results.
Therefore, if we do not invest in research, we can be sure that, in future, no economic sector will grow in this regard.
Thus, when I ask for enough funding for technological research, I am not doing it for my own pleasure, but to develop the economy, and hence to create jobs for the future, here in Europe, and to prevent businesses relocating outside Europe.
Some of you raised the issue of the regulatory framework.
I will be quite clear on that matter: the Telecoms regulation âÂ which is a very positive example that we are considering using as a basis for reforming the market and regulatory framework in the fields of transport and energyÂ â was intended not to regulate but to deregulate, to open up the markets to competition.
Our statistics demonstrate one thing: where markets are open to competition, prices fall and the take-up of technologies among the citizens rises considerably.
In contrast, where markets are closed, where there are monopolies, the take-up is non-existent because there is no choice on the market and because prices are too high.
Look at the statistics on broadband, for example, and you will see that only competition can make this market work, but âÂ as I said beforeÂ â competition only in markets that can be competitive.
We need correctives in markets that are too expensive for industrial economics; in other words, regional policy must pay attention to the regions remote from urban centres.
That said, the regulatory framework is in the review phase.
I have launched the initial discussions, and before the summer I will present to you a review of the markets concerned and an initial draft reforming the telecoms package.
Consultations on this subject will start in the second half of the year, and at the end of the year I will present to you a new telecoms package, which will be much simpler than the telecoms package on the table or in force.
However âÂ and I would like to make this quite clearÂ â this new package will not allow new monopolies to become established: I am quite resolute on that point.
Some of you also mentioned roaming.
As you probably know, last summer I announced that I would not put up with excessive prices for much longer; you will remember that last October I published a price comparison on a website.
I am in the process of making a comparison of the price changes since October.
Because I was frustrated with those price changes, I announced a regulation to reduce them, and, miracle of miracles, since I announced the regulation, international roaming fees have dropped, which is a good thing.
In a few weeks, I will let you know what I am going to do in that regard and I will tell you whether or not we need to regulate.
I think we will need to regulate, and I will therefore submit to you a regulation to ensure that international roaming fees are based on true costs and not on fantasy prices that strain household budgets.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  One hundred and twenty years ago, Thomas Edison said: âElectrical lighting will be so cheap that only the very rich will use candles for lighting.â
These days only the very rich can afford not to have a mobile telephone number or an e-mail address.
In the absence of these, these days it would be very difficult to apply for a job, and it would be hopeless to try to start a business.
The creation of the information society is not just a means, but also an indispensable precondition of growth and employment.
We must ensure development in all areas at the same time, in a rapid and flexible manner:
We must build networks even in areas where this would not be profitable purely on the basis of the market.
This must be included in our cohesion policy.
We must provide the population with affordable access to networks.
The market will undertake to do this, if we do not place unnecessary obstacles in its way.
We must provide high standard, safe content. This involves up-to-date training, innovation, research and development, and undoubtedly a more efficient protection of intellectual rights.
If we had waited for too long to switch on electricity, the candle wax would have burnt our fingers.
If we delay the issues relating to the information society much longer, the globalised ICT economy will be only too pleased to overtake us.
We must take action urgently.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0031/2006) by Jean Louis Cottigny, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on restructuring and employment (2005/2188(INI)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank my fellow Members for entrusting me with this report.
One of the methods I used in preparing this report was to listen.
I met all of the social partners, employees and employers, I went to meet the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and I had a meeting with CommissionerÂ Å pidla and the Commission's partners.
We also carried out a great deal of consultation with the shadow rapporteurs and I would like to take this opportunity to thank MrsÂ Bachelot, MrsÂ McDonald, MrsÂ Schroedter and MrÂ Beaupuy for their willingness to compromise and for the quality of their work.
When we talk about restructuring, there is always a certain impression that people are surprised, and that it is a new phenomenon.
In fact, it is as old as the hills and completely unavoidable.
Society changes, moves on, modernises.
It is quite normal for its economic activity to follow the same evolutionary curve.
The technical progress made by humans has been resulting in restructuring for centuries.
I will give you an example that I am sure will not offend anybody here: in the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, our ancestors experienced a great deal of restructuring.
Having said that, it is true that the acceleration of progress and today's global market have given these phenomena a new face.
Each new decision we take may result in restructuring.
That is why I would like, if I may, to congratulate the Commission on having recognised, in its communication, that, since the EU is sometimes the cause for restructuring, such as in the textiles sector, it needs to bear its share of the responsibility by supporting it to the best of its ability.
As you will have noticed, I have attempted throughout my report to stress the fact that restructuring is necessary, because in my view it ensures that our businesses remain economically competitive and thus safeguards jobs.
However, in examining this issue, we cannot ignore restructuring based on false pretexts, which is in fact predicated on the hunt for an immediate profit.
It is quite justifiable to condemn such behaviour as immoral, because it is absolutely unacceptable in today's Europe for a father with a family to support to find the factory gates locked on Monday morning, everything having been cleared out over the weekend.
The role of our institutions, and of the social partners, is to intervene as early as possible, so as to plan for restructuring better and to soften the blow in terms of the social cost.
This is because restructuring, whether or not it is justified, often leaves people by the wayside.
Restructuring is not a phenomenon that affects any Member State in particular.
We must not heed the siren's call that tries to set us in opposition to each other whenever we discuss employment in this Chamber.
There are not two blocks with the old Member States on one side and the new ones on the other.
No, there are 450Â million Europeans from Tallinn to Lisbon, any of whom could suddenly find themselves in this situation.
In my report, I have tried to define three spheres of action.
First of all, there is a sphere of action to support what we might call good corporate citizens, by strengthening the tools for analysing the phenomenon, in order to prevent it in advance, increasing aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, encouraging continuing vocational training, which is a right for employees and an undeniable asset for businesses, reforming State aid to support growth and, in particular, setting up a globalisation adjustment fund.
Secondly, there is a sphere of action to punish the 'gangster' companies, if I may call them thatÂ âÂ they are certainly very much in the minority, but they are the ones we talk about the most.
This type of action involves better monitoring of the use of the European funds in order to prevent subsidy tourism, challenging certain instances of restructuring with doubtful motives, and respecting the Community legal and its enforcement.
Thirdly, there is a sphere of action to support those primarily affected by the phenomenon of restructuring: the workers.
This involves setting up permanent retraining units to help people to find new positions as soon as possible after losing their jobs.
It involves strengthening the role of the social partners, who are our greatest asset in dealing with these phenomena, and that is why I would ask you all once again to consider reviewing the European Works Councils directive.
It also involves encouraging employees to become shareholders in their companies and setting up a one-stop shop to give all EU citizens equal access to care.
To conclude, I think that, alongside the social partners and beyond any party political affiliations, we can help to provide support for restructuring in order to win the employment battle.
We need to bear this in mind at a time when, from one minute to the next, it is possible for a decision taken by a board of directors on the other side of the world to completely destroy, here on our territory, the fruit of decades of work.
This matter gives us the opportunity to get involved in the lives of our citizens, because that is what this is all about, behind all of our technical circumlocutions: men and women who just want to be happy.
In the spirit of the founding fathers who created a Europe based on peace, it is up to us today to contribute to a Europe based on social peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, restructuring is essential, as it will allow the economy to develop, shedding the less productive activities and becoming stronger in key areas.
It is, however, usually the case that the new jobs are not the same as the jobs that have been lost.
The greatest number will be in services and in the most skilled professions.
Industrial and less skilled jobs will disappear.
This will involve social costs, and it is therefore essential to anticipate restructuring and to ensure that accompanying measures are in place, which is the shared responsibility of public authorities, firms and social partners.
The communication on restructuring of 31 March 2005 was drafted precisely with this in mind.
The Commission is grateful to Mr Cottigny and to all of the Members who contributed to the drafting of the report, which in principle supports the general consensus that has emerged on addressing the issue of restructuring.
The Commission is pleased that Parliament supports the provision of significant funding from the European Union for the purposes of anticipating restructuring and ensuring that the accompanying measures are in place.
Greater use must be made of the Structural Funds to support economic and social change in the regions and to retrain the workers most affected by restructuring so as to help them secure new and better jobs.
In addition to this, the Commission recently adopted a proposal to create a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has already been put before you.
The aim of this Fund is to ensure the necessary level of solidarity in the future between those who benefit from trade liberalisation and those who will lose their jobs as a result of globalisation.
The Commission notes a number of interesting points in Mr Cottignyâs report, which it will pursue further.
These include the idea of a European one-stop shop for restructuring, which I consider to be particularly interesting.
As for improved monitoring of the way that Community funds are used, the Commission has proposed for the period 2007-2013 that Community funds tighten regulations on company relocations and broaden the responsibility for securing a return on investments.
The Commission is also proposing that firms which infringe these regulations be obliged to return the aid they have received and that they be barred from receiving any aid in the future.
If we wish to pursue a positive and constructive approach to economic and social change, the involvement of the public authorities is essential, on European, national and regional levels.
At the same time, restructuring must principally involve those who are carrying it out and who will have to live with its consequences, that is to say firms and employees.
It is precisely for this reason that last yearâs communication focused also on the European social partners, calling on them to continue in the joint task of drawing up and implementing preventative and positive procedures on restructuring.
The Commission has also called on the partners to find ways of strengthening the role of European works councils.
The programme of work for future years, which has recently received the backing of the European partners, provides for continuing work on both of these issues.
The Commission calls on the social partners to speed up the delivery of results in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, restructuring must not become a synonym for social decline and the loss of economic substance.
It can also contribute to economic and social progress, provided it has been anticipated in time so that firms are able to manage it rapidly and efficiently, and public authorities are able to contribute with appropriate accompanying measures.
I am delighted to find this view expressed in the introduction to the report from the European Parliament, and it must be our guide on the path to growth, social cohesion and higher standards of living.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, restructuring brings two worlds together: the economic world, where restructuring is necessary in order to face up to the changes mandated by globalisation and customer expectations, and the social world, where it is often a source of suffering and anxiety for employees.
This restructuring is taking on a whole new dimension with the emergence of new powers, resulting in a new aspect to work sharing, which will lead to Europe being forced to develop the service sector while giving up on being an agricultural and industrial power.
We refuse to accept this prospect.
In this context, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to demonise necessary restructuring, but feels that the European market needs to promote a regulatory framework to absorb the shocks of this globalisation.
The internal market is not the cause for restructuringÂ âÂ it is the antidote to it.
Even so, this European model is also a humanist model, and we need to take into consideration the suffering caused to the people and the territories affected by this phenomenon.
The question that arises is this: how can we encourage socially responsible restructuring?
MrÂ Cottigny's report allows us to look at a number of approaches, to which our group contributed.
An initial approach involves reviewing the European Works Council directive and increasing the role of the social partners, following in-depth consultation with them: the rapporteur has proposed an amendment in this respect, which we support.
Other approaches include access to expertise and the exchange of good practices, which is a relevant area for the open method of coordination; vocational training, with regard to which we are pleased that the support fund proposed by MrÂ Barroso supports retraining for the workers affected and is not devoted to risky salvage operations; and optimising the support for our solidarity policies from the ESF/ERDF structural funds, on condition, Commissioner, that they are not compromised by the delayed financial perspective.
I will, of course, conclude by mentioning research and innovation.
I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur MrÂ Cottigny for his open-mindedness, which made it possible to reach a number of compromises and which should, barring disasters, allow our group to vote in favour of his report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the transparent way in which he worked on this report and so succeeded in uniting the committee.
The way he did this was excellent.
I also share the rapporteurâs view that restructuring is nothing new.
If I look at my own home town, I note that the big workplaces that existed when I was a child are no longer there. Completely new workplaces have grown up.
Society has changed as a result of this process, and workplaces are now of a higher quality than they were when I was growing up.
That development will continue.
What is new is that the process is happening so much more quickly in todayâs globalised world, which is why we must have restructuring as an instrument.
It may be seen as either a threat or an opportunity, but now that we have chosen a path to go down and said that we are not to compete with India and China with their low wages and their particular working conditions but, instead, retain a high level of wages and good social conditions, restructuring must be an instrument used in the Lisbon process.
The issue is, however, one of how, then, we are to implement the restructuring.
Firstly, we must have long-term planning.
There are trends we need to be able to see.
Moreover, we must act in time for, if we delay taking action, we may delay too long.
Then, factories will simply have to close down.
There will be no alternative.
Our work to bring about change must take place in time.
Secondly, there must be participation.
Both sides of industry, including employees, must be involved in the whole process so that, when the restructuring process takes place in the form of skills updating and such like, people are prepared.
Thirdly, experiences must be shared.
I visited the Dublin Institute last weekend.
There has been extensive analysis of successful restructuring processes, and there is a bank of information about them.
I know, for example, that, following last yearâs closure, 75% of former Electrolux employees in VÃ€stervik have now already obtained new jobs.
There has been cooperation between the company, both sides of industry and the local community with a view to creating new jobs.
Now that we are creating a new Globalisation Fund, let us not forget the old instruments: the Social Fund and skills updating, together with responsibility taken at national and regional levels.
I am a supporter of the Globalisation Fund if it is used to strengthen individuals and increase employment and does not preserve old structures.
However, we must also use the old instruments, such as the Social Fund, to promote the updating of skills.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion this report is pretty exemplary in many respects.
I think the main reason for this is that the report we have before us sets out the problem well.
Some of you, including the rapporteur himself, have pointed out that this is not a new problemÂ âÂ it has existed for millennia.
I would just like to emphasise that these issues of adaptationÂ âÂ because restructuring is simply one aspect of the adaptation of businessesÂ âÂ are absolutely vital in order to be able to respond to the needs of the customer, which includes every one of us here.
I am not going to repeat the various points made by the rapporteur when he presented the subject.
What I would like to say, because I think he sets a very good example, is that he has made some very pragmatic proposals, which I would divide into six categories.
This has been emphasised by several people.
The first point is the need to take action as early as possible.
Also, I would remind my fellow Members, if they need reminding, that we do not hear anything about the vast majority of incidences of restructuring, precisely because the decision is taken in advance.
Secondly, we need the partners to be involved â the partners in the business, obviously, but also the regional and external partners.
My final point, which has already been raised, is support for workers.
Nevertheless, I would emphasise one very specific aspect, that of tailored support for employees, because general responses are not the only option.
A tailored response really is needed.
Each employee must be able to get an answer, through information, help looking for a new job, and so on.
As for the companies themselves, we must, as you said, make a distinction between the fraudulent businessesÂ âÂ because there are someÂ âÂ and the most essential businesses, which need to be supported.
Finally, there is support for disadvantaged regions.
Mr Cottigny, I would like to thank you for the way you worked.
As MrsÂ Bachelot said on behalf of her group, I would say, on behalf of my group, that there is a good chance, a very good chance, that we will support you.
In conclusion, Commissioner, I obviously hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament's proposals, but I also hope that, beyond our European institutions, the various players â in the Member States, in the regions and in the chambers of commerce â and the various professional players will take note of the letter and the spirit of this report, so that restructuring is not a death sentence but rather an opportunity for these businesses and these workers to bounce back.
Â Â  â Mr President, It is indeed the case that the enterprises involved in restructuring always talk in terms of being pressured into it by something they compare to a force of nature suddenly overwhelming them, but I do not believe that they are right to do so.
Restructuring and modernisation are things that enterprises are constantly obliged to do; indeed, they are a matter of social duty in respect of their workers.
They are responsible for the continuing development of their skills, and this is where I agree with the rapporteur: workers are entitled to training, whether basic, advanced, or in-service.
It is of course possible for vocational development and the training of professionals to be undertaken by publicly-funded bodies, but it would be outrageous for businesses to take the line that this was actually an obligation incumbent on the public sector, and that it had to take over responsibility for it.
I concede that such restructuring or even relocations result in a great deal of unemployment in some regions, but I would remind those caught up in such situations of such instruments as the territorial pacts for employment that we â that is, this House together with the Commission â have put together.
Studies testify to the fact that what made them really outstanding was that they involved all the local stakeholders.
They are efficient; they were supported by European structural funds, and they were successful.
It really does amaze me that the Commission is more reticent about its support for these territorial employment pacts and no longer has recourse to these options in the way it once did.
