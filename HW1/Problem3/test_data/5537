I have played a part in bringing about the compromises, and I support the report.
I think we should stick to the compromise so that a first reading is sufficient and we get a directive through quickly.
I am extremely pleased with the outcome.
I am looking forward to the ongoing road safety debate in Parliament, for it is very important.
Mr President, outdoor public areas used to be, above all, the domain of pedestrians and children playing.
Since then, the car has claimed a large proportion of these for driving and parking.
This represents a great danger in populous urban areas, in particular, but also on narrow country roads with ribbon development.
That danger is further increased if cars also have decorative fittings at the front or rear.
The use of sharp decorative fittings was banned at national level as many as 40 years ago, but there are still manufacturers and drivers who consider outward appearance more important than other people's safety.
That problem cannot be solved on a voluntary basis; this particularly applies to the attachment of bull bars to energy-guzzling jeeps weighing up to 3.5 tonnes.
I have been pressing for legislation against the trend - still predominant at that time - for a long time in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
In plenary conclusions a year ago, Parliament demanded a framework directive in addition to the voluntary agreements with European and Asian automobile manufacturers.
Today, I am arguing in favour of the amendments to it that afford maximum protection to non-motorists, instead of continuing to place our hope in motorists switching on their headlights in daylight, for example.
Mr President, I am pleased that my turn to speak has come before midnight this time - yesterday it was quarter past midnight.
This directive relates to the protection of vulnerable road users in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle.
It brings to a conclusion many years' debate regarding the necessity and usefulness of legal provisions on passive protection.
Although the result is unremarkable for balance between the benefits to society and industry, it is probably the best that can be hoped for at this moment in time.
From that point of view, we support this proposal.
It is now important to see to it that the agreements enter into force as soon as possible.
That is not my last word on the matter.
The development of systems that promote safety does not stand still.
We will also need to indicate a direction for the future.
In that context, I wish to make three remarks.
Firstly, the proposal applies to a limited part of motor-vehicle categories M1 and N1.
If the effect is to be maximised, the scope needs to be extended.
The Commission should examine the conditions under which the scope can be extended to all the vehicles in categories M1 and N1.
Secondly, during discussions on this proposal, attention shifted from purely passive measures to both passive and active measures.
We support this approach, but we are of the opinion that it is necessary to impose quality requirements on active systems, too.
It should not be the case that passive systems meeting more stringent requirements are supplanted by active systems which are not subject to a single European quality requirement.
Thirdly, the attention to active measures must not delay the entry into force of the requirements for passive measures.
As has already been said, the results regarding passive safety were hard-won.
Society will benefit from the quickest possible implementation of these, therefore.
Holding a debate on active systems would not be conducive to this.
Finally, our thanks to Mr Vermeer for the energy and commitment with which he has launched himself into this dossier.
You can tell your constituents that you started speaking on Wednesday and were so keen that you did not finish until Thursday!
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
(The sitting closed at midnight)
We have tried to seek a compromise.
I believe there are two ways of carrying out politics.
The inflexible way, which makes dialogue difficult, and the flexible way, which involves giving ground and trying to be constructive, a positive politics.
We propose accepting a combination of passive and active measures (which in any event could have been included in another directive!) in the event that we replace the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) tests, provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25% of all the measures.
The alternative measures to the effective EEVC tests (which have proven to be effective for more than 20 years) should not therefore differ from the latter by more than 25%.
We concede that the EEVC tests can be subject to a further viability study (like the alternative measures which the industry may present).
The condition is that this study must be entirely independent.
Finally, we wanted to clarify that the alternative measures must, in all cases, maintain the same level of protection as the EEVC tests, so that they protect all the parts of the body included on those tests.
I believe that my group has made a great effort to make these concessions and I hope that you will accept them and that they will improve the protection of pedestrians.
. (FR) The common position is satisfactory with regard to the listing of the ingredients present in foodstuffs, with one exception.
Where processing aids are concerned, it needs to be revised.
The common position is, in effect, completely disproportionate in requiring all the substances used in the manufacturing process to be displayed on the labels.
Especially where no traces of these substances are left in the finished product.
This is the case of renowned beverages on which entire regions depend for their livelihood, such as beer and wine, which could thus be labelled as containing egg and fish derivatives.
It is enough to ruin the reputation of high-quality beverages which have been consumed for centuries without any risk of harmful effects.
The amendments tabled, which are along the same lines as those we tabled for the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, require these processing aids to be subject to specific scientific tests providing evidence of their allergenic effects.
For the time being, nothing has been proven - it is all conjecture.
We must therefore wait for the first results before making the labelling of processing aids mandatory.
We are in favour of transparency to inform consumers of the ingredients in products, but we are opposed to over-labelling, which would be disastrous for the agrifood chains which are vital for France and many other countries.
Thank you Mr Staes.
I would like to express our full sympathy for Dr Erkel's father.
ECB 2002 annual report
The next item is the report (A5-0237/2003) by Hans Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2002 Annual Report of the European Central Bank (I5-0012/2003 C5-0238/2003 2003/2102(INI)).
It is particularly appropriate that we welcome to the House this morning Mr Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank.
He is the first President of the European Central Bank, and it may well be his last visit to Parliament in that capacity.
So, President, you are particularly welcome.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Duisenberg, I have been reading your biography in recent weeks and have found it very enjoyable and interesting.
The book begins with a beautifully written preface describing the tough negotiations that preceded your appointment as the first President of the Central Bank.
They were difficult negotiations that were to lay the foundations of a stringent policy aimed at stabilising the euro.
If one thing became clear, however, it was that you set your very own course for the European Central Bank, in which political views did not play a role.
It is an ironic twist of fate, then, that the very country that found it hard to accept your nomination for longer than four years, asked a few months ago whether you would like to stay on a little longer.
Mr Duisenberg, your last annual report has come out in a period in which the growth of the European economy has stagnated.
The last quarter saw zero growth.
Some Member States are thus officially in recession, and that means that the economy has contracted for the second consecutive quarter.
This puts the European Union in a worrying situation.
The measures taken by the Union and the Member States have thus proved unable to turn the economic tide in the short term, and it is in this very period that we are discussing the fifth annual report of the European Central Bank.
It is an annual report about a very eventful year; a year in which citizens had their first chance to show their confidence in the euro; and a year which was preceded by higher expectations as regards economic recovery following the September 11 attacks.
Many of those expectations were not realised.
New threats slowed down the pace of recovery, and the euro is yet to inspire great confidence in citizens.
The fact that 300 million inhabitants of the euro zone are making full use of the new currency does not prove anything except that they have no real alternative: they have to use it, and no further political conclusions can be drawn from this.
In a climate of uncertainty such as this, it is not surprising that the ECB has its work cut out if it is to fulfil the objective of stability.
It is not only the responsibility of the ECB, however, but also of the Member States; after all, it is their budgetary policy that lays the foundations for a stable euro.
I should like to devote attention to a few further points in this debate.
First of all, it is important that we make our position known succinctly in the form of a resolution.
Now is not the time to reveal all of our political desires for change.
The most important thing, in this economically less prosperous time, is that Parliament make clear that it supports a policy that has stability as its aim.
Stability of the currency, and hopefully a return to economic growth in the short term, are necessary in order to restore the confidence of manufacturers and consumers and revive the economy.
The number of new political desires contained in the resolution is therefore limited.
In addition, it would be ill-advised to start tampering with the ECB's objectives already.
The resolution emphasises - incidentally following on from earlier resolutions - that price stability is, and must remain, the chief objective of the ECB.
New objectives, such as the promotion of economic growth and other tasks, are subordinate to this.
An important argument for this relates to the short history of the Bank.
To date, the Bank has not been confronted with a Europe-wide recession; it has, however, met with repeated criticism of its policy.
For example, in times of economic prosperity, there was a great deal of criticism when the exchange rate of the euro depreciated, and also now, when it is rising - even though the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is not an aim in itself.
What is important is monetary stability within the euro zone itself, and this is the ECB's responsibility.
In brief, a real acid test is yet to come.
The Bank has yet to prove its ability to fulfil the objective of price stability in times of recession, too, using the existing instruments.
In addition to this, inflation has been relatively high up to now, and real wages are increasing sharply despite the increase in unemployment, which indicates continuing structural rigidities in the labour markets.
I should like to emphasise that it is important for precisely that price stability - to which consumer confidence is inextricably linked - that the ECB be allowed to continue to do its work independently of politics.
Parliament therefore bears some of the responsibility for creating the political preconditions for this by means of a resolution.
Finally, Mr Duisenberg, on the back cover of your biography there is a photograph of you evidently enjoying your hobby, fishing.
I wish you a good catch, and I also wish you good health and enjoyment of the finer things in life in the years to come.
I am sure we all agree with your remarks, Mr Blokland.
. (ES) Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank Mr Blokland for his report, which addresses all aspects of the European Central Bank's annual report.
The Commission is pleased to see Parliament undertaking this activity, which contributes to our joint efforts to improve the framework of macroeconomic policy in the Union and, especially, in the Eurozone.
The report clearly pursues the approach adopted in previous years and contains numerous aspects with which the Commission fully agrees.
There is no doubt that the euro has been an enormous success and we must all thank the European Central Bank for the hard work it has carried out to achieve this.
The Commission also considers that the Central Bank has done an excellent job in recent years with regard to its basic task, which is to ensure price stability, and we also share the concerns at the inadequate structural reforms and at the fiscal consolidation that is taking place in Europe.
Nevertheless, my position is rather more circumspect on some points.
Firstly, with regard to the Central Bank's mandate, the Treaty makes this mandate quite clear: to maintain price stability.
It is true that the Bank is also asked to support the general policies of the Community, but this must be done without undermining the aim of stability.
Mr Blokland's report appears to suggest a rather different interpretation of the mandate, and this aspect was highlighted by the Commission last month, when the report was debated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Secondly, the report calls for the Central Bank to take action in other areas for which we do not believe it has a mandate.
It calls on the Bank, for example, to back the denomination of energy supplies and commodities in euros.
On this point, the Commission's position is the same as the Bank's in that it should be neutral with regard to the international use of the euro.
Lastly, Mr Blokland's report assesses the European Central Bank's management of its budget.
From the formal point of view and without having access to the latest audit report covering 2001, this assessment might, in our opinion, be somewhat premature.
In any event, I wish to thank him for his comments and say that I am particularly pleased to be here in Parliament, particularly on such a special day, with Mr Duisenberg present.
. Mr President, thank you for your kind words of introduction.
I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for the kind words with which he introduced the resolution which is before you today.
It is indeed a pleasure today despite the fact that it is in all likelihood the last time that I shall be here to introduce the ECB's Annual Report for 2002, a year that was marked despite all the incidents you may have found overwhelming in your minds by significant progress on our path towards a more integrated Europe.
In particular, 2002 saw the successful introduction of the euro in its tangible form, as euro banknotes and coins have been swiftly accepted and embraced by the citizens of the euro area.
Moreover, the Heads of State or Government, at their summit meeting in December last year, took the historic decision to invite ten countries to join the European Union as of 1 May 2004.
At the same time, the environment in which monetary policy was conducted in 2002 was one of considerable uncertainty.
Following the slowdown in economic activity in 2001, a moderate recovery of real GDP growth in the euro area was recorded at the beginning of 2002.
However, as the year progressed, the recovery lost momentum, affected by renewed turbulence in financial markets and geopolitical tensions, which had consequences for oil prices and confidence.
Overall, annual real GDP growth in the euro area is estimated to have been only 0.8% in 2002, compared with 1.4% in 2001.
Despite the subdued pace of real economic growth, inflation remained at 2.3% on average in 2002, unchanged from 2001, and slightly above the European Central Bank's definition of price stability.
This was partly due to a number of temporary or one-off factors, including higher oil prices, indirect tax increases and adverse weather conditions.
On top of this, there is no denying that there were some effects from the cash changeover.
While the overall impact of the cash changeover on inflation was small, its perceived impact was much greater than its actual impact, probably due to comparatively strong price increases in some specific sectors.
Of greater concern for the medium-term outlook for price stability was the fact that nominal wage growth remained relatively strong despite the weakening of economic activity and a rise in unemployment, while productivity growth remained low.
This development points to persistent structural rigidities in the labour markets of the euro area.
Monetary growth was strong in 2002.
While this development was partly the result of high volatility in financial markets, which heightened investors' preference for short-term liquid and less risky financial assets, it also reflected the relatively low interest rates in the euro area in 2002.
Overall, however, the excess liquidity was not seen to indicate risks to price stability in an environment of subdued economic activity and moderate credit growth.
While some factors pointed to possible upward inflationary pressures at the beginning of the year, later in the year the worsening outlook for economic activity and the sizeable and protracted appreciation of the euro increasingly pointed towards lower inflationary pressures over the medium term.
Against this background, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in December 2002.
This move was followed in March 2003 by a reduction of 25 basis points and by a further 50 basis point reduction last month, in June 2003.
These rate cuts provided some counterweight to the various factors having an adverse effect on economic activity and thereby improved the prospects for price stability over the medium term.
With these decisions, the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2% in June 2003.
Interest rates in the euro area are now at record low levels by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms.
As regards the current outlook for price stability, Eurostat's flash estimate of annual inflation in the euro area was 2% for June 2003.
The appreciation of the euro, which has brought exchange rates to levels close to long-term averages and more in line with economic fundamentals, should contribute to keeping inflationary pressures low.
In addition, in a context of moderate economic recovery, wage growth is expected to remain compatible with the maintenance of price stability.
The strong monetary growth also should not, for the time being, adversely affect the outlook for price stability.
While the outlook for price stability has remained broadly unchanged since our last decision on 5 June 2003, the Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment.
Although the outlook for price stability is favourable, having allowed interest rates to fall to historically low levels, monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area.
Other policy-makers also have to take up their responsibilities.
Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of both fiscal and structural reforms to further improve the conditions for investment and employment.
I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets, given their positive impact on the euro area's ability to better withstand external shocks, as well as to increase its growth potential.
Fiscal policies should also strive to establish a well-designed consolidation strategy in those countries struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances.
A medium-term, stability-oriented approach for economic policies would eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives, which would also have positive effects over the shorter term.
In fact, at present, the situation of subdued economic growth and the stronger external value of the euro make the structural reforms even more necessary.
Let me now turn to some other issues raised in the draft resolution on the ECB's Annual Report.
I have noted and I welcome that in several important aspects the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB, for instance as regards the need for Member States to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and the importance of honouring their commitments under the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, in particular, again, with respect to structural reforms.
I also appreciate the fact that your draft resolution welcomes the clarifications of the ECB's monetary policy strategy which we made public in May of this year.
These clarifications, while reflecting the overall successful experience with the ECB's monetary policy strategy since its inception, will further foster understanding of the monetary policy of the ECB.
While the European Parliament and the ECB hold similar views on many important issues, some differences in views remain, such as regarding the draft resolution's suggestion that the ECB should publish the summary minutes and the balance of votes of Governing Council meetings.
For a number of reasons, which I have pointed out on previous occasions before Parliament, we believe that the tools chosen by the ECB to communicate and explain its decisions ensure transparency, are more readily available and better reflect the institutional environment in which the ECB operates.
You will also not be surprised that I cannot share the view that the ECB's decision-making process might have been delayed by the fact that most Governing Council decisions have so far been taken by consensus.
Indeed, the Governing Council has taken its decisions in a timely manner, responding appropriately to changing economic conditions whenever required.
The draft resolution also refers to the Beige Book of the Federal Reserve System as being a benchmark for country-by-country reviews to be conducted by the Eurosystem.
Let me point out that the national central banks within the Eurosystem regularly monitor and analyse macroeconomic, fiscal as well as structural developments in their respective countries, publishing their findings in their monthly, quarterly or annual reports.
These analyses clearly enhance our understanding of euro area developments.
However, given its euro area focus, it is natural for the European Central Bank to pay greater attention to the euro area perspective in its explanations of the single monetary policy.
As mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we are currently experiencing truly historic developments.
The dream of a united Europe stretching beyond former post-war rifts is about to become reality.
Although major challenges lie ahead, as many of the acceding countries are still developing into fully-fledged market economies, I believe that the signing of the Accession Treaty at the Athens summit in April testified to our joint belief in an integrated Europe.
The clear endorsement of the Treaty in the national referenda that have already taken place in a number of acceding countries provides evidence of this commitment.
It goes without saying that an enlarged European Union will require a number of adaptations in the working procedures and the internal functioning of European institutions and bodies, including a reform of the voting modalities of the Governing Council of the ECB.
I am well aware of the views that the European Parliament has expressed in this regard, but let me again point out that the Nice Treaty set clear conditions and limits within which our reform proposal had to be formulated.
While the adopted changes in the voting modalities are, admittedly, complex, the tried-and-tested principles of the Eurosystem constitution, in particular the ad personam participation of governors and the 'one member, one vote' principle for the members exercising a voting right, have been kept fully intact.
This will ensure that, also in a significantly enlarged euro area in the future, the Governing Council will maintain its capacity for timely and efficient decision-making.
Upon accession, the new Member States will join Economic and Monetary Union with the status of 'countries with a derogation', and their central banks will immediately become part of the European System of Central Banks.
At a later stage, these central banks will become part of the Eurosystem, once their respective countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria for adopting the euro.
A key priority of the European Central Bank is to have in place the necessary technical and institutional infrastructure to ensure an orderly enlargement of the European System of Central Banks and, later on, of the Eurosystem.
An interesting foretaste of the new, larger ESCB was provided by the General Council meeting last week where, for the first time, the governors of the acceding countries' central banks participated as observers in a meeting of the General Council of the ECB.
With this look towards the future, I should like to conclude my statement.
This, indeed, will be the last time that I have the opportunity to present to you the Annual Report of the European Central Bank, which I have had the honour and the privilege to preside over for the last five years.
Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for the cooperation and cordial relations that we have maintained.
Mr Duisenberg, I am sure I speak for every Member in the House in wishing you all the best for the future.
We can all recognise the fact that you are passing on a new but highly respected institution, a situation largely due to the contribution that you personally have made to the foundation of the European Central Bank.
We thank you very much for your presence today and for all the work you have done on behalf of all of us in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like, if I may, to wish Mr Duisenberg success in the future that is on a par with all that he has managed to achieve in the European Central Bank.
I will not wish you good luck in your fishing, Mr Duisenberg, because, as an Italian from the south of Italy, I am afraid that it might bring you bad luck.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland, whose report focuses on the responsibilities of the European Central Bank in Europe and the responsibilities that it will have to take on with a view to the imminent entry of the ten new countries into the Union.
According to the terms of the Treaties, the primary goal of the European Central Bank is to define monetary policy in Europe and to ensure price stability through monetary policy.
Personally, I am convinced that, irrespective of this principal responsibility, the European Central Bank must play a more effective role in the economy, using moral suasion methods, not least, which have yielded surprisingly successful results in the field of bank supervision.
I tabled an amendment, which was not accepted in committee, which sought to provide a more detailed, comprehensive definition of the Pact.
It would have read as follows: a uniform interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact must be achieved in order to avoid undermining the credibility of the euro area and thus the effectiveness of its monetary policy; considers that the European Central Bank must confirm to the Commission that the Pact is being implemented with sufficient flexibility as to promote growth.
Indeed, the Pact was created not just with a view to achieving stability but also in order to boost growth to acceptable levels.
Growth as a key objective of the Pact can also be achieved through investment in large-scale work and financial undertakings in the field of research, outside public spending.
Of course, this option must not become an excuse for abandoning the rigour of public finances and must be supported by a totally sustainable fiscal policy, as implemented so successfully in the United Kingdom.
The recently approved draft Constitution includes provisions governing the European monetary institutions, or rather, the role of the ECB and the national central banks and their sensitive relationship.
Over this period, some national central banks have feared radical resizing with subsequent centralisation of power in Frankfurt.
They did not want the European Central Bank to become a fully-fledged institution on the grounds that this would jeopardise the independence of the monetary institution, but I am sure this was just an excuse.
This deadlock between the European Central Bank and the national central banks has caused confusion, and it is only in Article 29(3) that we have a comprehensive definition: the European Central Bank shall have legal personality.
Looking at the other decisions made in this field, it has to be said that, in Europe and Parliament, as elsewhere, the compromise approach has taken root which often, far from bringing about convergence of differing positions, generates, in many cases, uncertainty and confusion regarding the matter in question.
As a result of these compromises, a complicated method of voting has been decided on for the members of the Bank's Governing Council, the printing of banknotes has been split willy-nilly between the different monetary institutions, and, above all, a decentralised system has been preserved which will become overcomplicated and ineffective with eastward enlargement.
To sum up, over and above the Convention's decisions, we need to ask ourselves whether, in order to take into due account the guiding role of the European Central Bank and the interests of the individual national central banks, we should not be taking the path of dividing up the responsibilities between centre and periphery, with consequent specialisation of the national central banks, which would have to supervise minor financial institutions too.
I hope that many of these points will be clarified at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, the annual debate in this House on the Annual Report of the European Central Bank, just like the quarterly Monetary Dialogue, always provides us with an opportunity not only to take stock but also to examine the outlook.
Against this background it is therefore especially pleasing to note that no one disputes the successes achieved in establishing the issuing bank, introducing the notes and coins, and also in combating inflation.
I would also like to thank you very sincerely for your cooperation and for the contribution you have made.
The fact that 75% of Europe's citizens are now in favour of the euro must certainly be due in part to your work and your actions.
We will of course do everything we can to win over the remaining 25%, and we hope that the three Member States still outside the euro area will soon be part of European monetary union.
Although interest rate levels are at an historically low level in Europe, I find myself wondering, when I consider the European Central Bank's monetary policy, about the appropriateness of those rates, given our failure to achieve our growth potential and the price stability guaranteed for the foreseeable future.
That is why I ask myself if our monetary policy strategy is the optimum one.
The bank itself has of course investigated to what extent it can be satisfied with its own monetary policy strategy, and I do indeed see that as being very helpful.
However, we as politicians also need to consider at all times whether this monetary policy strategy is optimal not only in terms of monetary policy, but also as regards those aspects of macroeconomic policy that relate to the Lisbon objectives - growth, employment and social cohesion.
I know that does not make your job particularly easy, because there is also room for improvement in the coordination of economic, employment and finance policies.
Nevertheless, I wonder what scope there is for making a further contribution.
The definition of price stability now agreed upon, with a medium-term inflation rate target of under 2%, if only just, will help here.
But I still believe that our bank of issue has a more rigid definition of price stability than other internationally important central banks.
That is why we need constantly to reflect upon whether a certain change of course would not be appropriate.
I also believe that it is important for us consistently to consider inflation, deflation and how they are defined, especially in view of the risk of deflation.
Even during times of strong economic growth a symmetrical target of 2% with a range of plus or minus 1% should certainly be considered.
The ECB must not underestimate the importance of a strategy for low growth and increased employment in the euro area.
Although this is, of course the secondary rather than the primary objective, we still do not as yet have a clear definition.
It is apparent in the current economic situation that incentives for growth are urgently needed and I wish to specifically welcome new investment initiatives and also the support of the European Investment Bank.
I view this initiative very much in the context of structural and fiscal reforms, but such reforms alone will not enable us to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
That is why I believe this to be so important.
You will not be surprised if I refer once again to transparency of monetary policy, because this House has made its views on this very clear over the years.
I still cannot see how it would jeopardise the effectiveness of the bank if summary minutes were to be published.
Nor do I see how it would put the ECB or its independence at risk if the result of weighted votes were to be published without naming names.
To my way of thinking, it would result in greater clarity, more information and it would avoid false reporting.
I have in mind your last press conference and the way it was reported in the British press, which led to much speculation and aggravation on the markets.
We could do something to change that.
Greater transparency prevents inaccurate assessments, which in turn lead to bad investments - something we all wish to avoid.
That is why I think it is important to do still more in this area.
There is also scope for gaining greater public acceptance for the euro, for example by abolishing the 500-euro note or by printing a 1-euro note.
After all, there is a 1-dollar note!
(Applause)
Mr President, President Duisenberg, Commissioner, rapporteur - I congratulate you on a good report - I would like to use this minute and a half to make a few brief points about President Duisenberg's management of the European Central Bank.
I believe the Bank has been distinguished not so much by the successful operation of introducing the euro as by the line he established on monetary policy.
Over the past few years, he has played a courageous, effective part in safeguarding the independence of monetary policy as a whole as well as that of the Central Bank against repeated attempts on the part of governments and many sections of public opinion to bend monetary policy to the short-term needs of a policy which has been unable to create the necessary conditions for success and economic growth in Europe.
This morning, President Duisenberg said: 'I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms'.
I hope that, despite the fact that they will be taking over in a climate and a situation in which we would prefer the procedures to be clearer and more transparent, his successor too will be able to focus consistently on the need for structural reform, on the need to safeguard the Stability Pact: this is the way to protect the future generations of Europeans, citizens and taxpayers.
Lastly, President Duisenberg, best wishes for your birthday in a few days' time. For the sake of all of us in Parliament, all of us European citizens, I hope that President Duisenberg's successor will be able to do as good a job as he has.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Solbes Mira recently said, quite rightly, that economic growth is Europe's great weakness.
I would like to add that budget deficits in Europe are another great weakness.
Worse still, it is precisely the biggest countries that have allowed these large deficits to build up.
However, in view of this it is also important to emphasise that this does not apply to all the EU Member States. There are in all seven countries in the European Union that either have a balanced budget, or, as in the case of Sweden, Denmark and Finland, have a budget surplus.
So it is not acceptable for people constantly to talk about the 15 Member States of the EU as if the same problems applied to all of them.
No, they are very different, and I believe that is something we need to spell out very clearly.
There is also another factor here: there are countries that are not complying with the 3% criterion in the Stability Pact, especially of course France, Portugal and Germany.
When I look at the Stability Pact I can only say that there is perhaps still a little glimmer of hope that it will survive.
When you consider the debate going on in Germany, for example, and the fact that fiscal reform is not supposed to be counter-financed by cutting subsidies, then it is evident that Germany will be in breach of the pact for years to come.
We do not therefore consider it acceptable for Europe's major economies to fail to implement the necessary structural reforms and thus fail to sort out their budgets.
Both the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly observed that it is precisely these countries that need to carry out structural reform in health services, for example, or in other areas across the whole range of social provision, because there are latent budgetary risks in these areas.
This needs to be tackled once and for all.
I think it is fair to say that Mr Duisenberg put his stamp on the European Central Bank in the early years, when it was on the way to independence.
This became apparent during the great many dialogues that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and for that, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you personally.
It is vital that we should continue to prevent the bank from being politicised, so that the dialogue with Parliament should be about providing information and not justifications.
That needs to be emphasised too.
I believe that Mr Duisenberg himself has done a great deal to safeguard that independence.
I would like to make one last point. Europe needs to be extremely flexible - we need flexible arrangements.
But we do not want flexibility when it comes to Europe's Stability Pact.
That is something I feel very strongly about.
Mr President, the good name that the European Central Bank (ECB)'s mandate under Mr Duisenberg's Presidency has earned itself is widely acknowledged, and the conviction with which this institution defends its monetary policy is admirable: it considers that policy to be best suited to revitalising the European economy in the short term.
The recent changes to the Bank's monetary strategy are, furthermore, uniformly described as very positive. They are believed to constitute real progress.
Indisputably, however, there is no sign of a European economic recovery in the immediate future.
Moreover, all the political changes undertaken have been anticipated by the markets and diverted towards uses and balances which can contribute little towards that recovery in the short term.
In fact, it is predicted that Europe's gross domestic product (GDP) growth will reach around 0.7% in 2003, and that Europe's GDP will increase by only 1.6% in 2004.
At a stroke, in other words, the ECB is cutting a slice out of its growth predictions equivalent to about 0.9% of GDP in 2003, and 0.8% in 2004.
Faced with the false dilemma of 'growth or stability', the ECB cannot be content with its primary institutional strategy, price stability, and disregard the weaknesses and contradictions of those of its policies directed at other targets, such as economic growth and employment.
Furthermore, national governments, the Commission and the Council cannot, for their part, be satisfied with the low initial level of coordination between their economic policies, or with the merely advisory nature of their general economic policy guidelines.
To return to the Bank, there are also good reasons for believing that mistakes were made in setting the point of departure for monetary policy levels (an inflation rate of 2%) and that these are not in line with the potential growth of the European economy.
The European Central Bank must, therefore, help to find answers and solutions for the following fundamental questions: have the structural reforms carried out in most European economies been sufficient?
If not, what additional contribution can monetary and fiscal policies make to the fight against the current situation of economic stagnation?
Are the current monetary policy restrictions and the financial constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, which the ECB has supported, compatible with the much-needed reform of the European social model, without calling into question its essence and the distinctive role it plays in the context of European development policy?
Is the current appreciation of the euro entirely in step with the foundations of the European economy? Is it, moreover, a proactive aid to economic recovery, or could it, on the contrary, set off a severe deflationary trend?
What contribution can the ECB make to overcome the lack of structural reforms necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy?
Can those objectives be attained within the time limits initially set, given the monetary and fiscal policies which have been developed and the apparent preference of Member States for a minimal level of economic coordination?
Faced with this economic crisis, the level of responsibility taken by the ECB and the active cooperation needed to weather the storm depend on finding a balance between the various options, and on the effectiveness of the solutions found for the problems that I have just described.
Whilst acknowledging the positive balance-sheet of the Bank's activities, which the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, does, the European Parliament should, in line with its duties and competences, draw attention to those problems that do exist and urge all the institutions to overcome them.
) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Duisenberg, I would, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, like to thank you very sincerely for your work as the first President of the European Central Bank.
On behalf of my group I would like to say that you were the right man at the right time.
You have not only shaped the image of the European Central Bank through your appearance; you have also shaped it by the sheer force of your personality.
I myself have a three-year-old son and I therefore know how important, how eventful and how demanding the almost daily surprises of the early years of a child's life are.
The early years of the European Central Bank's life have been successful ones and you have shouldered your specific responsibilities to our full satisfaction during those first few years.
The introduction of the euro and the introduction of the euro notes and coins went smoothly.
The ECB has made its mark as an independent European international bank.
With a steady hand, you calmly steered our monetary policy on a successful course on the basis of the ECB Statute, building up confidence without being swayed by short-term populism, opportunism and carping.
You demonstrated that for you the long haul was more important than short-term image building.
You also once again sounded a note of warning today when assessing the report.
Those who deliver such warnings need credibility and integrity, and you possess both those qualities.
You have reminded us again today that despite the successes of the European Central Bank, a great many tasks have been agreed as regards the economic policies of the Member States, and as regards our own work, which have not yet been completed.
You also reminded us that structural reforms need to be given high priority in Europe's economic policy, because they underpin stability and growth; that fiscal policy needs to provide a stimulus and must be pursued; and that the Stability and Growth Pact should not be constantly called into question but must flank the ECB Statute by providing the necessary basis for a successful policy of stability and growth.
You have once again reminded us that monetary policy can be no substitute for economic and cyclical policy and a corresponding structure, and our priorities must be adjusted accordingly.
Through your work and that of your colleagues in the ECB, you have averted a number of monetary crises - we only have to think of 11 September and of the Asian and Russian crises.
You have made an excellent job of preparing Europe and the ECB for enlargement, and we have also moved closer together, although there were often times when a little more communication and transparency would have been welcome.
Nevertheless, our relationship has become a more open one.
I would like to conclude by saying that as far as I am concerned, I would have been pleased to see you stay for the entire period of office!
Many thanks for your work.
Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my own thanks to those already expressed to Mr Duisenberg, because, with the support of your colleagues and your committees, he has, over the last few years, managed the introduction of the euro in a way that has won growing support from the public.
My sincere thanks to you for that, Mr Duisenberg.
I have always admired the open and fair way in which you have discussed matters with us here in Parliament.
The arguments we have heard in several speeches today are the same ones that have cropped up again and again in recent years.
I have in mind in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, who asserted once again today that monetary policy can solve Europe's problems.
She is mistaken.
Structural and fiscal reforms alone cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives.
In fact, the reverse is true.
Even with a good monetary policy, the Lisbon objectives will not be achievable without structural reforms in the EU Member States.
Mrs Randzio-Plath, we have two responsible experts in monetary policy with us today; Mr Duisenberg, for whom I have the highest esteem, and Mr Solbes Mira, whom I also regard very highly.
Both of them have their roots in social democracy and are not prepared to accept your proposals.
I would also like to express my sincere thanks for the consistent and reliable monetary policy that has prevailed over the last few years.
That is, however, not the only subject we should mention in relation to the annual report, which is presumably the last one for which Mr Duisenberg will be responsible.
The latest annual report - of which you can be proud, Mr Duisenberg - refers to the euro's position on the world stage, which it has earned.
The euro has now returned to its previous strength; we have overcome the crises involving the euro.
We have not put a foot wrong over the last few years.
We have also once again heard that old story about the need for us to have immediate information about the internal decision-making processes of the ECB's committees.
I think that is a mistake too.
It is precisely this cautious assessment process that has guaranteed the internal stability of the euro in recent years while at the same time enhancing its external stability.
That is why it is also my belief that Mr Duisenberg's well-earned retirement and the appointment of his successor should not involve an arbitrary change in the European Central Bank's strategy.
You have already changed the inflation range.
It was the right decision not just to aim for the lowest possible inflation target, but to bunch it around 2%.
We have heard bellyaching from the left of this House that there is a risk of inflation.
That is pure nonsense!
The totally normal adjustment of prices and of competitiveness in the euro area has led to varying inflation rates.
The same applies to growth rates as well, of course.
That is the responsibility of the Member States and that is how things should remain in future.
That is why I am pleased that you have adopted this strategy in this way.
It is not the European Central Bank that is responsible for growth in Europe - in any case there are not many further options available in terms of monetary policy. It is the leaders of the governments, of the majority parties, in the three major Member States: Germany, France and Italy.
Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, Prime Minister Raffarin and Prime Minister Berlusconi need to carry out structural reforms.
That needs to be our starting point, regardless of the basic political direction.
In the long run, it is only by consistently adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact that we will be able to keep the euro internally and externally stable.
On that note, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation, which has been based on trust, and for your successful period of office, and to wish you all the very best for the future.
. Mr President, first of all let me thank all the Members that have spoken for their good wishes and in particular for their encouragement to the ECB to strictly adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact.
One has to realise that the Stability and Growth Pact is a very welcome additional element in forging our monetary policy.
However, the ECB is not the guardian of the Stablility and Growth Pact; that is the European Commission.
I can assure you, however, that the ECB has been and always will be squarely behind the European Commission in its endeavours to live up to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Mr Andria has referred to the position of the ECB and the ESCB as mentioned in Article 29 of the draft Constitution of the Convention, which will be under discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference as from the middle of October.
May I add one remark?
In general the ECB welcomes the draft Constitution in so far as its position is concerned.
However, we have one overriding wish for change, concerning the fact that in the current Treaty and in the draft Constitution, the term European System of Central Banks is interpreted with some ambiguity.
Sometimes it is to be understood that it refers to the total of all the central banks participating in the European System of Central Banks. Sometimes it is understood as comprising only the ECB itself and the participating national central banks.
We have pleaded for the inclusion of a reference somewhere to the core concept of Europe's system of central banks, that is, the Eurosystem.
It is the ECB that is the hub, the participating national central banks are the spokes; together they form the central banking system of Europe.
We will, when we are asked for an opinion, and we have to be asked for our opinion, urge the Intergovernmental Conference to make a reference somewhere in the text to this concept of the Eurosystem, which is the central bank of the European people, something which up until now has not been mentioned, either in the current Treaty or in the draft Constitution.
Various speakers Mrs Randzio-Plath and also others have expressed some doubts as to whether the current monetary policy stance is optimal.
The last speaker, Mr Langen, even referred to statements made in recent days by some heads of government Mr Schroeder, Mr Raffarin, and Mr Berlusconi calling on the ECB to do more to promote growth in the current circumstances.
Let me be crystal clear on that.
The current monetary policy stance, in the eyes of the Governing Council, with interest rates at 2%, is regarded as being appropriate in the light of the developments we foresee for the medium-term future.
We expect inflation for the remaining months of this year to hover around this level of 2%, then early next year, mainly due to base effects, to fall significantly below the 2% limit and then, later on next year and in 2005, to climb back somewhat in a direction that will bring it close to 2%.
That is our aim.
Given this monetary policy stance, which is regarded as appropriate in the light of analysis of the future, in so far as we can make it, one can conclude that monetary policy has played its part in creating the conditions for a resumption of economic growth and growth of employment in the euro area.
We have played our part and it is now the case that governments maybe I sound a little sharp can no longer hide behind the ECB to try to cover up their failure to enact the structural reforms which are so urgently required for Europe.
Is the definition of price stability too rigid?
I do not believe so.
We recently clarified our definition and our strategy.
We are striving for a rate of inflation of below 2% but also close to 2%.
That should be a guarantee to the European people that we are on our guard, not only to fight inflation, but also to fight deflation if it were to emerge.
Let me answer another question clearly.
Mr Santos wondered whether there was a danger that the appreciation of the euro might lead us into a deflationary environment.
The answer is that we do not see that.
We do not expect deflation, not in Europe and not in individual component parts of the euro area.
Deflation is not around the corner.
That is clear.
Is the definition too rigid?
Let me speak anecdotally.
We define our price stability as a rate of inflation of no more than 2%.
Let me remind you and give an example.
The Bank of England has inflation targeting, and the Chancellor imposes a target on the Bank of England of 2.5% inflation, 2.5% inflation as measured by the retail price index.
Now the Chancellor has announced that probably in September, when he presents his mid-year budget, he will change the definition of the price index into the European one the harmonised index of consumer price inflation.
When he does so, the implication is that the 2.5% in England will translate into less than 2% probably between 1.75% and 2% in terms of the harmonised index of consumer prices.
On publishing the minutes and being more transparent, I truly believe that there is no central bank in the world which is as transparent about its monetary policy decisions and the backgrounds and analyses leading up to decisions as the European Central Bank.
About an hour after a decision has been taken, we hold a press conference and give all the necessary background and explanations which led us to take that decision and subsequently, in a question-and-answer session, we answer all the questions relating to it.
Some say that if the minutes of those meetings were published there would be less confusion.
May I refer to the decision taken last week by the Federal Reserve System, which immediately produced a press communiquÃ© giving the decisions and stating how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee had voted.
You all know now that has created more confusion than transparency in the markets.
Mr President, I have answered the most pressing questions.
I would like to thank the Members once again for their good wishes, both for the past and for my future.
I should like to say to Mr Karas, who has a three-year-old son, that I have eight grandchildren of about the same age.
They saw me recently on a television programme for children explaining the functioning of the euro and its intricacies.
They called me after the television interview and I asked them if they had understood what I said.
Their answer was: 'Why?
What's so special about the euro?
We don't know anything else!
What was there to explain?'
I regard that as one of the greatest successes of the introduction of the euro, that at least for my grandchildren it is nothing special any more.
It is simply their money.
(Applause)
Colleagues, we have had a rather historic debate on the Blokland report this morning, which has turned out to be a tribute to Mr Duisenberg and all he has done on behalf of the European people.
Mr Duisenberg, I think you will recognise that you take the goodwill of this House with you for your future, and that as representatives of the people we speak for the European citizens.
You have brought a huge measure of stability and firm management to the European Central Bank, and you have set it on a good course for the future.
We are deeply grateful to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0169/2003) by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the international role of the euro zone and the first assessment of the introduction of banknotes and coins (COM(2002) 747 - 2002/2259(INI)).
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I have the honour of representing, could not have come at a more appropriate time.
This report is based on the one drawn up by the European Commission, assessing the first four years of the euro and also, as has been pointed out, on another report on the use of euro notes and coins.
The euro has been introduced in a very short time, but has proven its solidity and stability.
The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Duisenberg, must be congratulated on the euro's sound management and we must thank him, in his last appearance in plenary, and extend our best wishes for the future, hoping that he enjoys them in the company of his grandchildren, who have only known the euro as the single currency.
The introduction of the euro, its increasing acceptance and its appreciation towards the dollar, inevitably lead us to consider its role at international level, which is the main theme of the report.
At the Thessaloniki European Council, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, stated that working on the external representation of the euro is absolutely crucial.
The report attempts to respond to this need articulated by President Prodi, and proposes principally that the euro should have a single representation in the international financial institutions, and also that this representation should be enhanced at international level.
The report does not go further, because we believe that there must be a broad consensus and, obviously, the relevant arrangements in line with this principle must be studied and adopted in the appropriate international forums.
There is a suggestion, however, made by Mrs Peijs, to be specific, before her appointment as minister in the new Dutch government, which is to use the type of post that has already been adopted and proposed by the European Convention, of a European Minister for External Affairs.
The same could apply to a Minister for European Economic and Monetary Affairs who would, at international level, represent the euro on the basis of a formula contained in a proposal from Ecofin, which the Commission has obviously accepted.
This 'Mr Euro' or 'Ms Euro' would also hold the post of Vice-President of the European Commission.
I repeat that this is a suggestion, for a post that has already been adopted and proposed in the Convention, and which appears to be accepted at political level, even by the European Council itself and we therefore believe it to be a valid alternative.
In an article that appeared recently in the Financial Times, Martin Wolf said that the Eurozone will very soon be larger than the dollar zone and attributes this to the credibility and soundness of the economy and of the economies that are joining the Eurozone.
Obviously, this solidity and credibility are the result of complying with the stability and growth pacts, which it is absolutely crucial to pursue and abide by.
We refer to this aspect - compliance with and the need to comply with the stability and growth pacts - as a component and guarantee of the euro's soundness, credibility and stability, and we study, as one would expect, the use of the euro at international level in various fields and, in particular, on the international financial markets, and its use by our new neighbours, including Russia and the Baltic States.
We also refer to the euro's potential for ensuring greater stability in the supply of raw materials which are extremely important, because of their dependence on the European economy.
We believe that energy supply should be paid for in euros.
We also refer to the growing number of central banks around the world that are increasing their euro reserves.
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I shall simply recall that in the report we also study some suggestions and propose a study to be undertaken by the European Central Bank and the central banks that are members of the euro zone, on some aspects of the use of notes and coins, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has already referred.
. (ES) Madam President, I wish to thank Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm for his presentation and for his interesting report, since I share his point of view hailing the creation of the euro as a great success.
I wish to focus my comments on two fundamental points made in this report. One of them concerns economic policies, while the other relates to problems of an institutional nature, to which he has paid rather more attention.
With regard to economic policies, at Thessaloniki the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines were adopted and we hope the Ecofin Council will formally adopt these at its next meeting.
The guidelines maintain the tone set by the Commission, including some of the comments made by this Parliament in the report presented by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil.
In general terms, the proposal ratifies the broad lines on which we are all working: sound macroeconomic policies, which are crucial to increasing demand, growth and employment and to increasing the potential for growth, on the basis of the Lisbon conclusions.
This implies a need to press ahead with policies of modernisation and structural change, and our main challenge at the moment is to set up and implement these policies.
That is where I believe Parliament must play a crucial role, in this aspect of implementing policies, through its dialogue with the citizens and with the national Parliaments.
As to economic governance, I wish to make two comments; firstly, the Eurogroup has played and continues to play a fundamental role.
In our opinion, the recognition of its role in the Constitution should be welcomed, since this maintains its informal character.
Nevertheless, the Commission regrets the fact that the idea of creating an Ecofin Council for the Eurozone has not been accepted.
We believe that there is a whole set of formal decisions that must be adopted publicly by the countries of the Eurozone and that the existence of the Eurogroup is nevertheless not sufficient to resolve these problems.
We welcome the fact that some progress has been made in the decisions that the Eurozone countries are to adopt, including in the framework of the current Ecofin. There are, however, some requests made by the Commission that have not been accepted and we do not believe that this will help the system to function more smoothly.
Decisions such as those on the excess deficit procedure, the procedure of multilateral vigilance in the Eurozone or on the entry of Member States to the Eurozone should, in our opinion, be adopted, not by the Council in plenary, but by the Council that deals with the Eurozone.
This point will continue to be debated and I hope that we can make progress in this area.
I wish to make a final comment on the issue of external representation.
At the Thessaloniki European Council, as Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm has just said, emphasis was given to the importance of increasing the Union's ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system.
The need to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation and economic interdependence was also underlined.
The effective and coherent representation of the Eurozone in this way is crucial.
Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that beyond raising the issue, little progress has been made on external representation.
In recent years, the progress that has been made has basically been better advance coordination of strategic positions at international meetings, which has enabled us in several cases to put forward joint proposals, but not one common proposal.
We must make more progress in this direction.
I take note of your suggestion, which is not far-removed from another suggestion the Commission made to the Convention.
We must be aware, however, of the technical, legal and institutional difficulties that the issue entails and in light of these, I believe it is crucial to demonstrate enormous political sensitivity, in order clearly to define what we want to achieve in future.
For this reason, we in the Commission will continue to work with the Convention, trying, in the corrections to the final texts, in the part which is still being debated, to clarify some points.
In any event, at the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission will attempt to put forward a vision that is more ambitious and even innovative, which will enable us to consolidate effective external representation of the Eurozone.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur not only for his work, but also for his willingness to enter into an open dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups.
This debate is a seamless continuation of the previous one.
I believe that we should view all the arguments as a whole and not as an alternative to the report of the European Central Bank.
Right at the beginning of his explanatory statement, the rapporteur wrote the following: 'Since its more than four years of existence, the euro has become the world's second leading currency'.
The first reason, he says, is the size of the euro area economy, which accounts for around 16% of world GDP, in comparison with the United States' 21% and Japan's 8%.
The second reason he refers to is the stability and growth orientation and economic and monetary union.
Whilst his reasons are sound, these are of course also areas that we need to approach with great caution.
The euro area is growing.
Since its inception we have already gained an additional member, Greece, and we must do our utmost to ensure that the Member States of the European Union are not divided into a eurozone and a non-eurozone, because the euro can make the single market our home market, and because we must do everything to strengthen the single market, to be better able to influence global political events and thus to increase the benefit to the Member States.
This involves the new Member States meeting the Maastricht criteria, it involves strengthening the euro area, and it also involves adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and the communitarisation of national economic policies.
It must be our objective for all the Member States of the European Union also to be members of the euro area, because only then can we fully exploit the potential of the single market and the single currency.
However, this political objective presupposes political will on the part of the Member States and compliance with the criteria.
In Paragraph 11 we have very clearly spelt out what is necessary to achieve this, that is to say achieving the Lisbon strategy, promoting a culture of entrepreneurship, stronger small and medium-sized enterprises, creative and innovative fiscal reforms, with protectionism outlawed and research and development promoted.
If we can stick to what we have agreed we can then make the euro area even stronger, both internally and externally.
Madam President, as you all know, it is becoming the norm in this Parliament to start speeches with a phrase which, as a result of being repeated so often, has become a commonplace.
This phrase consists of congratulating the rapporteur on the report they have drawn up.
I would not like my congratulations to Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, in this case, to imply that I am simply observing a Parliamentary formality.
I wish to congratulate Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm in particular, not only on the content of his report but also, above all, on his good choice of issues.
Parliaments sometimes earn prestige not only by what is said within their walls but also by their choice of issues for debate: if these are topical and affect the citizens, they serve to bring the citizens and their political representatives closer together.
Like Mr Karas, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his flexibility towards the positions of the other groups.
The introduction of the euro is one of the most significant milestones in the process of European integration.
Having a single currency represents a huge step towards achieving European unity, not only in economic terms, but also, I would say, in political terms.
The Eurosceptics are right to fear the single currency, because no one can question the fact that participating in a common currency involves the greatest possible degree of integration.
We should not, therefore, think that the introduction of the euro has been important only in the economic field.
It is true that the euro has enjoyed considerable success in the field of foreign trade: around one third of trade with third countries takes place in this currency.
Furthermore, as we Europeans continue to use the same currency, we will start to feel more united with one another.
For this very reason, it is the political and human dimension of the euro's introduction that we should be worrying about - the 'micro' effects of the new currency.
Concern about these effects, which citizens sometimes see as negative, obliges us to remedy them, inasmuch as we can, or, when this perception is not borne out by objective causes, to try to convince the public that its opinion does not match the reality.
This success cannot conceal the fact that there have been problems in introducing new notes and coins. Blame for this must be laid at the door of the Commission, the governments and European Central Bank; there may still be some issues that make citizens feel that some problems are the result of the euro's introduction.
The success of the euro's introduction cannot conceal some of its effects, which have damaged public opinion.
In this context, the citizens' perception is perhaps that the euro has played a major role in increasing inflation and in raising prices.
The reality, however, is that, according to objective data, the euro has had much less influence than the citizens perceive to be the case. There is some basis for this perception because the so-called 'rounding-up effect' has had a fundamental impact on consumers' shopping baskets and other essential goods, and on certain services.
The necessary steps must, therefore, be taken to prevent this perception, which can have such damaging effects.
Finally, the last thing I would wish to do is interfere in the internal debate of those countries that have not yet decided whether to join the Eurozone.
I must remain on the sidelines of this internal debate but whilst remaining on the sidelines, I can still express the desire for them to join our common currency zone as soon as possible.
Madam President, many thanks to my colleague, Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, for an excellent report which will be of great help in the ongoing referendum campaign in my country.
Clearly, the introduction of the euro has been very successful.
We have finally obtained a practical common European symbol.
The euro is already the world's second largest currency.
It has strengthened European identity and bound the twelve countries together.
Even if economic development is shaky, the euro has already shown positive economic advantages, strengthened trade and increased investments for the eurozone countries.
One of the aspects, which was also addressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster and which has been discussed in connection with the introduction of the euro, is that of whether there have been price rises and, if so, unfair ones.
Eurostat's statistics clearly show that there was a very small, one-off effect of between 0.1 and 0.2% upon the introduction of the euro.
Within some sectors of the economy, or in certain industries, there were, however, significant price rises, particularly in certain countries.
The overall effect for those inhabiting the eurozone has, however, been very small.
It is good that we should now take up this issue and ask the Commission to investigate it further.
One thing we have found is that pro-active consumers and two-currency price labelling have prevented underhand price rises.
Let us not, however, be deceived into thinking that the price rises were higher than they in actual fact were, and let us not make use of that argument in debates, either.
The big advantage of the euro is, however, that it has provided economic stability in politically and economically very difficult times.
In spite of great unrest in the world, partly due to the Iraq war, European currencies have not tossed around on a stormy monetary sea, as in actual fact happened in the nineties.
The euro has provided stability and security.
That is a fact that should be mentioned more often.
This should be emphasised in the discussion of the euro's advantages and disadvantages, particularly in those EU countries that at present enjoy the stability of the euro without participating fully in the cooperation and so without accepting full responsibility, either.
Madam President, we can all measure the positive economic impact of the birth of the euro, and I am thinking in particular of the general easing of interest rates and the abolition of risk premiums, from which all European countries are benefiting.
However, we can also see the limits to these benefits: the short-lived expansion phase from 1997 to 2000 and the current economic stagnation.
It was Jacques Delors who said that the euro was not enough.
He asked for strong coordination of economic policies.
We have not yet achieved this, and we are now desperately in need of a European economic policy.
I approve of Mr GasÃ²liba's report, which is a move in this direction, and which expresses the desire for, among other things, the development of public and private investment, of human capital, of research, and of the mobility and qualifications of workers.
The Convention should have drawn up the tools to achieve these objectives.
It has not done so and that is one of its great failings.
We have not really been able to construct the euro group within the framework of the work of the Convention.
Even though Member States could, as they say, take additional measures in terms of major economicpolicies, they have neither the fiscal nor the budgetary means to do so.
I would add that the monetary policy which was mentioned just now, and about which complimentary words were spoken, neither anticipated nor understood the reversal in the world economy and was very late in reacting to it, which demonstrates the difficulty that we have in imagining our position within the world as a whole.
It is all very well to talk of structural reforms - and these are certainly essential - but, as Mr Delors also said, competition is not enough: we must build up cooperation and solidarity between us if we want to have a successful economy and play a role in the governance of the world economy.
Without this willingness and these concepts, let us at least work towards institutional reforms, let us try to equip ourselves with institutional tools.
You have proposed a single representation of the euro zone, and have aired the idea of a minister for economic affairs who would play a role that was at once both internal and external and who would operate as part of the Commission.
Obviously I can only support these proposals, which are a step in the right direction.
Madam President, I am not going to paraphrase here the technically excellent report of my fellow countryman Mr GasÃ²liba; I do not have the time in which to do so.
On a political level, as a federalist and a supporter of Catalan independence, I ought to be pleased at the relative success of the euro.
For Europeans, the euro reinforces the evidence of the process of integration of which it is the symbol.
For Catalans, whether French or Spanish, it means that we once again have a common currency, which has not been the case since the disastrous Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.
I have to admit that I am not entirely happy, however, first of all because this common currency is not as common as all that.
Some people do not have any of it, or at least not enough of it.
For instance, in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, some 5% of families are living in a situation of extreme poverty, in other words with an income of less than EUR 240 per person per month.
Secondly, I am not entirely happy because I would like Europe to have a stronger and more human symbol of unity than a unit of currency.
In celebrating the euro, are we not rather like the chosen people who, forgetting their destiny, began to worship the golden calf?
This earth, which has been so copiously watered with the blood and tears of our fratricidal wars, so distressingly covered with the ashes of our tragic genocides, deserves, I believe, stronger and less abstract signs of its humanity and its unity.
Madam President, I feel it is genuinely important for Parliament to start carrying out an initial evaluation of the introduction of the euro today, a year and a half after its launch in the European market.
The introduction of the euro has, without a doubt, been an extremely valuable development, and not just in economic and financial terms.
It is worth pointing out once again that the euro area is the second largest economic area in the world.
However, the single currency has also contributed to a small revolution in terms of culture and identity, so to speak.
Indeed, the circulation and use of the single currency have given consumers something practical in common and have thus helped them to feel more like European citizens for the first time.
Nevertheless, these same citizens, who exceeded all expectations and sailed through the transition from individual national currencies to the European single currency, are now demanding that the Community institutions carry out careful surveillance to prevent unjustified - and, in many cases, very substantial - increases in the price of both goods and services.
Above all, as has been pointed out in the report too, these citizens are calling upon us to introduce minor measures in the future, effective, practical measures which will make their everyday lives easier.
In particular, the citizens are calling upon us to introduce EUR 1 banknotes or even, in some cases, 50-cent banknotes, as well as for greater availability of low-value notes, especially in cash machines.
I believe that these demands are absolutely legitimate and very reasonable too.
I also believe that it is genuinely important that Parliament makes every effort to persuade the relevant Community institutions to comply with the demands of the European citizens, which, although small, are extremely important.
Madam President, the GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm report draws up a positive balance sheet for the operation of the euro zone since 1999, highlighting many advantages but only rare and hypothetical disadvantages.
Nevertheless, we can be a little more precise than that: the real advantages exist and have, moreover, been known from the beginning. For example, the disappearance of fluctuations in exchange rates between countries in the euro zone, which has no doubt saved us from a few crises in recent months.
Nevertheless, the disadvantages exist too.
These can be found, in particular, in a growth rate that has halved and an unemployment rate that has doubled in the euro zone compared with the non-euro zone.
No doubt there are several reasons for this difference, but one of those reasons is very definitely the inflexibility resulting from uniform interest rates and exchange rates, when these are applied to economies whose needs remain very different.
Another disadvantage, which rarely occurs, is the lack of incentive for structural reforms, which is the result of making responsibilities mutual.
Previously, poor national management could cause a monetary crisis, which would require corrective measures.
Now, the responsibilities of saint and sinner countries are blurred, thanks to the single currency, so that certain parties can put off reforms as long as the euro still has credit.
Admittedly the plan was that the disappearance of the disciplines of the exchange market would be compensated for by the disciplines of the stability pact, but it has now been proved that these administrative disciplines are not enough to replace those of the market.
As for the strengthening of overall economic coordination and a European budget drawn up in accordance with federal principles, which the report calls for, we must not count on these too much in the immediate future, as is shown by the somewhat unsatisfactory results obtained on this chapter in the Convention.
Moreover, it would not be in accordance with what was agreed at Maastricht.
In other words, Madam President, the ship of the euro zone is afloat, but it cannot be piloted, and no one knows where it is heading.
I hope it is not heading towards a superstate.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is four and a half years since the European single currency, the euro, first saw the light of day with an exchange rate of 1.17 to the dollar, which was, at that time, intended to adequately reflect price levels on the two sides of the Atlantic.
Since then, as we know, the euro's exchange rate has followed a roller coaster course.
At present, it has returned to its starting point.
But, basically speaking, we Europeans should not be too concerned about the euro exchange rate, because no one can explain or even predict short-term exchange rate fluctuations between one day and six months.
We should instead be focussing on economic problems, which are more important, and leave exchange rate trends to the foreign currency markets.
Even if public acceptance of the euro has increased, the most recent polls carried out by opinion research organisations indicate, for example, that in many Germans' thinking, the Deutschmark is still very much alive.
That this should be so was, however, totally predictable and should by no means be seen in a negative light.
The increasing public acceptance of the euro is a gradual process and can in no way diminish the impact of this key event in monetary policy in the history of the continent of Europe.
As far as withdrawals from cash machines are concerned, I support the rapporteur's view that we need more smaller-denomination banknotes, that is, 5-euro and 10-euro notes.
I am, however, rather more critical about the idea of setting up a working party to investigate the need for a 1-euro banknote.
The most recent opinion polls confirm that in Germany at least there is widespread opposition to this idea.
There, for example, 79% of the population clearly rejects this low denomination note, with only 16% in favour of introducing it.
Even if opinion polls are not the be-all and end-all, this result nevertheless seems to clearly confirm that the public, at least in Germany, does not see any need for such a note.
In short, the answer to the question 'Do we need a 1 euro note alongside the 1 euro coin?' is very definitely 'no'.
The euro denominations currently in circulation are fine.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to devote my speech to payments within the euro zone.
The introduction of the single currency was a huge success, but although the new notes and coins have brought with them widespread satisfaction, the same cannot be said of the processing of payments in the euro zone.
The euro has actually been our currency since 1999.
For four and a half years the euro has been the currency of 11 Member States, whose national currencies became nothing more than submultiples still in circulation.
Throughout this period, however, the European banking system persistently refused to recognise this new state of affairs.
There were 12 countries with the same currency, but the banks carried on operating as if each country in the zone were financially autonomous.
The euro payment zone did not really exist.
It was not until a year ago that electronic banking cards could be used all over the euro zone as well as in the countries in which they were actually issued. It was not until this week, moreover, that it became possible to carry out bank transfers under the same conditions as those that apply within each Member State.
Furthermore, while this is an extremely beneficial step for citizens and for small and medium-sized enterprises trading in the euro zone, the limit of EUR 12 500 per transaction is ridiculous and unjustifiable.
Since the technical infrastructure allowing single-currency transfers from one country to another is in place, and since the cost is negligible, this being a virtual transaction processed by computers, why has such a low limit been set?
A EUR 12 500 transaction costs the same as a EUR 50 000 transaction (which will be allowed from 2006), or a transaction of EUR 100 000 or more.
I would go as far as to say that forcing a company to perform 10 small transactions of EUR 12 500 in order to make up one payment of EUR 125 000 only serves to increase costs for companies and banks.
To conclude, I will state my conviction that the euro zone must be made to work effectively by reducing banking commissions to the rates charged at national level.
Do not forget that the euro zone is our country where currency is concerned.
What does the Commission plan to do to improve the processing of payments in the euro zone?
Madam President, there is a lot in this discussion with which I can agree.
The euro is not only a means of payment. Instead, it is part of an economic policy and an important key element of EMU policy.
If the euro is to function, a lot of things are clearly required.
Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm indicated a number of them in his report, and other factors were also addressed in the debate.
Much more harmonisation and coordination of economic policy is required.
Mr GasÃ²liba I BÃ¶hm goes so far as to talk about federal budgetary principles.
What is required is coordination on tax policy, a structural policy and greater mobility for the European labour force.
In short, a range of measures may be taken to reduce the large differences that exist between national economies.
For example, it would be possible for Ireland and Germany to have the same policy - two countries that, at present, quite clearly have a need for different policy approaches.
Mr GasÃ²liba I BÃ¶hm talks about the need for institutions.
If the matter were to be summarised, there could even perhaps be talk of the need for a European state power in the economic sphere.
He proposes having an economics tsar when it comes to the eurozone's relations with the surrounding world.
It is precisely all this that gives rise to such a lot of scepticism towards the euro project in my own country of Sweden.
We fear it would mean the small economies being integrated into a European economy in such a way that they would be unable themselves to exercise control and that would not offer any democratic guarantees, either.
There is therefore considerable hesitation, and more than half of the Swedish population will presumably vote 'no' in the forthcoming referendum.
That is also why the Swedish referendum will be followed with such great interest in the candidate countries.
So far, only 12 of what will soon be a total of 25 Member States are in the eurozone.
The 13 countries that are still outside it have obvious doubts.
People are aware of the ups and downs of the German debate and of the problems there are, and they think it is better to wait.
I appreciate, however, that there may one day be a need for lower denomination notes, especially if economic problems were to arise in Europe.
Madam President, I wish to thank Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm for an unusually interesting report.
In purely practical terms, it is now clear that the introduction of the euro has been extremely successful.
The latest Eurobarometer indicates that 75% of citizens in the eurozone countries are satisfied.
Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm certainly draws attention to a number of unnecessary price rises upon the actual transition to the euro but, overall, we now know that these were fairly modest and that they have since become less pronounced.
It is quite obvious that we can anticipate the eurozone in the future creating conditions for lower price rises, which is perhaps what is most important of all.
I nonetheless think that the most interesting thing about this report is the observation that the euro is in the process of becoming a world currency, together with the demands for a feasibility study designed further to strengthen that role, for we can see how the dollar even now dominates in the world at large.
In particular, international trade, especially in oil and other raw materials, has for a long time taken place in dollars.
Use of the euro and its importance as a currency are increasing all the time, however.
I believe that, in the future, the euro may very well be able to compete with the dollar as a world currency.
If we could achieve this, it would be important from both economic and political points of view.
There is a lot to be said, for example, for the possibility of one day fixing oil prices in euros.
I know that my colleague, Mr Goebbels, is among those who have addressed that idea in various reports.
It would be in the interests of the oil-producing Gulf States because more and more of these countries' goods are imported from the eurozone.
It would also, however, be in the interests of European consumers because the price fluctuations we have for oil and petrol, dependent upon the rate of the dollar, would disappear.
In my own country, Sweden, the debate is fully under way prior to the autumn referendum on introducing the euro.
I believe that the prospect of the euro, together with an enlarged EU and EMU, possibly offsetting US power and the dollar's world dominance is one of the most important factors that could make the Swedes vote yes in the referendum.
Thank you, Mr FÃ€rm.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The first conclusion to be drawn from the introduction of the euro is a considerable increase in the cost of the shopping basket of the housewife, who, Mr GasÃ²liba, contrary to what you have written, is far from being purely a psychological illusion, and whom I am not confusing with inflation.
One can also conclude that the euro, which is over-valued, is starting to amplify the difficulties of our economies, namely the sluggishness of growth and of internal demand, the handicapping of our exports, the threat of deflation, and a dogmatic stability pact which imposes a procyclical budgetary policy.
Who will dare to put a figure, in terms of jobs, on the cost of the single currency and the delays and excuses of the European Central Bank?
The United States, which serves as your model in so many fields, should also serve as a model in matters concerning economic and monetary policy.
The US Federal Reserve has other things on its mind than how to beat an inflation rate that is little more than 2%.
The United States preserves its growth, which is already considerably more dynamic than ours, by issuing dollars.
It uses them to finance not only its deficits but its wars as well, and it also uses them as the basis for its political domination.
Why should we not do the same with the euro?
The rapporteur states that the advantages of the single currency far outweigh its disadvantages.
That is merely a profession of faith, and the faith must be translated into reality.
The next item is the report (A5-0214/2003), by Mrs Ghilardotti, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on 'Gender budgeting - building public budgets from a gender perspective' (2002/2198(INI)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today slots perfectly into European policy on equal opportunities, which, as we know, has two basic branches: specific measures benefiting women and gender mainstreaming, or the incorporation of the perspective of gender equality into all stages and levels of public policy by all the actors involved in the decision-making process.
Gender budgeting is the application of the principle of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process. As we are all aware, budgets are not gender-neutral, but reflect the way in which power is distributed within society.
Whenever they define revenue and expenditure policies, public budgetary authorities at all levels are taking policy decisions.
Budgets are not merely economic tools but, in fact, key instruments with which political authorities shape a society's model of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution and prioritise the measures to be taken in respect of policies and the needs of their own citizens. The impact this has is not the same on men and women.
The way in which public budgets are normally drawn up tends to ignore the differences - in terms of roles and responsibilities - between men and women, and, in most cases, the indicators and data used fail to make any gender distinction. Although they are presented as neutral economic instruments, public budgets, in actual fact, reflect and thus reproduce the socio-economic disparities already present in the Community.
Analysing budgetary policies on the basis of the different impacts they have on men and women and adjusting them accordingly serves to ensure that public budgets meet appropriate criteria in terms of fairness and cost-effectiveness. In order to be not merely fair but also efficient, public spending must help to promote the development and exploit the potential of all sections of society.
It is therefore a matter of adopting an economic and social approach based on the principle that, even in an open and globalised market economy, economic and social development are considered inseparable and interconnected.
An economy cannot be competitive, dynamic and healthy in the long term unless the productive, commercial and financial processes are backed up by a stable, cohesive and fair society in which human rights, resources and capacities are properly developed.
The strengthening, modernisation and reorganisation of public intervention, and hence budgetary policies, with a view to social development are, in fact, an absolutely essential intangible investment in capacities, empowerment and new resources and opportunities for economies wishing to be dynamic and competitive through being knowledge-based, in accordance with the objective set by the European Council in Lisbon.
Although this is the first time that Parliament has discussed gender budgeting, it is by no means a new concept.
The Platform for Action drawn up at Beijing at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women specifically refers to it; an experts' working group has been set up within the Council of Europe's Directorate-General for Human Rights; the Commission itself, after the conference organised by the Belgian Presidency, set up a working group of experts; but, above all, numerous experiments have been carried out in Eastern countries, starting with Australia, which adopted this instrument - like many developing countries, moreover - as early as 1984, and there have been interesting experiments carried out within the European Union too for some years now at both national and local level.
What are the specific objectives of the report?
Firstly, raising awareness among the public and political and economic actors at all levels.
Disseminating information on the gender budgeting strategy and method among the institutions of the European Union and the Member States. Calling on the Commission, which has already expressed its support, to produce and distribute as widely as possible an information brochure on gender budgeting.
Involving the actors operating in the Community at all levels in the building of budgets. Most importantly, indicating an action framework for the implementation of gender budgeting, providing for bottom-up democratic participation and the involvement of organised individuals, NGOs and women's associations.
I will end, Madam President, with this point: wherever, especially at local level, experiments of this kind are already underway, they have also served to wipe away the indifference and detachment we see today at all levels in relationships between the citizens and the public authorities.
This is an instrument which brings great participation as well as great justice.
. (ES) Madam President, Mrs Ghilardotti has already referred to the importance of this issue, to its complexity, to the experiments that have already been conducted in countries such as Australia and South Africa and to the experiments that we have also started in the Union.
The Commission indeed first raised the issue at a technical seminar held in October 2001 and in 2002 the Consultative Committee on Equal Opportunities was instructed to look at current experiences and to study how Member States view the gender perspective and how they propose to integrate it into their budgets.
This committee delivered an opinion which is available to this Parliament, distributed by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Clearly, on the basis of this document, the committee is willing to draw up the pamphlet to which you referred and which could be useful in providing this information.
We now have some good practices in place in various fields, such as the European Employment Strategy, social protection, science and research and cooperation development and - perhaps the most interesting example - in the Structural Funds.
All of this demonstrates that gender equality is being addressed more effectively in the current programmes than in the previous period.
Clearly, much remains to be done, but we are continuing to make progress in this field.
The Commission Communication on integrating gender equality into the programming documents for the Structural Funds recommends that the Member States clearly indicate which funds are allocated to specific equality-related actions.
The Member States will provide us with the relevant information, with precise indicators, as part of this year's review.
Member States are also being urged to ensure that actions pursued under the Structural Funds use gender impact assessments and statistics broken down by gender and, at the same time, the Commission emphasises that specific funds, in most of the programmes, should be maintained and even increased for activities dedicated to ensuring gender equality.
The Commission will continue to develop methodologies and tools to implement the integration of gender into the budget, but this means continuing with our discussions on exchanging experiences and all cooperating with one another.
Consequently its report on integrating the gender perspective makes an, in our opinion, enormously useful contribution to improving the principle of gender integration.
The fruitful cooperation between Parliament, Member States and the Commission must remain in place and be stepped up if we are to achieve the aims that we all wish to attain.
Madam President, I should like to compliment Mrs Ghilardotti on her initiative to draw up this report.
Even though the Commissioner says that a lot is already happening at European level, I view this report rather as a start and a stimulus for building on the little that is already happening.
People may say that there is a lot of expertise, or at least some, but, to be honest, I have to say that I have yet to see much evidence of this.
Why are there calls for gender budgeting?
It is because a number of items in the budgets of Member States and the European Union are largely only benefiting half of the population.
I shall give two examples.
It is common knowledge that, when it comes to allocating resources for scientific research into health care, a good deal of research is conducted on half of the population: the males and not the females.
A second example is as follows.
When resources are given for stimulating democratisation and respect for human rights in developing countries, it frequently happens that these resources are principally used for the benefit of one half of the population and not the other.
That is why it is expressly requested that we perhaps start with an analysis of a number of budgetary items that are very gender-sensitive, where something really could be done.
If this could be carried out in consultation with the Member States, I think that something positive could result.
It is indeed good to have a brochure, but we are actually still only at the stage of developing a mechanism.
The development of a mechanism requires the building-up of a great deal of expertise.
I give my support to the Commission, and to Mrs Ghilardotti, and I hope that this own-initiative report bears fruit.
Madam President, I too should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, on her enormous contribution to the promotion and highlighting of the relatively new concept of gender budgeting.
The promotion of the idea of gender budgeting is obviously not calling for the creation of separate funding headings, nor does it aspire to more financial resources for women.
What we want is for the specific consequences on the economic and social life of both sexes to be evaluated and, of course, for the budgets to be restructured so that, through them, gender equality can be promoted instead of being undermined.
Today, it is becoming more and more understood that macroeconomic policy can reduce or widen the gap between the two sexes in relation to financial resources, economic independence, education and health care.
For example, the health budget should take account of the specific needs which arise from the different physiology of the two sexes and the different health problems faced by the two sexes.
In other words, the male cannot be used as the measure for everything.
I regret that the European Commission does not have at its disposal either methods or reliable statistics for analysing the budget by gender.
I should also like to stress that all the committees of the European Parliament should apply gender budgeting in all their budgets.
Finally, it is also important for there to be transparency and control mechanisms.
Madam President, my political group will be delighted to vote in favour of this own-initiative report by Mrs Ghilardotti.
It is a very serviceable document that really is to be welcomed.
It gives concrete shape to what many are talking about, that is to say gender mainstreaming, but which so few are attempting to convert into practical politics.
I am glad to hear that the Commission has the same problems as the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Ever since the Beijing Conference in 1995, we have talked about statistics broken down by gender.
Statistics of this kind have still not been produced in our Member States, and nor of course have they been produced by the Commission.
We have also assessed in previous debates how the structural funds are distributed by gender.
I am not usually particularly enamoured of the Commission's various propaganda documents, but I really do hope in this case that an attempt will at least be made to produce a document on this issue that can be distributed in the Member States.
It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets has not itself taken the initiative that Mrs Ghilardotti has so creditably taken.
All the institutions have undertaken to take account of gender mainstreaming in all areas.
Now that, hopefully, many from the Committee on Budgets are present, I really do hope that this initiative will be taken to heart and practical measures continue to be taken.
Madam President, in this report, the pursuit of equal treatment of men and women is so grossly exaggerated as to give the impression that the European Union would collapse if this aim were not pursued with all available means.
For that reason, some sober correction is in order.
The two genders must be valued equally: I am an outright supporter of this.
However, this resolution smacks of an ideology that wants to forcefully combat one objectionable form of oppression by introducing another undesirable form of dictatorship or collective thinking.
For, ultimately, the equality ideology does not value women as women.
It does not give them their due.
On the contrary, women must become the same as men.
They will be forced to be the same.
Where have I heard those words before?
It must be understood that I am against any unworthy treatment of women.
If we are to banish from society the problem indicated, we must not take as our starting point a model based on confrontation between the two genders, but instead set to work in accordance with a model based on harmony.
This is the way God the creator intended it when he created humankind - man and woman as a unity of two parts that complement each other.
Unfortunately, this harmonious relationship has been thoroughly disturbed on account of humankind's refusal to recognise God or his authority, instead insisting on being its own boss.
Unfortunately, there is no place for this original truth in the equality ideology.
As a result, it does not rise above the jealousy-promoting confrontation model, which involves the division of power and money; everyone the same, as if men and women will be happier as a result.
The resolution tramples on the subsidiarity principle.
It calls for studies and reports from the European Commission that require an enormous amount of work, including from the Member States, in order to achieve an ideological and ultimately inhumane objective.
In our opinion, it would be more just and fair to call for attention to the position of families and the extent to which government policy and budgetary policy in the European Union are family-friendly.
After all, the individualistic spirit exuded by this report has very negative implications for the future of our societies.
Madam President, this report is not about creating conflicts, but about harmonisation, and it is not about levelling down, but about equal treatment.
To my mind, that is a very important distinction, and one that we should not forget.
Gender budgeting does not involve creating separate budgets for men and women, but it does mean working to ensure that funding is distributed fairly and efficiently.
Contrary to what we are often told, public budgets are not gender-neutral; in terms of both income and expenditure they have different impacts on men and women.
We want to highlight these differences and take account of them.
Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic, social, and societal terms.
That is why we need a budget analysis.
Such an analysis means investigating the impact of budgets on women, and on tax systems, that is to say different types of taxation.
How do women perceive cuts and how are they affected by them?
The answer is: very often more than men are.
To make gender budgeting possible, we need transparency, consultation and joint decision-making.
A group of highly committed Austrian women have written a book entitled 'Women, Power and Budgets - Public Finances from a Gender Perspective'.
I can recommend this to you as a starting point, and it could also provide a basis for the information leaflet the Commission has promised us.
That leaflet should be widely published, easily accessible and go hand in hand with an information campaign.
Statements like the ones you have just heard should then be a thing of the past.
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank, most warmly, the rapporteur of this report on gender budgeting, because it seems to me that, thanks to this document, we are taking an important step forwards, as Mr Solbes-Mira has just said.
The rapporteur has explained that countries both outside and inside Europe have already been applying the practices of gender budgeting.
Therefore I hope, Commissioner, that we will keenly support this report.
I should like to say, to the Member who believes that we are being ideological when we discuss this question, that this is an economic question.
If I take as an example the issue of pensions, which affects most countries in Europe and, in the last few months, France in particular, gender budgeting enables us to make a diagnosis of the situation.
We discover, for example, that while the difference in wages between men and women is 25%, that difference rises to 47% as soon as retirement age is reached.
That is the sort of diagnosis that this study enables us to carry out.
Having said that, this diagnosis is not sufficient, because the pessimists will say that that is going to cost us money.
Economic equality between the sexes does cost money, whether it is professional equality or equality of retirement pensions, as is the case with many other subjects.
I should like to remind those pessimists that it is possible to produce a different analysis of inequality between men and women, namely that it is economic inequality between men and women that costs money.
A better analysis and a better practice of equality in financial matters would make it possible to reduce a cost rather than to increase it.
I say this for the benefit of those who think that we are being ideological.
They are wrong, because we are also thinking in economic terms when we consider this issue.
Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on the fact that there are not just 20 Members present to debate this report, but that for once we are at last considering equalities issues with a full House.
Gender budgeting is a relatively recent idea, which was developed at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing.
In the context of gender mainstreaming, it involves analysing public budgets to assess their differing impacts on men and women, and to raise awareness among political and economic actors - which we have ample opportunity to do today.
Discrimination very soon becomes apparent when figures talk and we see that only 6% of the Structural Funds are geared towards helping women.
Let me give you another example from the EU Budget: the forest protection programme has a budget of EUR 52 million, whereas the programme for the protection of children, young people and women is allocated only EUR 41 million, a clear 20% less.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities hopes, by means of this report, to stimulate a debate that will expose the inequality and discrimination in the Budget.
But we need instruments to achieve that, and this point is addressed to you personally, Commissioner Solbes Mira: please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13, which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender, which will at last give us a significant instrument.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs GrÃ¶ner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr President, the previous Vice-President in the chair quite rightly asked for Members who are coming in to vote to enter the Chamber quietly when a debate is going on.
That is right.
However, every voting time this week has slipped behind not just by a few minutes, but by over 25 minutes.
I ask the powers-that-be or the great and the good to do something so that in future voting time starts on time, as opposed to the rigmarole that seems to happen every part-session with the time slipping by.
I shall ask the powers-that-be: the great and the good are fewer in number in this House.
We will see what we can do.
The next item is the vote.
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, I have another small correction to the adopted text as a result of Amendment No 16.
Amendment No 16 deletes Article 18(2).
Article 6(9) of the common position makes reference to Article 18(2); this article must therefore be changed if Amendment No 16 is adopted.
Mr President, here, too, I have an amendment to the adopted text.
Amendment No 31 deletes Article 10.
Article 1(3) of the common position makes reference to Article 10; that article must therefore be changed on account of Amendment No 31.
Mr President, I have a technical amendment to make concerning the wording of Amendment No 3 and also the original text to which this amendment applies.
It reads as follows: 'that the common agricultural policy's share of total compulsory expenditure is ?'. It should be changed to 'that the compulsory part of the common agricultural policy's share of total ?'.
It is about compulsory agricultural expenditure.
Mr President, with reference to the amendment to Paragraph 21a, I propose that the words 'and armed opposition forces which continue to recruit child soldiers' be added after the words 'strongly condemns governments', in order to condemn governments and armed oppositions which make use of child soldiers.
. (NL) My group takes the position that the outcome of the Convention does not form a good basis for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
An important reason for this is that the preamble distorts the history of Europe: it deliberately omits to make explicit mention of Christianity, even though this has had a profound influence on, and been decisive in shaping, the culture and politics of all the countries of Europe for centuries.
A good 'European house' cannot do without sound foundations.
In the Council's conclusions regarding the Middle East, both parties are called to account on their obligations.
It is a shame that the EU has not always been so resolute in propagating this viewpoint.
The pronouncements on terrorist organisations such as Hamas their relations with countries in the region, and the financing of their abominable actions do not mince words.
This kind of firm language is unfortunately lacking in the conclusions regarding Iran and those regarding Lebanon, with a view to the agreements the EU wishes to enter into with these countries.
This reveals the inconsistency that is so characteristic of the EU's position, and which makes it an unpredictable party as far as Israel and other countries in the region are concerned.
Open internal borders force the Member States to cooperate in the field of asylum and migration.
There was a lot to be done about this in Thessaloniki, but little was achieved.
The British plan for registration centres and reception in the region was not supported by a majority in the Council.
A pilot project that may be started up is the paltry consolation prize.
It is high time that the Council came up with results, so that the EU meets its moral obligation towards political refugees.
The Thessaloniki Council launched an exercise in reflection on the Union's security strategy on the basis of a report by the High Representative entitled 'A Secure Europe in a Better World', which seeks, in a highly interesting way, to take into account certain recent developments.
In particular, this document reveals the new threats: terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, rogue states or states that are failing, and organised crime.
It demonstrates that, because of increased interdependence, destabilisations that are far away in geographical terms may nonetheless have dangerous repercussions for us, whether direct or indirect.
Finally, it emphasises that often 'pre-emptive engagement' (which is not necessarily military) 'can avoid more serious problems in the future'.
These considerations could provide a good basis for justifying, after the event, the intervention in Iraq, which provoked the anger of the Chairman of the Communist Group.
Yet I, for my part, applaud this attempt at lucidity.
On the other hand, I think that the High Representative's report underestimates the future threat posed by increasing and uncontrolled migratory flows.
Moreover, this text appears to be somewhat unrealistic about the possibilities, in Europe, of a unified foreign policy without a substantial reduction in democracy.
I congratulate the Greek Presidency on the progress it has made in the field of justice and home affairs, and on the results achieved at the Thessaloniki European Council.
I welcome the decision taken to step up development of the programme adopted at Tampere, especially as regards drawing up a common European immigration policy (on illegal immigration, return to country of origin and cooperation with third countries).
I would mention the progress made in improving the management of our external borders, in developing the second Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS), as well as the adoption, after three years of negotiations, of the directives on family reunification and long-term residency.
Equally important is the consensus reached on the Union's position regarding the agreement with the USA on extradition and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
I also approve of the European Council's decision on the results of the Convention. I hope that, using that decision as the basis for the work of the next Intergovernmental Conference, the three pillars will eventually be abolished, as the European Parliament has been requesting for some time now; the area of freedom, security and justice will then be created more easily and transparently.
Finally, as a result of the Council's decision, I hope that the European Parliament will be granted powers of codecision on asylum and immigration issues.
. (FR) We have refused to validate the results of the European Council in Thessaloniki.
First of all, we refuse to consider immigration issues as the main problem in Europe.
At a time when immigrants who are the victims of poverty, political repression or conflicts are dying every day before the walls of Fortress Europe, whether at Sfax or at Lampedusa, we are reaffirming the principle of free movement and freedom to become established.
The creation of transit centres and regional protection zones, or the stepping up of policing and repatriation measures at the border are practices that have proved to be both inhumane and ineffective.
Finally, we do not recognise either the legality or the legitimacy of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposed constitution for Europe.
This text, the result of the anti-democratic process of the Convention, is nothing more than the expression of the supporters of a market-based Europe, a Europe of democratic and social regression.
This draft text, having been through the hands of the Eurocrats, is now in the hands of the Heads of State or Government.
If the citizens of Europe want a constitution, there must be a constitutive process based on democracy, social rights, public services and the general interest.
In voting against the resolution, we are defending that point of view.
. (SV) I am unable to support the proposal in Paragraphs 13 and 14 concerning a Community-funded EU border force.
Nor am I able to support Paragraph 27 concerning a European arrest warrant, Paragraph 49 on the development of the EU's military capacity or Paragraph 51 on a defence capacity body.
I congratulate Mr Bradbourn on the excellent report he has produced on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system ('Marco Polo Programme'). I support this report, and especially the rapporteur's belief that the programme should approve the implementation of innovative projects proposed principally by a consortium of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would also like to emphasise that the project's goals of 'enhancing intermodal transport and reducing congestion in road transport' should indeed be clearly reflected in the text of the regulation, as the rapporteur suggests.
This report emphasises the need to make systematic use of gender budgeting, with a view to incorporating the gender perspective into Community and national budgetary procedures.
I was persuaded to vote in its favour.
In the context of budgetary policy, gender budgeting implies that revenue and expenditure for all programmes and projects should be assessed and restructured so as to ensure that women's priorities and requirements should be taken into account, the eventual goal being to achieve equality between men and women.
A campaign must be launched to raise awareness among the general public, governments and national parliaments. Particularly important is the production of a guide describing the tools and methods for introducing the gender perspective into public budgets.
Lastly, I agree with the idea of setting up a European network of organisations and experts active in the field of gender budgeting, to be linked into the network of parliamentary committees for equal opportunities.
This will allow the development and dissemination of good methods and practices.
. (FR) We abstained from voting on the Ghilardotti report, which argued in favour of gender budgeting, in other words public budgets taking into account the 'gender perspective' and thus supposedly establishing a little more equality between men and women.
The intention is good, but the means envisaged are not, particularly if one looks at them in the context of the broad economic orientations of the Member States of the European Union which, contrary to what the author of the report claims, are not reducing inequalities in Europe but are, on the contrary, helping to make them worse.
Members of the European Parliament, sitting in their ivory tower, can imagine what they want to imagine.
The reality is very different.
By giving the major industrial and financial groups an increasingly free hand, by destroying public services or attacking social protection, the Member States of the European Union are not reducing inequalities: they are entrenching them even deeper.
By refusing to put a stop to dismissals, by favouring moderation in wage claims, and by reducing the amount of pensions, their action is aggravating the misfortunes suffered by women, who are more often than men the victims of unemployment, insecurity and forced part-time working.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure).
The need to draw up public budgets through a gender perspective, with the ultimate aim of achieving genuine equality between men and women, stems from our belief that budgets are not neutral tools but in fact reflect the way power is distributed in society.
Budgets are thus the outcome of political decisions, becoming key instruments for shaping models of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution.
Any equal opportunities policy must thus be reflected in the manner in which budgets are drawn up at various levels.
As the rapporteur points out, in order to pursue the aim of fairness, governments and public administrations must deal with gender issues and reduce inequalities between men and women, taking due account of the fact that men and women play different roles in society and the economy and, as a result, that economic policies have a different impact on them.
By voting in favour of this report, we are also underlining the importance of implementing the Beijing Action Platform and of drawing up provisions in the European Union's own budget with a view to applying the proposals contained in Mrs Ghilardotti's report.
. (FR) Up to now, public budgets have been drawn up on an administrative basis, with the credits being shared out between ministers.
There are also, however, methods which show budgets according to major function, according to programme or broken down in economic terms.
Since 1995, in the interests of seeking to achieve equality between men and women, it has been proposed that budgets should be drawn up on a sexual basis.
This is known as gender budgeting, or budgeting according to sex, which is intended to respond to two questions.
The first question is how the budget expenditure should be shared between women and men, in other words who gets the money, and the second question is who should pay, in other words who shoulders the tax burden.

This brave vision must be expanded to include even more justice.
We need generational budgeting.
Which generations pay the taxes? Is it young people, retired people, working people or old people?
Which generations gain the most advantage from public expenditure?
Above all, however, we must have class budgeting, or category budgeting.
Which social categories shoulder the tax burden?
Is it the wage earners, or the holders of movable capital incomes?
Finally we come to the great taboo, the question of who profits from the budget credits.
Is it the rich or the poor?
Is it the middle classes, old people, small farmers, the small man or the big man?
This is a question about justice.
It is a social question rather than a hormonal one.
. (FR) The creation of the Single European Sky, to allow optimum and unified use of European airspace, in the light of the fact that the sky has reached saturation point, resulting in delays to flights, is based on a good intention.
The fragmentation of European airspace,however, is not the only cause of the delays.
The commercial practices of the airlines who increase the number of shuttle services using small aircraft on the most profitable routes is also largely to blame.
The harm done to the principle of subsidiarity by the requirement for organic separation between the regulator and the operator prevents Member States from organising their national air traffic control systems in the way that they would wish, possibly within the second pillar of the CFSP with, as its corollary, harmonisation with NATO.
Thus the Commission's proposal seeking to modify the way in which airspace is shared between civil and military use should not give precedence to purely commercial interests to the detriment of security.
What will be achieved if the Community duplicates the powers of Eurocontrol?
Its current operation is organised efficiently as far as security and the control of traffic flow are concerned.
Will we not be creating a technocratic and administrative monster, which yet again distances the average citizen from the decision-making process?
. (NL) Economies of scale have their disadvantages, but are sometimes necessary.
This particularly applies in the case of long-distance traffic.
This traffic crosses national borders, so responsibility for its safety and regulation is shared by more than one country.
Previously, something like this would have led to plans for the creation of a single European railway company first of all, and then a single European aviation company with a single European air-traffic safety system.
Of course, those monopolies would then have to be under democratic control, in order to prevent abuses of power, wastefulness and nepotism.
The neoliberal ideology has since arrived.
Not only service provision, but also maintenance of support infrastructures and monitoring of safety can be handed over to competing undertakings.
Work funded with public finances is to be allocated by means of competition, and existing jobs are no longer secure. This causes great unease in those who have to do this work.
It is a good thing that national borders and military zones lose their importance in the course of the organisation of aviation safety, but that does not mean that the means currently being proposed are the best.
It was a surprise a pleasant surprise to hear Commissioner de Palacio yesterday evening inform us in this debate that this proposal is by no means intended for privatisation or liberalisation.
However, I fear that, unintentionally, it may well be used for that in the long run.
. (FR) We rejected all the amendments which do serious damage to conditions of employment, quality of service and, more generally, to the mission of the public services.
We have no confidence in market forces in terms of either harmonising or improving air transport.
Parliament's amendments are the result of all-liberal ideology.
Under cover of harmonisation, they are dividing the European sky into a number of entities and opening the way to competition between service providers.
We therefore rejected the obligation to extend the Single European Sky to airspace at a lower level.
We rejected the idea of the Commission acting as arbitrator in disputes about the creation of cross-border airspace blocks and the introduction of sanctions for service providers.
We are concerned about the relatively short duration of the authorisation granted to service providers (5 to 10 years) and the reintroduction of financial incentives.
In these conditions the Single European Sky of the Commission and the Council will be a factor of uncertainty and insecurity.
In time, the Single European Sky will be a step backwards for both users and employees, as opposed to a public service coordinated at European level, incorporating the long-term view and making use of the most advanced technologies.
Large parts of the Council's common position are a good compromise.
We therefore support the position, especially when it comes to cooperation between civil and military bodies.
The Council's common position is a first step on the way to a common European air space.
. British Labour MEPs are strong supporters of the Single European Sky and wish to see it implemented as soon as possible, to eliminate air traffic control delays, reduce emissions from waiting aircraft and enhance safety.
However, a number of amendments seek to reopen the issue of the coordination between civil and military airspace.
In particular Amendments Nos 2, 6, 16 and 18 in the Fava report and Amendments Nos 3, 21, 23, 29, 30 and 32 in the Sanders-ten Holte report.
We cannot support these amendments because they undermine the compromise reached in Council to develop a Flexible Use of Airspace concept.
We welcome FUA as a major step forward.
Allowing civil use of military airspace when not in use.
It would be a pity if, by reopening this issue, we delay achieving the one thing we all agree on: the early realisation of a Single European Sky.
. (NL) The passage of freight transport by road through the Alps is a bone of contention that recurs time and again both within and outside parliamentary debate.
I have participated in that debate or given explanations of vote on 15 December 1999, 14 December 2000, 4 September 2001, and 11 and 12 February 2003.
Germany and Italy want free passage through Austria and Switzerland, but the latter two countries want to protect their valleys against those flows of heavy goods vehicles, and want to transfer transport quickly over to the railways.
I support the efforts of those two countries in that regard.
Switzerland keeps up with the EU legislation and participates in the European Economic Area, but it does not make financial contributions or participate in voting.
This also means that it cannot be outvoted by others.
Austria, however, unlike Switzerland, has the misfortune to be a member of the EU, of eight years' standing.
Others think that this entitles them to enforce their will on this Member State.
They even want to completely abolish distribution through ecopoints in the long run.
It is better if we build the Brenner Base Tunnel for electric rail transport under Austria, then Germany and Italy will in practice border on each other, without inconveniencing any little intervening country.
This time, as on the previous occasions, I shall be using my vote to once more support the Austrian Members, because they are defending their quality of life against large-scale short-sightedness.
- (FR) We would have voted in favour of those amendments seeking to provide better compensation for passengers, but since all the amendments are in practice voted on en bloc, we did not want to back those which exempt certain service providers, such as tour operators, or which aim to reduce the obligations of the airlines.
In particular, we are opposed to the latter not being liable in the event of strikes.
It would, in fact, be inconceivable that airline employers should escape their obligations when it is their own wage and employment policy that is the cause of such strikes.
I congratulate Mr Lisi on the excellent report he has presented on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. I support this report, especially the recommendation of opting for a single distance criterion applying to compensation, delay and the placing of passengers in a lower class.
I would also like to stress that complying with the provisions laid out in this regulation, especially those relating to compensation in cases of non-compliance, will require a serious and fundamental rethinking of the way air carriers operate. For this reason it would be appropriate to extend the period before this regulation enters into force by a few months.
. Whilst not perfect, this regulation does address a very important issue.
However, I am concerned that, by adopting the regulation, we may have severely damaged a much needed community service, without realising it.
The helicopter shuttle to the Isles of Scilly is a vitally important link and a necessity to my region.
Without the helicopter service to ferry visitors to and from the mainland, the economy of this tiny island will be devastated.
As the objective of the regulation was to deal with fixed wing services, I do not believe that it was meant to cover such niche operations.
They only operate two helicopters on a shuttle service, are often victim to bad weather, and do not have the luxury of 'standby' helicopters in case of mechanical failure.
If a mechanical breakdown does occur early in the day, all subsequent flights are affected.
The element that covers such occurrences could mean paying out compensation to such a level that the service would simply cease to operate.
We raised this privately with the Commission at yesterday's debate, but I would ask the Commission again to rectify urgently an oversight which could ruin a beautiful island and a community.
Food additives are already regulated. Apart from sweeteners and colourings, the bulk of these are obtained from natural raw materials.
These substances, the so-called 'E numbers' that we find on the packaging of foodstuffs, are needed for the development and running of the agri-food industry. They are used in operations as diverse as preserving and regulating mixtures, enhancing flavours and improving the appearance of the product.
Hence the importance of this report in the context of the broader discussion of food safety, at a time when various food and veterinary crises, such as BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, sewage sludge, dioxins, nitrofurans, etc. have significantly shaken consumer confidence, further highlighting the need to change production methods.
The image of food additives among consumers has deteriorated, even taking account of risk assessments and the concept of the acceptable daily intake.
Today, there are scientific and technological means of improving production methods, and of forewarning us against misuse. This guarantees the precautionary principle.
Tighter labelling and packaging regulations are needed in order to guarantee that the necessary information is included.
For these reasons, we agree with the rapporteur.
The Commission should carry out a general evaluation of the use of food additives, basing future authorisations on three criteria: technological need, a high level of protection for human health, and labelling which does not mislead the consumer.
The conciliation procedure under discussion allows the European Parliament to assess the requirements of the 2004 EU Budget. Among other things, it establishes an agreement on levels of expenditure for agriculture and fisheries.
Against the backdrop of enlargement, this budget promotes greater economic, social and territorial cohesion. On the other hand, it offers a very limited increase in appropriations.
I wish to comment here on some of the financial provisions relating to agriculture and fisheries.
I welcome the appreciable increase in allocations, especially for rural development, although that increase is mainly directed at the candidate countries.
Also to be welcomed are the budgetary efforts dedicated to health protection, consumers and food safety, not forgetting the environmental criteria needed for high-quality agriculture.
I give my full support to the creation of a special budgetary heading for farmers affected by emergencies and calamities such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever and other diseases.
Like the common agricultural policy, this budget provides a relative increase in the amounts allocated to fisheries.
I can only disagree, however, with the appreciable cuts made in the research budget and the structural funds linked to this sector.
Strengthening the control and implementation of each Member State's quotas is, therefore, desirable. This will avoid penalising those who comply while offenders get off scot-free.
It is a cause for concern that commitment implementation for internal policies has fallen to 10% as of April 2003, compared with 24% in 2002. This is due, of course, to the budget chapter on technological research and development, which is a priority given the EU's weaknesses in this area.
There is also a downward trend in terms of commitment implementation for areas of social policy, especially for the titles relating to the social dimension and employment as well as education and youth, even though these priority areas were already underfunded.
The reasons for this situation, apart from a lack of political will, include bureaucracy, a lack of transparency and the inflexibility of spending regulations.
The poor implementation argument cannot, of course, be used to justify cuts in sensitive areas.
It is unacceptable to suggest that allocations to the social dimension and employment are unnecessary, at a time when unemployment is on the increase in the EU.
I regret that the rapporteur did not specifically address the fisheries question, especially the reconversion of the fleet which used to fish in Morocco waters and the lines relating to social dialogue with the sector.
That would have been useful, bearing in mind the planned reduction of the preliminary draft budget for 2004 and the Council's vagueness about funding for the reform of the common fisheries policy.
Through this report, the European Parliament, which has power of control over implementation of the EU Budget, has analysed allocations for 2003.
The aim is to ensure that the EU's financial resources are used effectively in order to attain the goals laid down in its policies, as well as to guarantee continuity with next year's budget.
It is, therefore, with a sense of grave disquiet that I agree with the conclusions of this report, which draws attention once again to the problem of funds that are committed and not used.
This is especially worrying since a part of those funds falls under the N+2 rule, which states that funds committed must be used by the Member States within two years of the initial allocation, or the funds will be forfeited.
This situation becomes even more unacceptable and disgusting when it occurs in the implementation of the Structural Funds and in the internal policies of the EU.
I therefore lend my support to the transparent, frequent and detailed presentation of sums cancelled, annulled or forfeited because they have not been used, as well as an assessment of the financial impact of those losses.
This valuable information should be presented by budget heading and by Member State.
I also support the idea of streamlining the rules for submitting applications for structural funds, especially by improving the timetabling and implementation of those funds.
These provisions must be adopted when the mid-term review of the Structural Funds is undertaken.
. (FR) We voted in favour of this report because one cannot disagree with the condemnation of this despicable situation in which children are turned into slave soldiers.
At the same time, however, the hypocrisy of a text originating from the political representatives of rich countries whose ruling classes are to such a great extent responsible for the wretched plight of these countries is something that disgusts us.
For example, what is meant by statements about having a strategy to combat poverty, or by the promise - which we know to be a lie - to facilitate such children's access to medical care, social services and schooling?
Besides, while the European Parliament is expressing its indignation, those States which make up the Union are continuing to maintain relations with the leaders of those countries.
To take only one recent example, the fact that the current President of Liberia uses child soldiers did not, four years ago, prevent the leaders of the French State from giving him an honourable welcome to their country.
The rule of armed gangs has never interfered with the arms manufacturers selling their arms to the regime, or with the jewellery companies recovering contraband diamonds.
While civilian populations are massacred and children are dehumanised by being turned into slave soldiers, the looting continues.
There is a connection between poverty and trafficking in children.
The focus must therefore be upon the fight against poverty if it is to be possible to eliminate trafficking in children.
The Commission must devise a strategy for fighting poverty and design a common EU policy focused upon prevention, support for, and protection of, the victims and tough punishment of the perpetrators.
This also means requiring countries that cooperate with the EU to introduce tough legislation on trafficking in children.
. (FR) We voted against the joint resolution.
The discretion of the State must not take precedence over that of the people.
Contrary to what has been stated, the referendum was not a first step towards the restoration of normality.
It was antidemocratic, since the opposition did not have the right to campaign.
It put in place a Chechen constitution which legitimises Moscow's dominant power, making it compulsory to use the Russian language alone in government matters, and giving the President of the Russian Federation the power to dismiss the Chechen President.
The main concern of the people of Chechnya is not the fight against terrorism, but rather the fight against military occupation and the fight to improve their living conditions.
These are atrocious as a result of Russian bombardments.
Unemployment, which is already massive in the Russian Federation, owing to ultra-liberal policies, is made even worse in Chechnya and in the Caucasus by the demands of the military.
Moreover, it is curious that the ad hoc delegation has not reported these facts to us.
Peace in Chechnya and the search for a political solution require the opening up of direct negotiations between the representatives of President Maskhadov and the Russian authorities.
The end of military conflict can only be based on an official cease-fire and the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces.
. (NL) Yesterday, during the debate on Chechnya, my German colleague Mr Markov presented an optimistic view of the renewed stability, the referendum held, and support for reconstruction.
However, he was clearly critical of the policies of the Russian Government and advocated a peaceful and humanitarian approach for the future.
I do not think that I was alone in finding the word 'stabilisation' somewhat provocative, although I know that Mr Markov did not intend it to be, and now himself agrees that he should not use that word again as it gives rise to misunderstandings.
Terms such as 'stability' and 'reconstruction' are often used by occupying powers wishing to gain support for their continuing occupation.
The terminology used creates the impression that the conflict is over and that it goes without saying that Chechnya has a future as an autonomous part of the Russian Federation.
I think that the conflict is still going on, that the referendum is seen by the majority of Chechens as an instrument of the military occupying powers, and that, on the basis of the assurances of the late General Lebed, there must be negotiations between the Chechen State structures arising from earlier elections and the Russian State claiming this region.
In this connection, I can only support the resolution of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, although it unfortunately lacks a reference to the abduction of Arjan Erkel.
. (FR) It is understandable that the European Parliament should be concerned about the situation in Chechnya.
Is that, though, a reason for ignoring the most elementary principles of international law, such as the national sovereignty of Russia, non-interference in its internal affairs, the right of the Russian political authorities to take the necessary measures to guarantee the territorial integrity and the indivisible nature of their State?
I do not think so, particularly since the reasons given to support the usual condemnations of events in Chechnya seem to me to be totally mistaken.
Even if some people sometimes forget it, we are dealing here with a legitimate fight against terrorism.
Contrary to what a handful of people in the humanitarian, human-rights lobby would have us believe, there are no good terrorists and bad terrorists.
There are terrorists, full stop, in other words fanatics who, in their contempt for the dignity of the human person, are committing murderous attacks against innocent people.
Yes, a political solution is desirable in Chechnya, and I applaud the efforts that Vladimir Putin is making towards achieving it, but it will only be credible if the terrorist factions renounce violence once and for all.
That is what I hope will happen.
. (EL) The ?U is going to Cancun having carried out what is for farmers a disastrous interim reform of the CAP, which it is offering as a 'gift' to the competitive global market in agricultural products.
It is also prepared to abolish export subsidies and duty on imports from developing countries, which will result in the sidelining of our agricultural products.
It is also going prepared to start discussions on competition and foreign investment, on terms which will be onerous for developing countries, in that they will suffer even greater exploitation by the multinationals.
They are also discussing the opening up of public services and utilities in these countries, so that the multinationals will have unimpeded access.
What the WTO is not prepared to discuss is access to cheap drugs and the protection of biodiversity.
The right to health, education, safe food, water, telecommunications and energy is being subjugated to commercial interests and increased profit.
We voted against the European Parliament resolution because, although it expresses certain reservations, in essence it accepts the role of the World Trade Organisation.
The Communist Party of Greece does not believe in the reformation of the WTO, so that inequalities in international trade can be levelled out and the countries of the developing world can develop.
However, it does believe in the fight of the peoples.
.
(SV) We Swedish Moderates believe that the GATS Agreement on including the service sector in the WTO's free trade provisions is an important step in the right direction of increased international trade. In this area, we see no reason, however, for exempting education, the health sector and important parts of the cultural sector, such as audiovisual activities, from liberalisation.
European education and culture, traditionally characterised by cultural diversity, have every opportunity to thrive in an open world market and indirectly to support minority cultures, in particular.
On this point, we have a view at variance with the resolution, but we are voting for the resolution as a whole.
The 5th WTO Ministerial conference, which will take place in Cancun in September, seems to be governed once again by the requirements of free trade rather than by an approach that seeks to shift the balance back towards national sovereignties.
With regard to procedure, the Commission appears still to wish to use the negotiating mandate granted in 1999 for Seattle, which lacked relevance even then and is today completely out of date.
As for the European Parliament, it is only consulted in the present resolution, which contains a brief debate and has no binding legal value.
Negotiations will, therefore, once again be opened in conditions that lack transparency, which does not bode well.
Fundamentally, the issue at stake is the right of each people to determine the society in which it lives.
In particular, this involves the right to choose its own farming model, as discussed superbly by Mrs Dominique Souchet during yesterday's debate, the right to choose how its own public services operate (and their limits), the right to safeguard its independence or to apply the precautionary principle by banning certain imports. There is also the right freely to uphold a regional preference or a preference that will benefit poor countries, in order to make a choice that expresses solidarity.
. (FR) We have, of course, voted against the joint resolution on the WTO because we are opposed to the capitalist system, and to all international organisations that represent it.
We have also voted against or abstained on most of the amendments because, even though they contain good intentions on making the capitalist world a better place, they are simply participating in the overall dishonesty.
It will take more than a few stopgap measures in the shape of amendments by the European Parliament to improve capitalism.
. (FR) We are voting against the joint resolution on the forthcoming WTO conference.
This resolution again adopts positions that have traditionally been advocated by the European Commission for extending the scope of negotiations in the WTO.
On what are known as the Singapore issues, it consequently recommends that negotiations should be officially opened on competition, investments, trade facilitation and public procurement.
This would give the WTO further powers.
This resolution also considers that it would be possible to ensure the satisfactory reform of world governance by establishing a more balanced and closer relationship between the WTO and other international organisations.
This misses the point of what the WTO is.
This organisation was founded with the aim of encouraging trade liberalisation.
It was designed to ensure that the imperialist countries would dominate it.
It imposes itself like an antidemocratic force and its decisions, which are taken without any form of popular scrutiny, have to be transposed into national or Community legislation.
The WTO is a war machine in the service of the financial powers.
Adjusting the balance of its relationships is not enough to solve a problem of this nature.
A democratic reform of international trade will take place despite the WTO, not through it.
