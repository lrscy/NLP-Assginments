Acting in the name of Germany, the German finance minister has just trodden this law underfoot by joining with France in doing serious damage to the Stability Pact.
In so doing, Germany not only broke the law but also destroyed trust, not only at home, but also among its neighbours in Europe and without doubt also in the countries seeking to join the European Union.
Rules can be changed, but not by breaking them.
At best, this amounts to rule by might rather than right, and hence to the antithesis of what holds the EU together.
This malevolent spirit of national egoism and Franco-German high-handedness will dog Europe for a long time yet.
Berlin shrank back in fear from cutting EURÂ 6Â billion from total expenditure of EURÂ 1Â 000 billion.
Such an amount is in no way crucial to the success of a recovery â not that there are any indications of one.
The EUâs foundations have been tampered with, and a long-planned alliance has been forged against the European Commission.
That, in essence, is the strategic position, the strategy underlying this course of action, the strategic heart of the Berlin-Paris soft-currency axis.
Who, then, will blame the smaller states and the Eurosceptics if they again become more suspicious?
Nor will anyone be so keen to rely again on the Commission to protect them.
It was a black day for Europe when this damage was done to the Stability Pact, resulting in a crisis of confidence and a political crisis within the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, the Presidency has been criticised for not being neutral.
The Italian Presidency, and I am quoting CommissionerÂ Solbes, made a great effort to find a solution, but it is also true that it did not vote in favour of the Commission recommendations.
The way a person votes is a strange way of defining neutrality.
The Presidencyâs position has been totally impartial.
It has nothing to gain and I believe that the whole of this debate should be carried out at European level, without following the conventions of domestic politics.
I feel I can say this as the representative of a government which considers the Commission to be importantÂ -Â as guardianÂ -Â but considers the financial market to be equally as important.
I am sorry to see that the group chairman, MrÂ Poettering, is not in the Chamber.
If I am not mistaken, the chairman gave the example of two countries that have shifted their position: Ireland and Portugal.
I am sorry to see that Ireland and Portugal, together with France and Germany, and Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg as well, voted in favour of the Commissionâs conclusions.
Although he is not present today, I believe that a remark must be made on the position assumed by MrÂ Junker, who I do not believe thinks differently from the European Union, in the Eurogroup and then in Ecofin.
The debate about âlargeâ and âsmallâ countries does not hold water.
What we are talking about is a political process.
Frankly, I do not believe that the Commission has a political monopoly and I do not believe that rules are the same thing as sanctions.
Monopolies are not a good thing for the economy, nor are they a good thing legally speaking.
Rules can be interpreted in different ways: the Councilâs Legal Service interpreted them in one way and the Council interpreted them in another way.
The rules provide, not least, for a vote.
That is not all, though: sanctions are not the whole picture but a part of it and there is more to the rules than just sanctions.
In essence, the Council decision can be welcomed in so far as the measures recommended to France and Germany are essentially the same as those proposed by MrÂ Prodi to the Commission.
The substance is the same.
The difference does not lie in the procedure: whether the procedure and the sanctions amount to the same thing or whether the procedure can be construed in a different way, the requirement of essential compliance with the Commissionâs recommendations remains the same.
I believe that sanctions are essential, but that they are most useful if they do not have to be enforced.
Sanctions work well if they do not have to work.
Sanctions work well if they serve to bring about extension, prevention and adjustment.
This was the case and this is absolutely clear.
I do not believe that enforcing the sanctions was our objective; I believe that our objective was to ensure that the rules were respected and this was the case.
I do not believe that we would have reached the point of enforcing sanctions, even for a small country.
I would never have voted in favour of sanctions on a small country that had, like two large countries, complied with the Commission demands.
The sanctions are one part of the rules; they are not all of the rules.
The main part of the rules is something else and providing for sanctions is important.
Seeing the sanctions work by extending the process is the essential thing.
There was total compliance.
I concluded my speech saying that substance is more important than form, or rather that both are important, but that, up until now, there has been too much focus on one aspect of the procedure, as if it were made up of sanctions alone, and this is not the case.
Moreover, there has been no talk about substance.
The substance is very simple, and this came out of the debate with political force and intelligence.
We are going though a difficult stage in Europe, in which we see a striking correlation between the extent of the problems and the governance capacity.
The extent of the problems: two wars in two years, the breakdown of the geopolitical balance in the world, the collapse of the financial markets, unregulated competition created by China, the effects causedÂ âÂ perhaps more than predictedÂ âÂ by the changeover in some countries, local and sectoral crises.
All this in the face of limited governance capacity.
The old Nation States no longer have the instruments for national governance and Europe does not yet have European governance.
We do not have wide margins for budgetary policies because there is the Stability and Growth Pact and it is not being challenged.
We do not have margins for interest rate policies, which are impartially decided using the constitutional reasoning of the European Central Bank.
We cannot establish exchange rate policies because these are decided elsewhere.
In 2000, the European economy was doing well, the budgets were in order, the value of the euro was down against the dollar.
In 2003, the economy is not doing particularly well, the budgets are not particularly in order and the value of the euro is up against the dollar.
I believe that Isaac Newton would have some difficulty in understanding the cause and effect link between these two phenomena.
We need European governance.
I believe that the Constitutional Treaty provides a basis for the development of European governance: I believe that, in the growth plan proposed by the Presidency but which has now become a European plan Europe has found a beneficial common undertaking in the form of a common economic policy: the first since the euro.
In 2003, Europe began an extremely intensive cycle of structural reforms.
A cycle orchestrated by European reasoning and in a European spirit of structural reforms of the labour market and the welfare state.
Reforms extended from Finland, Holland and Germany to Austria, France and Italy.
Europe is being renewed, investing in its future and changing growth expectations through a cycle of structural measures and essential structural reforms.
I believe that these are the things that we should be discussing.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to make three very quick comments.
Firstly, for your information, the Commission never proposed sanctions. The Commission proposed greater flexibility by granting an additional year to fulfil the 3%.
Secondly, the Commission will continue to make all the necessary effort to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of budgetary vigilance.
We know that complying with the Pact in the current context will raise certain problems, certain difficulties, but we are going to do so while guaranteeing absolutely equal treatment for all Member States.
Thirdly â as I pointed out in my initial speech â the Commission carefully considered all these issues, what this means for the future economic governance of the Union, and we will prepare an initiative to improve it within the framework of the current Treaty.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â The Queen of the Councils of Ministers, the Ecofin, has come tumbling off her pedestal with a loud thud.
In the Brussels glasshouse, this debate about the finer details of the Stability Pact is still going on, whilst normal citizens, at least in my country, the Netherlands, have for a long time been debating something else.
Why do the rules we agree on apply to some countries and not to others?
What about the rules we will agree on in the new constitutional treaty, on which all Dutch people are allowed to vote in a referendum?
In order to gain any credibility, this constitutional treaty will need to contain tough procedures to enforce monetary rules.
I am in favour of a much stronger role for the Commission.
Countries that are themselves in breach of the rules should be excluded from voting on the assessment of other countries that infringe the same rules.
The French and German Governments have opened Pandora's box.
This may well serve a short-term interest, but they have lost all credibility as the axis of European cooperation.
As such, they carry a heavy responsibility.
Â Â  â I would like to talk about the Geneva Accord and tell you that, like Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela, both former Presidents and winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, the European Parliament must welcome and support the initiative launched by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abbed Rabbo, who proposed a peace plan between Israelis and Palestinians on Monday, 1 December in Geneva.
I believe that this is a courageous and symbolic act that highlights and reflects the hope of the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians of living in a world of peace and mutual solidarity.
As Kofi Annan said, this plan does not take the place of the UN proposals.
Similarly, it is not for us to provide an exhaustive, line-by-line commentary on everything that it proposes.
The key element has been retained, namely the creation of a Palestinian state and the rejection of all forms of violence, especially suicide attacks.
We must support a strong signal at a time when certain people in both camps are virulently opposed to this peace plan.
They must be provided with a genuine lesson in peace and forced to move beyond hate in order to live together.
I regret that the Council is not present.
The urgency is all the more evident as the Iraqi crisis is only serving to amplify the problem.
I think that it is time to offer a generation of Palestinians and Israelis a genuine future, and a generation across the world the capacity the politicians have of ensuring that they can all live together with greater success.
Â Â  Madam President, I rise to ask you if you will join with me in expressing your concern to the Turkish judicial authorities about the delays in bringing to trial those persons involved in the affray that took place in Galatasaray, Turkey on the occasion of a football match with Leeds United in April 2000.
This terrible event led to the murders of my constituents Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight.
A local man, Ali Umit Demir, has now been convicted of these murders.
However, he has appealed against the original sentence, and now, along with others involved in the original affray, is awaiting the start of a retrial.
The preliminary retrial hearing has now been delayed twice, once in July and again in September of this year.
The third date for the hearing has now been arranged for 11 December 2003.
While I am very grateful for the interest, concern and assistance shown in this matter by the Turkish ambassador to the EU, Mr Oguz Demiralp, I would welcome the support of the President of Parliament in sending a letter to the Turkish judicial authorities seeking assurances that the legal proceedings will go ahead with no further delay.
I am sure the President understands the distress the families of the murdered men are experiencing, caused by the lengthy and drawn-out proceedings for the retrial, which have only added to their original grief over this matter.
Â Â  Madam President, as I am sure my fellow Members are aware, as a result of the various initiatives launched this year in Parliament, that on 1Â December we were due to receive MrÂ OswaldoÂ PayÃ¡, to whom we awarded the Sakharov prize last year.
Unfortunately, the Cuban authorities did not allow him to come.
He sent a message to Parliament, which he asked me to read out.
I read the message out, in its entirety, at the meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I will not repeat it here; I simply wish to have the matter recorded in plenary.
This is a powerful and stirring message, in which he recounts the difficulties facing democrats in Cuba, but also talks about the ongoing determination of the Varela Project (I would draw the attention of all my fellow Members to this fact) and condemns the fact that he was prevented from coming here.
He condemns the situation in the concentration camps and the situation of the detainees, which are precisely the issues on which we would like to hear him and to be able to discuss with him.
He also calls on the European Union to provide moral support for cooperation, which we will certainly not refuse him, and states that the European Union must hold constructive dialogue with all of Cuban society.
I would therefore ask Parliamentâs president and the Conference of Presidents to consider this matter again, since our invitation of 13Â November was thwarted and it is extremely important that we achieve the release of Oswaldo PayÃ¡ so that he can come and tell us what is happening in his country.
Â Â  Madam President, I want to raise the case of a British man on death row in Ohio in the United States.
Kenny Richey was convicted 16 years ago of arson and the murder of a two-year old girl who died in the fire. But new forensic evidence presented six years ago may well establish his innocence.
However, he remains on death row and could be given an execution date any time. This is because US law provides that no new evidence can be introduced after a certain stage.
The prosecutor has said: 'Even though this new evidence may establish Mr Richey's innocence, the Ohio and United States Constitution nonetheless allows him to be executed because the prosecution did not know that the scientific testimony offered at the trial was false and unreliable.'
So they know his conviction is unsafe, but he could still be executed.
That accounts for why Amnesty International has called it one of the most compelling cases of innocence human rights campaigners have ever seen.
Madam President, I will be circulating an e-mail petition and would urge all colleagues to support it, either to have the case reviewed in the light of the new evidence, or, as a last resort, to appeal for clemency.
Â Â  Madam President, under our Constitution, the Irish ratification process requires a referendum on all Treaty revisions.
Today, headlines, reports and editorials in a serious daily newspaper, the, stated that Mr Prodi believed that any state voting against the constitutional treaty now in its final stages of negotiation should logically leave the EU.
He did say they might get a second chance it might not be the first time they voted against it.
My appeal here, however, is that what could be perceived to be an ultimatum accept or leave the Union is most unhelpful in the run-in to a ratification process that is going to be difficult enough anyway, not just in Ireland, but in many Member States.
Mr Prodi is also reported as saying that any future amendments or revisions of the Treaty should be by parliament or government rather than by popular referendum.
Could I ask that Mr Prodi be given the opportunity to come and explain in more detail his views on these very sensitive issues, because interference or ill-judged comment at this stage will not be helpful if we want to get the present constitutional treaty through in the 15 Member States, let alone in the 25.
Sometimes it is better to say less than more in these issues.
Â Â  Madam President, I feel that it is my duty to speak about an issue that regards the dramatic legal event in Italy affecting the current life senator, Giulio Andreotti.
He is a public figure who is well known at European level, a figure who is at the forefront of Community affairs.
I waited for the Court of Cassationâs verdict before speaking on this issue.
Even more urgently, I waited for the reasons given a few days ago by the Court of Cassation, in which it not only acquitted senator Andreotti of a torment which had lasted years and of preposterous accusations of no less than murder, but, in the reasons that I have just mentioned, it criticised the absurd action taken by the Court of Appeal in condemning him: personal theories which could not be backed by any evidence.
I therefore believe that the ordeal of this man, a life senator, one of the public figures to have made a significant contribution to the development of democracy in the country and one of the fathers of Europe, should be firmly highlighted, and that it must be made clear that a part of the Italian justice system, which is clearly ineffectual if not subversive, enforced this situation which has disturbed both Italy and Europe for 10 years.
I therefore urge you, Madam President, and I am sure that I am not just interpreting the will of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian democrats) and European Democrats, but also the opinion of the European Parliament as a whole, to give Senator Andreotti formal recognition for the clarity, the far-sightedness and the great democratic uprightness that distinguishes this valuable and useful European figure.
Â Â  Madam President, as there is time remaining, allow me to bring to the attention of Commissioner Fischler an issue relating to his decoupling proposals and the area required to be farmed once decoupled.
If farmers have to farm 100% of the area they farmed during the reference years 2000 to 2002 in order to draw down the decoupled or area-based payment, it will put huge pressure on the price of rented land or Conacre as we say in Ireland both in Ireland and in other countries.
I wonder if Mr Fischler is in a position to consider that farmers should must farm 80% or more of their land?
If not, we will put a false floor under rented land and active farmers will not be able to afford it.
Farmers who want to fill out the 100% of their base-year area are going to have to take that land.
A distortion is being introduced into the market as a result of this requirement, and I would urge Mr Fischler to do all he can to ensure that the land is in the hands of the best farmers to farm it.
That is one of the principles of decoupling.
Â Â  This item has been dealt with.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs:
- A5-0402/2003 by Mr Van den Berg, on European governance (COM(2002) 704 COM(2002) 705 COM(2002) 713 C5-0200/2003 2003/2085(INI)); and
- A5-0401/2003 by Mr MacCormick, on the communication from the Commission: a framework for contracts and tripartite agreements between the Community, the States and the regional and local authorities (COM(2002) 709 C5-0202/2003 2003/2088(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Europe must do better on behalf of its citizens.
That means dealing successfully with more cross-border problems, and in a more democratic manner.
Order should be restored to our European home, at which citizens from across the EU are casting quite sceptical glances.
Over the past year, we had a Convention which resulted in a Constitution, at least in draft form.
That is, in itself, very good news for the European citizens, as we have mentioned before.
There are other ways of restoring order to our European home, though.
The report I am presenting to you this evening on behalf of our Commission is also about better, more democratic and more transparent governance.
Even without adapting the European treaties, we can implement substantial reforms.
Enhancing European governance is one of the Prodi Commission's key strategic objectives for the period 2000-2004.
In 2001, we issued the White Paper on European Governance, on which we in this House gave our opinion.
Two years later, we are doing the same thing again, only this time it is about progress in respect of the same White Paper.
Some important achievements have been made.
For example, in April 2002, the Commission started simplifying legislation, which was reduced by no fewer than 35Â 000 pages.
This is an important contribution to the simplification of European governance.
In addition, the Commission has published plans in the field of consultation of regional and local authorities, of organisations in the civil society and for consultation with experts.
I should like to return to some of these subjects, but what matters now is for all of these plans to be implemented. Not merely lip service, but concrete action!
The Commission can do a great deal more in order to actively bring Europe closer to the citizen.
I have, in this report, made various proposals to this effect.
The first, and most important, proposal is, in my opinion, that all legislative proposals should be subject to a so-called citizens' criterion.
This means that for every law that the Commission lays down, it should think about their social, ecological and economic impact on everyday life of the citizens for whom these are established.
That is the only way of ensuring that we come down from our ivory tower and that we no longer issue laws in a vacuum or from the top down.
I would call on my fellow MEPs and the Commission to support this initiative.
Parallel to this, I should like to place special emphasis on the Commissionâs use of experts at an early stage in the legislative process.
First of all, I have to say that experts are extremely useful.
Secondly, I have to note that there is an enormous jungle and also a proliferation of expert groups, both on a permanent and on an ad-hoc basis.
There are 850 groups of experts and another 500 or more sub-groups.
Nobody, not even the Commission, quite knows exactly who is involved in these.
Parliament has already urged the Commission to publish clear lists specifying which experts can be consulted on which topics.
In that way, Parliament and the Council, and I even think the Commission, gain a clear insight into who exactly examines these legislative proposals and into the fundamental policy choices that are made during the policy-forming process.
When those lists become available, this will benefit us all.
I would call on the Commission finally to do something about these lists after three years of promises, for we want a parliamentary democracy and not a democracy of experts.
Another important point that I have mentioned is Global Governance.
Multilateralism and a broad concept of safety, which include peace and security, but also the fight against poverty and sustainable development, have always been at the heart of foreign policy.
It is time for the European Union, the UNâs largest economic superpower, to commit itself to spreading its values at world level during the reform of multilateral institutions.
However, we want the EU to speak with one voice in this respect, starting, if possible, with one seat in the Security Council.
Finally, turning to the consultation of organisations, I have quite specifically underlined the need for local and regional authorities to be among the bodies consulted.
'Europe begins in the regions'.
After all, it is the regions where policy is to be implemented and where many of Europe's funds are spent.
The regions are also the places with which citizens identify, sometimes even more so than with their own capitals, certainly when regions transcend borders.
That is why it is important for regional authorities to have their own voice and to be given this in the legislative process.
The Commission has grasped this well and is showing itself willing to do something about this.
We would now like to see this translated into action.
On the same subject, Mr MacCormick has drafted a very important report on tripartite contracts and agreements.
These contracts with Member States and regional authorities can be a very useful instrument, enabling Europe to start to bring the region nearer and give it actual shape.
European governance thus becomes more efficient and moves closer to the citizen.
We warmly support the gist of Mr MacCormick's report.
Finally, I should like to emphasise here that it is the responsibility of all institutions to achieve credible, transparent and democratic governance.
It is not simply the responsibility of the Commission, but of all Institutions.
This is why, in this report, we call for an interinstitutional agreement in the area of consultation, to be binding upon all institutions.
The reforms contained in the White Paper on Governance are of major importance for Europe and for its citizens.
What matters now is for us to roll up our sleeves and get down to business.
I thank you for the slightly extended speaking time.
Â Â  . Mr President, my report is on the proposal for tripartite contracts and agreements between the European authorities and the Member States, and local and regional authorities.
This is, one might think, rather a mouthful for what is essentially a simple idea.
The point is, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy pointed out in its opinion on this matter, much of the implementation of important aspects of European policy environmental policy, regional policy and other policies, including transport is carried out in Member States at a level of government below that of the centralised state government.
And yet there is a danger of inadequate connection between the Commission, at the centre, and local and regional government.
Any steps that can be taken to improve these connections are greatly to be welcomed and much to be encouraged.
The Commission's proposal on tripartite contracts and agreements is a proposal for precisely such an improvement, and therefore my Group strongly welcomes it.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Environment Committee also welcome it and wish to carry it forward.
One of the first pilot arrangements in terms of a tripartite agreement was among cities.
It was based on the idea of a sustainable city for example Birmingham, Stockholm and other cities in the Union.
It was about trying to figure out ways to make sustainability make sense.
One of the interesting facts I discovered in reading a report on that pilot project was that the city of Birmingham could write to the central government in London and go for weeks or months without receiving a reply.
Central governments in Member States are often very bad at maintaining adequate contact with local and city authorities and with city regions.
If we are going to make progress in implementing policies in Europe, it is obvious that we must make sure there is interaction between central government, local government and government at the European level.
It is important to stress and I address in particular my friend and opponent Mr Bradbourn on this point that this suggestion for tripartite contracts and agreements is not only a suggestion about regional government of which I know Mr Bradbourn disapproves it is also a suggestion about local government, of which I rather think he and his party strongly approve.
We must ensure that there is real contact and connectivity and that we get things moving.
Sometimes in this House we use the word 'region' in a very misleading sense.
For example, Scotland, the constituency which I represent, is for some purposes called a region.
But most of the inhabitants of Scotland think it is a nation within a multinational state.
And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions.
Only yesterday I was visiting the South of Scotland Partnership, who were discussing some of the particular problems facing the rural south of Scotland, which is very different linguistically, culturally, socially and agriculturally from central Scotland and from highland Scotland.
They raised with me the problem of the town - the old borough.
Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns.
Cities and regions have great identity but towns, in our local government system, have lost that.
The sustainable city is currently being trialled as a pilot project.
What about the sustainable town?
We must look at governance in Europe at many levels: the region, the locality, and entities which are lower than the locality in terms of current governmental structures.
All these things matter.
The report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee needs to be amended, not in such a way as to break the spirit of what was agreed in that Committee, but in a way that completes that spirit by building in some of the points agreed on by the Environment Committee, all of the points agreed on by the Legal Affairs Committee, and some of the things which have emerged from the pilot projects under way.
I strongly commend the report in its amended form to the House, and I very much hope that it will be carried in the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the two reports by MrÂ van den Berg and Sir Neil MacCormick.
The Commission is grateful for Parliamentâs support for its initiatives seeking to produce better regulation, by for example arranging impact assessments, setting minimum requirements for the consultation of stakeholders, laying down guidelines for the collection and use of expertise and simplifying Community legislation.
Next week the Commission will table its annual report entitled âBetter Lawmaking 2003â, which will for the first time provide an overview of all of the work currently underway to improve regulation and policy-making in the EU.
With the same intention, Parliament, the Council and the Commission recently concluded the 2003 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking.
This is a major step in the right direction and ensures that the competences of all of the institutions will be fully respected in our future work to achieve better regulation.
Today, however, I should like to focus on the two key issues that have been raised by MrÂ van den Berg, namely the consultation of stakeholders or interested parties and the advice that experts should contribute.
What are the principles and minimum standards for the consultation of interested parties?
Our first task is to provide a coherent and transparent framework for the consultation of these groups.
Here the Commission fully shares the European Parliamentâs opinion that consultation cannot be a substitute for parliamentary democracy and emphasises that the aim of having minimum requirements for consultation is to give stakeholders a voice, but not a vote.
In other words, this is not about deciding, but about being heard.
The representatives of the people of Europe will still have to decide.
Neither will these measures impact on the institutional role of the two advisory bodies, the EESC and the CoR.
The general principles and minimum requirements for consultation set out by the Commission could also serve as a basis for a further interinstitutional agreement.
The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the consultation process must not be allowed to slow down the legislative process and stresses that the minimum eight-week consultation period for public consultations strikes a good balance between the need for efficient decision-making and gaining the necessary input from external parties.
To make the consultation process more transparent, the Commission has published a formal and structured list of advisory bodies.
This information can be retrieved from the database of advisory bodies.
Establishing guidelines for the collection and use of expertise is a further important Commission measure to improve the way in which initiatives are prepared.
As we have underlined in the White Paper, European governance standards for the collection and use of expertise need to be improved.
The guidelines, which apply to any Commission services calling on and using expert advice, seek precisely to guarantee that high standards and tried and tested practices form an integrated part of the working culture of all of the Commission services.
Careful preparation, however, is not the only way in which the Commission needs to improve the quality of its work; it must also make this process more transparent.
For this reason, next week the Commission will be adopting a new standard explanatory memorandum for all of its proposals, which will make it necessary to explain the reasoning and facts underlying each one.
This decision also covers expert knowledge and the consultation of interested parties.
I should now like to turn to Sir Neil MacCormickâs report on tripartite contracts and agreements.
The approach adopted in this report is in tune with the Commission proposal and is as ambitious as it is sensible.
It is ambitious, because it seeks to enhance the status of local and regional authorities and to give them increased responsibility for implementing Community regulations and measures, something which is being advocated increasingly vociferously.
This should bring the Unionâs regions closer to each other.
The conclusion of tripartite contracts or agreements may be an interesting development when implementing particular Community policies.
At the same time, however, it is also a sensible approach, because we do not question the need to proceed step by step.
The Commission had the same idea in mind when it adopted the communication on tripartite contracts and agreements last December, as it had promised to do in the White Paper on European Governance.
There too we proposed first to have a trial period.
This phase has already begun.
In environment policy, work is already underway in three European cities on an initiative to conclude a tripartite agreement.
Tripartite agreements might also soon be concluded as part of measures to implement the Sustainability Pacts initiative.
In regional policy, the Commission is convinced that greater decentralisation is needed.
Tripartite contracts between the Commission, the Member State and the region might possibly form part of a new system to implement the Structural Funds.
In addition, this would also transfer even more responsibility to the regions and those involved in regional development.
We must, however, exercise a degree of caution.
Firstly, as the rapporteur has requested, we must take stock of the pilot phase and evaluate the results.
Secondly, we need to consider what legal, political or institutional stumbling blocks might in certain cases lie in the way of using such agreements.
In regional policy in particular, I should therefore like to draw a distinction between two phases: the phase of determining the development strategy, where greater involvement on the part of authorities below the State level is desirable â provided that it is compatible with the constitutional system of the Member State concerned â and then the implementation phase.
Here we need to consider what impact these new contracts might have on applying the rules on the use of budgetary resources and on the obligations that the Commission has to discharge as the guardian of the treaties.
In addition, we need to check to what extent there is a danger of the Commission having to take on extra administrative and monitoring tasks.
Finally, I should like to assure the rapporteur that, in accordance with his wishes, the Commission fully intends to involve Parliament in the implementation and evaluation of future tripartite agreements.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr van den Berg for the wonderful report he has presented and I would also like to thank him for having taken up the ideas which, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have presented in my opinion report on the central idea that in modern societies civil society is expressed by means of the vote and by means of representative bodies elected by the citizens.
This is the central idea which the rapporteur has taken up very well in his main report.
Secondly, I believe that significant progress has been made in recent months with the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement, between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on the improvement of Community legislation.
I believe this is an issue on which we will continue to work, as the Commissioner himself, Mr Fischler, has said.
It seems to me essential, however, to point out that there is a mistaken idea that the reduction of Community legislation reduces the total amount of legislation.
Nothing could be more wrong, because every time we adopt a Community rule we are simplifying the legislation by replacing 15 pieces of national legislation.
And it is not that I am in favour of adopting Community rules just for the sake of it, but, at the moment, we are dealing with a genuine legislative jungle.
Only very positive action by the European Union can put an end to the national legislative jungle which prevents the proper functioning of the European institutions and the European market, the internal market, which is one of our objectives.
I am not, therefore, one of those people who call on the Commission to legislate less or who propose less legislation.
I would ask it to legislate more when it is necessary, because if it does not fulfil its legislative function we will continue with this jungle which, furthermore, can only increase.
With 25 Member States each Community rule represents a genuine legislative simplification and the way ahead does not involve a reduction in the Community acquis but in strengthening it and consolidating it.
In any event, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr van den Berg.
I hope that tomorrow we can approve this report without any great difficulty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech concerns the MacCormick report, which deals with European governance andÂ âÂ as the rapporteur rightly mentionedÂ âÂ Europe united in diversity.
The Commission communication on which this debate is based, and to which Commissioner Fischler made a timely reference earlier, proposes tripartite contracts and agreements committing the Community, the States and regional and local authorities.
It proposes this in order to make Community rules adaptable to situations that are characterised by significant environmental and demographic diversities as well as to the political diversities of the Union, from transport policy to regional, territorial policies and so on. This is an important decision, although it must be noted that it will start an experimental phase in which we must take stock in order to learn the necessary lessons, which will partially be procedural ones but whichÂ âÂ as has already been saidÂ âÂ will also concern the best management of Community regional policies.
We know that, in any case, these are agreements bound by an obligation of compatibility with the Treaties regulating the life of the European Union and adjustments that must not hinder the functioning of the internal market.
Basically, the principle to which the Commission refers in this communication, which is accurately interpreted in the MacCormick report, is that of flexibility.
This principle entails respecting the various constitutional systems of the States of the Union, but it recognises that in some States there are constitutional systems that assign huge responsibilities to regional and local authorities, which must not be reduced despite the fact that, in such cases, the need for greater democratic participation must not cause imbalances that would run counter to the guidelines produced by the constituent Convention.
Tripartite contracts cannot, however, derogate from the provisions of secondary law applicable throughout the territory of the European Union becauseÂ âÂ as I mentioned earlierÂ âÂ it is only in this way that they remain coherent with the guidelines of the constituent Convention.
We need to improve the implementation of Community policy.
It is, therefore, important that the tripartite agreements and contracts define clear objectives based on the need to give due consideration to diversity throughout the territory of the European Union, although, on the basis of these experiences, it will then be possible to look again at a policy for the management of Community policies that goes beyond the issue of diversity and tackles the more general issue of democracy in greater depth without, however, compromisingÂ âÂ and I believe that this must be emphasisedÂ âÂ the uniform enforcement of Community law across the entire European area.
Â Â  Mr President, we are debating the regulatory framework for future contracts and tripartite agreements between the Community, the States and regional and local authorities.
I would like to stress how necessary it is for the intra-State administrations to collaborate, increasing subsidiarity, in order to achieve the objectives which we have set in the majority of programmes and projects stemming from the European cohesion and environmental policies, and also in order to guarantee sustainability.
I am thinking of the FIFG funds and programmes for the fisheries sector, or LEADER + for agriculture for the target regions of FEDER or the URBAN and Interreg projects, amongst others, in which the participation and responsibility of the territorial bodies is so essential.
I am also convinced, however, that the fact that a significant proportion of the important Community resources which are budgeted for are not used â the so-called RALs â is due to the fact that the regional and local autonomous governments, which execute the majority of projects, have not so far been able to participate in the early phase, either in the drawing up of policies, or in the adoption of strategies, or in the identification of legal obligations prior to drawing up of the respective European programmes.
It is time to put things right, to come down from Mount Olympus and to share decision-making with the other institutions which are closer to the reality on the ground and the reality of the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to speak specifically and directly in response to Sir Neil MacCormick's report on tripartite contracts.
I hope I will be able to respond to a number of the points he made in his opening remarks.
In the light of current events in the UK, this report centres on an extremely important issue.
The UK Deputy Prime Minister a hapless fellow if ever there was one is trying to foist regional governance upon our own electorate.
This unwanted and completely unnecessary tier of politicians is symbolic of the UK's recent shift towards regionalisation.
I have no doubt this move is directly related to the President of the Commission's call for the development of a 'Europe of the regions'.
This report, and the Commission proposal that lies behind it, certainly echo this call.
By drawing up contracts directly with the regions, the Commission can enter into legally-binding agreements with local and regional bodies on regional and other policy issues such as the environment.
If these proposals go ahead, one can imagine all manner of projects and policies which could be foisted on the UK by the back door.
This move clearly represents a slippery slope towards a system where the prerogatives of national governments are diminished and those of the regions are enhanced.
It appears to me that the Commission is attempting progressively to break down the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe into bite-sized chunks, aided and abetted, in this case, by our own government.
British Conservatives are opposed to any measure which would bolster such a development.
I shall certainly vote against this report tomorrow in plenary.
Quite simply, we cannot accept a situation where the Commission foists upon us any changes to the UK's government structures.
If we accept that the EU can deal directly in any way with the regions, we are compromising national integrity, and the nation as the prime building-block of the EU.
This report represents an unacceptable interference in the governance of individual countries, and I reject the approach entirely.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
I want to stress the vital importance of an ever more transparent administrative culture in the European Union if we are to gain the approval of its citizens.
Obscurity leads to complete darkness, as we know.
It is essential to simplify legislation.
The public must be able to understand how this whole place works, and it is absolutely necessary to replace mind-boggling legal texts with something that is more streamlined, and I am in favour of that.
It is unnecessary to regulate the details, as has been mentioned here.
That is our disease.
I would nevertheless like to make one additional amendment, which is already contained in this report.
The Union supports the one-stop shop principle in all areas.
According to this, people can always obtain the information and forms they need at one and the same point.
As yet, however, the different institutions of the Union do not share a common website where the public could follow the progress of legislation.
Discussions by Parliament, the Commission and the Council on legal issues and other projects should be accessible at one website address.
The institutions at least need a common portal, like a one-stop shop, where all the necessary links can be found.
The Commission and Parliament have become more transparent, but the Council has not.
The Council is to have more power, which means more obscurity.
This issue has to be addressed.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be brief.
Firstly, I should like to thank you for your constructive contributions to this debate on the two reports.
Secondly, I should like to address a few of the points that have been raised.
I think â as MrÂ Medina Ortega rightly pointed out â that the main way in which European legislative initiatives will be simplified is that in the future it will be possible to consolidate 25 different legal acts into one single one.
I do not believe that this can be stressed enough, particularly given that the institutions of the European Union are, as we know, constantly being accused of being somewhat legislation-happy.
The reality is rather different.
You are probably aware that we did actually look into this a few years ago and it turned out that the Member States introduce more new pieces of legislation every year than the Community has introduced since its inception.
This is a clear indication that you are right to make this assertion.
Nevertheless, this does not absolve us from our obligation also to organise our European laws properly: organise their preparation, but also how they are structured, so that they meet the appropriate standards of transparency and clarity.
Above all, however, it will be important to identify what these days we often refer to as âEuropean added valueâ, because any legislative initiatives with no such added value should have a large question mark over them.
This is an important point, particularly in the light of the new European constitution, which specifically states that legislation should be subject to such a test.
As far as tripartite contracts are concerned, I certainly do believe that it is sensible to conclude such tripartite contracts, and I do not agree with MrÂ Bradbourn, who thinks that they would ride roughshod over national interests.
For a start, one of the three parties to these contracts will be the Member State.
Without the agreement of the Member State such a contract does not even come into being.
I therefore do not understand your fears at all.
I would tend to see this the other way round.
I regard it as important, particularly for example in structural policy or in my own area, rural development policy, for us to make greater use of the bottom-up approach and to allow that to become a reality, because this gives the people on the ground a better idea of who is responsible for their problems.
That is how you should look at it, and that is why we have also taken the precaution of first having a trial period and then an evaluation. That is as it were the icing on the cake.
Having said this, I should like to thank you once more for giving such a favourable response to these reports.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0393/2003) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission report on the assessment of the activities of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (COM(2003) 154 2002/2237(INI))
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, allow me to begin with a brief flashback.
Five years ago almost to the day, on 2Â December 1998, this House held a heated debate here in Brussels with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Santer.
With hindsight, this debate marked the beginning of the end of the former Commission.
The issue then, as it is now, was combating fraud and the conclusions that the Commission needed to draw from several serious cases.
At the time, the President of the Commission decided to head for a confrontation with Parliament.
Against the declared will of this House, he wanted to move most of the responsibility for fighting fraud out of the Commission and into an external agency, on the grounds that this was the only way to guarantee the independence of investigations.
We rejected this very firmly, because no one was able to tell us where this agency was supposed to derive its authority from and how the effectiveness of its work was supposed to be ensured.
This fantasy of an external agency has resurfaced in recent months in connection with the debate on the Eurostat case, thankfully, it seems, at least only in the minds of a handful of senior officials in the Commission.
The signals that we received from the President of the Commission, MrÂ Prodi, in Strasbourg in November pointed in another, more constructive direction.
Today, a good five months before the Members of this House bid one another a final farewell and head for the campaign trail, it is a question of identifying what is feasible and tackling this together, so that on such a decisive issue as protecting the Unionâs financial interests we do not have to go before our electorate empty-handed.
I now turn to the individual points.
My report makes it very clear that our prime concern is that OLAF is underperforming, something that was brought to light very dramatically by the Eurostat case.
This is not the time to apportion blame, but if we note that of the 300 staff in OLAF fewer than 15, even on a generous count, are at present working on internal investigations in the institutions, then something has gone seriously wrong.
If that is the case then this office is, to put it inelegantly, completely off the mark.
A quick and radical change of course is required here.
OLAF needs to focus its investigations on those areas in which the relevant bodies in the Member States either cannot or do not wish to intervene, that is on investigations within the institutions and on the expenditure that is managed directly by the Commission.
My second point is respect for the fundamental rights of those involved in investigations.
The OLAF Regulation is absolutely clear on this.
I quote: âThese investigations must be conducted âŠ with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value.â
We take it from the reports and opinions of the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but also from the Ombudsmanâs reports, that this is where the greatest danger currently lies.
In this respect, the regulation is quite simply being ignored by the Officeâs investigators.
I only have to remind you of the most recent example, the reprimand issued by the Ombudsman last week against OLAF in connection with the libelling of a journalist in public statements made by the Office.
If the fundamental freedoms of those concerned are not respected then at the end of the day the results of the investigations are also worthless, and I fear that, as a result, OLAF still has some nasty surprises in store in connection with Eurostat.
What is lacking is an effective and above all preventive monitoring mechanism to enforce the provisions of the regulation.
This is an area where we need to take countermeasures by amending the regulation itself.
We do not wish to touch the Directorâs decision-making powers, but we need a stronger counterbalance.
This counterbalance is the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but on three conditions: firstly, that the amendment concerned explicitly confers upon it the power to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and rights of those involved in investigations are respected; secondly, that it receives the additional resources to enable it to carry out this task, and thirdly, last but not least, that it has greater independence from the Director of OLAF, not only by increasing the number of staff in the Committeeâs secretariat, but also by removing it from the organisational framework of both OLAF and the Commission.
Targeting resources on investigative activities and stepping up the monitoring of these investigative activities are the key points that now need to be addressed where OLAF is concerned.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have done our work well in the committee.
We are fulfilling our responsibilities to our electorate and to the Unionâs taxpayers.
I therefore commend this report to the House.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ BÃ¶sch, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was, as you mentioned, established in 1999.
This office became the focus for most of the Commissionâs work to fight against fraud and OLAF was given the task and the right to carry out investigations in any of the European institutions if fraud was suspected.
OLAF was entrusted with extensive responsibilities and, as the latest OLAF activity report shows, it has already notched up clear successes in many areas.
OLAF carries out its administrative investigations, whether internal or external, completely independently, even though the office is established within the Commission.
This dual status has raised both problems and questions, as can be seen from the report that we are debating today.
At issue in todayâs debate is the BÃ¶sch report on the Commissionâs so-called ArticleÂ 15 report.
This sounds very technical, but it is a tremendously important debate, because it is about the future of OLAF, which, let us not forget, is still a very young office.
The Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶sch, for his hard work.
The evaluation of OLAFâs activities over the last three years, which is the subject of the report, has been largely eclipsed by the Eurostat affair.
Nevertheless, the findings and analyses in the report are essentially still valid, even though the views of the rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶sch, differ from our own in many respects.
It is true, however, that the Eurostat affair did highlight existing shortcomings, in particular the question of communication between OLAF and the Commission, and OLAFâs legal framework, which was adopted in record time in 1999, needs to be adjusted accordingly.
This does not mean, however â and here the Commission agrees with the rapporteur â that we need to go back to square one.
At the present time, this would not appear to be either proper or realistic.
In any case, greater changes are in the offing for OLAF, at the latest once we achieve our aim of setting up a European financial prosecution service.
The Commission is continuing to lobby very vigorously for the European financial prosecution service to be enshrined in the new constitution, and we then propose to table a White Paper.
I now turn to your report.
In it, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises various aspects of OLAFâs work, in particular its investigative activities and its priorities.
Although I understand the rapporteurâs displeasure, I do not think that the criticism is entirely fair on all counts.
OLAF has a difficult transitional period behind it.
It would be wrong to view and assess OLAF through the Eurostat lens alone and not to include other essential work in the evaluation, whether it be in customs or cooperating with the enlargement countries to fight fraud â a very important field â or in the legislative area.
Despite the criticism from the Committee on Budgetary Control, I do not think that Parliamentâs and the Commissionâs positions are actually all that far apart.
What we all want is a proportionate reform of OLAF, that can be dealt with if possible in this parliamentary session.
This is a starting point for us to work together.
On 18Â November, President Prodi outlined the essential features of the proposed improvements in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I take it from your speech, MrÂ BÃ¶sch, that you too would agree with their general thrust.
The Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control agree that OLAF should concentrate more on its core activities.
I should, however, also like to scotch the rumours that could be heard after the President of the Commission had made his speech, namely that if Commission officials were suspected of fraud the Commission wanted to take control of the internal investigations away from OLAF.
Let me be quite clear: this is not true.
Instead, we need to consider whether tasks that are not closely related to OLAFâs specific area of expertise should be moved back to the sectoral directorates-general.
This might apply, in my opinion, to clearance of accounts in agricultural policy for example.
In addition, however, the boundaries between OLAF and other entities with investigative powers, in particular IDOC, need to be more clearly defined.
Moreover, it should also be stated clearly in the regulation itself that it is the Director of OLAF who decides whether or not to open an investigation, that it is the discretionary principle that applies.
This too will contribute to ensuring that the office concentrates on its true priorities.
The information flow between OLAF and the institutions needs to be improved considerably.
The Eurostat affair exposed the existing weaknesses in the channels of communication.
Even when investigations are ongoing, the Commission must be able to take precautionary measures to protect the Communityâs financial interests, obviously without jeopardising OLAFâs investigations.
The draft memorandum of understanding between the Commission and OLAF is, in our view, an important and opportune step forward.
However, in the interests of legal security and clarity the OLAF Regulation should also be clarified accordingly and we will obviously also discuss where such clarifications should be introduced and what form they should take.
An important and completely undisputed point is also strengthening the rights of defence of those who are involved in investigations.
The OLAF Manual already contains a whole series of detailed internal rules about this.
The main principles underlying the rights of the people concerned, such as their right to inspect files and to be given a hearing, should however be spelt out in the regulation itself.
In his speech of 18Â November, President Prodi mentioned enhancing the role of the Supervisory Committee or creating an interinstitutional forum as possible ways of improving OLAFâs governance.
The Commission has not yet concluded its reflections on this.
However, I can say that on the whole strengthening the Supervisory Committee, as proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is something with which we can agree, particularly when it comes to examining complaints.
The Supervisory Committee itself has of course made an interesting proposal on this in its opinion.
The Commission cannot, however, accept the rapporteurâs proposal to make the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee part of the European Parliamentâs secretariat.
The proposal raises fundamental questions of interinstitutional balance and also legal issues.
The question of where the secretariat should be located needs to be given thorough consideration.
Neither can the Commission support the other proposals on OLAFâs budgetary status or on the control mechanism within the Commission, because they would call into question key aspects of the reform of our financial management.
I might also remind you that, following the intensive work of Parliament and the Council, the new Financial Regulation only entered into force on 1Â January of this year.
We first need to gain experience with this new legislation.
In any case, it is too early to make significant changes.
It is now a question of acting swiftly â the Commission fully agrees with you here â and of tabling a legislative proposal that has a real chance of being dealt with in this Parliament.
Unfortunately, it will not be possible to do so before the end of this year, as the Committee on Budgetary Control suggests in its report, and I would ask for your understanding in the light of the complex and sensitive nature of the subject.
However, the Commission is confident that it will be able to table a legislative proposal very quickly at the beginning of next year.
We should work on this together.
We will take account of your report and the opinions of the Supervisory Committee in our work and considerations.
The Commission is prepared to cooperate extensively with Parliament and, in the interests of effective fraud prevention in the European Union, our joint overriding objective should be to create a solid and workable basis for OLAFâs future work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, work on the BÃ¶sch report was obviously overshadowed by the Eurostat affair.
In its efforts to shed light on the Eurostat affair â its secret bank accounts, mis-management and nepotism â the Committee on Budgetary Control also uncovered significant shortcomings within OLAF.
In this case, OLAFâs main failing was to work too slowly.
In so doing it missed the opportunity to recover a considerable proportion of the at least EURÂ 8 million that had been embezzled.
I believe, however, that the report adequately reflects the various criticisms of OLAFâs work.
One thing must surely be clear to all of us, and it is clear: the real guilty party in this more than dramatic case of fraud is not OLAF but the Commission.
They hushed it up and issued denials for so long that they had no choice but to continue doing so.
And the Commissioners responsible, including the President of the Commission, are still refusing to accept the political, as well as the actual, responsibility for this embezzlement.
On top of this, the Commission tabled its report â this ArticleÂ 15 report â more than one year late.
That is not very respectful of the law either, Commissioner.
In our view, Eurostat showed above all how necessary it is to have an anti-fraud office, if the Prodian zero tolerance of fraud is not to mutate into full tolerance of fraud.
We want an independent OLAF and we continue to need a strong OLAF Supervisory Committee, made up of external experts.
An independent OLAF is still far from being a reality, because unfortunately the Commission repeatedly manages to exert influence because of its links to OLAF in terms of organisation and staffing.
The Commissionâs attempt to take internal investigations away from OLAF, which only recently came to light, is a perfect example.
Commissioner, that was not a rumour, as you have just claimed; a meeting really did take place.
If your top officials did not inform you of it then I can give you sight of the minutes of that meeting.
The Commission has an inexhaustible wealth of ideas in this respect, with which it now even appears to want to honour the OLAF Supervisory Committee.
So far it has tended to be seen as a nuisance, but now, so we hear from the Commission, representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are to be involved to make it more democratic.
This would, however, only serve to undermine OLAFâs independence further and we will certainly not be accompanying you down this precarious route, Commissioner.
OLAFâs work will also continue to be difficult.
We are aware of this.
That is why, alongside strong, unswayable managers, we also need clear framework conditions.
There is still a long way to go before we have a European financial prosecution service, but I hope that there will be no turning back.
I am not able to support most of the amendments tabled by the Liberals and Greens, with two exceptions, but we can go along with most of the PSEâs amendments and I would ask for your support for our ten amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, as we are reminded in Mr BÃ¶schâs meticulous and exhaustive report, OLAFâs current director took office three and a half years ago.
This body has grown so much that it now has 364 members of staff.
The time for expectations, transitions and adjustment is, therefore, over.
The time has definitely come for a balance sheet, for an evaluation and for accountability.
The audit that has been planned for OLAF is crucial, as is moving from the current âSupervisory Committeeâ, which is simply a figurehead, to a monitoring, evaluation and decision-making body with ultimate authority.
Our Committee on Budgetary Control has always viewed OLAF as a working instrument for a European Prosecution Service, an institution made increasingly necessary by the growth and sophistication of transnational European crime.
The outcome of the current Intergovernmental Conference will consequently be crucial.
We must ask ourselves whether, until OLAF is given the status of a European Prosecution Service, it makes sense to continue investing in police action that this organisation cannot legally pursue and instead employ auditing methods that are used in all financial crime-fighting and which no financial investigation body can do without.
Clearly contributing to OLAFâs poor performance in the recent Eurostat case was a lack of understanding of basic concepts of communication and information, and an imbalance between the interests in play.
Another contributing factor was the lack of auditors, whose skills must always be at the heart of combating financial fraud or irregularities.
This is a time for rigour, strictness, hard work, professionalism, balance, reason and common sense and this is precisely what we hope to see OLAF achieve.
Â Â  MrÂ President, recent events, which have very much pushed OLAF into the limelight, have lent this assessment great importance and relevance.
I should like to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports a strong, independent OLAF.
Briefly, I am also of the opinion that reform of OLAF is needed â reform that should focus on the following matters: the whole issue of OLAFâs independence and the fact that OLAF must prioritise its tasks to a greater extent and concentrate its resources on its core task, which is to clear up cases involving fraud and irregularities.
The time taken to deal with cases must be reduced, and the channels of communication between the Commission and the Commissioners responsible must be improved.
In the interests of the division of responsibilities and of the possibility of cutting losses, it is crucial that the Director-General and Commissioner responsible are notified as soon â and in as much detail â as possible.
MrÂ BÃ¶sch has done sterling work in this House in relation to OLAF over a long period.
Nevertheless, in our opinion, this report does not quite measure up to our aims.
I do not think that it is Parliamentâs business to determine OLAFâs internal organisation and staff policy.
Nor do I think that it is right to bring the OLAF Supervisory Committee under the European Parliament.
It must be fully independent of all the institutions.
Nor do I think that it is necessarily a particularly good idea to give us a special legal officer for the rights of the individual.
The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombudsman.
Finally, I also think that it is important that this report be about OLAF.
Other things should be dealt with separately.
An example is the proposal regarding the Commissionâs accountant in paragraphÂ 16.
Finally, I should like to express my regret once again that our committee has not had a proper opportunity to debate extensive amendments to the original text of this report, and I should like to call for Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the ELDR Group, so that we, too, can support, or vote in favour of, the final report during the final vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to give MrÂ BÃ¶sch the highest praise for a splendid report, which is both penetrating and thorough, and I should like to say to MrsÂ Schreyer, who is my favourite Commissioner: you should ask someone else to write your speeches instead of coming out with the nonsense we have heard this evening.
It is unacceptable.
There has been a great deal of criticism of OLAF of late, and rightly so, but OLAF must not be made a scapegoat for the Eurostat case, for example.
The Commission must not use OLAF as a dustbin for all the cases it does not feel like dealing with itself.
Even if a case has been forwarded to OLAF, that does not release the Commission from its obligation to act.
OLAF must be fully independent, and we must admit that we were wrong to set OLAF up as an administrative part of the Commission.
The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee must be fully independent of the Commission.
The staff working for OLAF must be independent of all the institutions, and it is important that staff are not allowed to apply for posts in the Commission afterwards, because we have of course seen examples of cases being shelved because people had to go back to the Commission.
I telephoned OLAF about Eurostat in the spring of 2002, after Dorte Schmidt-Brown had contacted me for the first time.
OLAF told me that it had neither the time, the inclination nor the staff to look over the Eurostat case.
In their words, Dorte Schmidt-Brown was a hysterical woman who should try to relax a little.
It was not until Parliament became vociferous on the subject that the investigations picked up speed.
It is very worrying that OLAF only prioritises investigations that have the interest of Parliament or the press, and it is also very worrying that OLAF does not take whistle-blowers seriously.
I hope that we do not see any more of this kind of case.
It is absolutely crucial that we are able to rely on OLAFâs objectivity, and that people work quickly and effectively in the future, but I should also say that OLAF is not known for being the sharpest tool in the box.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to thank the rapporteur for his comprehensive work.
On this occasion, unfortunately, we are unable to support him on all points, and we regret that there was not enough time left for a discussion of the individual amendments before the vote in committee.
We identify two main problems with the amendments.
Firstly, we are in favour of strengthening the Supervisory Committee, but we are also against the Supervisory Committee then being allocated to the European Parliament.
If a Supervisory Committee is to be genuinely independent in its evaluations, it should be independent of Parliament as well.
At the moment, we can perceive another tendency in the current debate about the Supervisory Committee.
It is extremely regrettable that there is still no European Public Prosecutor at present and that we will probably have to wait some time for this.
However, we should not now make the mistake of trying to achieve a transitional solution which pushes the Supervisory Committee vicariously into this role, as this would not be the appropriate role.
What we need, in the long term, is judicial control of OLAF, but this can only be provided by the European Public Prosecutor, not by a substitute committee.
We take an equally critical view of another problem.
We see that Parliament is increasingly seeking to involve itself in OLAFâs internal affairs, and we do not think this is right.
We take the view that OLAF must be â and must remain â genuinely independent, but this does not mean that its independence from the Commission is necessarily strengthened if this House gets involved in micromanaging OLAF at the same time.
That is quite wrong, in our view.
Genuine independence also means administrative independence.
Overall, I think we need a thorough rethink of the amendments.
I hope that we can achieve a compromise that a majority in the committee can support.
I would also, however, like to make one thing clear to MrsÂ Stauner. We will not support most of your amendments, for we think it wrong that they should contain an implicit vote of no confidence in OLAF and apportion blame â also in a one-sided way â as regards the Commissionâs role in the Eurostat affair.
This is something we will not go along with.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to thank MrÂ BÃ¶sch for a splendid, extremely thorough report, the conclusions of which we can support, on the whole.
It could of course be said that the advisability of Parliament giving such detailed rules for the reform of OLAF is doubtful, but, as the Commission has been unable to create a functioning monitoring body, Parliament must of course attend to it.
It is we who must be answerable to citizens in the last instance for the way in which their money is managed.
In the past, we had UCLAF, but that did not function perfectly.
Then OLAF came along, and obviously we are now seeing that that has not improved matters as desired.
I agree with the criticism, in itself, that several of my fellow Members have made regarding the causes of OLAFâs inability to function.
In the late seventies, there was a joke in my country stemming from the fact that there was a main post office that did not function properly.
We were discussing what to do if a nuclear power station were built.
There was a problem with the waste, and the joke was that the solution was to package the waste up and send it to the main post office, where it would go round and round in an eternal cycle until the radiation had diminished.
The Commission has actually used OLAF in a similar way.
Things have gone on far too long, have lain unattended for too long, and it is incomprehensible to us, especially in relation to the Eurostat case, that OLAFâs management was able to say to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in deadly earnest, that cases have been kept secret from the Commission so as not to burden the Commission with the unpleasant knowledge of what has happened.
This gives a very amateurish impression.
In fact, it could of course be life-threatening to the Commission not to be informed.
We do not really believe that it would be very helpful to put new committees above the existing Supervisory Committee, nor do we have much faith in the idea of a European Public Prosecutor.
Indeed, what is important is to bring about a sea change in our approach towards dealing with the EUâs economy as a whole.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this debate should have taken place last year.
The rapporteur cannot be blamed for this, as he drafted a sound report in the shortest possible time.
When the Commission took office, it announced once again that it would apply itself fully to tackling fraud and irregularities in the EU Institutions, justifiably so, for there are billions of euros involved.
The Commission continues to perform in a wholly unsatisfactory manner now that it has submitted this progress report to Parliament more than a year late.
The fraudulent practices surrounding the Eurostat affair illustrated that OLAF should no longer, administratively speaking, fall within the Commission's remit.
The bureau must be given as much independence as possible and be made accountable to Parliament.
I firmly hold the Commissioner to the promise that she made a moment ago to present her proposal to Parliament within two months.
Otherwise, her credibility will really torpedo.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr BÃ¶schâs report is a critical but also a very constructive one, and I congratulate him on his intensive work.
Of course, we could have voted on its outcomes and possible implementation at an earlier stage if the Commission had submitted its evaluation of OLAFâs three years of work on time, as envisaged in the Regulation, instead of over nine months late.
Some of the mismanagement and irregularities could then have been addressed more effectively than is possible now, at the end of the parliamentary term and the Commissionâs term in office.
Eurostat is a case in point.
We know the background to OLAFâs establishment: an interim structure was all that could be achieved because a Treaty amendment was not envisaged at that stage.
As a result, OLAF was in a paradoxical position from the outset.
In its work, it is independent â we insist on that â but it is subordinate to the Commission administration in organisational terms.
Nonetheless, delays, cumbersome processes and inadequate application of the OLAF Regulation by both parties â the Commission and OLAF â have regrettably characterised this agency to date.
Let me cite just a few examples: its protracted recruitment process, its excessively long investigations, its failure to inform the Supervisory Committee as required, and above all the poor training and the failure to adequately respect the defence rights of the individuals under investigation.
I take the Supervisory Committeeâs clear statement on this latter point especially seriously, as it directly highlights the need to create a European Public Prosecutor to protect the Unionâs financial interests.
This House has called for such an appointment for a very long time and the Commission has now added its voice to these calls in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am grateful to President Prodi for now having addressed this issue in his action plan.
The fundamental rights of the individual can only be guaranteed within a judicial framework based on the rule of law.
Until this objective is achieved, I fully support strengthening the Supervisory Committee, both as regards the Secretariat â we need to discuss its allocation to the European Parliament budget â and also, and especially, the appointment of highly qualified, independent persons as members of the Supervisory Committee.
In sum, what we need is not a new regulation but a number of amendments, as the report makes clear.
We need a strong OLAF.
I ask the Commission to take our demands seriously so that we can move closer to a zero tolerance policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate MrÂ BÃ¶sch on the report and express my appreciation of the firm stance he took towards those directly and politically responsible for the fraud who have been charged.
A plea to Commissioner Schreyer: I urge you not to try to play down the Eurostat case which remains one of the most alarming and awkward episodes that the European Parliament has ever faced.
The enormous economic damage caused has not and may never be quantified.
Let us move onto the report.
If what MrÂ BÃ¶sch wrote in the report were to be implemented, then we would live very peacefully in Europe.
Financial interests would hardly be protected; legality would be the key element in all European issues.
If, however, the established principles, which are summarised in Recital G, which state, and I quote, that âthe Commission committed itself to a âzero toleranceâ policy with regard to fraud and irregularitiesâ, are not translated in practice, then everything that is written will not make the immense effort poured by the rapporteur into his report worthwhile and no specific objective will be achieved.
Now, given what has come to light on Eurostat, would it not have been more appropriate to put an amendment tabled by myself to the vote in committeeÂ âÂ although, I am glad to say, MrÂ BÃ¶sch explained this issue â which reads, and I quote: âCan only condemn all the cases in which OLAF has been unable to conclude its investigations within the allotted 9-month time limit, in particular the Eurostat case, which has been suspended for over three years and in respect of which a timely investigation could have broken a chain of events which has now been exposed as anything but straightforward and of which certain elements are under investigation by the judicial authoritiesâ?
This amendment will be put to the vote and, I hope, adopted tomorrow in this Chamber.
At the same time I do not want what I have said about OLAF to be misinterpreted, for it cannot become a scapegoat for fraud perpetrated by others.
This is why OLAF must be able to continue to receive its funding, which must be sufficient to strengthen the staff, in particular the investigation officials.
I completely agree with the rapporteur in ArticleÂ 33(1), when he calls on OLAF to inform the European Parliament in detail if an investigation takes longer than the prescribed nine months.
Coming back to the Eurostat case, which disturbs and irritates many of us, I feel I can say that I certainly agree that our positions should be cautious, but, at the same time, we cannot accept an arrangement, which would mean that it would be seen as counterproductive to place the European Institutions in jeopardy over this case.
We should be discussing and debating something else: in the Eurostat affair, were the contracts concluded properly or did fraud come to light?
If, as would seem the case from reading the reports, many contracts were concluded without lawful signatories, if there were conflicts of interest that led to certain, illegal economic benefits, if documents were systematically lost that should have been subject to control and news published outside that was intended solely to facilitate negotiations, if more than 50% of contracts were concluded with a single bid, then, clearly, damage running into millions of euro has been done to the European Community and this aspect must override everything else, including the preservation of the European institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, with your permission, I would like to respond briefly to a number of points.
There is certainly no doubt that the Eurostat affair is not merely about gross misconduct at Eurostat â and I refrain from using the term âfraudâ simply because the matter is still under judicial investigation and I do not want to be accused of making prejudicial comments.
Mistakes were also made in the Commission, and OLAF should have carried out the investigations more swiftly.
This is why Mr Prodi has also devised an action plan which, on the one hand, contains comprehensive measures regarding Eurostat and, on the other hand, addresses the issue of communication between the departments and the Commissioners, as well as measures relating to OLAF.
Let me say again to Mrs Stauner: the measures relating to OLAF do not include shifting the internal investigations into Commission officials back to the Commission.
On the contrary â and let me quote from Mr Prodiâs speech â the aim is strengthening OLAFâs operational independence by refocusing its activities.
Therefore there might be a case for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations.
I think you know as well as I do that OLAFâs core tasks â in other words, what was reinforced and, in part, newly established in 1999 â are indeed the internal investigations, the rights to conduct internal investigations, and the duties to do so.
I entirely agree with Mr BÃ¶sch that more capacities must be established in these areas.
At the same time, however, it is also true â as the Eurostat case itself has shown â that sometimes an external investigation becomes an internal investigation because the external investigation suddenly raises the question: Why did these mistakes with the competition process occur?
Why are these specific contracts always concluded here?
Let me reiterate one point: the drafting of the action plan which Mr Prodi has outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control is well under way and the text to amend the law of the Regulation will be with you at the start of January, I hope, or at any rate promptly in January.
I see many similar approaches on the issue of the amendment of the Regulation.
Mrs Theato has just mentioned them again.
As the President of the Commission has pledged, we will work very closely on these points with the Committee on Budgetary Control, also in advance of the drafting process.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission should perhaps finally decide whether it is satisfied with OLAFâs work or not.
I almost have the impression that we are criticising OLAF out of the blue, yet I had the feeling that President Prodi has been taking OLAF apart with his criticisms while we have been defending it, since so many Members of this House, speaking in todayâs debate, have stated that Eurostat is not an OLAF matter, it is a Commission matter.
The Commission must finally adopt its own identifiable line here.
Otherwise, I am very pleased that it is happy with everything to do with OLAF.
In that case, though, I really do not want to hear any more, not from the President of the Commission, about the obvious shortcomings, in terms of quality, which have arisen in connection with Eurostat.
That does not mean that we have not moved from our position, and I think there are still a number of misunderstandings as regards the independence of the Supervisory Committee.
The Supervisory Committee must, like OLAFâs Director-General, be appointed on an interinstitutional basis; today, it is part of the Commission, and not â lest any myths arise â in a vacuum.
We think that there must be a separation, and that includes a physical and financial separation.
It is unacceptable that the staffing of the Supervisory Committee, which exercises a monitoring function, should be the ultimate responsibility of a body which is the subject of that monitoring.
We have adopted a firm position here and I hope that this House will endorse this position tomorrow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the message for MrsÂ Schreyer this evening is crystal clear: she should say to MrÂ Prodi that we have no need of his action plans.
They are only there to gain time, to sweep the whole matter under the carpet.
We cannot tolerate this.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0407/2003) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco (COM(2003) 437 C5-0357/2003 2003/0157(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, very warmly for your excellent report and for supporting our proposal.
The Commission has proposed making various changes to the system to promote conversion of fishing vessels and fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco.
We propose the following amendments: compensation will now also be paid to every fisherman who has lost his job because the ship on which he worked has now joined another fishery, for example through a joint enterprise.
This will extend the group of beneficiaries, so we must, therefore, also extend the deadlines by one year so that all new beneficiaries are able to apply for assistance and to give the authorities in Spain and Portugal enough time to make a decision.
I am also willing to accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3.
However, I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna as it calls for an amendment to Article 12 of the Regulation, which governs structural support in the fisheries sector, as regards socio-economic measures.
We cannot amend this Regulation at the present time.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 30Â November 1999 the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Morocco expired, bringing the activities of four thousand three hundred fishermen and four hundred vessels to an end.
Since then, the aid to the people affected entered into force, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999, payable under the FIFG.
This aid was extended to 31Â December 2001, but it was then necessary to implement a policy of converting the fleet, which to a large extent could not be relocated to other fishing grounds.
We therefore approved, and on the basis of national plans, Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001, for the socio-economic diversification of these areas affected by the cessation of activities.
In regions particularly affected, such as el Morrazo, Barbate, Algeciras or Lanzarote, fishing activity was drastically reduced or quite simply disappeared, with repercussions for many other sectors linked to this activity and to local production as a whole.
In order to fund these actions the Solidarity Fund was used, as you know, to the tune of EUR 197 million in total.
The Regulation also provided for derogating measures and exceptions to the legislation defining the methods and conditions for interventions aimed at structuring within the fisheries sector.
Nevertheless, the exceptional nature of the measure led the Council to approve a limited period for it, which has not been sufficient to deal with many of the people affected.
The rigidities of the Regulation have also contributed to this and now, by means of this modification promoted by the European Parliament, they are going to be eliminated.
That is why I am so pleased that Mr Fischler should say that the Commission will accept these modifications and the amendments I propose in my report, because the two of us â Mr Fischler and we, the European Parliament â want the fishermen affected to receive equal treatment, so that they may receive the aid for their conversion, regardless of the fate of the vessel on which they work, because the linking of the fisherman to the fate of the ship has been one of the great difficulties.
In certain cases, the vessels were able to be relocated to other fishing grounds, fishing less than they fished in Moroccan grounds and, therefore, losing income.
These vessels had to reduce their crews.
Nevertheless, the Regulation did not cover these fishermen because it linked the fate of the vessel to that of the fishermen, preventing them from receiving the global premium for their conversion.
Therefore, and so that this Regulation â as both the Commission and the European Parliament want â can in practice deal with the greatest possible number of people affected, we must eliminate the provisions according to which the individual global premiums can only be granted to a vessel or to fishermen who fished in a vessel whose fishing activities have ceased for good.
And the modification we are now debating, as the Commissioner has said, also means extending by twelve months the deadline for eligibility of the expenditure, which will now be 31 December 2004, and the last date for submission to the Commission of the request for payment of the balance, which will now be 30 June 2005.
This is what the representatives of the people affected by the closure of the fishing ground asked us in the Committee on Fisheries, including the Loitamar Cooperative, on the Morrazo peninsula (Galicia), consisting of almost 60 workers who previously fished in Morocco waters, but who have still not been able to fully implement their business project.
Now, with the greater time margin they are being allowed, they will be able to do so, and all the members of this cooperative will be able â as required by the Regulation â to begin to work in order to be able to receive this individual aid.
This was also requested of us by the Government of Andalusia, which, together with Galicia, the Canaries and the Algarve, is one of the regions which has suffered most profoundly from this failure to renew the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
I must say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that this modification, as I propose it, has no financial repercussions, but merely seeks to ensure that the financial resources allocated can be duly disbursed, thereby fulfilling the objective intended by the legislator when the Regulation we are now revising was approved.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs MiguÃ©lez, on her report on a just cause â as others have said â which we have all supported for a very long time, including the Spanish Government, as the Commissioner is aware.
I wished to take advantage of this modification of the Regulation on aid for the conversion of the fleet which fished in Morocco to point out that what was done then must not be the exception, but the rule.
In other words, when Community fleets need to be converted, either due to a failure to renew international fisheries agreements, or due to a drastic reduction in catches owing to recovery plans â and our British colleagues are well aware of this, particularly the Scottish Members, in relation to cod â the European Commission should automatically provide for additional measures to compensate these fleets and deal with the new situation.
We should not therefore make partial modifications to the general Regulation on FIFG structural aid whenever a situation such as this occurs, but rather there should be a permanent general framework in order to provide aid whenever it happens, either as a result of species recovery plans in Community waters or in external waters when they affect our fleet, the Community fleet.
This has been the case recently with the Community halibut fleet in NAFO waters, where the Commission proposed a recovery plan for halibut which was accepted and which involves dropping from 42 000 tonnes this year, 2003, to 16 000 tonnes in 2007, a reduction of 62%.
And since it appears here that nothing has happened, I say that the Commission must be obliged to do something in order not to jeopardise the future of this fleet.
And it must take appropriate action by adopting extraordinary measures such as relocation to other fishing grounds, the promotion of experimental campaigns and the granting of other socio-economic aid which we have been asking for in order to compensate for the situation which has been created.
Our intention in presenting this amendment which, Commissioner, is not a âVarelaâ amendment but an amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries, is to resolve these problems and any future problems.
If our Parliament approves it tomorrow, my request to you, Commissioner, is that the Commission should consider this since the sector in question is calling for it.
It is asking you to do something.
The European Parliament wishes to help you and be your ally and an ally of the sector and therefore ensure in this way that the European Commission takes action.
This is my opinion and I hope, Mr Fischler, that you will consider what has been said before taking the initiative you have announced.
I would like to end â since I will not have time later â by congratulating Chairman Stevenson, rapporteur for the report on Mozambique, which we are going to deal with next, because it is a wonderful report which deserves our support.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco dealt a harsh blow to the external strategy for fisheries policy and has had tragic consequences for certain fishing areas, especially in Andalusia and, on a smaller scale, in Portugalâs Algarve region.
The Commission and Parliament have, it must be said, managed to adopt a plan to support the activities affected, albeit with a few weaknesses and shortcomings, which are now being corrected.
We therefore welcome this Commission proposal, which has come about as the result of Parliamentary pressure as well as requests from the two countries directly affected, Portugal and Spain.
It must be said that this proposal would perhaps not have been needed if the Commission had listened to Parliament when RegulationÂ 2561/2001 was discussed.
Even then, the potential problems of implementing this regulation had already been clearly identified.
We support the MiguÃ©lez Ramos report, and have nothing but praise for the rapporteurâs work and for the initiatives she has produced, which are doubtless behind the corrections that are being made to the proposal.
We must ensure equal treatment for all fishermen and we must ensure that the regulation covers the greatest number possible of people working in this sector.
The provisions preventing already scheduled aid being granted within more reasonable deadlines must, therefore, be removed.
We support the rapporteurâs amendments, which are so clearly justified that they need no further comment.
It is right that financial compensation should also be given to fishermen who are unemployed as a result of other decisions and not just because their vessels have been scrapped, including fishermen who have decided to devote themselves to other types of fishing, for example, or those who have already switched to other types of fishing.
I wish to make one last comment, Mr President, which concerns the need, in future, to provide emergency measures for situations of vulnerability when agreements with third countries might lead to situations of collapse and harm fishing activities.
I genuinely believe that we need a global strategy so that we do not only respond to these situations as and when they arise.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I am very grateful to you and to everyone who has contributed to this debate.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that it is positive and important to undertake the adjustment for this very specific case of the Spanish and Portuguese fleet in connection with the Morocco Agreement, or the expiry of the Morocco Agreement.
However, I still believe that we should not have recourse to knee-jerk legislation of any kind.
While I do understand the issue raised by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna here, I think that this is something we should examine during the midterm review of the structural measure.
A midterm review is envisaged in any case, and I believe that is the right moment to discuss all the elements and experiences that we have gathered during implementation in the first half of the implementing period.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0406/2003) by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mozambique (COM(2003) 419 C5-0354/2003 2003/0154(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I can continue where I left off.
This concerns the Fisheries Agreement and the renewal of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Mozambique.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Stevenson for his report and also for supporting the Commissionâs proposal to conclude this Protocol.
With the aid of this Agreement, the Communityâs fishing vessels can resume their fishing activities in Mozambiqueâs waters.
The new Agreement also expands the set of agreements on tuna fishing concluded by the Community in this major region.
Moreover, we have succeeded in establishing a highly innovative partnership agreement, for Mozambique will earmark the entire amount of the financial compensation to funding marine surveillance, research, training and various other measures designed to develop Mozambiqueâs fisheries and improve its capacities for fisheries management.
As regards the other amendments proposed here, let me say that Amendments Nos 1 and 2 do not seem necessary from our perspective, as we already supply Parliament with this information under the relevant framework agreement between you and the Commission.
Amendment No 3 â this is really an old story â concerns the renewal of a Protocol.
As long as it relates to a renewal of the Protocol, no separate negotiating mandate is required, as it falls within the scope of the existing negotiating guidelines.
For that reason, I must reject this Amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, this new agreement between the European Community and Mozambique was initialled on 21 October 2002.
The agreement is for three years, and the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities, the financial compensation and the technical annex form an integral part of the agreement and enters into force on 1 January 2004.
The main fisheries connected to this agreement are, of course, deepwater shrimp and tuna.
As the Commissioner knows, we have had considerable controversy in the past concerning some of these international third-country agreements.
Indeed, last year we worked very closely with the Commission to produce a template: the Senegal agreement.
I make no apologies here for moving from the east coast of Africa to the west coast: the Senegal agreement broke new ground in introducing innovative new ways of dealing with third-country agreements, which we have continued to put in place ever since.
In the case of Senegal, we insisted that 60% of the financial compensation should be for fishing opportunities and 40% should be for conservation and development.
We insisted that half of the crews on the EU vessels should be Senegalese, that a considerable quantity of the catch should be processed in the fish processing plants in Senegal and that VMS monitoring be fitted in all vessels involved.
In every respect, this was seen as a good package that delivered the development and conservation values, provided a sustainable fishery, continued to provide jobs for EU fishermen, and continued to supply the EU with high-quality fish.
In the EU we are only 60% self-sufficient in fishery products; there is a rising consumer demand for more fish, and fish stocks are falling in the Community's waters.
It is important that through the Senegal agreement, and the subsequent agreements we have achieved since then, we are trying to continue with this pattern in order to continue to provide these kinds of sustainable fisheries agreements.
If we abandon these agreements, we would have a free-for-all.
There would be a situation where countries like Senegal, Mauritania, and, in this case, Mozambique, would feel free to enter into contracts with the Koreans, the Japanese or the Russians, and there would then be no element of conservation, no development element, no care for the local indigenous fishermen or their welfare.
In these circumstances, if we act via the EU, we have a better opportunity for monitoring the way these agreements work.
In the case of the Mozambique agreement, we are asking the Commission to report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the application and implementation of the agreement one year before it ends.
If we find that these conditions have not been adhered to, then we will not mandate the Commission to enter into further agreements with Mozambique.
In this case, we have a report of an abundance of deepwater shrimp and tuna in this area.
We are going to give fishing opportunities for ten vessels fishing for 1000 tonnes per year of deepwater shrimp - and an additional 535 tonne by-catch - 35 freezer tuna seiners and 14 surface longliners fishing for 8000 tonnes of tuna.
The financial package is EUR 4Â 090Â 000 per annum.
In this case it is not a question of 60% for fishing opportunities and 40% for development; all of it is going towards conservation and development - EUR 1.5 million for monitoring marine fisheries, EUR 1 million for institutional development, EUR 1 million for research, EUR 430Â 000 for training, EUR 100Â 000 for quality control and EUR 60Â 000 to help Mozambique participate in international meetings.
This is a very good package and I commend it to the House.
I am grateful to the Commission for producing it, we are now working in a new spirit of partnership in these third-country agreements and we should continue to do so.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, for having included the amendments of the Committee on Budgets in his report, and I believe we should all be pleased because this protocol will allow Community ships to return to the waters of Mozambique, in which they fished until 1993, when Mozambique condemned the then existing Agreement.
Although Mr Stevenson has already spoken briefly on the budget, I would like to insist that the financial record sheet for the Council's proposal effectively provides for compensation for 2004, 2005 and 2006 in commitment appropriations of EUR 12Â 270Â 000, which is exclusively dedicated as Commissioner Fischler and the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, have said â to what we call specific measures, which the Committee on Budgets also welcomes.
Furthermore, it is laid down that there may be a maximum of EUR 15Â 870Â 000, when the annual budget is established.
Apart from this, the Committee on Budgets is in favour of this Protocol with the Republic of Mozambique, which provides for new fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in the Indian Ocean.
Mr Fischler, the Committee on Budgets, however, regrets â as on so many occasions â that the Commission has waited until the end of July 2003 to communicate its initial proposal, despite the fact that the Protocol was signed in October 2002.
Â Â  . Mr President, the main concern of the Committee on Development and Cooperation in relation to this agreement is to make sure that its impact is in keeping with the wider development goals of the Union.
We are very keen to ensure that development policy is not ghettoised into one little bit of the Commission, and that its objectives are mainstreamed right across EU policies when we are dealing with the developing world.
What does this mean in concrete terms in relation to this agreement?
It means we want to see real benefits for the local communities and assurances that this agreement will not have negative impacts on the local populations that depend on fisheries.
We want the Commission to maximise local employment opportunities arising from the agreement, looking at access for fishermen to the tuna fishing business.
We are keen to see women be given a role in the marketing and processing of fisheries products.
Stock management issues are also important.
We want the Commission to make sure that the agreement takes full account of the sustainable management of fisheries resources, particularly with regard to tuna stocks.
The emphasis should be on decentralised production using low-cost, sustainable farming methods.
Like Mr Stevenson we welcome the Commission's proposals to allocate the financial compensation to measures which promote institutional development, marine surveillance, research, training and quality control.
This is a good step in the right direction because it is important that the money also goes into furthering our development goals.
Finally, I agree with all those who are saying that it is extremely important that the Parliament be kept informed of the implementation of this agreement.
We need regular assessments on what is happening on the ground before we can agree to any renewal of the agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to overcome the problem of its scant fish stocks, the European Union has, amongst other measures, concluded agreements with third countries with a view to using these countriesâ territorial waters in exchange for financial compensation.
In 2002, the European Union signed an agreement of this nature with Mozambique, which was seen by many as the perfect agreement, because it managed to combine cooperation and mutual interest: in the next three years the Community fleet will be able to fish in Mozambican territorial waters in return for financial compensation of around EURÂ fourÂ million.
This balanced agreement is in actual fact ideal.
Firstly, because it covers species which have abundant stocks in Mozambique; shrimp and tuna.
Secondly, it seeks to develop local fisheries by training Mozambican crews.
Thirdly, Community compensation has been earmarked for tangible objectives in the fisheries sector.
The fourth and last point is that the agreementâs implementation will be monitored, with particular attention being paid to the sanitation aspects of catches.
I agree with the requirement laid down by the European Parliament, through its rapporteur, MrÂ Stevenson, to receive an annual report on the agreementâs application and on the implementation of its measures, which will enable this institution closely to monitor this agreement â of strategic importance for the European Unionâs common fisheries policy â thereby keeping up to date in preparation for any negotiations, when it comes to renewing the agreement.
I wish to conclude by expressing my complete satisfaction at the signing of this agreement, which is so well balanced.
I am truly convinced that, unlike the previous agreement, Mozambique will have no reason to be unhappy with this text.
Â Â  Mr President, it is me again.
International fisheries agreements with third countries have always been one of the key elements of Community fisheries policy.
Half of our fisheries products, consumed fresh or used for processing, originate from waters outside the Community in which third countries exercise the right to exclusive use of resources.
In economic terms, the European Union is an enormous market of more than 370 million inhabitants, an expanding market with a deficit in fisheries products.
This situation determines the European Union's commercial policy in the field of fisheries.
Given its volume, the Community market is the worldâs main market for sea products.
The Socialist Group therefore supports the conclusion of this agreement between the Community and Mozambique and congratulates the rapporteur, MrÂ Stevenson, who has produced a wonderful report.
We have absolutely no doubt that this agreement will contribute to strengthening mutually beneficial relations with that Republic.
It will not only contribute to the supply of the Community market but it will also mean - as Mr Piscarreta said â aid for the development of Mozambiqueâs fisheries sector, all within the framework of sustainable development.
Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that strengthening commercial relations between the European Union and Mozambique, is not simply demagoguery, but might actually help to improve the lives of the Mozambican people.
Surely it is good development aid policy for the so-called first world to buy from the developing countries their most valuable products, whether they are diamonds or prawns, and that the fruits of these sales should promote fundamental strategic sectors such as local agriculture.
The Socialist Group therefore supports the amendments of the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, and those of the Committee on Budgets.
We agree with the wishes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, although we regret that we cannot support its proposals, since they have not been presented in the form of amendments to the legislative text, as is always required in these cases.
Â Â  Mrs MiguÃ©lez, you began your speech by saying âit is me againâ.
The fact that you have spoken more than once in one evening simply demonstrates that you are very hard-working.
You know that the Presidency is always very happy to hear you.
Â Â  Mr President, I too wish to welcome the return of the Community fishing vessels to Mozambican waters.
As a Portuguese citizen, I make this statement without any colonialist nostalgia or any harking back to those times, but I feel that the fact that Community boats are returning to Mozambican waters is also a sign of the democratic maturity that Mozambique has achieved and the normalisation of diplomatic relations that have been established between that country and the European Union.
In fact, as has already been said, this agreement brings mutual advantages and really represents the culmination of a process of drafting fisheries agreements with third countries that the Commission and Parliament have been working on for some time now.
This agreement was concluded as the result both of discussions and of a wealth of experience, which should in future be applied to cases similar to that of Mozambique.
In this regard, the President of the Commission has called this a model agreement, and I share this view.
This could provide a model for future agreements with third countries, poor countries, underdeveloped countries for whom the type of scheme and system contained in this agreement provides the best way of protecting their interests, of supporting their fisheries in a manner that is ecologically, scientifically and economically advantageous.
I must therefore congratulate the Commission on having achieved such positive results in its diplomatic relations with Mozambique, and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on the excellent report he has produced.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0362/2003) by Mr Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains (2003/2032(INI))
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for their unanimous support on this very important report.
To provide a context, at present there is no EU-wide provision uniformly governing the repatriation of mortal remains from one Member State to another.
In the absence of any such provisions, cross-border transportation of mortal remains is governed by two instruments of international law, but primarily the Strasbourg agreement concluded in 1973.
The world, methods and technology have changed much since then.
It is also interesting to note that only some Member States have actually acceded to this Strasbourg agreement, which, in many respects, is obsolete.
On account of the above-mentioned agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin.
We encourage people to live, work and settle in states other than their own national Member State.
Currently, over 5 million people reside outside their national Member State; add to this the millions of EU citizens who holiday throughout the European Union every year, and we are looking at a growing number of people who die abroad.
Their relatives are faced with appalling bureaucracy through which they have to wade.
The Commission has recently stated once again that EU citizens should be able to move between Member States on terms similar to those applicable to nationals of a Member State, and that additional administrative or legal obligations should be kept to the bare minimum required by the fact that the person in question is a non-national.
As things stand at present, it is still far from true that a Community citizen who dies in a Member State other than his own is treated in the same way as a national who dies in his home country. This has been pointed out to the Commission and the Council on numerous occasions by many Members of the European Parliament.
We are presented with the ludicrous situation that we are supposed to be a Europe without internal borders, yet as soon as somebody dies, when there is a great need for understanding and sympathy, we erect the borders merely because the body needs to be transported from one country to another.
That means that a zinc coffin is required, at enormous expense.
A family from Coventry in the UK had to repatriate their son who was tragically killed on his first night on holiday in Spain.
They were given no help.
They were given a mass of bureaucracy â in a foreign language â through which they had to wade.
They were given no translation, no help from the consular services and had to meet the cost of over GBP 3000 for a zinc coffin alone.
We are presented with a ludicrous situation in which the repatriation of a corpse from Salzburg to Freilassing â a distance of ten kilometres â requires a zinc coffin, but the transfer of a body from Ivalo to Helsinki â a distance of 1120 kilometres â requires no such coffin.
It is quite clear that we need a uniform approach to this situation.
We are currently 15 Member States, soon to be 25.
We are encouraging people to live in other countries, to embrace other cultures; yet when they die, suddenly, the border is erected and the bureaucracy comes into play.
It is very simple: in 1973, we were worried about the deterioration of corpses during transit.
Embalming is now common, technology has moved on.
We have to say to the reluctant Commission that this issue will not go away.
All of us here are protected â we have organisations, trade unions and institutions that will return our bodies to where our families want them to be.
But imagine for a moment the plight of a mother, Dolores Shambley, dealing with the death of her son, Kris Shambley â barely 20 in 1998.
Dolores Shambley is a woman with very little money, who was given very little assistance.
This is a fundamental right.
If we are really interested in upholding the rights of our citizens, I urge the Commission to bring forward proposals and accept the principle of free movement.
I believe that the right to move freely only ends when the body is interred.
There has been a reluctance within the Commission to accept this own-initiative report.
Be brave. Be courageous.
Accept the challenge.
The goodwill is there.
I now want the political initiative.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I first of all thank Mr Cashman for his detailed and precise report on this very sensitive and important issue.
This report sets out very clearly the problems regarding the repatriation of mortal remains that exist within the Union today.
I know how strongly many Members feel about this issue.
Many Members of this House have personally intervened to assist families of constituents who have faced these difficulties when trying to repatriate the mortal remains of their loved ones.
I therefore appreciate the particular importance that must be attached to this issue.
The Commission agrees with Mr Cashman that these problems will multiply as EU citizens increasingly use their rights to work and reside in other Member States.
Although the Commission fully recognises the importance of this issue and the urgent need to deal with it, I must admit that it has been somewhat hesitant, as the report has clearly pointed out, in determining precisely what to do about this.
The Commission has signalled, in response to a number of questions by Members of Parliament, that it does not believe, at this stage, that specific harmonisation is required.
I wish to stress today, however, that this does not imply that we cannot move to resolve these problems.
In the coming weeks, I shall be asking my colleagues to adopt a directive on services in the internal market, and I believe that directive will help resolve a number of the problems raised by Mr Cashman's report insofar as they reflect restrictions on the exercise and provision of cross-border funeral services.
In particular, it will simplify administrative procedures and abolish authorisation requirements that are not consistent with the principle of proportionality.
I also hope to be able to deal with the specific problem related to zinc coffins insofar as a coffin is obviously an essential element of the funeral director's services.
There will remain problems caused by different national requirements such as those on death certificates and autopsies.
On those issues the Commission doubts that it is legally possible to apply the principle of the free movement of people to contest restrictions on the transfer of mortal remains.
It also believes that harmonisation on these issues would be likely to be contested on the grounds of subsidiarity.
I wish to thank Mr Cashman once again for this report and I should like to reassure this House that the Commission will seek to resolve as many of the problems raised in it as possible, but I cannot guarantee that we shall solve all the problems, given the uncertain legal situation regarding the free movement of people.
In resolving the restrictions to the provision of funeral services the Commission will do its utmost to make Member States aware of the very important problems raised in this report regarding differing provisions on autopsies and death certificates.
In particular, we shall indicate that national legislation in this field should respect fundamental rights, and in particular the dignity of people.
Â Â  Mr President, it is not easy to speak following Mr Cashmanâs speech, and I would firstly like to congratulate him on having had the idea of producing this own-initiative report, on the way he has drawn it up and on achieving the unanimous support of his committee.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on announcing that it is going to propose a services directive and simplify some of the procedures necessary for free movement â in this case of mortal remains and we eagerly await the presentation of this proposal by the Commission.
I believe this issue is of particular importance.
It is said that societies are measured in terms of their respect for their elderly people, and even more in terms of their respect for their mortal remains.
I believe it is our obligation to make as much progress as possible in simplifying as far as we possibly can the procedures necessary â which affect the families so much for the free movement of mortal remains within the Union in the event that death takes place far from their places of origin.
Furthermore, I believe that Mr Cashman â if you will allow me a little humour on such a serious issue is showing his great qualities as a politician, because he is showing concern for people who are never again going to be able to vote for him.
I believe that the fact that certain countries of the European Union have not signed the Strasbourg Agreement, as the rapporteur has quite rightly said, obliges us even more as the European Union â in view of the imminent entry of ten new countries â to establish certain rules in order to simplify as far as possible the procedures necessary for the free movement of mortal remains within the European Union.
Â Â  I was surprised to see this report and its contents on the agenda.
In my own 35 years in the funeral profession, I never encountered the problems of not being able to send home or receive mortal remains.
What I have repeatedly witnessed, however, is the appalling conditions in which some bodies have been received because of the lack of proper embalming or care treatment in some countries.
Sadly, there is no attempt in this report to tackle this serious issue, despite a reference to it in the introduction to the explanatory statement, wherein it is hinted that this is the main problem.
The rapporteur has informed me that the Commission would not accept amendments on this essential issue, so the chances of standard systems of embalming being introduced are zero.
This report will no doubt be adopted nevertheless without the real issue being confronted.
By voting for this report, Members should be aware that they will do nothing to alleviate the stress and emotion suffered by the bereaved who frequently fall victim to the tragic catastrophes of the repatriation of mortal remains.
Unfortunately and regrettably, factual errors in this report make it obvious that it has been written by a layman who has no real understanding of the problems of repatriation or indeed the funeral profession, and I therefore see that this report has not addressed the real issue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to congratulate Mr Cashman on the report he has presented, which won the unanimous support of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
As MrÂ Cashman stated, and as CommissionerÂ Bolkestein reiterated, the fundamental logic of freedom of movement will make the need to adopt rules in these areas increasingly pressing, because the free movement of citizens within Community territory will multiply the number of cases that we are seeing today and which warrant our attention.
In fact, it is incomprehensible that the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his or her country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs.
This clearly runs counter to the Community approach.
This being the case, measures must be adopted to simplify or even harmonise the process of repatriating the mortal remains of persons who have died so as to bring this process more into line with the Community approach which is not, of course, taken into account in the international agreements governing this field.
These are the 1937 Berlin agreement and the 1973 Strasbourg agreement which, because they are quite old, are not relevant to the situation we have in Europe today and have therefore become largely obsolete.
Furthermore, these agreements established a form of indirect discrimination because they apply essentially to ânon nationalsâ, which contravenes the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Community law, thereby breaching essential rules of Community law.
It consequently falls to the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that these are compatible and to adopt the necessary measures to guaranteeing that they are complied with.
Lastly, it should be pointed out that not all Member States have ratified these agreements, which is another reason for the unacceptable disparity in the measures adopted by each of the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman.
His report is based on a resolution that I tabled.
Following on from Mr Titford's comments, today I tried to contact an undertaker friend to see if he had anything he wished to add tonight, but it seems he is on his holidays somewhere, as it so happens.
We all accept that Mr Cashmanâs excellent report is still and I do not mean to denigrate it - an aspirational report.
It aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common.
Every year I hear of one, two or even sometimes three cases where people experience problems in relation to the repatriation of remains.
If we look at the dates of the various pieces of legislation that Mr Cashman has mentioned in his report, we see that they are all at least 30 years old.
30 years ago the world was very different.
As MrÂ Cashman said, huge numbers of people are now moving about and spending holidays in other Member States.
In two of the cases I have very recently heard about, the deceased had been killed under what were considered to be suspicious circumstances.
Only this morning I had a phone call from the mother of a young man.
She has been waiting 17 months to have his remains repatriated, and local courts have constantly changed their minds about the prosecution of the person believed to have been involved in the death of this young man.
So, it is not just a question of the technical matters relating to repatriation.
Very often, delays also occur in relation as the report mentions - to the circumstances of the death.
I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to.
This was an answer to a question I tabled on 11 October 2000: 'the Commission, following extensive consultations with all parties concerned, concluded that detailed harmonisation of national rules in this area, over and above those that already exist, is neither desirable nor necessary and would not be justified from the point of view of subsidiarity or proportionality'.
That is a depressing answer, Commissioner, so I hope very much that, in the provision of services directive you are proposing, you will recognise that this is an important issue, and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe it would be right to correct the record as regards Mr Titford's contribution.
I would point out to him that the report is about the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains.
It is about barriers to movement rather than the conditions of the corpse.
I want the principle to be accepted.
Mr Titford could, at any time, have suggested amendments to me.
Despite discussions in Strasbourg on my report, he subsequently offered no amendments.
I am deeply saddened.
I always deal honestly and openly with all my colleagues, but he flattered me privately and failed to act publicly.
I need to correct the record in this regard.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0400/2003) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships (COM(2002) 595 C5-0154/2003 2003/2064(INI))
Â Â  . Mr President, I want to start with a word of praise for the Commission.
In the first reading on sulphur levels in marine fuel, the European Parliament asked for stricter levels for sulphur in marine fuel, and as a first step towards looking at this, I am very pleased that the Commission has requested a study which has now been produced - that looks into the particular issues involved, arising from a potential price premium for 0.5% sulphur in marine fuel.
So I am very pleased to see the Commission taking the Parliament's initiative so seriously, and that is a very positive point to start with.
However, it is balanced by a negative point: we are still waiting for a common position on that proposal.
The European Parliament's first reading was back in June 2003, so one preliminary question I have is why has the Council not made more progress?
Could the Commission enlighten us as to when we might expect that common position?
I hope that we could have it by early 2004 at the latest .
Regarding the Community strategy on air pollution from seagoing ships, as I have said before, I very much welcome the publication by the Commission of this communication on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions.
As it states, the Commission has indeed set out a broad series of objectives, actions and recommendations for reducing the emissions of air pollutants from seagoing ships over the next ten years in order to reduce their impact on the environment and on human health problems in the EU.
However, many of the proposals outlined do not go far enough and in my report I seek to encourage the Commission and the Member States to go a little bit further than outlined in that Commission communication.
The Commission very usefully sets out the scale of the impact of ship emissions.
It is very important that we recognise that those impacts are far from being insignificant.
In my explanatory statement I underline the seriousness of these impacts that we face.
For example, ship emissions contribute to critical loads of acidity being exceeded by more than 50% in most of the coastal areas along the English Channel and the North Sea, in the Baltic Sea along the coast of Germany and Poland, and also in large parts of southern Sweden and Finland.
So, the kinds of impacts we are talking about here are indeed very serious.
In terms of the main atmospheric emissions that should be addressed by the Commission communication, it already mentions sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulates, carbon dioxide and halon - all of these are quite rightly included.
However, in my report, I seek to add two further categories of emissions that should be covered by the strategy: heavy metals and polycyclic aromatics, which are essentially hydrocarbons associated with cancer.
I would very much like to see the proposal being extended to cover those.
The Commission is right to state that EU regulations on emissions standards are the best way to reduce emissions from ships in EU ports, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.
But, indeed, it is also right to note that economic instruments can also be one of the best means of promoting good environmental performance providing that what they are doing there is giving incentives to go further than the regulations and actually move towards coming up with the best available technology.
Another point about the objective of the communication is that it needs to be more explicitly aimed at reducing ship emissions of greenhouse gases in particular, looking especially at the impact on global warming.
In relation to that, my report also asks the Commission to study how emissions from international maritime traffic could be included in Directive 2001/81/EC on national emissions ceilings when that is reviewed.
Furthermore, my report reminds the Commission of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which requests that the Commission identify and undertake specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping if no such action is agreed within the International Maritime Organisation by 2003.
Since we can see that indeed no such action has been agreed within the IMO, I hope very much that the Commission will go ahead and initiate such actions without further delay.
On sulphur emissions, it is appropriate to mention the Commission's proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC relating to the sulphur content of marine fuels.
The Commission proposed only to reduce sulphur emissions from seagoing ships in European sea areas by about 10% compared to the emission levels in 2000. But, in order to achieve the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, emissions need to be reduced by at least 80%.
The Commission must therefore be much more ambitious as regards the limit values it has proposed and, indeed, the sea areas to be covered by such limit values.
My report therefore calls on the Commission to amend its proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC in accordance with the European Parliament's first reading back in June, the aim of which was to reduce sulphur emissions by 80%.
The Commission should also publish, before the end of 2004, proposals for EU-wide economic instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric emissions from ships.
Finally, I would like to see the Member States, the Commission and the accession countries really putting pressure on those countries that have not yet ratified the Marpol Annex VI Agreement.
Only five Member States have so far ratified that, and it seems appropriate at this moment to call for wider ratification among accession countries and others as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, for her thorough, well-drafted report on the Commissionâs ship emission strategy.
Reducing ship emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases is a priority for the Commission, since we know that if measures are not taken, by 2020, ships in European Union seas will emit more air pollutants than all land-based sources combined.
I therefore welcome most of the proposals in the Parliamentâs draft resolution and I am pleased to say that the Commission is already working to take these forward.
For example, on market-based instruments, we are examining a range of possible options.
We held a useful stakeholder workshop in September 2003 to which parliamentarians were invited.
On the issue of taking international ship emissions and EU national emission ceilings into account, we aim to launch a study soon to get a better perspective on how significant ship emissions are in individual Member States compared to land-based emissions.
On the use of shoreside electricity and abatement technologies for air pollutants, we aim to use the same study to examine the costs and benefits and present positive examples.
We shall feed the results of this work into the Clean Air for Europe Programme in 2005, and present proposals as appropriate.
The question of ship sulphur is of course subject to codecision negotiations on the Commissionâs marine fuel sulphur proposal.
The proposal as drafted would deliver a significant 40% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions targeted in asset-sensitive northern Europe.
The Councilâs progress on the proposal has been slower than we would have liked, but we have used the extra time to investigate the costs and benefits of the tighter sulphur limits proposed by the European Parliament in June 2003.
In response more specifically to Mrs Lucasâ points, we share her concern about the slow progress in Council and we now hope that a common position will be agreed upon under the Irish presidency early in 2004.
We have found that the 0.5% fuel sulphur limit proposed by the European Parliament would give rise to a price premium of approximately EUR 70 on every tonne of fuel.
The environmental and human health benefits of the tighter sulphur limit would still outweigh the costs but the overall cost to the shipping industry would double to over EUR 2 billion.
We must consider whether this is proportionate, bearing in mind the Commissionâs commitment to promoting a modal shift from road to sea transport.
Lastly, in direct response to a question raised by MrsÂ Lucas on the issue of ship greenhouse gas emissions, I am pleased to inform her that the International Maritime Organisation is due to adopt a strategy on this issue later this week.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Caroline Lucas for her report and also pay tribute to Heidi Hautala, upon whose original report this is built and who is now back in national politics in Finland.
It highlights an issue that the citizens around the European Union are not even aware of, despite the fact that what the Commissioner says is absolutely true.
If present trends continue, over half the pollution produced in the EU will be out at sea.
It is true that the use of sea transport and inland waterways is the most environmentally friendly way of moving goods with the possible exception of a locomotive using electricity produced in a nuclear power station.
It is important we see development of this particular type of transport.
It is also true that we take the pressure off the roads.
In my own country, lack of investment in roads means that one alternative could be the development of more coastal shipping, using ports, for example Scarborough and Whitby, in my region.
However, there is a downside to the improvements that we have achieved on land and in fuel quality.
If you fill up your car with the latest diesel at 10 parts per million, the downside of that is that the sulphur, which has been taken out of your diesel, remains in the bunker fuel which goes to the ships, and could be 26Â 000 parts per million.
The Hautala report, at first reading, called for reductions to 1.5% in sensitive areas like the English Channel, the Baltic and the North Sea.
It is very encouraging that the amendments that I put forward at first reading with regard to abatement technology were taken on board.
P[amp]O Ferries, operating on the Dover-Calais route, have two identical ships operating, one with the abatement technology and one without.
I hope the Commission will look at the initial results of those trials to see whether this technology is an alternative, more cost-effective way of achieving the aims that we want.
I hope that these amendments will be taken more seriously by the Commission than some of the amendments that the Commissioner referred to, which call for even stricter levels that may not be cost-effective.
We must bear in mind that if we reduce the sulphur levels of fuel for ships, we increase the emissions at the oil refinery where these sulphur levels are reduced.
It is important that we act internationally, and not unilaterally, through the International Maritime Organisation and Marpol Annex VI.
It is particularly disappointing that only five Member States have ratified Marpol Annex VI.
Unless there have been developments which the Commissioner could refer to, I understand that the United Kingdom - which is always critical of other countries that do not ratify agreements such as Kyoto - has not ratified Marpol Annex VI.
It is vitally important, when we look at emissions, to see where they take place.
Emissions out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean do not cause us problems on land.
I am worried that some of the more ambitious suggestions in Mrs Lucas' report, for example an 80% cut, are out of proportion to the cost.
But we now have a reasonably balanced report which we will be pleased to support in the vote in plenary tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, as regards the subject of the Directive, one cannot disagree with the need to reduce atmospheric emissions of sulphur caused by maritime transport, which must agree to make the same efforts as land-based transport in this respect.
Granite areas are particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon of acidification caused by these sulphur emissions and must therefore receive priority treatment.
We must ensure, however, that we do not penalise our own shipowners by laying down standards that do not give sufficient consideration to the international nature of maritime transport.
In this area, as in many others, the Union is only an intermediary.
The relevant forum for pushing forward the regulations is in this case the IMO.
That is why we are in favour of the measures to limit the maximum sulphur content of marine fuels used in the North Sea, the English Channel and the Baltic Sea as they are in line with the ceilings laid down by the IMO/Marpol Convention.
There could also be extensions in this area if defined within the IMO framework.
We do not believe, however, that the rapporteurâs additional proposals on the two other aspects of the Directive concerning the levels applicable to passenger ships and ships in ports are appropriate.
They do not integrate the need to proceed gradually in these fields in order to take account of the heavy technical constraints imposed on our shipowners by these new guidelines, nor the need to develop these emission reductions within the framework of the IMO, which seems ready to act.
On the contrary, they give rise to discrimination that could harm European interests.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as I said earlier, the Commission generally welcomes this report. However, there are two points which the Commission finds difficult to accept.
First, I believe that a proposal to include polyaromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals in the ship emissions strategy is perhaps premature.
The monitoring of those pollutants is not currently mandatory in the European Union and no limit values are set.
This is, however, considered in a new Commission proposal on ambient air quality.
Secondly, the Commission is somewhat disappointed by the proposal that ships travelling to remote island regions should be exempt from emissions policies.
In our view, clean air is a human right for all EU citizens, no matter where they live.
My services recently received a letter from a woman in Crete who protested about the filthy, black smoke which ships belch out into her house in Heraklion harbour.
The use of shoreside electricity in harbours, which Mrs Lucas, the rapporteur, is trying to promote, would dramatically reduce emissions of both air pollutants and noise, offering real improvements in the quality of life in port cities.
Finally, I should like to stress that the essential plank of the Commissionâs strategy is to work with Member States to promote global solutions through the International Maritime Organisation - the IMO.
In that respect I should like to welcome, and indeed echo, Parliamentâs call for EU Member States and acceding countries to ratify, as a matter of urgency, Annex VI of the IMOâs Air Pollution Convention, Marpol, and to submit proposals to the IMO for tighter global standards.
In conclusion, I should like to say to Mr Goodwill that the Commission is very interested in his comparison between the two ferries travelling between Calais and Dover.
This is a controlled experiment that should be of value to us all.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0410/2003) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards reduced rates of value added tax (COM(2003) 397 C5-0359/2003 2003/0169(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, on 23 July 2003, the Commission presented its proposal to simplify and rationalise the current situation with regard to reduced rates of VAT.
This proposal, based on Article 93 of the Treaty, is intended to harmonise legislation to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market.
Therefore, the Commission could not support modifications to its proposal that represented a step backwards.
Having said that, I should like to make the following comments relating to the report presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I agree with the rapporteur that it is not the time to make drastic changes.
That is why the Commission did not propose any change to the level of the rates or the optional nature of reduced rates for Member States.
On the other hand, it is necessary to rationalise the present situation.
The limited extension of Annex H, proposed by the Commission, is intended to reduce the discrepancies between Member States rather than increase them, in line with the objectives of the internal market.
The extremely difficult discussions in the Council on this issue have highlighted the radically divergent views on the question of VAT and the use of reduced rates.
That reinforces my belief that the Commission's proposal is a balanced one.
Any amendment which introduces new reduced rates in sectors where the standard rate is currently applied, such as for CDs, would be unacceptable, all the more so because the application of reduced rates could create competitive distortions.
The addition to children's shoes and clothes is also unacceptable.
Only three Member States are allowed to apply zero or super-reduced rates by temporary derogation.
All other Member States are obliged to apply the standard rates.
The rapporteur proposes to maintain the present derogations, but suggests establishing a new annex to the sixth directive, which would include all the supplies for which only one Member State has a specific derogation, thus permitting all Member States to apply a reduced rate to such supplies.
I am not convinced that this solution is feasible.
I want to stress that the Commission still favours a real phasing-out of these derogations.
Politically speaking, they have always been considered transitory and due to disappear at a certain moment.
Already in 1967, 1977, and again in 1992, at the time of the introduction of the internal market, the Council decided to authorise the Member States concerned to maintain these derogations.
However, no absolute deadline was set by the Council.
This does not mean, however, that they can remain indefinitely.
That is why I am still convinced action is needed in view of the forthcoming enlargement, in order to give all Member States, both present and new, equal opportunities and to create a level playing field.
I should like to remind you in this context that, for acceding countries, concrete deadlines have been laid down for all derogations.
Finally, I should like to come back to you on the results of the last Ecofin meeting, which invited the Commission to extend Annex K for two further years.
I have also received a letter from your rapporteur which urges the Commission to extend the duration of Annex K for at least six years, in order have a total period of application of ten years.
I should like to take this opportunity to explain why I am convinced that an extension of Annex K is not a realistic solution.
First, the Member States' and the Commission's reports have clearly shown that reduced rates are not a cost-effective way of creating employment.
I have, however, already indicated to the Council that I was prepared to turn a blind eye to those Member States which, after the 1 January 2004, would continue to apply the reduced rates introduced within the framework of the experiment of reduced rates for labour-intensive services.
This was to give the Council more time to find a solution based on the Commission's proposal.
Such a situation could only continue for a short period of time: that is why I spoke of a period of six months.
An extension would merely postpone, once again, a solution to this problem.
Moreover, it could give rise to the expectation that the experiment would become permanent.
A simple extension would, moreover, exclude other Member States, and in particular the new Member States, from being able to introduce reduced rates in the sectors concerned and would therefore be an added source of discrimination.
In that context, I should like to remind Parliament that the Commission has already proposed to introduce, once and for all, housing and domestic care services into Annex H. That is part of the exercise of rationalisation of the present situation and takes into account the fact that reduced rates are already applied by a majority of Member States.
To conclude, for the reasons I have outlined, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and I should like to invite Members to reconsider very carefully their position on this issue.
Â Â  . â Mr President, in view of the Commissionerâs comments, I would ask the Houseâs Bureau to consider once again whether it might be more important to allow the rapporteur to speak first, since we are part of the legislative process and the Commission is merely making a proposal.
I think this is a fundamental problem relating to parliamentary democracy, and one that we must address.
As regards the matter at hand, I would like to begin with the last point.
This House has lobbied in favour of a reduced rate of VAT for labour-intensive services.
Regrettably, this was not adopted as mandatory by the Finance Council but was merely introduced as an option, and some Member States have put it into practice.
However, it has been implemented very tentatively, so we have very little experience on which to assess the impact of this reduced rate of VAT on work and the black economy.
That means that after two years, we did not even know whether this provision would be extended for a year, and we are aware that many companies were not prepared to take the risk and therefore did not participate in the experiment at all.
So let me ask you this, Commissioner.
If we take a simple service industry such as hairdressing, where we can see that there has been an increase in the number of employees and self-employed persons â thousands in Spain, and hundreds in Luxembourg and Belgium â should we not take this as a sign that what has been happening is something that we really must evaluate?
Moreover, do you think it is right that after such a short time and based on such poor analyses by the Member States, you are nonetheless concluding that the reduced rates of VAT really have had no impact on employment, especially given that in some sectors, the figures tell a very different story from the ones in your reports?
That is why I urge you to extend this provision â if not for ten years, then for six years, not six months â for otherwise, there will be no legal certainty for the companies involved and we will also be unable to determine whether there has been any change in behaviour on the part of the clients and the businesspeople themselves.
Let me turn now to the fundamental principle underlying your proposal.
I am very sympathetic to the idea of a systematic approach to reduced rates of VAT, but I must ask you this, Commissioner: the whole point is to move towards a definitive VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, so that we can introduce this and finally establish genuine and systematic clarity.
We still have a long way to go before we reach that point.
Indeed, we really cannot see how any progress on the issue of VAT is to be achieved at all.
Therefore as one of the MEPs concerned, the question in my mind is this, and I put it to you on behalf of my committee and on behalf of this plenary as well: Do we need rules in areas where competition is not distorted and where the functioning of the internal market is not affected?
