Â Â  Mr President, I want to talk about climate change, but above all about the report of the European Environment Agency, which two months ago published a prognosis for the future and points out that the areas at greatest risk, the areas which are going to suffer most as a result of climate change, are the Mediterranean areas.
I believe it is very serious that this has not so far been said out loud.
I believe it is essential to insist that the Mediterranean areas are going to suffer most from the increase in temperature, with the extremely serious risks to health that entails; they are going to suffer most from lack of water, from lack of rainfall; from an increase in desertification, from the advance of the desert; from a decrease in productivity.
Furthermore, these areas are receiving immigration based on suffering, misery and hunger.
It is our duty to help them.
I would call on Europe to opt clearly for strategies to combat desertification and a policy for adapting to climate change, as recommended by the Agency.
We must produce adaptable policies, as required by sustainable development.
We need integrated strategies and much more in-depth studies and research into the problems we are facing.
The United Nations Organisation, which has implemented a process of combating the desertification of Europe, has said almost nothing.
I am therefore calling for a Mediterranean policy, a policy fundamentally of social balance and a more active policy for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, while I congratulate you on your new duties, I am delighted that you are here tonight for this debate on climate change.
The European Unionâs strategy for the Buenos Aires Climate Change Conference is of very great importance.
The European Union must maintain its leadership and, furthermore, make use of it to negotiate with a view to increasing the number of countries signing up to the Kyoto Protocol in the future.
I believe it is essential to work towards including the debates initiated in Milan in the second period of commitments, with a view to incorporating emissions from flights and marine transport, and also to make progress on global commitments for reducing emissions from passenger and goods transport by road, which is currently a big problem in terms of atmospheric pollution.
Furthermore, the Commission should consider producing more measures in the field of energy performance and also of more renewable energy sources because, as you stated on 26 August, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, if all the public authorities of the European Union were to move over to ecological energy, CO2 production would be reduced by 62 million tonnes, which would allow us to comply with the 18% Kyoto commitments in the field of emissions reduction.
Furthermore, I believe that the market requires clear and persistent signals in order to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.
For all these reasons, Commissioner, I believe it would be positive for the Commission to promote proposals aimed at increasing measures in the field of energy performance and promoting alternative energy sources for the second period, and producing proposals is another way to maintain the European Union's leadership.
Â Â  We are now already seeing the effects.
Glaciers are disappearing, the Arctic ice is melting and we have shorter winters and more storms, as well as natural disasters and environmental refugees.
At the end of paragraph 2 of the resolution, there is a statement to the effect that, in the long term, everyone in the world must each be given the same emission quotas.
This particular sentence places heavy demands on us to take drastic measures to reduce our emissions.
We are stealing oil supplies not only from future generations, but also from the worldâs poor.
When, now, we debate the climate issue, there is a risk of our looking five years ahead to the next election and avoiding taking difficult decisions, but the EU â Parliament, the Commission and the Council â must collectively avert their gaze from the prospects of re-election and dare to take decisions that radically reduce emissions.
Otherwise, we are committing crimes against humanity and the earth and are in danger of ending up, in the autumn of our years, at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, eternally condemned by future generations. Always assuming, of course, that The Hague is not already under water by then.
Â Â  Mr President, climate change presents the human race with a challenge to civilisation, because this is a question of maintaining the species and the major balances of nature.
What is needed is a fresh perspective on our concept of progress and development.
This problem will increasingly come to dominate peopleâs shared existence as this century progresses.
The profusion of extreme climate phenomena confirms that the effects of global warming are already being felt.
Profound changes are now inevitable.
Whilst the EU appears determined to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, a great deal remains to be done, however, if we are to prepare our communities to face the changes that are already underway.
A genuine adaptation policy must be drawn up and implemented, as a matter of the utmost priority.
We must draw political conclusions from the work of scientists and, in particular, the European Environment Agencyâs report, which sets out the various effects of global warming in Europe. Our continent, let us not forget, may be the smallest continent in the world, but it is also the continent with the most coastline.
The 155 outlying coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean have already decided â on the initiative of the French National Observatory on the effects of global warming, of which I am the chairman â to meet in 2005, in Marseille, to debate this question of adaptation.
We trust that we will have the Commissionâs support on this measure, which can help to draw up a genuine European strategy for adapting to current climate change.
This strand, which has become an integral part of the Community action programme on climate change, should now be extended.
Â Â  Mr President, we need cleaner energy and more efficient technologies and, in order to achieve that, we need incentives â negative incentives, if you like â such as a carbon tax.
Ireland is currently 25% in excess of its targets and yet, a couple of months ago, the then Minister of Finance announced that he was abandoning a commitment to introduce a carbon tax.
The day after tomorrow, the former Minister of Finance, Mr McCreevy, will be sitting on those benches beside you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, in charge of the internal market.
What confidence can we have that the Commission will ensure that all Member States will comply and fulfil the commitments made in relation to reducing carbon?
It has been estimated that 100 of the largest companies in Ireland will exceed the current emission rates between 2005 and 2007.
Ireland is losing ground in this battle in relation to climate change.
It will be the Irish taxpayers who will pay the penalties!
The companies who are currently pleading that they will be uncompetitive if they have to invest in order to create clean energy and more efficient technologies are the ones who escape scot-free!
I appeal to the Commission and to the Council to insist that the Irish Government reverse its decision to abandon the carbon tax.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I thank Members of Parliament for their contributions and I agree with most of the remarks that were made.
It is important to be aware that Parliament, the Commission and Council share almost the same views on this important issue.
We indeed have to fight against scepticism, we have to look beyond 2012 and perhaps we do not agree with everybody in the world.
But at least we agree on the main paths of the whole discussion here in Parliament with the Commission and the Council.
It is very important that we continue the steps we have already taken.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their kind words and their cooperation over the years.
I hope to continue to follow this discussion, because this concerns not only the environment but also our survival on this planet and the economic and social consequences that affect us now.
Thus, in the years to come, I hope to support and be involved in the initiatives to tackle climate change taken by the Barroso Commission.
I recall that we very rarely get reports from the Pacific Ocean â the vast expanse of water that covers one third of this planet â but where the effects of climate change are already affecting people living in small island states.
It must be said that during all the debates on climate change over the past five years the speeches by representatives from the small island states have been the most impressive, because they can tell us their personal stories of how this affected their lives and the possibilities to continue to live on these small islands.
A lot of people would say that the Kyoto Protocol did not work, that it was flawed, and they would mention its negative aspects.
It is not perfect, but what is the alternative to that one international legal framework, which has now been negotiated for ten years?
Should we try to become involved in bilateral contacts between one state and another?
To solve a global problem we need a truly global solution and framework.
I have tried to turn it around and say that it is an ingenious protocol, because it combines sound science and the way the United Nations has put together the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change is unprecedented.
Of course individual scientists will question the whole thing â that is their job!
However, the fact remains that we have an in-depth knowledge of the problem.
With sound science, we have common but differentiated responsibilities, meaning that the rich countries â those who emit eight or eighty times as much pollution the poor countries do â have a certain responsibility.
But we involve them all.
India and China sit at the same table as the rich countries, so we are able to talk to them and discuss what will happen after 2012.
It also means that we have access to the so-called flexible mechanisms, meaning that we will do things in a cost-effective way.
We will involve and mobilise different actors and use market forces for the good of the environment.
That is why it is ingenious.
We will have to revise it and work and change it for many years to come, but it is the one game there is in town in combating climate change.
That is why I am also proud of the role the European Union has played over the years and I hope will continue to play.
It is so important.
For once we can show the rest of the world that sustainable development is possible; that we can find cost-effective means and measures and that we are willing to cooperate with each other.
Thanks to the European Parliament we have a very ambitious climate-change policy.
I hope that will continue with your help.
I wish your delegation and our EU delegation to COP 10 in Buenos Aires all the best.
Â Â  At the end of the debate, I received a motion for a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.(1)
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  . I want to commend MrÂ Putin.
The Kyoto Protocol is off life-support because the Russian Federation ratified it.
The country with the highest levels of pollutionâ the United States- refuses to consider the global need for their ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
I am deeply concerned that the United States has chosen to tackle this climate change issue through unilateral activities. Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem.
If carbon dioxide is not reduced, the Arctic ice cover will disappear.
This is particularly going to affect the quality of life of those living in coastal regions and on island communities.
That is a scientific fact, not a passionate policy comment on my part.
Ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago.
I encourage other Member States to follow suit.
Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy.
But complacency in dealing with it, is worse.
My duty as a MEP, is to stress the necessity of climate change protection to: the people we represent, our EU counterparts and our international partners.
I urge the remaining countries that have not made their global commitment to combating climate change, to do so, via the Kyoto Protocol.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0027/2004) by Mrs Corbey on the draft European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.
Â Â  . Mr President, in 2001 a total of 65 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in the 15 old Member States of the European Union.
That corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight.
Of these 65 million tonnes, 34 million tonnes â 53% â were recycled, and 60% was recovered or incinerated with energy recovery.
Our information gives good reason to assume that in 2002 not a single target out of the 75 different targets applying to Member States was missed.
This is a success many would not have believed in even a few years ago.
Therefore the Community has built on this success and adopted new and higher targets earlier this year.
The new Member States started later in setting up their own recycling schemes.
They have nevertheless made significant progress towards fulfilling their target under the old packaging directive at the end of the transition periods agreed in the Accession Treaty.
For procedural reasons, a deadline for the targets of the revised packaging directive could not be set within that directive and this proposal was therefore necessary.
The Commission believes that setting this deadline for the new Member States is a matter in which Parliament needs to be fully involved.
We therefore consider that the appropriate legal procedure is codecision on the basis of Article 95.
We can also understand, however, that the new Member States want to have legal security as soon as possible.
They should be able to transpose the targets of the revision directive and the deadline under the present proposal at the same time.
The deadline therefore needs to be agreed before the transposition deadline for targets expires in August 2005 and I hope that the efforts made to reach an agreement at first reading will be successful.
The Commission has proposed a deadline of 2012 for all new Member States. This should allow discussion in Parliament and Council to start from an equal basis.
However, I can also accept limited postponement for some of the countries concerned.
I am also aware that many Members of Parliament wish to extend possibilities for Member States to encourage re-use systems.
This is an important subject and the Commission agreed to study options during the last revision of the packaging directive.
However, getting the right balance between encouraging re-use and preserving the internal market is also not easy.
I think, therefore, that we should wait for the outcome of the two ongoing studies and discuss this issue on the basis of a report that the Commission will present to Parliament and the Council in 2005.
However, if Parliament wishes to point out the importance of re-use in a recital, as suggested in Amendment 4, that is acceptable to the Commission.
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2 and 3 in full, and Amendment 4 in principle.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are once again discussing packaging.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, this being your last debate as Commissioner for the Environment, I should like to congratulate you on your sterling work over the past five years, your significant personal involvement and commitment, and to thank you for the good cooperation which you have established with this House.
You have been an excellent Environment Commissioner.
This evening, we are discussing the leftoversof the revision of the Packaging Directive.
The ten new countries need clear objectives.
Recycling and reuse cannot be announced out of the blue from the capital or from Brussels.
It takes time to persuade people to set up systems.
That is why it seems best to retain the dates proposed by the new Member States themselves.
Needless to say, I also checked out how the Members from the new countries felt about this, and this has not produced any other viewpoints. Hence my proposal for Amendment No 3.
I agree with the Commission that we need to finalise this issue as quickly as possible and that we must try to create political clarity for the new Member States at the earliest opportunity.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Packaging Directive is due for a general overhaul.
One of the crucial points is the constant tension between, on the one hand, maintaining the internal market and, on the other hand, protecting the environment.
In a number of cases, this has led to ambiguity and to long drawn-out procedures.
Clarity must be created, for the sake of both manufacturers and consumers.
On the basis of the Packaging Directive, which also covers the environment, the European Commission has called into question a number of reuse systems in Europe.
Commissioner, that is very disappointing in my view and I have decided to focus on this revision.
In Amendment No 4, on behalf of my group, I have suggested including in the directive the possibility of Member States encouraging the reuse of packaging material.
Member States can introduce new systems for the reuse of packaging material or, alternatively, maintain existing systems if these yield an environmental advantage compared to recycling or recovery from packaging material.
This amendment, which is also a recital, does not say that Member States encourage reuse.
It states that Member States can promote reuse, provided that â and that is important â that is done in compliance with the Treaty and does not disrupt the internal market.
You said, Commissioner, that you could accept this amendment, and I understand that it does not meet with any great resistance in the Council either.
It is therefore beyond me that even this has provoked objections among the Members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and within the European packaging industry.
The reaction from the PPE-DE and the industry is simply bewildering if we stop and think about the state of the environment and nature.
The follow-up report to the recently-published report by the Club of Rome concludes that the limits of sustainable development are in sight.
If we are not careful with natural resources, such as water and energy, the two worlds, the world of nature and the world of human civilisation, will clash.
We have not sufficiently succeeded in integrating sustainable development in our production and in our patterns of consumption.
Clearly, we need to make a complete change.
The reuse of materials and carefulness with natural resources are vitally important.
That too is the background to Amendment No 4.
A packaging industry which itself objects to the possibility of encouraging reuse within the borders of the internal market is not facing the future. By 2010, European industry must be the worldâs most competitive economy.
This requires businesses that can assess social reality. It requires businesses that can turn sustainability into a trademark, businesses that realise that citizens and consumers are worried about the future of the planet and are prepared to make their contribution.
Industry is right, of course, in saying that reuse should not be a front for protectionism.
Reuse may not be an excuse for thwarting foreign suppliers.
Similarly, reuse is not in all cases better for the environment, and there is no reason for making reuse compulsory.
Reuse does fulfil an important role, though, that being persuading people that we need to be careful with nature and with materials.
The last thing we need is to start reverting to being a throwaway society, not, incidentally, that the public appreciate that anyway, because many people consider discarding anything a waste, a waste of a bottle, a can or the material.
Tomorrow, this Parliament will also be discussing the Kok report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Mr Wim Kok has concluded that the pursuit of a sustainable society, one in which man, the environment and the market are in harmony, has, although commendable, not been given due prominence, and that this is due to a lack of political will.
He is not saying, though, that we should throw out the Lisbon strategy altogether, and I agree with him.
We must set to it and demonstrate political will.
In all its modesty, this packaging dossier will provide you with the opportunity of showing your political will tomorrow.
Not only can we speak out in the resolution about what is yet to be done, we can also speak out in favour of a concrete, sustainable supplement to the Packaging Directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, I urge all of you to nail your colours to the mast tomorrow.
The choice is yours: a voice for a Europe that is striving towards a sustainable society and acts accordingly, or a voice for a Europe that is full of fine words about sustainable development and the Lisbon strategy, but lacks the energy or moral fibre to back these up with vigour.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, communication is your new key task in the European Commission.
You have said that your intention is to continue to spread and promote the message of sustainable development.
You have my heartfelt support in this, and I wish you much success in this respect.
I hope that after the vote on the Packaging Directive tomorrow, you will be able to point out to the press that Europe not only speaks about sustainability, it also acts on it.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the proposal the Commission has presented to us is quite simply intended to establish time limits for compliance by the new Member States with the objectives of the directive we approved last year.
During the negotiation of the modification of the directive on packaging, for which Mrs Corbey was also rapporteur, the problem was raised of what to do about the new Member States not included in the objectives of the directive.
The new Member States negotiated transitional periods with the Commission of differing lengths according to their capacity to comply with these objectives or not, because, in reality, for many countries, these objectives are very ambitious and not at all easy to comply with.
These time limits were laid down in Recital 6 of the modification of the directive carried out last year.
I agree with the report as approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and in Amendment No 3 the rapporteur has replaced the date proposed by the Commission, a single date for everybody, which, as you are well aware, is 2012, as negotiated by the Member States.
They may not agree but, in reality, each Member State has its own specific characteristics, its own problems, and is perfectly aware of when it can achieve these objectives or not.
There is no point in producing legislation which is impossible to comply with.
This proposal was intended to include the Member States in the objectives of the directive on packaging.
For this reason, I am opposed to the new Amendment No 4, which is intended to introduce a new recital on the system of reuse, which gives the impression that the intention is to take advantage of one thing in order to impose another.
This is not the time.
I am not against systems of reuse, and nobody can be against it. But this is not the place to put this amendment.
It is neither the time nor the place, particularly given that Article 5 of this directive already allows the Member States to promote methods of reuse provided that they conform to the Treaties.
I believe it is premature to open up this debate when in June the Commission will have to present Parliament and the Council with a report on the application of the directive, its impact on the environment and the operation of the external market.
Amongst other issues, this report will have to deal with promoting reuse and, in particular, compare the costs and benefits of reuse and recycling.
So far no environmental or economic reason has been found to favour one type of packaging over another.
The most important thing I wanted to say is that I am against Amendment No 4.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The objectives in the field of waste treatment to which the new Member States committed themselves during the accession negotiations are not a simple matter for the majority.
This also applies to the various types of waste packaging set out in the European Union directive of 1994.
All the new Member States have asked for transition periods to be granted.
As we know, the Directive was revised during the accession negotiations and higher standards for waste treatment were introduced.
In order for the Member States to remain within the realm of what can realistically be achieved, it was logical that they had to receive new, extended transition periods.
It is those transition periods that we are discussing today.
At present the new Member States are establishing their systems for dealing with waste packaging and in this respect the next three years will be crucial.
Let these systems have high standards from the ecological point of view, but they must also be achievable and economically acceptable.
In this respect the new Member States are pooling their previous experience and following the experiences of others in the area of legislative options.
This entails the use of 'examples of best practice', which they wish to repeat, as well as the use of unsuccessful experiments, which they wish to avoid.
In any case they will attempt to integrate various methods and to influence manufacturers to make packaging functional and, at the same time, safe and acceptable to consumers.
The method for recycling packaging set out in Article 5 of the original Directive is one of the methods we wish to consider.
My own country, Slovenia, supports recycling, as it is logical both from the environmental and the economic standpoint.
It has not been possible, however, to overlook the fact that the interpretation of Article 5 of the original Directive has been the subject of numerous complaints as well as legal proceedings.
So Parliament and the Council called on the Commission to prepare the statement which we have heard today, a statement that would examine various aspects of the effects on the environment and the internal market.
Our political group is happy with the extended deadlines restored to the new Member States by the recommendation in the revised Directive.
Taking all the various elements into account, we have reached the decision that it is reasonable if the wording is limited to its original purpose and we do not include anything that is in the process of development or is the subject of expert analysis and current proceedings in the European Court.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for all her work as Environment Commissioner.
I know we are going to miss her very much and would like to extend our thanks to her.
I should also like to thank Mrs Corbey for her report.
This is a very important subject, which makes a real difference to our environment.
It is an issue that constituents feel extremely strongly about.
There are two key issues in Mrs Corbey's report.
Firstly the dates.
I understand very well why the rapporteur is proposing slightly later dates than the Commission.
Our Group, the Verts/ALE, cancertainly go along with that, with the proviso that we believe we need to be very careful that these compliance time gaps between older and newer Member States begin to start closing afterwards.
As we have seen before, these gaps have in some cases actually got wider over time, so we need to make sure that over time they begin to close.
On balance, however, we can accept the amendment.
Another key issue is Amendment 4, to which many other speakers have referred.
We have great sympathy with what Mrs Corbey is trying to achieve with this amendment.
The rapporteur is trying to safeguard Dutch national provisions on re-usable packaging.
I would point out that at first reading, Green amendments were aimed specifically at enabling national re-use schemes to proceed, but on that occasion we unfortunately did not secure a big enough majority to get that through.
The Greens strongly support re-use as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of packaging, but we share the reservations expressed by others about trying to tackle that in this directive by amending a recital.
We appreciate the motivation, but we do not think this is the right place to do that.
We are not sure anyway how an amendment will support the Dutch case, since it does not amend the current legislation.
We are not convinced that this recital would have an impact on the Netherlands, since this legislation appears to be much more applicable to the ten new Member States than to the 'old' Member States.
Even if it were applicable, I am not sure how much further forward it would take us.
The main difference between what we already have in Directive 94/62/EC on re-use and what the rapporteur would like to introduce is a slight reinforcement of the level of encouragement to re-use.
But given that the amendment is just to a recital, I do not see how it really strengthens the existing legal possibility.
I strongly urge that we use all our efforts to promote re-use over recycling and recovery when we come to the full review of the packaging directive next year.
I look forward to a strong Commission proposal next summer.
That will be the right time to ensure that we give re-use the priority it deserves.
Â Â  .The revised packaging and packaging waste directive marks another important step towards strategies and policies that focus on waste minimisation, recovery, reuse and recycling.
In both the North and South of Ireland, similar directives are having a positive impact and changing both government practice and public mindsets with respect to domestic and commercial waste management.
Much work remains to be done, but we now have many good examples to learn from, including innovative ideas on reuse.
I also wish to stress the importance of deadlines for ensuring that Member States reach the targets agreed by the EU, and this includes deadlines for the newest Member States.
At local government level in Ireland we have directives which show that recycling brings with it the notion of local authorities, from Belfast to Dublin, actively pursuing new forms of waste management, while at the same time government departments have been moved to concentrate their efforts as a result of these directives.
It is important, however, that those countries which joined the European Union in June 2004 are treated fairly.
I therefore support Mrs Corbey and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with respect to the amendments on this point.
This is not about delay: it is about clarity, effectiveness and fairness.
We need deadlines, but we also need clarity and fairness for all.
On that basis the original agreement on dates should stand.
It is also extremely important for us to ensure that countries can pursue policies on reuse and that we do not close down any possibilities in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, in noting the delay in the implementation of the packaging waste directive that the accession states are to be allowed, I wish to say that, from our experience in Northern Ireland, they are fortunate to escape its requirements for several years.
Under this directive, draconian regulations have been imposed on Northern Ireland.
We now have the ludicrous requirement that a DIY retailer, for example, who buys in packaged goods and sells them on, is required to make returns detailing the net weight of the packaging of all such goods passing through his business, even though he never opens or discards any of the packaging.
He is then liable to what amounts to a waste tax for merely handling the goods and, in addition, has to waste time and effort on trying to assess the weight of the packaging.
I am therefore glad that the accession states are being spared this lunacy.
I note with some surprise that the Republic of Ireland, although a long-established EU Member State, has also been permitted to defer full compliance until the beginning of 2012.
Sadly, the United Kingdom did not seek equal derogation, so we are beset with the foolish regulations I have described.
I am also somewhat surprised that the last speaker seems ignorant of the fact that there are different provisions in the Republic of Ireland and that it has been granted an extension and deferment until the end of 2011.
Perhaps if she concentrated more on the documents, rather than speaking in a language that no one cares to understand, she might not have made such a fundamental mistake.
Â Â  Mr President, to follow on from what my two colleagues have just said, I took part in the adoption of this directive with Mrs Corbey and others.
We were certainly under the impression that the dates mentioned in the preamble to the directive, as it was finally adopted, were the dates that would apply to the accession states.
I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner.
It is very nice to see her here for what must be one of her last debates as Environment Commissioner.
First of all, have the accession states requested these earlier dates? They are embarrassingly close to the Irish dates.
Ireland, as we know, has been looking at this legislation for many years and has done absolutely nothing about it.
Were these earlier dates that the Commission is proposing actually requested by the new Member States?
If not, on what basis have they been decided?
Second, are they based on any cost impact assessment?
There must be some additional cost between the dates that the new Member States wanted and the dates the Commission is proposing.
I believe that these dates show the way in which the Commission operates.
It sees much of this legislation as aspirational.
As my colleague Mr Allister has said, we see it as legal texts that are put into operation.
If we are not very careful, we will find a mass of used packaging being exported from the European Union to China and elsewhere in order to escape this situation.
So could we please have those answers from the Commission?
Â Â  Mr President, I have been provoked by several speakers but I will not be deterred from what I have to say.
The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations.
There is no point in setting a deadline that cannot be achieved and triggering the inevitable infringement procedures.
As Mrs Corbey rightly points out in her report â and I thank her for her work â it is only fair and equitable that the same approach be taken with regard to our colleagues in the new Member States, as was indicted to them during the accession negotiations.
Shifting the finishing line and imposing onerous time constraints at this stage would display a lack of good faith on our part as it unscrambles the hard-won result of the final trialogue on the revised directive earlier this year, as outlined in recital 6 to that directive, which I understood to list, for each new Member State, the date relating to the derogation.
Our debate should focus not on argument about timetables, but on the reduction of the overall level of packaging and packaging waste through recycling and recovery.
I would like to emphasise that the derogations in question are from the timetable and not from the substantive targets.
This is an important distinction which demonstrates that we are not supporting a shirking of responsibilities.
In advance of the Commission's report on the implementation of the original directive next June, I can report that a sensible policy of realistic derogation has already proved a success in my own country, and I hope Mrs Jackson will take note of what I am about to say.
We have a specific problem of demographics, geography and lack of infrastructure, and no indigenous packaging industry, with 80% of our packaged goods being imported.
Ireland has no energy recovery or incineration facilities so all our targets have to be met through recycling alone.
However, we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 93Â 000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 414Â 000 tonnes in 2003.
This represents over 45% of the packaging waste on the Irish market, all of which would previously have gone to landfill.
We have achieved our 2001 target of recycling 25% of packaging and we are well on our way to achieving the 2005 target of a 50% recycling rate thanks to proper, sensible timelines and derogations.
There has been a clear shift in the public mindset in relation to recycling in Ireland.
61% of adults visit their local Bring Centre at least once a month, as opposed to only 25% in 1998.
Bringing about this change has taken â and will continue to take â time, effort and investment, a fact that is reflected in the 2011-2012 timetable set in the revised packaging directive for Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
I was the author of that particular amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support.
The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States.
Our quest for better regulation as a Parliament must start with enforceable legislation.
If we are to set unreasonable objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste which take no account of capacity constraints, we might just as well get it over with now, book our slot in advance at the ECJ for non-implementation and spare the Commission a waste of envelopes on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty.
I would like to put on record my disappointment at MrÂ Allister's comment on MrsÂ de BrÃºn speaking a language 'no one cares to understand'.
It may well not be the time or place to speak in Irish, but I do not think that derogatory and disparaging remarks about anyone's language, albeit a minority language, have any place in this House and I take exception to them.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding work in this important and thought-provoking Directive on packaging waste.
With the enlarged Europe we now find ourselves in a situation in which the common targets set to achieve harmonised legislation are particularly stringent for the newest Member States, and perhaps more so than ever before.
In this sense, the proposal for a Directive on packaging and packaging waste is not exceptional.
The entry into force of this directive must be based on the guarantee of an internal market that is as viable as possible without any risk of distortions.
This is easier said than done.
The area of the internal market has expanded, and there are perhaps greater differences in the basic standards of Member States than ever before.
The Commissionâs proposal to lay down a common deadline of December 2012 for the new Member States regarding recovery and recycling targets under the packaging waste directive can be justified for market convergence to be achieved as soon as possible.
The proposal, however, is not without its problems.
Consequently, it might well be prudent to take the long view and take basic standards in the new countries into greater consideration when setting the deadline.
This way we will avoid any embarrassing repercussions that result from breaches of the conditions set and at the same time give priority to European convergence instead of market harmonisation which is now being discussed.
There has also been much discussion in connection with the reading of the Directive on the recycling and recovery of packaging waste.
The ecological value of reuse is incontestable.
It should be realised, however, that the environmental friendliness of reused packaging is not always directly justifiable.
For short transportation journeys it certainly is preferable, but problems arise when each producer has its own packaging and internal distances in the European market are long.
A good example is the transportation of fruit from the countries in the south to the Nordic countries, where the retransportation of reused packaging would not promote sustainable development at all.
For example, cardboard boxes and cartons are often collected and recycled locally, to avoid a large number of unnecessary journeys.
Promoting reused packaging whilst ignoring environmental considerations would be ecologically hypocritical.
From the point of view of the report under discussion now, it would be good if the objective of coherent adaptation were not unnecessarily compromised by vague reuse systems of packaging at national level.
Â Â  Before I call on Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to speak, I shall remind Members who have intended to make use of unofficial Union languages that this institution has a profound respect for their decision but, at the same time, according to a Bureau decision of 27 October last, speeches made in these languages cannot be translated and, consequently, cannot be Minuted.
Members are therefore free to choose whether to make use of the Unionâs minority languages.
At the same time let us remember that in the Constitution we have written , âunited in diversityâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I am sure you will appreciate it if I refrain from speaking northern Swedish â if there is such a thing.
Firstly, Mrs Jackson, as you know, our proposal suggests a deadline of 31 December 2012 for all the new Member States.
The amendment confirms the deadline for seven new Member States, but allows a deadline of 2013 for Malta, 2014 for Poland and 2015 for Latvia.
In reply to your question, this reflects the wishes the new Member States expressed to the Commission in the consultation round in spring 2003.
A recital in the revised directive states that the deadline to be agreed should not be later than those dates.
It is also my understanding that no agreement was reached in conciliation on a particular date.
The recital indicated specifically that the decision should be taken on the basis of requests from the acceding states for derogations, which would not in principle extend beyond the dates mentioned.
So there is nothing to suggest that the date could not be earlier.
The Commission considers that this matter should be debated openly, treating all countries equally.
We have no problem in accepting differentiated dates, if that is what Parliament and the Council want.
On the costs, we do not anticipate any significant change.
There will be no dramatic change in costs if the dates are changed.
Thank you for this important debate and your valuable cooperation on environmental issues.
I hope we will meet again soon.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Cuba.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union's relations with Cuba are governed by the common position originally adopted by the Council in 1996, which has been updated and renewed regularly.
The common position advocates a policy of constructive engagement with Cuba through enhanced dialogue with government and civil society with the objective of encouraging 'a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people'.
This constructive engagement has remained our position.
Following the large-scale imprisonment of dissidents in 2003, the Union took a series of political measures.
In June 2003 the EU decided to limit bilateral high-level visits to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events, to invite Cuban members of the peaceful opposition to their national day celebrations alongside government representatives and to re-evaluate the common position ahead of time.
The most recent re-evaluation of the common position in June this year re-affirmed the policy of constructive engagement as the basis of EU policy towards Cuba.
The EU has repeatedly underscored the importance of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and has indicated its willingness to restart such a dialogue when conditions permit.
The European Commission deplores the Cuban Government's decision to freeze relations with all embassies of EU Member States that have invited dissidents to their national days and with the Commission delegation in Havana, as well as the refusal of direct aid from the European Union.
Despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission has continued funding actions by NGOs and humanitarian actions managed by ECHO.
In October 2004 the Commission took a decision to provide EUR 1 million in humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable victims of hurricanes Ivan and Charlie in Cuba.
We should not really talk about humanitarian assistance in this context because we would deliver humanitarian assistance in any case, without any political considerations.
The decision by the Cuban Government to release certain dissidents on health grounds is a positive gesture to an improved situation, but not sufficient to warrant full revocation of the measures decided by the Council in June last year.
The aim continues to be the release of all political prisoners in Cuba.
The June measures are currently being reviewed by the Council.
The European Council wishes to stress that the result of this review has to be consistent with the overall aims of the common position and the human rights policy of the EU.
In the Commission's view, this could provide a basis for a constructive and future-oriented EU policy towards Cuba, which would be conducive to attaining the objectives of the common position.
Some people have asked whether the delegation in Havana can really function meaningfully in the present circumstances.
I want to make it clear that the delegation in Havana is essential to carry out the tasks that Parliament has asked the Commission to undertake.
Our presence in Cuba is more important today than ever.
The main tasks of the delegation are not only to assist with the implementation of eight programmes and projects, but also to promote a political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society, to monitor human rights issues and to protect the trade and investment interests of Member States.
This is a heavy, important, and sometimes difficult agenda to pursue, but it is essential if we wish to promote political and economic improvements in Cuba.
All in all, I would say that 2003 was a sad year in our relations with Cuba.
In my view, it was a lost opportunity for Cuba and the EU that membership of the Cotonou Agreement did not succeed.
I hope that what happened in 2003 will not turn out to be irreversible.
I still find Cuban membership of the Cotonou Agreement a very meaningful framework for our relations.
It represents the basic structure of how we would like to organise and govern north-south relations.
Cuban participation in Cotonou also means that Cuba would be subject to peer pressure within the Cotonou Agreement.
I hope that it is still possible to keep an open mind, but that also means an open mind inside Cuba.
Â Â  . Mr President, few Members will have worked as hard to preserve our capacity for dialogue with the authorities of the regime and the Cuban people as I have during my period as chairman of this Parliament's committee responsible for relations with that country.
But the dialogue that we advocate, that we believe in and which we put into practice, Mr President, has not been wrecked by any government of the European Union, nor by Osvaldo PayÃ¡, nor by Elisardo SÃ¡nchez, nor by Marta Beatriz Roque, but by the policy of executions, the arrest of independent journalists - such as RaÃºl Rivero, who is currently rotting in Cuban prisons, and others - and the policy of arresting peaceful dissidents and human rights campaigners.
Faced with these events, our Parliament cannot remain deaf, dumb and blind.
The Council's common position, which some people wish pointlessly to alter â and we have the results of todayâs comparison, which have been a spectacular disaster for the approach of changing it - requesting a new report from the Ambassadors in Havana, has served, as expressed by Mario Vargas Llosa in an article published recently in the newspaper, to send a clear message to the millions of Cubans who cannot protest, vote or escape, that they are not alone, that they have not been abandoned and that the western democracies are with them.
What is proposed to us by certain political groups in this Parliament in their resolution, where there is not even any mention of calling for the release of political prisoners?
To cooperate and talk with the villains and mock the victims?
To be complacent towards those who oppress them?
To seek a policy of appeasement and friendship with tyranny?
Mr President, Andrei Sakharov, who left us a legacy of moral integrity and a significant lesson in peaceful co-existence between peoples, said that the voices that count are often those which cannot be heard.
Mr President, the forced absence from the Sakharov Prize award ceremony last year of one of its most honourable recipients, Osvaldo PayÃ¡, is the best possible argument for speaking out on behalf of those people inside and outside of Cuba who are fighting for their freedom and dignity, and for this Parliament, Mr President, to be very forceful in its demand for freedom, as it has always been.
Â Â  . Mr President, in its relations with Cuba, as with any other country of the world, and particularly the developing world, the European Union must pursue two objectives: on the one hand, it must contribute to improving the lives of the Cuban people in all respects, including in terms of freedoms and human rights, areas in which we note serious shortcomings, and on the other, it must defend European interests of other types in Cuba.
There have been two characteristics of the European Unionâs policy on Cuba over recent years that have set that country apart, made it an exception, all in line with an unjustifiable approach which the founders of that policy were never able to justify.
The European Unionâs dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of the world includes a chapter on the human rights situation.
It is an extremely important chapter, but there are others.
Only in the case of Cuba is the human rights chapter exclusive, precluding any other chapter which should exist in our relations with that country.
Furthermore, with all the countries of the world, the European Unionâs dialogue and cooperation is aimed at overcoming shortcomings in the field of human rights.
Only in the case of Cuba do those human rights shortcomings become a prior condition, preventing dialogue and cooperation.
At this point we must carry out an objective evaluation of that policy, the results of which have been a complete failure.
Such an objective view reveals that, through this policy, not the slightest progress has been made in relation to freedoms or human rights in Cuba.
In addition to this, this policy has been a disaster for European interests in Cuba and it is condemned equally by businesspeople, non-governmental organisations, artists, religious leaders, etc. It has also been disastrous in terms of our diplomatic representatives carrying out their activities normally in that country.
Furthermore, however, this policy has demonstrated a complete distancing of our European societies from their respective national governments and the European Union itself, and absolutely no notice has been taken of their views.
Similarly, various initiatives ignored or even boycotted by official bodies have attracted a great deal of participation from artists, authors, businesspeople and citizens of our countries.
I am referring, for example, to the art biennale, the book fair, the ballet festival or the trade fair in Havana.
The Vice-Chairman of the United Kingdomâs Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, has been in Cuba over recent days carrying out a programme of contacts at the highest level.
It was no doubt to him that a distinguished colleague was referring when on Monday he talked about the visitors to the island, and I am sure it was with particular bitterness that his party colleague spoke of him.
Finally, we believe that this policy has damaged Europeâs credibility in Cuba and in the whole of Latin America, by giving the impression that we are supporting US strategies in the region.
Following this assessment, our conclusion is that the policy pursued so far by the European Union in relation to Cuba, and which is based on the common position and measures, must be reviewed, rationalised and updated.
What we are saying is in line with what several Member State governments are saying in the European Council.
Furthermore, we would make it absolutely clear that the change of policy we are advocating must not only mean not giving up on any of our objectives â expressed at the beginning of my speech â but must confirm them and aspire to contributing to achieving them more effectively than has been the case so far.
We are convinced that the progress we are pursuing for Cubans and for European interests in Cuba will be achieved more easily through broad and rigorous dialogue and cooperation, which is critical whenever it needs to be, but never hostile and without making any prejudgements.
Furthermore, in doing so we will be applying the same approach to that country as we do to China, Vietnam, Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan and also the United States and dozens of other countries in which we note very serious shortcomings, which in many cases are much more serious than those in Cuba, in terms of freedoms, human rights and the Rule of Law, but with which we talk and cooperate precisely with a view to improving the things we do not like.
Mr President, that is the aim of the resolution presented by our group and supported by other sections of the House.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour.
Exactly two years ago, we awarded the Cuban democracy activist, Oswaldo PayÃ¡ our Sakharov Prize.
It was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that had proposed him for this prize, and he received it for his courageous fight for democracy and justice in Cuba.
He received it as a representative of all Cubans from different party groups: Christian Democrats, Liberals, Social Democrats and others who, by peaceful means, are trying to pave the way for a new Cuba without Castro, whether his name be Fidel or Raoul.
PayÃ¡ and the others are working for a Cuba in which democracy, human rights, pluralism, freedom and justice exist for all.
It was not easy getting Oswaldo PayÃ¡ here.
On several occasions, the Cuban regime tried to prevent him from coming, but we succeeded in the end.
Unfortunately, we did not succeed in getting him to come back.
Since Oswaldo PayÃ¡ was awarded the Sakharov Prize, the situation in Cuba has deteriorated.
About eighty democracy activists have been arrested and sentenced, following farcical trials, to very long prison sentences.
They are now spread out over the island.
They are faring badly.
Their living conditions are appalling, and they very rarely see their families.
Many of them are ill.
I have met many of these people.
They are fantastic, courageous people who wish to adopt a peaceful route to establishing human dignity and democracy for themselves and their fellow countrymen.
For Castro, the dictator pathetically romanticised by many in Europe, these people are, however, a grave threat.
That is why they had to be silenced.
That is why they have been imprisoned.
Osvaldo himself is at liberty, and his family is harassed on a daily basis.
The situation in Cuba, one of the worldâs last Communist dictatorships, is worse.
No progress has been made since the Council toughened its so-called common position.
Castro continues to be intractable.
He appears to want to isolate the country completely.
Just as the Commissioner said, he is boycotting the EU and our Member States.
Several Members of the European Parliament, including Swedish MEPs, have been denied entry to the country.
There is a debate at the present moment as to whether the EU should modify its common position or make it less stringent.
That would be very unfortunate.
Why should we reward Castro when there is no progress on human rights?
For once, the EU has a consistent position on a dictatorship.
Why, then, should we change it?
Oswaldo PayÃ¡ and the other dissidents are appealing to us to hold fast to our values and to the policy we have adopted.
That is why it is important to intensify our dialogue with the dissidents and to support a gradual transition to democracy.
We honoured Oswaldo PayÃ¡ and the other Cuban democracy activists here in this House, and that was a long-term commitment.
We must stand up for human rights and vigorously reject a change to the common position.
Just like ourselves, Cubans are entitled to democracy and human rights.
Let us show them which side we are on.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group is unequivocal in its defence of freedom and human rights.
For us, the defence of all the rights of Cubans is a key issue.
We have always called for the release of all prisoners and we also call for a clear transition to democracy.
The question at the moment is how best to push Cuba towards democracy; after 40 years of embargo, and now with the European Unionâs sanctions, we can see that this method is not effective and that the best way to help Cuban society is not to isolate it, but rather to create increasingly close and strong relations with Cuban civil society, to help the NGOs in society.
The openness of Cuban society is at stake here.
We cannot help a society which wants to move towards democracy by means of a confrontation which only seeks, through the resolution of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a break-off of relations with unforeseeable consequences, when what we want, as for any part of the world, is an agreed transition, without violence, which can lead to the democracy which everybody, in particular the Verts/ALE Group, is seeking.
We therefore support this Resolution in favour of Cuban society and in favour of democracy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our friendly relations with Cuba are longstanding and ongoing.
You see, Cuba is an example of a small island attempting to determine its own existence, and to do so in a way that is different compared with the great imperial power.
We look on this with solidarity.
Naturally, we are also able to express our criticisms, explicitly and without restraint, as we have done and continue to do, as regards the death penalty and certain judicial procedures, for example.
However, we consider it mistaken, unjust and unacceptable that punitive measures should be taken against Cuba.
For decades, Cuba has suffered from a ferocious economic blockade imposed by the US administration.
Frankly, there is no reason why Europe should align itself with such measures.
On the contrary, it is precisely relations, trade and engagement that can foster understanding and improvements.
In Latin America important and historic events are taking place, as witnessed by the victory of progressive forces in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Uruguay.
By comparison with the logic of laissez-faire globalisation and war â and today we have seen some terrible images â the need for an alternative politics is emerging: Cuba is part of this Latin America.
The relationship with Europe helps this Latin America, and the relationship with Latin America helps Europe.
We call for the abolition of all measures discriminating against Cuba and, consequently, of the Councilâs common position; a similar demand must be addressed to the US Government.
At the same time, we call for a strengthening of free and fruitful relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Fidel Castroâs antics are hard to follow, both literally and figuratively, but also politically, socio-economically and culturally speaking. stands his ground.
His word is law.
Just ask the opposition.
It becomes the European Union that it wishes to recognise and support the independent Cuban spirits.
Today, however, this policy is under internal pressure.
According to reports, the Spanish Government in particular would like to leave Cuban dissidents out in the cold from now on, and Madrid is looking to recruit allies among the other Member States.
This unfortunate development prompted the Christian trade union leader in my country, Doekle Terpstra, to send a letter to the Dutch Presidency earlier this week.
This letter urges the European Union not to make any concessions in respect of Castroâs dictatorship in exchange for trade benefits.
I am only too pleased to lend my backing to this appeal.
At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission whether there is any coordination between the EUâs human rights policy and that of the United States with regard to Castroâs Cuba?
If so, how do they intend to reinforce it?
Finally, I should like to make a request to the Commission.
As a Member of this House, I am looking forward to a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Cuba, including future scenarios, from your point of view.
The fact that we have an official delegation in Havana should make this feasible.
I should like to finish off with the appeal by Oswaldo JosÃ© PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as.
Thanks to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I have just read the letter that is addressed to the President of this House.
This letter is basically saying that all governments, regional and international associations and institutions, should, if they really wish to enter into normal relations with Cuba, begin by demanding amnesty for the political prisoners.
We should avoid at all costs forging relationships while the rights of all Cubans are still being violated.
I thank you.
Â Â  I speak as a representative of the New Italian Socialist Party.
On 5 June 2003, the Council voted unanimously to impose political sanctions on the Cuban regime, following the indictment of 75 dissidents and the death sentence imposed on three citizens who had tried to flee to the United States.
This event unfortunately fits into a general picture of continued and repeated violations and negation of fundamental freedoms in Cuba, as also confirmed recently by COLAT.
Fidel Castroâs regime, which is in severe difficulty following growing internal and international pressure, is becoming more and more oppressive and repressive, in particular towards the younger generation, which dreams of a future of freedom, true democracy and development, a new and open horizon, incompatible with the current communist establishment.
Europe should therefore pursue the firm path it has embarked upon, taking particular care, however, to avoid at all costs any further negative repercussions for the population, with the aim of laying the foundations for a productive and renewed dialogue free of resentment between the Cuban people and Europe in the period after Fidel Castro: friends of Cuba, friends of the Cubans, enemies of all dictators.
Â Â  Mr President, there is manoeuvring going on by governments and Members of Parliament which is difficult to understand, for two reasons: firstly, because it is not always open and because it often smells of complicity.
Secondly, because the manoeuvring is not consistent with the constant, repeated and dramatic demands of those people who are fighting peacefully and suffering in Cuba.
They are shadowy manoeuvres and appear to show such a desire to betray our 2002 Sakharov Prize winner, that I am reminded of a poem by a great lady of Portuguese poetry, Sofia de Mello Breyner, who died a few weeks ago: âTears for todayâ.
âWe will never cry enough when we see a creative gesture stopped.
We will never cry enough when we see a person with the courage to fight destroyed by contempt, malice and other means we know of which are so cunning, so subtle and so expert that they are almost beyond descriptionâ.
When we talk about Cuba and the Cuban regime, we must always ask ourselves the question: what kind of Parliament is this?
A Parliament of freedom or a Parliament of repression, a Parliament of the citizen or a Parliament of the tyrant?
That is the question we must answer.
We are not talking on our own behalf, but on behalf of the actual people fighting and suffering for freedom and democracy.
This is not a party-political issue; it is a fundamental political and human issue for the real people over in Cuba, where the pain is felt, who are watching us and listening to us: BÃ¡rbaro Sevilla GarcÃ­a, 22 years old, executed; Lorenzo Copello Castillo, 30 years old, executed; Jorge Luis MartÃ­nez Izak, 40 years old, executed; VÃ­ctor Rolando Arroyo Carmona, sentenced to 26 years in prison; Miguel GalbÃ¡n GutiÃ©rrez, sentenced to 26 years in prison; Jorge Vero CastaÃ±eda, sentenced to 20 years in prison; Pablo Pacheco Ãvila, sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr President, I do not have time now to read all the names of the dozens of victims of the tragic March of 2003, and their families, friends and colleagues.
There are so many of them that I do not have time.
What is the significance of not having time to name them all?
It means that this is not the time to change our European policy, but rather for Fidel Castro and the Cuban regime to change theirs.
That is what is needed.
Amnesty first, and then dialogue.
Â Â  â Mr President, the resolution tabled for adoption by plenary in the European Parliament at the initiative of the Socialist Group comes along at a particularly crucial time for relations between the European Union and Cuba, for the Cuban people and for the future of the country. I would even add for our collective credibility as institutions of the European Union.
Cuba has suffered for many years the unacceptable, unilateral and revengeful policy of isolation and commercial and economic exclusion of the United States, which has pushed the Cuban people into poverty and forced the regime to harden.
Unfortunately, this deadlock policy, which is characterised by selective sensitivity to the question of human rights and democratic freedoms, was also applied by the European Union in its decisions to impose sanctions and freeze relations and dialogue.
This had a very adverse effect at all levels.
The planned objective was not achieved, in that European public opinion itself, non-governmental organisations and business and cultural associations ignored the official policy of the European Union and continued to maintain relations and work with Cuban society.
We need to be honest.
The situation in human rights, the rule of law and democratic freedoms in Cuba is not good.
However, as international experience has proven, isolation and segregation are not a credible or effective policy.
Wherever such a policy has been applied, the people have ultimately paid the price.
The European Union, and the Council of Ministers in particular, should radically rethink its deadlock stand and have the courage to lift sanctions and restore relations with Cuba immediately.
It should proceed to establish political dialogue, as a means of advancing relations and as a means of controlling the conduct of the Cuban authorities.
It should proceed to open negotiations on the conclusion of a cooperation agreement.
Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has no such agreement.
The European Union should support the funding of programmes in the humanitarian aid and infrastructure sectors.
The recent natural disasters have created serious problems for the Cuban people.
Finally, the European Union should take an immediate decision to integrate Cuba into the Cotonou Agreement within the framework of relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
The Cuban people cannot suffer double punishment, both from the United States and from the European Union.
If the fight for the defence of human rights and the building of a democratic society in Cuba is in fact an honest rather than an ostentatious fight, then the European Union should listen to the voice of European public opinion, of our people, and proceed to lift sanctions and develop relations and contacts with Cuba.
Â Â  Mr President, there are two facts here: Cuba does not have political freedom, and neither did Spain when, under the Franco regime, with the jails full of political prisoners, she signed a spectacular trade agreement with the European Union.
That is a fact.
Another true fact is that the European Union has maintained a common position since 1996 which has produced no positive result whatsoever and which has made no contribution to improving the situation on the island.
Statements to the effect that those who do not agree, for example, with the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or with the exiles in Miami, are on the side of Castro, are exactly the kind of things we have heard from the White House, saying that those who questioned the US position on Iraq were automatically allied with Saddam Hussein.
They are poor arguments, devoid of content and entirely inconsistent with European political reality, with the way in which we in Europe have dealt with our relations with every other region of the world, where we have rejected the black and white approach, a dialogue between Saint Michael and Satan, and where we work in accordance with the specific reality, with political practice, with changes as they take place.
We have done so in relation to Libya, in relation to Iran, in relation to Korea.
We have done so in relation to other countries and we want to continue doing so with Cuba.
The European Unionâs position on Cuba cannot be based on a gut reaction or an instinctive rejection of the political reality of Cuba or the figure of Fidel Castro.
The European Unionâs policy on Cuba must be born of reason, as is the case with so many other places, and must take account of the real needs of the Cuban people.
The resolution to be voted on tomorrow, if voted for in its original version, prohibits the Council from modifying or even reconsidering the position on Cuba until Cuban jails have been emptied.
We would like to empty Cuban jails of political prisoners and we would like political freedom in Azerbaijan and in Ukraine and in Belarus and in Sudan, and in China as well.
But we know that this is far from pragmatic and inconsistent with the political realism with which we in Europe can act and which has produced many results in many parts of the world.
We would also like the fanaticism of certain people to be replaced with pragmatic thinking so that we can really move towards the peaceful transition in Cuba that some people are doing everything they can to prevent.
Â Â  Mr President, we have little time to deal with a situation as complex and as rich as that in Cuba.
We certainly must in this short time remember the battle of David and Goliath: the battle of an island which, for over forty years, has suffered from a war waged by the world giant â the United States.
But we are in Europe, and we must speak about Europe.
I consider it quite right that the European Union should change its attitude towards Cuba, because our current position is entirely subservient to US Government pressure.
Europe would in this way signal its independence, its autonomy â which does not mean conflict with the United States, but actually means autonomy and independence of judgment in international affairs.
There is talk of the fight against terrorism, of the fight for human rights, but there is a question that I should like to ask.
Why is it that in any part of the world someone who hijacks a ship or an aeroplane is called a terrorist, whereas someone who does the same in Cuba is called a defender of freedom or a dissident?
Why are there double standards when one speaks of Cuba and when one speaks of Iraq?
These are the reasons why â just to show that I am a romantic and love poetry â I should have no hesitation in supporting all actions and resolutions in favour of Cuba, its people and its original revolution.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Cuba must not become some kind of fenced-off reserve, with a sign on the fence reading âhuman rights not respected hereâ.
Cuba is not an âanimal farmâ, to use the title of a book by GeorgeÂ Orwell, nor is it FidelÂ Castroâs âfarmâ.
During yesterdayâs one-minute speeches, it was said that Members of this House should not travel to Cuba on EU money, but that is not the issue at stake.
We must stand firm and continue to call on the Cuban regime to respect human rights, and we must be rigorous in demanding the release of political prisoners.
We should not, however, create additional barriers and obstacles.
If we isolate Cuba, Castro is most likely to benefit, not the opposition.
According to Human Rights Watch, Castro is not suffering under the US embargo, but the Cuban people as a whole most certainly are.
The Eighth Session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will begin next Saturday in the Netherlands, and in view of this I should like to note that 77 of the countries that are Members of the Assembly believe that relations with Cuba should be stepped up, not scaled down.
We would do well to fight for human rights, and we should do so effectively.
Sometimes, even if our intentions are good and we defend the correct values, we may unintentionally cause harm to the people of Cuba and assist those who order them to chant âsocialism or death!â
I hope the decision taken on Cuba by the EUâs 25Â Foreign Affairs Ministers in December will be realistic and that it will defend human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, Cuba has regrettably failed to make any progress on human rights in the past year, indeed, since I last spoke on the subject.
But it has had the recent good fortune of Mr Zapatero's new socialist government coming to power in Spain.
MrÂ Zapatero seems keen to cosy up to Castro, aided and abetted â shamefully â by the British, Italian and French Governments, which have decided to try to change the tough policy of ostracising the Castro regime and regularly inviting Cuban dissidents to EU embassy functions.
This was done last year in protest, after MrÂ Castro imprisoned 75 dissidents and human rights activists and executed three ferry highjackers fleeing the island.
Castro has recently expelled visiting European MPs and NGO workers keen to engage with dissidents under the Varela Project.
The role of Prime Minister Blair, as a close friend of President Bush, who is tough on Cuba, is a bit of a mystery, unless it is some shabby deal cut over Gibraltar, which is thankfully off the agenda in Madrid right now.
For a long time the Cuban Government has been able to blame all the country's woes on the American embargo.
That is why our resolution supports lifting it.
I am not sure that will help, as lifting it might relieve the increasing economic hardship, worsened by Castro's stupidity in recently banning the dollar for trading purposes as a response to tighter travel restrictions by the US on Cuban exiles visiting their families.
Oswaldo PayÃ¡, our Sakarov Prize winner, is still denied the right to visit the European Parliament, but he has written a letter to President Borrell, urging the EU to stand firm on its common European position for as long as the authorities continue their violations of fundamental rights, which included a disgraceful lack of adequate medical care for Cuban prisoners.
I applaud the resolve of countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have been used to the tyranny of communism and have stood firm on any relaxation of the current arrangements.
No doubt when the ailing tyrant finally passes away many in this House will sing his praises as the historic father of the nation, as they have recently done sycophantically on the death of President Arafat.
I, however, will regard the departure of President Castro as a fresh chance to build a prosperous and democratic Cuba.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much agree with Commissioner Nielson that 2003 was a sad year for EU-Cuba relations, and one of lost opportunities.
I was in Cuba recently with colleagues on an ad hoc delegation.
I saw for myself the enormous potential of that country â a potential unrealised at present as a result, among other things, of the US sanctions and the current situation with the European Union.
I also agree with Commissioner Nielson that we need a constructive EU policy towards Cuba.
Others in this House do not seem to have been listening.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra is not listening to me now, but he said a few moments ago that we should stand firm in demanding freedom.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m said that the Cubans have a right to democracy.
Do they believe that people on this side of the House do not believe in human rights?
They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on.
We have made it clear that we do believe in human rights.
No one in this House has ever defended the death penalty.
However, we have to be realistic.
After 45 years, changes will not come quickly.
Some people in this House will also argue that we should never talk to political opponents if we disagree fundamentally with their political and military tactics.
Where has that ever got anyone?
Can anyone think of an example where that has improved the situation?
I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work.
I could respond to Mr Tannock's rather pathetic remarks, but it belittles this debate to bring in all sorts of other issues when we are talking about Cuba.
I would remind Mr Tannock and others, when they are looking for parallels or examples around the world, that in different circumstances the UK Government never got anywhere with the Irish situation until we were prepared to enter into very difficult negotiations with our political opponents, people with whom we disagreed fundamentally.
That is the only way we are going to achieve peace in the Middle East.
We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba.
That is why I would argue that we need an exchange of ideas in order to promote change.
The present EU policy, founded on the issue of who is invited to summer parties â or not â does not help Cuba or Europe, and needs to be changed.
I urge Members to think very carefully and support a sensible and realistic compromise text that will move the EU forward, will help Cuba and will help the world.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the law passed in Cuba this year limiting access to the Internet is a clear violation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
It was adopted as a punishment to society, following the statements made last year by a group of 75Â protesters fighting for the freedom to express their opinions.
The law allows the Internet to be accessed only from selected businesses and government offices.
It should also be noted that in 2002 the government placed a ban on the sale of computers to the public, making this yearâs law merely one more in a series of measures aimed at protesters and independent journalists.
Cuba and its left-wing allies all over the world constantly present us with the myth of the revolutionary event that took place several decades ago, when the corrupt Batista government was overthrown.
Are we to allow this myth to blind us to the reality of life in the modern police state of Cuba, to the imprisonment, repression and persecution suffered by those who merely desire liberty and basic civil freedoms?
As citizens of a part of Europe that was occupied by Russia and its Communist allies for decades, we know how much meaning a small gesture of solidarity by the free world can have for activists campaigning on behalf of those who have been imprisoned and persecuted because of their views.
We know from our own experience that the only thing anti-democratic regimes take any notice of is firmness and consistency, and that all the efforts of such regimes are directed towards breaking international solidarity with human rights defenders.
This is the very reason why we must not disengage ourselves.
Measures we can and should take as EU Member States include diplomatic sanctions and support for those who defend civil rights.
It is also important to speak out on their behalf in the international arena.
My message to those who thoughtlessly carry round gadgets bearing images of CheÂ Guevara is merely that they should add to them the slogan âCuba yes, weâre starting afreshâ.
The dissidents charged with conspiring against Cubaâs independence and territorial integrity were actually imprisoned simply because they exercised their fundamental rights in a peaceful manner.
It should be noted that the number of those suffering persecution has increased and decreased in proportion to the level of pressure exerted by other countries, and also in proportion to the extent of FidelÂ Castroâs international interests.
The current escalation is a step backwards for human rights in Cuba, and it is therefore crucially important that international support for Cuban democrats be reiterated, and that diplomatic sanctions be kept in place against the regime.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been an atmosphere of suspense in Cuba for some time.
External pressures are mounting, while internally there has been a relative worsening of the situation for freedom of expression and more generally for human rights.
In this situation, the European Union must take up a clear position, without waiting for further events.
What is Europeâs objective?
It is proper to ask ourselves this question, because there are those who, especially in the United States, are hoping for a traumatic collapse of the regime, based on a hegemonic vision that has not altered substantially ever since the embargo was imposed.
Meanwhile, I must say that it is difficult to see what dynamic vision the ruling classes of Cuba now have for the future of their nation after the end of the cold war.
All told, one can see a stalemate, caused by political immobilism both at home and abroad.
In this situation, I believe that the Union cannot simply entrench itself behind the question of human rights, or, worse still, line up behind those who would use it as a political jemmy.
There are plenty of examples to show that what applies to Cuba does not apply in equal measure to many other countries.
The recent European UnionâASEAN summit, with the full participation of Burma, perfectly encapsulates the double standard that operates on human rights.
Even today, in this Chamber, when Commissioner Patten was speaking on the subject of the arms embargo on China, he stated that the Commission has never established a direct link between a possible lifting of the embargo and human rights policy.
He did clarify, however, and quite rightly, that further progress in the field of human rights could make a change in Europeâs attitude easier.
Well then, I do not see why the same pragmatic attitude, based on a positive and motivational approach â and not simply one that is sanctions-based and punitive â cannot also be applied to Cuba.
As we all know from experience, in the era of globalisation, helping to break Cubaâs isolation through greater economic cooperation would not fail to have positive repercussions on its internal politics, beginning precisely with human rights.
Only those who look to the future with the eyes of the past, anticipating ideological revenge, can ignore this simple truth.
That is why the European Union needs to change gear.
We need more imagination and a new and autonomous policy towards Cuba.
A more advanced and intense phase of political dialogue and cooperation must be opened up, which fully involves not only governments but also civil society in all its facets.
We need to clear the path to a peaceful, negotiated transition towards a fully democratic and pluralistic change, and affirm the notion of a Cuban road to democracy.
These must now be the objectives of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, to the things I condemned yesterday in this very House â that is to say, the obscure backroom manoeuvres of the Spanish Government aimed at reducing the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the Castro regime â I can now add the media manipulation of the results of the meeting of the European Councilâs Committee on Latin America, which at no point has reduced the sanctions imposed on the regime in 2003.
Those sanctions â I would remind certain confused Members â were not implemented by the âhordesâ of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but during the Greek Socialist Governmentâs Presidency of the Union.
What has the Castro regime done over the last year to be thrown such an unexpected and generous lifeline?
The answer is simple: nothing.
Or rather it has imprisoned and tortured more opponents and isolated the Cuban population even further, moving them further away from our dream: a free and democratic Cuba.
I do not intend to give up on that dream and I know that many members of other groups in this Parliament, including the Socialist Group, will not do so either.
This Parliament has always been a model and a pioneer in defence of human rights and at this critical time it must demonstrate that it will not throw in its lot with a corrupt dictator in full decline nor be carried along by the collaborationism of certain Members who have always been manipulated by that dictatorship.
The democratic model of co-existence on the island and the hope of a peaceful political transition which will give Cuba and its people the important role on the international stage they have always deserved must win out today.
In order to achieve that aim, it is essential that all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Castroâs jails be released immediately, that the torture and execution of dissidents cease immediately, that there be free dialogue amongst all the parties and the recognition by the regime that it is they who are isolated rather than the brave people of Cuba who are calling for freedom.
I would call on all my fellow Members to share this dream with me and I hope that we will all wake up one day soon to a free Cuba in control of its own destiny.
Â Â  Mr President, I have always been surprised that Cuba should be used as a missile we launch against each other, depending on our individual ideological persuasions, and solely for the benefit of public opinion within certain European countries, in particular in my country, Spain.
Can we not take this opportunity â it would appear not â to come together and think solely of the Cuban people, of their present and their future, rather than make the issue an excessively ideological one and exploit it for party political purposes?
What are the aspirations of the Cuban people?
I believe we would all agree that their aspiration is to overcome the immense deficiencies they suffer in both the economic field and in the field of freedoms and civil, social and political rights.
I believe their aspiration is to have the hope of a better future, to begin, sooner rather than later, an ordered and peaceful democratic transition to bring reconciliation to all Cubans, those living in Cuba and those in exile.
I believe they would like the Europeans not to fight amongst ourselves â as we are doing here tonight â but rather to unite to help them as much as possible, because they must be the masters of their future, not us.
Mr President, our differences today relate to the common position adopted by the European Union in 1996.
Some governments and some honourable Members propose reforming it; others propose not changing a thing, but both are legitimate positions, there are arguments for both, and they do not mean that one side are lackeys of the United States and the others are accomplices of Fidel Castro.
Let us leave aside this type of argument, as the previous speaker said.
I believe that, after eight years, the common position deserves evaluation and a possible but consensual reform, with a very broad, practically unanimous, agreement in the Council, which allows us to explore new positions on Cuba which are more effective but in no way provide a lifeline for the Cuban dictatorship and which in no way undermine the dissidents, the opposition or the political prisoners, many of whom are suffering dreadfully in prison.
If the huge majority of this House is convinced that in Cuba there is a totalitarian dictatorship and an oppressed people who deserve our help and if we agree on the need to end the damaging US embargo and that dialogue between governments is a valid instrument, why are we going to find it so difficult to agree on a policy on Cuba?
As you will understand, however, I am very sceptical, given our debate tonight.
Â Â  Mr President, the Cuban political system is unique in the world.
We, as a parliament, absolutely condemn the human rights situation in the country and the lack of free speech.
However, that is not to say that the situation is all bad.
On a recent visit to the country we found that schools, where there is a ratio of 15 pupils to one teacher, are the envy of Europe.
The humanitarian work of educating doctors to transform health services in developing countries is not a case of talking about solidarity with Africa, but acting on solidarity with Africa.
Today, however, relations between the EU and Cuba are at an all-time low.
There has been no high-level contact between the governments of the EU and Cuba for over a year. The situation came about as a result of the EU pursuing sanctions against Cuba for a crackdown on dissidents in 2003.
The sanctions came in the form of an invitation to Cuban dissidents to attend Member States' national day celebrations, alongside government representatives in Cuba.
This action clearly infuriated the Cubans.
They were the ones who cut off contact.
My appeal tonight is that we should be consistent in our approach to human rights.
By all means condemn human rights violations in Cuba, but do the same in China.
If you are to impose these kinds of sanctions on Cuba, then impose them on China as well.
I feel that the EU strategy relating to Cuba is to spread an incredible degree of naivety.
Did we really think that we could shift the human rights agenda in Cuba by inviting a few dissidents to a party when 40 years of US embargo have failed?
We need to adopt alternative strategies to push the human rights agenda.
The current method is not working.
Mr White argued for the freeing of all dissidents in Cuba.
What about Spain?
Do you want to free all dissidents in Spain as well?
I will not be lectured to by the Spanish PPE on visiting Cuba when the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, was swanning around Havana last week.
It is time that you and Mr Tannock got over losing the elections.
Get over it and stop imposing your stupid obsessions on the rest of the European Parliament!
Â Â  Mr President, Cuba is clearly a very sensitive, as well as a very complex, subject, and I do of course agree with those who say that the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, should work for more democracy and respect for human rights across the world, and that is also true of Cuba.
The fundamental question we should be asking ourselves, though, is how we can best achieve this, how we can best help the Cuban people.
Is it by rejecting dialogue with the Cuban authorities, and thus with a large majority of civil society?
I do not think so.
Yet that, today, is the reality of the situation on the ground.
Since the channels of communication with the Europeans have been closed, the EUâs common position has produced no satisfactory results.
An assessment is therefore in order, provided it is a rational one, and the common position may need to be adapted.
Indeed, along with a few other MEPs, I recently visited Cuba, and we were able to witness for ourselves a number of positive developments concerning education, for example, or health care.
We ought to tell them this and we also ought to tell them that there are many aspects in Cuba we do not like at all, but at least we ought to strike up a dialogue, like we do with other countries including China, Saudi Arabia or Vietnam.
Â Â  . Mr President, just one remark for the sake of good order.
One Member mentioned that we should do more on humanitarian aid: this is not part of the political equation.
We provide humanitarian aid in reaction to need, and provide it where that need is, without considering politics.
This point is very important, and it is important that I take the time to repeat our position.
We are in Cuba when needed for humanitarian reasons, as in all other places including North Korea etc. I am quite sure that this is not up for discussion here.
I am not saying this because I feel it is a real problem in this House, but because it is important never to make that mistake.
I tend to agree with those who have said that the common position has not produced any results.
The problem is, however, what other instruments are available that will produce results?
It is not easy and the risk of being disappointed is always present.
As I see it there is an ongoing struggle between hardliners and more constructive, open-minded people in the leadership in Havana.
This moves back and forth in an unpredictable manner and is a reaction both to internal events and a reaction to the pressure from Cuba's big neighbour.
There is a need to do more than putting our rhetoric on autopilot â referring to basic principles of human rights and so on.
I do not think this discussion is necessary in Parliament. I do not see this Parliament as a place where we should have a discussion for or against human rights.
This really is not the place.
If we are serious about it we have to be pragmatic.
The other approach is the easy one and we have to get into the game, we have to get closer to the real politics of change and progress in Cuba if possible.
Nobody can give any guarantees.
In 2003 I attempted to see what could be done and I was disappointed.
However, this was a reaction resulting, in my view, from the very unpredictable inner circles in Havana.
Another frustration that we run into in Europe again and again is that, whenever it is attractive to do so, it is a fashion in Cuba to put us in the same category as the US.
It makes it very easy â even convenient â for hardliners in Havana to do this, supporting their view â driven by paranoia â that the whole world is against them.
This is wrong, Europe is not against Cuba and definitely not against the Cubans.
We do not like the regime, we do not like the old fashioned dictatorial way of managing a society, but we also do not want to be associated with the way in which the United States conducts its relationship with its neighbour.
Europe is different; our thinking concerning Cuba is different and we have to pay some sort of investment to make this an inescapable reality in the internal discussions in Havana.
For our part, we have to be willing to have some element of risk to make it impossible for the hardliners to portray Europe as if Europe and the US are the same thing.
That is the investment we must be courageous, constructive and self-assured enough to make.
If we are not ready to make an investment to create a real basis for a dialogue â one that is defined by us and not by a paranoid representation of the way the hardliners in Havana see the outside world â we are only relying on autopilot-defined rhetoric or, in other words, the old common position.
We should not make it a straitjacket.
Please remember that for a number of years the very same common position did not prohibit Europe from engaging in a bolder, closer and more critical dialogue on human rights with Cuba.
We did that against the same background in terms of the common position.
European investment in the Cuban economy also grew remarkably while we held the same common position.
It did not make investment growth impossible.
We should not interpret it in such a narrow sense that it becomes a straitjacket.
In conclusion, there is a need for a more innovative approach.
Â Â  At the end of this debate, I received four motions for a resolution.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 17 November 2004 at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Report by the European Council and the Commission Statement on the European Council in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to report to you on the European Council that was held on 4 and 5 November, and which was a productive meeting.
Central to that meeting were areas that are of major importance to the public, such as the economy, and the area of freedom, security and justice.
We also discussed the issue of âCommunicating Europeâ,namely improving communication and interaction between politicians and citizens across Europe.
Finally, we debated a number of topical external issues, including Iraq.
Recent developments in my own country give me no choice but to start with the topic of freedom, security and justice.
Those developments illustrate in an unpleasant but powerful manner that a further step in cooperation in those areas is indispensable.
I am very indebted to you, Mr President, for the words of support and solidarity which you spoke to the Dutch Government and the entire Dutch community on 15 November.
Allow me to react to those words in my national capacity.
The Netherlands is proud of its diversity.
Since the Second World War, we have received large groups of people from many countries â some because they were persecuted, others because they could build a better future with us and were welcome reinforcements on our labour market.
The contribution of those people in terms of quality of our society is immense and is appreciated.
Today, they, and their relatives, belong among us, and that âbelongingâ requires consideration and effort from both parties.
Integration is a complex issue that touches on identity, standards and values, as well as getting to know and understand each other.
At the same time, integration also requires respect and compliance with the fundamental rules of our society: freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, and respect for the democratic rule of law, which must offer individuals the protection to which they are entitled.
Last time I had the good fortune of addressing this Parliament, I said, referring to the prospect of Turkeyâs accession to the Union, that Islam or religion are not the issue. I would repeat that today.
In our European society, there is every chance that people with different beliefs can live alongside, and with, each other.
What is not acceptable is to use religion as an excuse to attack people, schools, mosques or churches.
That is what all of us, across Europe, have to fight with conviction and decisiveness.
Mr President, in your expression of support last Monday, you drew attention to the significance of recent events in the Netherlands for the whole of European society, and in that I agree with you.
The Netherlands is convinced that we must work together more effectively in fighting terrorism.
The fierce reactions and counter-reactions in the wake of the killing of Mr Van Gogh once again demonstrated that there is tension in the make-up of our society.
In Europe too, we have to learn from each other in terms of integrating minorities.
I will presently examine in more detail the multi-annual programme for Justice and Home Affairs, the Hague Programme, that provides for a deepening in both areas.
Last week, a ministerial conference was held, at which the subject of integration was discussed at length.
Of course we immediately applied the existing operational instruments over the past week.
In addition, the Justice and Home Affairs ministers have asked to discuss the events in the Netherlands and to deliberate on European aspects of these with their colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council next Friday.
Let me now return to my role of President-in-Office of the European Council and to the actual topic of this debate.
The European Council laid down the Hague Programme on 5 November. The programme outlines our cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years.
Moreover, the Hague Programme is the first comprehensive package of measures to have been the subject of negotiation involving 25 Member States. That illustrates that in an enlarged Union, we can also reach agreement about important, complex issues, and that bodes well for the future.
In a Europe with no internal borders, we have to join forces in order to tackle problems such as organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking.
In addition, we must work closely together in the fields of asylum and immigration.
After all, asylum seekers and immigrants are entitled to know where they stand in Europe.
The Hague Programme builds on that of Tampere, which, in 1999, was the first programme to formulate cooperation in this area.
It is based on Member State contributions, the Commission evaluation of Tampere and the European Parliamentâs recommendation of 14 October of this year, particularly in respect of decision-making methods.
The Hague Programme gives important new impulses.
Loopholes in national systems are being closed, as a result of which phenomena such as cross-border crime will be given far fewer opportunities.
Closer attention will be paid to the proper implementation of the measures taken, and the effectiveness thereof will be scrutinised on a regular basis.
What does the Hague Programme specifically mean?
The Union will make it easier for police, justice and intelligence services of the Member States to exchange information on the basis of the principle of availability of information.
With regard to terrorism, it has been agreed that Member States will go further than maintaining their own security; they will also extend their vista to the entire territory of the EU.
Institutions such as Europol and Eurojust will be given a central role in fighting crime.
We will continue to work hard on a European legal area, in which it is no longer possible to escape oneâs sentence by moving to another EU Member State.
Alongside this, we will work towards a common asylum system by 2010, in which the same procedures will be followed in all countries.
We want a single system that is humane, but also unambiguous, so that âasylum hoppingâ will become a thing of the past.
Illegal immigration will also be tackled more effectively. This involves a common repatriation policy and better border control.
We are now working on the basic principles for integration which will, if possible, be laid down during the Dutch Presidency.
A start was made on this during an informal ministerial conference in Groningen.
Another point I should like to mention in particular, is the introduction of Qualified Majority Voting and of codecision in the fields of asylum and immigration, something upon which you insisted in your recommendation of 14 November.
We will comply with your request by making the Union more decisive and democratic in this respect.
This will be effective on 1 April 2005.
Although there were compelling requests among a few Member States to make various allowances, eventually, these remained restricted to the exception of legal immigration.
All in all, it is an ambitious and realistic programme, in respect of which the European Commission will be presenting an action plan next year.
The separate legislative proposals contained therein will be submitted to you under the consultation and codecision procedure.
I am particularly pleased that agreement has now been reached among the Member States about the objectives and the way in which we want to achieve these.
A safer Europe for free citizens whose constitutional rights are protected effectively. That is what this is all about.
I would now like to turn to the other important topic of the latest European Council, namely the European economy, in other words the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.
The year 2004 is marked by a slight recovery in the European economy.
That recovery, however, is not a matter of course. In order to safeguard our European social model, we will need to make further adjustments.
The main feat of the Kok report is that it clearly demonstrates the relevance, if not, necessity, of the Lisbon strategy.
The key objective of the strategy is still very much alive.
There is no alternative.
The world around us is changing because in addition to the US, there are economies, including China and India, which not only compete in terms of labour costs, but also increasingly so in terms of quality and innovation.
Europe itself is changing too, though: the population is ageing, with all the consequences that this entails for labour participation and tenability of pension schemes and health care.
Despite this, the road ahead is clear: only by facing the challenge of the future can we retain the achievements of today.
Knowledge, innovation and competitiveness must be the pillars underlying the adaptability of the European economy.
Europe must develop its strengths further.
Founded on a broad-based and highly-qualified population, flexible labour markets, activating social systems and innovative ecology, Europe will be able to meet the global challenge.
The Kok report thus clearly demonstrates that the Lisbon strategy must be pursued with force.
Progress has been made on a number of scores: in the fields of labour participation, the internal market and the dissemination of ICT and the Internet in schools, universities, governments and households.
We should not fool ourselves, though.
At the same time, Mr Kok has indicated that the efforts, particularly by the Member States themselves, have to be stepped up. If not, we will assuredly not achieve the objectives.
It is this very process, where structural change is being carried out while retaining the public support base, which was the topic of a very lively discussion between myself and my colleagues during the past European Council.
There was an exchange of practical experience, and future prospects were outlined.
It was a sound discussion, particularly because the Kok report refers to the Member States themselves.
What struck me during that informative discussion was the unanimity about the need for reforms and about the need for good communication about this with the public and civil society.
In addition, the Heads of Government were unanimous in their willingness to take upon themselves political responsibility for the Lisbon strategy at European level, but also at home, in their own countries.
It was gratifying in that respect that the future President of the new European Commission, Mr Barroso, also confirmed that he considers the Lisbon strategy to be at the centre of his policy and he personally will take responsibility for this in the Commission.
I have discussed the roles which the European Council, the Commission and the Member States must play.
However, the Kok report also addressed the European Parliament directly, which should have greater involvement in this strategy.
For example, it contains a suggestion for you to set up a permanent parliamentary committee that focuses on the Lisbon strategy and growth and employment.
I am, naturally, interested to find out how you will act upon this recommendation.
Mr President, I should now like to turn to another topic, one which you yourself have discussed with us, namely that of âCommunicating Europeâ.
The awareness that we need to communicate more effectively with the public about what Europe is and what it is doing requires constant attention.
I see it as positive that future presidencies have indicated that they will be continuing the discussions on this subject.
The ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an important occasion to further improve communication with the public.
The citizens of Europe share essential values and it is up to the politicians, you and I, to convey the European project.
Creating a truly open debate requires teamwork between the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
I therefore welcome the intention of the future President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to entrust a Vice-President with the portfolio of communication.
We are looking forward to the announced communication strategy which will be tabled even before the European Council of June.
I have now come to the areas of external policy that have been the subject of discussion.
First of all, Iraq.
The European Council managed to reach agreement about a package of support measures for Iraq in the short term.
We presented this package to the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Allawi, who we had invited especially for the occasion, during a lunch meeting on 5 November.
Moreover, we then offered Iraq scope for cooperation and dialogue for the long term.
Mr Allawi thanked us for the support for the Iraqi reconstruction process.
In this process, the elections play an important role.
I therefore set great store by Prime Minister Allawiâs communication that, despite persistent security problems, these elections will be taking place in January at the latest.
Our meeting with Mr Allawi and the aid package we presented to him demonstrate that the European Union is willing and able to play a greater role in granting concrete support to the political and economic reconstruction process in Iraq.
Moreover, a similar signal of unanimity has been given within the Union with regard to Iraq.
A second item of external policy on which the European Council expressed a view is Iran.
Let there be no mistake: we want complete and permanent suspension of all enrichment and improvement activities by Iran on a voluntary basis.
Only then can the European Union offer Iran a prospect of discussions about long-term cooperation which will benefit both the European Union and Iran.
Although the agreement that was reached with Teheran at the weekend is a step in the right direction, we should satisfy ourselves first that the suspension by the International Atomic Energy Agency can be determined promptly.
If that attempt fails too, then we seem to have no choice but to resort to the UN Security Council.
This brings me to the Middle East, where there seems to be another window of opportunity for the peace process.
It is to be hoped that the Israeli decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip will offer a new opportunity for carrying out the roadmap.
The European Council has tried to cash in on this.
At the proposal of Javier Solana, we have now drawn up a short-term action programme to support the Palestinians in the areas of security, reforms, elections and economic development.
Needless to say, we need cooperation from both the Palestinians and the Israelis for this programme to be successful.
Although, at the moment, there is mourning for the death of President Arafat, I hope that the Palestinian Authority will, when a new president is elected in January, make a new start promptly and decisively.
The situation in Sudan remains extremely difficult.
The European Council has urged the Government of Sudan and all other parties to meet the international requirements.
In this respect, we have an obvious stick, namely the possibility of instituting sanctions, if need be.
If that is what it takes, that is what we will do.
Three weeks ago, the European Parliament held a debate with the Council about Ukraine.
I hope that the message which the European Council sent is being properly understood by the Ukrainian authorities.
The second round of the presidential elections is taking place this Sunday.
This round will need to be more democratic than the first one.
If not, we will need to consider the implications we want to attach to this.
As is evident from the conclusions, the European Council has not discussed the Unionâs enlargement.
We will do this in December.
We will then know the outcome of the debate which Parliament will devote to this.
The decisions we are facing regarding the four candidate countries can change the Union drastically.
A clear, positive and future-oriented view of Parliament is crucial in order to face the decision-making and implementation of the decisions with confidence.
I hope that that will be the result on 2 December.
Let me finally say a few words about Parliament itself and about the Commission.
First of all, I share your wish to resolve the long-standing issue of the statute of the Members of this Parliament.
Transparent and unequivocal agreements about the salary and other working conditions of the Members of your House avoid perceptions which undermine confidence in the institutions and the Union as a whole.
In the next few weeks, the presidency, in the form of the European Affairs Minister, Mr NicolaÃ¯, will be examining the possibilities that exist in order to reach agreement on this issue that has remained unresolved for far too long.
Mr President, you too will be consulted in this matter in the next few days.
Strictly speaking, the outcome of the debate which this Parliament held three weeks ago about the proposed Commission was not on the agenda of the European Council.
Mr President, you were right to pay attention to it in your contribution to the European Council nevertheless.
I should like to do the same now.
The Union did not end up in crisis because of this debate; on the contrary, it drew strength from it.
In the Treaty, Parliament has been assigned an important role in the appointment of the Commission.
Parliament has every right to reject the proposed Commission.
Had Parliament done so as a result of a vote, then that would have been an expression of political self-awareness.
Similarly, it is good that Mr Barroso, the President-designate, has drawn the political lessons he needed to draw from the debate.
He has been able to adjust his Commission with a view to receiving the broadest possible support in this Parliament.
In this way, he is laying a strong foundation for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
From the Councilâs point of view, the outcome is also positive.
The Council wants to set to work with Parliament and the Commission.
We are facing important issues and important choices.
I have high hopes that tomorrow, the European Parliament will express its confidence in the Commission, and we will be able to roll up our sleeves thereafter.
Â Â  . Mr President, as you know the European Council focused its work primarily on the Lisbon Strategy and the launch of a new programme for freedom, security and justice â the Hague Programme.
It also held an exchange of views on a topic of particular relevance to citizens: communication on Europe.
It heard a presentation on enlargement by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and adopted conclusions on a number of foreign policy issues, notably Sudan, Iraq, the Middle East and Iran.
Finally, the Heads of State and Government met the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr Allawi, over lunch.
Also on that occasion, the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, presented an amended list for his team of Commissioners, to be approved by the Council and submitted to the European Parliament for a vote.
When he met the members of the European Council on 4 November, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell, underlined the role played by the European Parliament in this process.
I shall briefly highlight the main points discussed at the European Council.
Concerning the Lisbon Strategy, the European Council confirmed the validity and relevance of the process it set in motion in 2000, aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of European economies through a balanced strategy with an economic, social and environmental dimension.
It encouraged the Council to maintain the momentum of this work.
It reiterated the importance of the implementation of agreed measures by the Member States.
The European Council welcomed the presentation by Mr Wim Kok of the report of the high-level group he chaired.
On the basis of the Kok report, the Commission will prepare proposals for the European Council next March for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is clear that progress has been made over the past five years but, as President Prodi said, we have not done enough and Member States still have to deliver on their commitments.
I am tempted to repeat that: Member States still have to deliver on their commitments!
The President-designate, Mr Barroso, has already indicated that the Commission's key priority will be to promote a competitive Europe through more growth and jobs and that it will remain fully committed to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in all its components.
In this context, the Commission also remains committed to better regulation.
The presidency has focused work on actions for simplification, impact assessment and measuring the administrative burden.
We support these actions and welcome the work of the high-level technical group on better regulation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Concerning the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Council adopted an ambitious multiannual programme â the Hague Programme â that follows on from the Tampere Agenda, and that will guide the action of the Union in those areas over the next five years.
European citizens rightly expect that the EU, while guaranteeing respect for fundamental freedoms and rights, will take more effective joint action on cross-border problems such as illegal migration and trafficking in human beings, as well as on terrorism and organised crime.
The Hague Programme reflects the ambitions as expressed in the Constitutional Treaty.
It puts the emphasis on delivery and implementation; it takes account of the evaluation by the Commission of the Tampere Agenda, as well as of the recommendation on the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure adopted by the European Parliament on 14 October 2004.
The Commission will present an action plan in 2005 to translate the aims and priorities of The Hague Programme into concrete actions.
On 'communicating Europe', the European Council reiterated the need to increase public awareness of the importance of the work of the Union.
Politicians at both national and international level have a responsibility to communicate the relevance of the European project, to involve Europeans through public debate and active citizenship in decision-making.
European institutions also have a role to play in this regard.
The Commission, for its part, intends to present a communication strategy in good time before the June 2005 European Council.
The ratification of the Constitution in all Member States will also represent an unprecedented opportunity for discussing European issues with our citizens.
That is the responsibility of each Member State, but it is very important that we hold an EU-wide debate, rather than leaving it to individual Member States.
On enlargement, at the European Council President Prodi presented the progress report, the strategy paper and recommendations, as well as the study of issues arising from Turkey's membership, produced by the Commission on 6 October.
As you know, the European Council will address these enlargement issues at its meeting in December.
Â Â  . Mr President, of the many issues dealt with at the European Council, I would like to focus on two: promoting the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and the process of economic and social modernisation of Europe, also known as the Lisbon Process.
I would like to congratulate the Dutch Presidency on the exhaustive Hague Programme in relation to the area of freedom, but I would like to add a brief comment.
We still need to establish emphases, priorities, with regard to promoting this area.
Governing means making choices and establishing priorities.
Times have changed since Tampere I. The time has come to choose priorities and identify the most urgent problems affecting the co-existence of the Europeans and, above all, those which are going to affect its future.
We must have the courage to choose and to accept the risk.
Courage is what the future of this area of freedom and justice in the European Union is going to require.
The Council says, for example, that the fight against terrorism must be given impetus, but it still does not have sufficient impetus to identify Islamist terrorism as the main problem threatening the co-existence of the Europeans.
Madrid, Beslan, the tragedies of the European hostages and last weekâs events in the Netherlands confirm this.
More Union means more ability to choose and select.
So this area must be promoted on the basis of a few, very few, but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us, the first of which is Islamist terrorism.
The greatest risk to Europe in this field is inaction, paralysis and not knowing what to do.
The Hague Programme does not mention the necessary protection for the victims of terrorism, and I regret that the conclusions have not mentioned this Parliamentâs request concerning the creation of the European Office for Assistance for Victims or the consolidation over the coming years of a political project, a political programme aimed in this direction.
Mr President, having seen the report on the mid-term review of Lisbon, the most important thing is that we are aware that we are seriously behind schedule.
The European Parliament must promote this Lisbon Process on the basis of three very simple and fundamental ideas: the first is that this Parliament must encourage governments to show signs of courage and to promote the necessary structural reforms, since more Union requires more Europe and more structural reforms; the second is to accept that employment is undoubtedly the best social policy, since more Union means more emphasis on job creation; and, finally, in order to implement Lisbon, the States need streamlined public finances, since more Union requires more budgetary stability demands and no more relaxation of finances amongst the European States as a whole.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the work you have done over recent months.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr DÃ©sir will be speaking on behalf of our group to make some points about the issues raised by the Lisbon process, but I would like to point out that it is to evaluating the outcome of this process that my group in this House, and, I think, the Union as a whole must primarily devote their efforts, for the Kok Report, which you are discussing in the Council, has plain words to say about it.
We are, quite simply, not fit enough, and it is on this that all our efforts â those of the new Commission, of the Council and of this House â must be concentrated.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will lay great stress on this.
Rather like Mr Mayor Oreja, though, who has already spoken, I would like to say something about the area of freedom, security and justice.
It was decided in the Council that 1 April of next year would be the latest possible date for the transition to majority voting and codecision in the areas of immigration and asylum policy and in other areas of justice and internal cooperation.
As has already been said, we demanded this in a resolution on 14 October.
The only thing is that it was not this resolution of 14 October, but a lengthy process lasting five years, and so I want to make reference to someone who is not here, namely our former colleague and Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, as it is not least thanks to his tenacity that we are where we are at the end of the Tampere process.
That is something I want to say loud and clear on behalf of our group.
What is this about?
What I am going to talk about is the way in which the Commission, the Council and Parliament share in the responsibility for the balanced policy we will be putting together.
The words you used at the beginning of your speech, when you drew attention to your own countryâs situation, were, I think, extremely well chosen.
The European Union and its citizens make demands where security policy is concerned, demands made of the Member States and of the EU, and with these demands we must comply.
There is no time to be wasted; we cannot leave any room, any room whatever, to the enemies of fundamental citizensâ rights, to the enemies of democracy, to those who give expression to their blind hatred through murder and assassination in order to destroy the order that we defend.
A strong democracy has the right to be strong and to take vigorous action against its enemies.
In that, our group is always right alongside you.
That, though, is but one side of the coin.
The other is that the state, the Union, the forces of law and order that are there to defend fundamental democratic freedoms, cannot curtail these rights while at the same time claiming to be defending them.
It is easier to say that in this House than to do it in the real world â that I do know, but even so, we cannot stint in our efforts to keep on correcting the balance between the publicâs right to be protected from uncertainty and the guarantee of their fundamental rights.
When, though, I hear certain of the debates in the Council or in the Commission, when I hear speeches by unsuccessful candidates for the Commission, I sometimes get the impression that this has to be said with more energy.
Speaking as a German MEP, I cannot imagine that Libya, to take one example, is a country with much experience of the observance of fundamental rights.
It follows that the quick and appealing solutions offered in the media market are not always the best ones.
Let me reiterate that if we want to combat illegal immigration â and it has for some time been one of my groupâs articles of faith that we do â we must at last create the possibility of legal immigration.
This Houseâs debate on the subject, which begins on 1 April next year, will open the door to that, to our being able â and we are willing â as legislators to help bring about a situation in which, if we want to establish security, we cannot simply talk in terms of illegal people, but can establish a framework within which they can become legal.
That too is an opportunity that we will have from next 1 April onwards.
Â Â  . Mr President, just a very brief word to Mr Schulz: please bring the statement you have just made to the attention of the German Minister for the Interior.
That would seem to be urgently needed.
On 4 and 5 November this year, the European Council laid down its priorities for the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice.
It is probable that these developments will do more to shape the EUâs character than any previous joint initiative, for it is on the realisation of this Union governed by the rule of law that a common European community will be founded.
The character of our society will be determined not only by to what extent the European Union wants our 450 million citizens to be protected against the dangers of terrorism, among other things, or the degree to which it wants judicial cooperation to be organised in future practice, but also by joint action in the areas of asylum, immigration and integration.
We must not forget that the foundations we will be laying down over the coming five years will determine not only the futures of 450 million people, but also those of their children and grandchildren.
I would just like to take this opportunity not merely to remind you, but also perhaps to make you again aware, of the responsibility we all took on when we made the decision to be policymakers in this House.
We shape societies and fashion their futures; it is, alas, only in retrospect that we will learn whether our efforts are crowned with success.
We will then, however, have to answer our childrenâs questions, as our parents and grandparents had to answer our own, and I will be able to tell them that I did indeed prevent freedom being sacrificed to security, that I did indeed help to keep this great society open, tolerant and free, a society that would never tolerate intolerance, that I did indeed offer those persecuted in foreign lands the opportunity to seek safety in this Europe of ours, and gave that same opportunity to those who wanted to live and work here.
And when my children ask me how I achieved that, I hope I will be able to tell them how we, the citizensâ directly elected representatives, would not stand for the interior ministers of a few countries joining together in what they called âG5â and taking essential decisions without reference to Parliament.
We have seen how important it is to integrate the foreigners living in Europe, in a way which respects them and likewise demands that they respect it.
I will tell them how we overcame those who sought to burn a free society to the ground, how we, in fighting terrorism, always took account of the need to preserve citizensâ rights and freedoms.
Such measures as biometric data in identity documents are to be assessed most stringently by reference to their necessity and proportionality.
I will tell them how we stamped out every form of traffic in human beings, which was slavery in a modern guise, combating it at every level and making it possible for people to enter Europe legally, and how we discharged our obligations to those who seek asylum, without making it easy for ourselves by shifting our responsibility to states beyond our borders and without our laws.
I will tell them that we did not merely create empty institutions, but such bodies as the European Human Rights Agency, endowed with funding and a mandate.
The Hague Programme is a beginning; it is certainly not an end.
Before we make irreversible changes to our society, we must think, discuss and argue, and do it time and time again.
For it is the protection of human and civil rights, of freedom and security, that underpins this Europe of ours, which we must defend â even, and something particularly, within its own institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to confine my remarks to two aspects of the Council's presentation: Lisbon and the Hague Programme.
Firstly, on a personal basis I always worry when I hear a politician use the phrase 'there is no alternative', because Mrs Thatcher used that phrase when we were all perfectly well aware that there were plenty of alternatives.
I worry, therefore, that we only look on the Lisbon Agenda as some sort of Holy Grail that we have to pursue, and genuinely welcome the Netherlands presidency's recognition of the breadth of that Agenda.
All too often in this House the Lisbon Agenda is limited to the issue of competitiveness, and we omit all the other facets concerning more and better quality jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development, which went on to be developed more fully at Gothenburg.
If we reduce the Lisbon Agenda to the sphere of competition we are selling ourselves short and will not solve many of the problems facing our societies.
The relevance of a partial reading of the agenda is thus highly questionable, and it is partly because of that partial reading that we have had such problems in implementing much of the agenda.
We have totally forgotten the Cardiff Process on integration of the environment into all the processes and policies of the European Union.
When one looks at social cohesion issues, which are linked to some of the other topics touched on today, we would also seem to have forgotten the dynamic approach needed in the implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination.
We would do well to reconsider the role of the Equal Programme in future, rather than consigning it to the dustbin.
The implementation of legislation on anti-discrimination deals with issues surrounding the marginalisation of many in our societies, and also deals with some of the issues people have talked about this morning, in terms of respect for individuals and for what they can offer.
When looking at the Hague Programme itself, one of the things not to have come through strongly enough is political leadership on issues concerning anti-discrimination.
A directive on anti-racism and xenophobia is still stuck in Council and we are not giving the political leadership that the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has identified as being necessary to move forward.
I wonder whether the EU Human Rights Agency will provide that.
We obviously welcome the moves towards qualified majority voting and codecision, and assume that this will also bring the European Court of Justice into play, although this is something not yet made explicit.
However, I regret that legal migration has not been included because, as the Council conclusions state, and as we have again heard this morning, illegal migration cannot be separated from legal migration.
This is not just a home affairs issue.
It also has real resonance for employment policy.
People prefer to have a legal status, and we need to look at the bureaucratic complexities which stand in the way of this, and which Parliament clearly identified in the previous legislature.
Rather than simply dwelling on the negatives â of which we have heard many this morning â we are looking for greater political leadership in terms of the sort of Europe we want to create.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too am stunned by Mr Balkenendeâs proclamation that there is no alternative to the Lisbon strategy, which implies that there is no alternative to the way in which it is implemented.
My group takes a critical view of the Lisbon strategy to date, and we do so not because it aims for more and better, not because it demands social cohesion and sustainability; we take a critical view of it because this Lisbon strategy makes the worldâs problems even worse.
The message that now goes out from the Council meeting in Brussels and also from the conferences held under the presidency of the Netherlands is that the creation of more meaningful jobs that actually pay a living wage, the strengthening of social cohesion, and the rational use of the natural world, now take second place to the competitiveness of conglomerates and to the EUâs ability to compete as a global player.
Rather than hearing of how political priorities have been responsibly adjusted for the sake of social, environmental and global sustainability and seeing proposals submitted for consideration by the Spring 2005 Council, we now hear that, firstly, Europe is to be made more competitive, labour markets to be made more dynamic, and that the social security systems are to be adapted to meet the challenges presented by the need for competitiveness and by population change.
Let me tell you, in plain terms, that this will not enable us to solve the worldâs and societyâs problems.
MrÂ Kokâs report was presented during the session, and it, too, has no alternatives to offer.
It does not help to develop a social and employment policy for our own time.
I therefore take the same view of it as the European Anti-Poverty Network and am more than willing to discuss these proposals for something like a social policy agenda for the years from 2006 to 2010.
With the summit in mind and looking forward to the proposals that the Commission will be putting forward next January, I call upon the Commission, the European Council and the Member States to adjust their political priorities within the Lisbon strategy along the lines to which I referred earlier.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me to congratulate Prime Minister Balkenende on the dynamic manner in which he has dealt with the shocking assassination of Theo van Gogh and the subsequent riots.
In these difficult circumstances, leadership is indispensable.
Without solidarity and unanimity in tackling those who threaten the rule of law, we would not achieve our goals.
What is positive is that this need also appears to exist in society.
I wish you Godâs blessing in your work, particularly in bringing, and keeping, together the different ethnic groups.
During the last meeting of the European Heads of Government, Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy, a report to which we in this House were very much looking forward.
The conclusions and recommendations are not new.
What new is that an advisor consulted by the Council has put the ball back in the Member Statesâ court.
Those Member States must make a start on structural reforms, which they have apparently not yet done.
No choices were made from the excess of objectives.
However, it remains to be seen whether reducing the number of objectives would be sufficient.
I doubt it.
More should be done, but that implies that there is a will.
Which Member State will be the first to stick its neck out?
Since 2001, we in this House have had many a debate on the question why this strategy has not had the desired effect.
This Parliament has restricted powers in the process of Lisbon, and in the open coordination method, it is in any event difficult to make the Unionâs role concrete.
Environmental policy and social policy are under pressure.
Despite this, we will need to adopt a sustainability strategy if we want to maintain our level of prosperity and welfare for future generations in the longer term.
The parties are largely agreed on the analysis.
Which Member State, though, will take the actual first step?
My question, therefore, to Mr Balkenende is what we can expect from the Dutch Presidency in the next six weeks in terms of follow-up.
After all, the Netherlands has always been a great champion of reforms in order to make the Lisbon process a success.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been confronted with extremely serious challenges in the field of internal policy. These include security and economic growth.
Essentially, the latter is conspicuous by its absence across Europe as a whole, in spite of the Lisbon strategyâs unusually ambitious provisions.
This state of affairs is due firstly to the fact that we still have an extremely naÃ¯ve belief in the power and force of regulation as an agent of change, in particular as far as the regulation of economic life is concerned.
This naÃ¯ve belief has led to Europe becoming completely defenceless on the global market, and to our citizens and entrepreneurs being overwhelmed with reams of legislation, legislation that is very frequently detrimental.
The second reason for poor economic growth is that our societies are ageing extremely rapidly indeed.
Ageing at the rate currently experienced in Europe would ruin even an economy that was at the height of its development, to say nothing of the European economy.
In view of the impending Council, it is worth touching on the harmonisation of legislation.
There are some areas in which harmonisation could have positive effects, yet there are also areas in which harmonisation is nothing short of impossible.
Such areas include family law, for the simple reason that radically different opinions on the family are held within Europe.
The Buttiglione affair is an excellent example of this.
It would be a serious error to think that it might be possible to use European law to ensure that homosexual relationships are legally recognised in countries that have not agreed to such an experiment.
Still with the Council meeting in mind, the Council is to be commended for taking an interest in Ukraine.
It must be added that this interest has come too late, and indeed we must hope it has not come altogether too late.
If this crisis had not arisen, the exceptionally passive policies adopted with regard to the East would presumably have remained in place.
The crisis we are witnessing within the pro-Western and pro-European forces in Ukraine would presumably not have come about had our neighbourhood policy been more courageous in political terms, more generous in economic terms, and above all, more open to the accession of countries such as Ukraine to the EU.
Â Â  Â Â Â Mr President, MrÂ Balkenende, ladies and gentlemen, in Communist times the authorities said the ideology was good and the people were bad because they did not wish to put it into practice.
Upon reading this motion for a resolution, I found a statement to the effect that the Lisbon strategy is good, but that the bad Member States, who do not wish to put it into practice, are the âchief obstacle to faster progressâ.
This sounds worryingly familiar, and I must concur with the comments made by MrsÂ Lambert and MrsÂ Zimmer on the issue.
With regard to paragraphÂ 4 of the motion for a resolution, the reference made by its authors to investment in people, research and innovation might lead one to fear that this will, unfortunately, be implemented by favouring the old Member States over Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as is the case in the provisions of the draft EU budget for 2007-2013.
Fine words can, and alas sometimes are, put into practice in a way that is far from fine.
After those words of criticism, I should like to commend the Council for having finally recognised the importance of the demographic factor, and the authors of the resolution for having asked the Council that âaction to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population of Europe be considered a policy priorityâ.
Â Â  Mr President, at present, the Netherlands is in despair, because we are more than ever compelled to reconsider the questions, not only of the balance between freedom and tolerance, but also of how to set boundaries in order to guarantee safety.
I wholly concur with Mr Bloklandâs congratulations addressed to Prime Minister Balkenende on the way in which he is taking charge, and giving direction in channelling the feeling of our population towards a more tolerant society in which people respect one another.
Respect for those values is also something which we in this House will need to defend at all times.
Tolerance, however, goes hand in hand with setting and demarcating boundaries.
I welcome the way in which the Hague agenda is building on Tampere.
