The Union must demonstrate determination to introduce and enforce an anti-corruption culture at all levels of political activity, in both the public and private sectors and at both national and Community levels, because corruption constitutes a threat to law-abiding society, distorts competition and hampers economic development.
I would recall, bearing in mind the recent case of Eurostat, that, in addition to the corruption perpetrated by representatives of the Community institutions, there is another worrying problem: the loss of citizensâ confidence in the process of European integration.
The role of the European bodies responsible for encouraging cooperation between Member States in eliminating corruption is crucial.
Coordinated action by these bodies (Eurojust, Europol, OLAF and the European Judicial Network) will strengthen the actions undertaken by national police forces and will facilitate transnational investigations, by sharing the Member Statesâ information capacities.
Â Â  .
There are positive aspects to this report, which puts forward interesting approaches to prevent, regulate, control and monitor corruption in various fields, such as political and administrative activity, public contracts, and in international relations, amongst other things.
It can be criticised, however, for:
- a degree of federalism, which we do not endorse, examples of which are its defence of the European arrest warrant, the increase in Europol and Eurojustâs powers and even poorly defined, heavy-handed and unjustified creation of a European public prosecutor's office.
- some confusion between measures for transparency and measures for standardisation (customs) with less attention being paid to the interests of peoples and nations;
- a highly administrative, bureaucratic and federalist outlook, which is not very participative and would exert little political control over the major economic and financial powers, specifically: off-shore investment houses, banking, clearing houses, in other words, genuine money-laundering institutions.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Â Â  .
Conservative MEPs believe that corruption is wrong and should be rooted out at all levels.
There are, however, ways and means of doing this.
We believe that the European Arrest Warrant and the European Public Prosecutor unnecessarily impinge upon nation-states' own legal systems and are therefore undesirable.
It is for this reason that we have abstained on the Rutelli Report.
Â Â  .
Despite the rapporteurâs concerns, which include the fact that these appropriations cannot be used to fund repatriation policies â specifically to pay for charter flights that return âillegalâ immigrants to their country of origin â, as well as the introduction of amendments seeking to minimise the negative effects of the regulation, the fact is that this regulation is intended to âencourage the signing of readmission agreementsâ with third countries.
As a matter of fact, as the rapporteur points out:
- âClearly, the Commission's intention is to create an instrument to compensate third countries for signing readmission agreementsâ;
- âThe promise of financial aid and support may provide an incentive for third countries to sign agreements and make them acceptable to public opinionâ, and adds, âeven though, at present, the sums of money which third countries receive from their immigrants in the Union are much greater than all the aid received from the EU's financial support programmesâ.
In other words, this is another instrument designed to support the EUâs immigration policy, which gives priority to a repressive mindset, attempting, in this case, to guarantee financial compensation for the countries of origin of âillegalâ immigrants for signing readmission agreements.
Â Â  .â According to the conclusions of the European summits in Tampere and Seville, the European Union is committed, over the period from 2004 to 2008, to paying EUR 250 million to third countries, to help them control the migration of their nationals to Europe.
This programme of technical and financial assistance in the field of asylum and migration is merely the âexternalisationâ of migratory-flow management.
Instead of having refugee camps in Member States, we shall have them at the gates of Fortress Europe, with worse health and social conditions and without any guarantee of respect for human rights.
The bare figures and European regulations, however, conceal the real reasons for migration: poverty, social despair, underdevelopment, and untenable political and democratic situations.
These are the reasons why the EU should fight alongside third countries while at the same time guaranteeing to all human beings the right to move and establish themselves wherever they see fit.
In order to combat âillegal immigrationâ it is necessary to oppose the black market in labour, to regularise the position of unregistered immigrants, and to give them political and social rights, starting with the right of residence for all immigrants living in Europe.
Instead of doing that, the EU degrades itself by ordering collective deportations.
Instead of voting in favour of this report, we invite Members of Parliament to sign the European appeal against the âcharters of humiliationâ.
Â Â  .
To a large extent, the Union is gambling its future on the success or failure of a common immigration policy.
It is a challenge and an opportunity.
This programme, directed at countries in which immigration originates and transit countries in order to help them to manage migratory flows, is essential and deserves our support.
The management of migratory flows affects the demography, the economic and social balance and the harmonious coexistence of the Communityâs citizens.
The common immigration policy must take this into account and ensure that Member States have margin for manoeuvre in terms of managing their migratory flows.
The programme contributes to creating a common legal and administrative culture for the handling of the phenomenon of migration based on our principles and values of respect for people.
That is the only way we can effectively combat marginalisation and the organised crime of human trafficking, which causes so many victims each year.
We must strengthen European immigration policy through concrete actions: joint repatriations of illegal immigrants, the implementation of a European visa bank or the common management of external borders.
The latter, with shared responsibility, must be extended to third countries, to the Unionâs partners, by means of the including in Association Agreements a clause on cooperation in the field of immigration.
Â Â  .
I roundly welcome this Commission proposal implementing the decision of the Barcelona European Council of March 2002 to introduce a European Health Insurance Card.
The card will not change existing rights and obligations and is intended to simplify access to treatment in the country visited and, at the same time, to provide a guarantee for the institutions funding the health system in that country that the patient is fully insured in his or her country of origin and that, consequently, the institutions in their country of origin will duly reimburse all costs.
I therefore believe that this measure embodies one of the most important principles underpinning the European Union, which is to guarantee throughout the territory of the EU a high level of health protection for all citizens and to contribute to the free movement that we all wish to see, abolishing barriers and obstacles to the geographical mobility of EU citizens.
Lastly, I believe it to be of the utmost importance to promote actions that guarantee that the beneficiaries of sickness insurance schemes are sufficiently informed of their rights and obligations arising from this regulation.
Starting with the need to ensure that citizens are informed about the cardâs introduction.
Â Â  .
This Commission proposal to amend the regulation on organic farming seeks, primarily, to clarify problems of terminology, at a time when this concept is being used wrongly by supermarket chains and by some multinational agri-food companies.
Another of the proposalâs aims is to tighten control over all operators at all stages of production.
The proposal nevertheless fails to meet expectations in this sector, which today accounts for around 150Â 000 farms and 4% of farmland in the EU.
In this context, I agree with the rapporteur when she states that organic farmers, who are the main actors involved in this form of production, must play an active role in this process of amending regulations.
I also agree that the labelling must contain no ambiguity over names and for this very reason, existing derogations for some brands, such as Danone, for example, should be immediately revoked.
Clearly, labelling and rules must be the same for imported products too.
I am extremely unhappy that the report does not address the set of issues surrounding GMOs, including what is known as âcoexistenceâ or issues of genetic pollution and also overlooks the aid and protection given to organic seeds.
Introducing GMOs will call into question the choice of organic farmers, with the economic risks ensuing from this pollution affecting their eligibility for existing aid, and no clear definition of the polluterâs responsibilities is provided.
Â Â  .
I welcome the proposal to amend the existing regulation and clear up the definition of 'organic'.
This comes at a time when the Commission is also proposing a major piece of legislation to deal with the issue of health claims on food products.
It is vital that consumer interests be protected in these areas.
Organic crops and products continue to grow in importance as a proportion of our production and every effort must be given to assist the sector.
Coming from Ireland, which tries to sell itself as the 'Food Island', I believe the marketing and job-creation potential of organic products is enormous.
I particularly want to see moves in this area in view of the newly-relaunched rural development pillar.
Small local cottage industries have great scope for boosting local economies.
As always, the rapporteur, Ms Auroi, has produced a good report for our Committee, and many of her proposed amendments are welcome improvements to the Commission text.
It is important, for example, that we recognise the languages of the new Member States.
It is also important to make it clear that retailers who import pre-packaged products directly from third countries are also subject to EU regulation.
Â Â  .â Although I do not have any major problems with most of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I voted against this report, because some amendments go beyond the scope of this directive.
This applies, in particular, to the recital which proposes a timetable for defining what might be the specific rules governing âorganicâ winegrowing.
The product definition proposed is comparable with that of a registered designation of origin.
We can, of course, recognise the legitimacy of wine produced from organically grown grapes.
However, to go on from there to attempt to define an âorganicâ wine, for which the winemaking process is no different from the traditional process used to produce a wine with a registered designation of origin, would be to ignore the fact that the âregistered designation of originâ concept is based on areas of land designated according to their soils, and production conditions defined on the basis of local customs, whereas âorganicâ wines can be produced using grapes from vineyards which are not authorised to use a registered designation of origin.
Moreover, to accept the image of two types of wine production would give the illusion that one was better than the other, thereby disregarding the fact that traditional winegrowing provides all the quality guarantees necessary for consumer confidence.
Â Â  .
I have voted in favour because I believe it is crucial to explain to consumers what organic products are and what products are organic.
Given growing demand and the interest of a large number of farmers in implementing good practices that are healthy and respect the environment, the Commission proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 to monitor the development of organic farming in the European Community is fully justified.
I agree with the measures put forward by the rapporteur, specifically as regards combating any ambiguity surrounding productsâ names, which could create confusion and a false understanding of organic products of consumers.
In fact, there is a growing need for certainty as regards terminology in the various Community languages identifying organic production methods, which must be given a label whose symbol is immediately recognisable to every citizen of the Unionâs Member States, and labelling must be precise regardless of the productâs origin.
Similarly, biodiversity must be preserved, crops and products must be protected and all and any pollution of organic crops by Genetically Modified Organisms must be avoided.
It is important in this regard to protect and support organic seeds.
Â Â  â We voted in favour of the Auroi report because we share the rapporteurâs attitude and her fear of seeing a proliferation of pseudo-organic products, which are likely to mislead consumers, if controls are not sufficiently rigorous and harmonised.
These controls must, of course, take place at the production stage and, on this point, we agree with the rapporteurâs position regarding the possible pollution risk from GMOs.
These controls should, however, also be practised at the product marketing stage and, therefore, for imported products so that, in a market that attracts more and more consumers, abuse and deception are avoided.
Â Â  .
This report approves the new fisheries agreement with Mozambique, which will last for three years and will have a fishing quota of 1Â 000 tonnes of deep-water shrimp, with a further 535 tonnes of by-catches and fishing possibilities for 35 freezer tuna seiners and 14 surface longliners, and the main beneficiary will be the Spanish fleet.
The overall financial compensation will total just over EURÂ fourÂ million per year.
We should stress that the first agreement, signed in 1988, was condemned by Mozambique in 1993, evaluating the development of its own fishing industry.
This report warrants my broad support, although I wish to express three reservations.
Firstly, Portugal will gain only 150 tonnes of shrimp (plus 80 by-catches) and permits for five longliners, despite the needs of its fleet and despite its traditions of fishing in Mozambican waters.
Secondly, the fleet must commit to the sustainable management of the fishing effort in Mozambican waters, and this, according to the rapporteur, appears to be guaranteed.
Lastly, we must support the development of the local fisheries sector, not only under the provisions of this agreement, but in the context of our cooperation and development policy with Mozambique.
Â Â  In spite of constructive efforts, current fisheries policy still means that the EU is buying itself the right to misuse the natural resources of the poor.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
A genuine reform of fisheries policy is required, and a totally transformed view of our relations with poor countries.
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report in its entirety.
Â Â  â Yesterday evening, at the end of the debate, we were astounded to see the Commission pull away the veil and declare that it was not, in any case, proposing to extend the experiment of reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services, even if Member States called for it unanimously (as was the case on 25Â November 2003).
This confirmed for us the anti-democratic nature of the sole right of initiative and, at the same time, the Commissionâs arrogance in using it to protect its interests of power.
This is because it really is a case of interests of power.
The Commission wants to move towards a VAT system based on âcountry of originâ which would give it a central role and more power.
This is why it proposed its so-called rationalisation planâ, where the continuation of some reduced taxes were only there to act as bait.
In this way, the professions, particularly those in catering and construction, find themselves being used as pawns by the Commission.
We hope that, in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, ministers will take account of these considerations and be forthright in drawing attention to them.
Pending this, we support the excellent Randzio-Plath report which understood what was at stake.
Â Â  . â I agree with our rapporteur in that I do not believe that it is relevant to harmonise VAT rates without first having improved the whole of the economic and fiscal system of the Member States.
In the difficult economic and social period that we are going through, at least some degree of flexibility is required, given the economic system advocated by the Commission and the absolute need to respect the Maastricht criteria.
Each State should have the full range of economic, financial and monetary instruments in order to act in the most appropriate manner.
Direct and indirect taxation are among these instruments, which it must be able to use as it pleases because each economy remains distinctive, even if it forms an integral part of a globalised system.
Since the problems are not necessarily the same for each State, then the solutions should be allowed to differ.
It was for all of these reasons that I and the colleagues from my group called, on behalf of France, for an extension of reduced rates of VAT in Annex H, in particular for the catering, housing and recorded music services.
Â Â  . The proposal to streamline rates should be seen in the context of the process currently underway to establish a definitive VAT system, based on taxation in the country of origin and on a harmonised timescale, with the least number of derogations possible, for taxation rates in the various Member States.
This idea, which has been put forward by the Member States with a view to the potential effects on their tax policy, enjoys the support of the European Parliament, although it is strange that, in this case, Parliament has adopted a more realistic stance, in particular by taking the view that this is not the time for greater harmonisation and by supporting the Councilâs intentions to extend the experimental application of reduced VAT rates in certain labour-intensive services.
Commissioner Bolkestein refused to present this extension at the last Ecofin Council meeting of 25Â November.
On the subject of reduced rates, however, and bearing in mind the concept of tax sovereignty, it should be recalled that the Member States must maintain the necessary flexibility in implementing social and cultural policies, in particular when setting reduced VAT rates.
Next, since a minimum rate already exists, the Member States must have the power to set rates in line with their policy options as regards tax redistribution and the funding of national budgets.
Â Â  â Four years of reduced rates of VAT do not allow us to see the complete effects of this experiment; all the more since, knowing that it was temporary, some employers did not implement it.
All the industries consulted, however, claim that lowering VAT has positive economic effects that are by no means insignificant.
In this way, the number of wage earners working in the housing maintenance sector has increased in France by 8.6% in two years.
This is why we need to continue down this route.
As draftsman, I can only welcome the Commission text and, in particular, Annex H, extending Annex K to some services, such as catering.
Since each Member State freely chooses to apply a reduced rate in a category appearing in Annex H, all sectors that benefited from the experiment must not now be excluded from the scope of the directive.
This is why I voted in favour of the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Furthermore, Amendments Nos 22 and 23 that I tabled with Astrid Lulling for the part-session are extremely important; indeed they allow for the experiment to be extended until the current changes to the directive come into force, which is absolutely necessary in order to avoid disastrous consequences in terms of jobs.
Â Â  .â EU rules prescribe the goods and services on which the Member States may impose high rates of VAT and those that, by way of derogation, may fall within the reduced rate.
This exception already applied to food and clothes, but in 1999, labour-intensive services were also, on an experimental basis, brought under the umbrella of reduced rates of VAT.
This has had a beneficial impact on employment.
According to a recent hearing here in Parliament, the deployment of this instrument has created an additional 250Â 000 jobs throughout the European Union.
There are also other positive effects.
If we keep the bicycle repairman affordable, this will promote cycling.
It is astonishing that the Commission should now wish to put a stop to this.
The Commission supports its decision by deficient and incomplete enquiries and has insufficient evidence to substantiate that the experiment has led to unsatisfactory results.
If the experiment is discontinued, countless jobs will disappear in Europe, 8Â 500 of them in the Netherlands.
My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, sees taxes as a useful instrument to achieve sound social security and provide public services, but it denounces this way of enforcing increases in them.
We want to maintain the reduced rates of VAT on hairdressers, bicycle repairmen and cobblers.
I call for enforcing the Member States' right to keep the rates of VAT on labour-intensive services low if this is underpinned by sound arguments from a social and employment point of view.
Â Â  .
Although this area of indirect tax is reviewed every two years, the Labour delegation for the UK sees no reason to change the current Annex H. This, we believe, should be the responsibility of the national governments as long as they are non-distortive in terms of trade and industry.
Â Â  â Three priority sectors must be able to benefit on a long-term basis from the reduced rate of VAT in France: the construction, catering and recorded music industries.
Since it does not affect competition, the decision on this matter should fall exclusively within the competence of the Member States and be made on the basis of their own priorities.
Franceâs priorities are: to create jobs, reduce moonlighting and promote cultural development.
The European Commission, however, is not listening: instead of abandoning its unsuccessful attempts to harmonise VAT and allowing the Member States to regain their freedom, it wants, on the contrary, to increase its powers by forcing derogations to be quickly done away with.
CommissionerÂ Bolkestein cynically pointed out yesterday evening that, despite the Council calling unanimously for reduced rates for labour-intensive services to be maintained, the Commission did not intend to make a proposal along those lines and that, on the contrary, it would start proceedings from 1Â July 2004 against the Member States that kept these reduced rates.
This block by the Commission, which takes our professions hostage to increase its own power, is unacceptable and shows clearly that any transfer of competences must remain reversible.
Â Â  .
It is worth emphasising that this resolution, once again signed both by the right and by social democrats, gets off to a good start by remarking on the ongoing economic stagnation and the high levels of unemployment in the EU.
Instead, however, of moving on to a much-needed change to the neoliberal capitalist policies that are the cause of the current economic and social crisis, it confirms them, and what else could be expected from the political forces that are responsible for this situation?
The resolution advocates maintaining the Stability Pact, implementing the âLisbon Strategyâ, opening up markets (postal services, passenger transport, the single European sky), making labour markets more flexible, although it does express some âconcernsâ about the social consequences of these actions.
The resolution also confirms a policy that criminalizes and penalises immigration, blackmails the enlargement countries to the extent that, unless they adopt Community legislation their funds will be cut, confirms its support for the current situation in Iraq, which is under military occupation, and for the militarisation of the EU without involving NATO.
The resolution also confirms the ambition to strike a new balance in relations with the US, responding to the âreal common interests and capabilities of the partnersâ, which we should interpret as meaning the major economic and financial groups.
These political priorities are worlds apart from the real and urgent needs of the workers and of our communities.
Hence our vote against the resolution.
Â Â  â The joint resolution by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels reflects the liberal, militaristic and anti-democratic Europe that they are building.
Asking for the transfer of sovereignty from US occupying forces to Iraqi representatives or even demanding a fair trial for the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay cannot delude people as to the true nature of Europe.
First of all, it is in thrall to liberal ideology.
Competition, growth, the Stability and Growth Pact and the liberalisation of transport and postal services have been presented as needing no justification, whilst people are suffering the full impact of this policy, starting with unemployment and job insecurity.
Managing migratory flows and controlling borders is the grim response to the ill-fated people of this earth who are ready to do anything to escape from poverty, underdevelopment, dictatorships and wars.
Finally, the Intergovernmental Conference continues to sit and negotiate giving constitutional status to liberalism, regardless of the 450 million Europeans.
This is a Europe to which we do not belong, and that is why we cannot support this resolution.
We are âold Europeansâ who, with thousands of others at the European Social Forum in Paris/Saint-Denis, proposed a different Europe based on peace, democracy, social rights and public services.
Â Â  . â The Intergovernmental Conference in Naples had no trouble whatsoever in agreeing on the further militarisation of the European Union, in that no-one raised the slightest objection to the ÎUâs becoming a global policeman at the side of the USA.
At the same time, it became perfectly clear that the famous solidarity, should a Member State be attacked, is not only not mandatory, but also comes very clearly under the NATO umbrella.
This in reply to all those who maintain that Greece could rely on the EU in the event of an attack by Turkey.
There is not a trace of sensitivity in the European Parliament resolution to the extremely negative consequences which, as we have repeatedly stressed, the new âConstitutionalâ Treaty will have for the peoples.
On the contrary, its only concerns are that the text elaborated by the âConventionâ should not be changed and that its role within the framework of the EU mechanisms should not be cut back.
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it.
We call on the peoples to step up their fight against the European Union and the new bonds which it is trying to impose on us through the âEuro-constitutionâ.
Â Â  We voted âyesâ in the final vote on the joint motion for a resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference, but would take this opportunity to emphasise our differing positions on a number of issues.
We believe that the Commission should have a full Commissioner (with voting rights) for each Member State.
We believe that a possible simplified procedure for changing the Constitution in the future must not mean ignoring the demand for ratification in all the national parliaments.
We do not believe that it is appropriate to make what is termed the clause generally applicable.
We do not believe that more room should be made for qualified majority voting in the CFSP area.
We do not think it necessary to require the Council to divide its activities between, on the one hand, a legislative Council and, on the other hand, other Council constellations.
Â Â  We are today choosing to vote against Parliamentâs resolution on progress by the Intergovernmental Conference.
Large parts of the resolution go further than the Conventionâs proposals.
A constitutional/consolidated Treaty for the EU is desirable in itself but should be based upon a clear demarcation between politiciansâ power and the EUâs areas of competence.
We take a particularly dim view of the resolutionâs supporting what is termed the clause whereby Heads of State or Government are able to give up the Member Statesâ right of veto without this needing to be ratified by the Member Statesâ parliaments.
We also oppose what the resolution says about reducing the number of Commissioners, which would mean each country losing the right to appoint a Commissioner.
We also oppose Parliamentâs being given full right of codecision regarding the EU budget.
Finally, it is also unacceptable for it to be possible, as proposed in the resolution, for changes to be made to the Constitution without unanimity and without ratification by the Member Statesâ parliaments.
This would undermine the current system whereby the Member States own the Treaties.
We also repeat our opposition to a permanent Council President being appointed to replace the rotating Presidency.
Â Â  .
What could be expected from a resolution on the IGC signed by the right, social democrats and Greens?
What can be said about a resolution that seeks to impose the unacceptable âEuropean constitutionâ proposed by the âConventionâ on the governments, national parliaments and citizens of the various countries that make up the EU, and which advocates extending qualified majority voting and simplifying procedures that facilitate moving from unanimity to qualified majority decision-making, calling into question the right of âsmallâ countries to defend its interests?
What can be said about a resolution that, at the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, (PSE) â of which the is a member â supports the existence of a European Commission that does not have one Commissioner per country with voting rights, removing the right of âsmallâ countries to be represented in the only institution with legislative initiative and which proposes that it should be possible to amend âPart IIIâ of the so-called âConstitutionâ through what is being called a âlightâ procedure, in an attempt to bypass an IGC and the ratification of its conclusions by national parliaments?
What can be said about a resolution that, because it supports the idea, fails to mention or condemn the way in which the bases of neoliberal capitalism, militarism and the attack on the sovereignty of States are consolidated as a result of power being centralised in the supranational institutions of the European Union?
This is simply unacceptable!
Â Â  .
I voted against in the first case and abstained on the second part of item 9 because:
- it is not clear whether the Naples Conclave will result in the idea of one Commissioner per Member State.
In fact the alternative to what was agreed in the Convention, based on the requirement for one Commissioner per State, will lead to the re-imposition of the requirement for two Commissioners for the more populous States, which not only differentiates between States, whereby the large States count for twice as much as the others, but also favours the creation of concentration of powers into twelve Commissioners from these States to the detriment of the others;
- the amendment puts forward a false idea of equality, which is in my opinion more likely to be achieved with the rotating equality in which each Member State can choose whether to belong to the College of Commissioners with or without voting rights, on an alternating basis according to the specific composition of the successive Commissions.
This gives countries equal opportunities as regards time, with none having more rights than any other.
Â Â  .
I have voted against, because the compromise resolution demonstrates a serious lack of balance.
The European Parliament should now adopt an objective, realistic and unbiased position, instead of insisting on an uncompromising stance and on false ânegotiating positionsâ â Parliament is not involved in any negotiation.
We would need to contribute responsibly to a visible consensus, instead of insisting stubbornly on a supposed âConvention consensusâ, that everyone has realised does not exist.
I was particularly irked by the fact that AmendmentsÂ Nos 8 and 9, which I tabled on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, were not adopted.
Rejecting the move made by the Naples Conclave towards the solution of one Commissioner per Member State, on an equal footing and with full status, makes a poor contribution to the success of the IGC and reveals an unexpectedly reactionary mindset on the part of the parliamentary majority â especially when, unfortunately, veritable nonsense is being spouted in its place, such as the idea that âappointing one Commissioner per Member State would impart an intergovernmental character to itâ (!?).
As to the Italian presidencyâs lack of support for balance, given its proposal to overcome differences concerning the Preamble by making an explicit reference to Europeâs Christian or Judaeo-Christian heritage, whilst at the same time confirming the secular nature of the European institutions, this simply demonstrates the intolerance and prejudice underpinning the political resistance to the growing call being made by millions of European citizens for social change.
Â Â  I have voted against the resolution (which was nonetheless adopted by 346 votes in favour, 106 votes against and 58 abstentions), for, on crucial points, it does not meet what is required by central features of the Swedish Christian Democratsâ values and our work to protect the rights of small countries in the EU.
We wish to see a reference to Europeâs Judaeo-Christian and Biblical inheritance in the Preamble to a future European Constitution.
I therefore welcomed Amendment No 7, involving support for the Presidencyâs efforts to have Europeâs Judaeo-Christian inheritance incorporated.
This was rejected by plenary (with 213 votes in favour, 293 against and 17 abstentions).
I also supported Amendment No 8, which put forward demands for a Commission constituted on the basis of equality, with a Commissioner with full voting rights for each Member State.
Parliament voted against this, however (by 349 votes in favour, with 147 against and 49 abstentions).
Instead, paragraph 8 now states, mistakenly, that the Commission would be in danger of acquiring an intergovernmental character if a Commissioner were appointed for each Member State.
Nor do we support paragraph 5 in which Parliament adopts a position on the proposal for a clause in the intended European Constitution.
The clause would entitle the European Council to give itself and the EU increased powers, as well as to change the voting rules in favour of a qualified majority rather than unanimity, without the approval of the Member Statesâ national parliaments.
Â Â  I abstained from voting on the resolution adopted by the European Parliament concerning progress by the Intergovernmental Conference.
In and for itself, the resolution as a whole contains many good viewpoints and demands.
I cannot, however, support paragraph 8 because it says that not every country should be able to appoint a Commissioner.
The resolution justifies this by saying that the Commission would be in danger of acquiring an âintergovernmental characterâ if a Commissioner were appointed per Member State.
That is strange reasoning given that this principle has so far operated well and that, to my knowledge, the Commission has never been accused of having an âintergovernmental characterâ.
This is basically a question of democracy.
It is important that each country should be able to be represented at the highest level of the Commission.
That is the background to the position I adopted.
Â Â  â I voted against the MacCormick report for the reasons given in my minority opinion appended to it: the âcontractsâ or âtarget-based tripartite agreementsâ are nothing other than a war machine deployed by the Commission against the Member States in order to bypass them by establishing direct links between Brussels and regional authorities.
This innovation will, in its own small way, be part of the vast enterprise of âunravellingâ the Member States, led by the Commission and federalistpressure groups.
This enterprise seeks systematically to destroy an age-old creation, the diminishment of which will in future leave people helpless before a European power that is badly controlled.
The European Parliament report, despite its faults, does at times seem to see the dangers of the new system and is alarmed by them.
It calls for tripartite contracts to remain the exceptions, so as not to âgive rise to extreme complexity and in practice undermine âŠ [the] normative purpose [of the administration of the law]â (paragraph 8), and so as not to favour Member Statesâ deflecting responsibility (paragraph 14).
In order to better avoid these dangers it would, however, have been preferable if the European Parliament had not itself approved their causes
Â Â  .
I agree with those who have pointed out that creating pilot programmes for âtripartite contracts and agreements between the Community, the States and regional and local authoritiesâ can only be interpreted properly if we take account of the intentions underpinning this action.
As a matter of fact, because the aim that is proposed â by means of âformally coordinated actionsâ being able to âimprove the implementation of policiesâ, in other words, to establish Community standards that can only be applied with particular arrangements, taking account of very different and specific existing realities â already features in the Treaties, specifically by implementing the principle of subsidiarity and by means of a much more straightforward and appropriate process, which is to set targets to be achieved, leaving it up to the Member States how to do this by means of a directive.
Consequently, what underlies this initiative is not the crucial need to combat ultra-bureaucratic or highly centralised procedures or for a real increase in the power of local authorities to manage their own domain, but simply to raise local authorities to the level of direct partners of the European institutions in implementing their guidelines, in an attempt to take over from States as the national interlocutor.
Hence the support and the hearty congratulations of Parliamentâs ultra-federalist Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Â Â  .
I abstained from the vote on this report because I feel that the reasons the rapporteur gave for âregretting the absence of fully effective connections between the European Institutions, especially the Commission, and territorial authorities within Member States of an internal-national, regional or local kindâ are not sufficient to justify launching âtarget-based tripartite contracts and agreementsâ.
In fact, like MrÂ Berthu, I believe that the Community legal system already has a mechanism that enables us to pursue the same outcome through different means and that is the directive.
In fact, this legal instrument, which is closely bound up with the principle of subsidiarity, (even though only on the implementation of means) could be an option for the areas that are suggested and which are economic development, environmental policy, transport, agriculture and fisheries, with the State itself remaining the sole and direct interlocutor of the European institutions.
I believe that the measure recommended for raising local authorities to the level of direct partners of the European institutions forms part of the well-known process of European centralisation and of ignoring the States and I predict that, if the practice of concluding such contracts becomes widespread, the complexity of interinstitutional relations will increase disproportionately, as will the related bureaucracy.
This will lead to chaos.
I acknowledge the Commissionâs prudence in proposing the adoption of experimental pilot programmes, which will be subject to the future presentation of an evaluation report.
Â Â  .
In accordance with the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are obliged to adopt measures to combat fraud and to protect the Communityâs financial interests.
In 2002 alone, some EURÂ twoÂ billion were lost to irregularities and fraud to the detriment of the Community, and this sum is perhaps only the tip of the iceberg â with obvious economic repercussions â highlighting the need to step up the fight against corruption.
I share many of the rapporteurâs criticisms and concerns about the evaluation of OLAFâs activities.
As the rapporteur states, âthe Eurostat case has laid bare a number of weaknesses in the Officeâs investigative activitiesâ, in particular the fact that the investigation has been dragging on for years and that the rules to protect those being investigated have not been complied with.
Consequently, I also agree with the need to guarantee OLAF greater autonomy and means, in particular for an increase in the number of investigators.
There are, however, fundamental issues that must be addressed and which underpin many cases of irregularity and fraud, particularly as regards outsourcing Commission services.
Furthermore, I have serious reservations as to the need for a European Public Prosecutor, a stage in the process of creating a European Public Prosecutorâs Office, backed up by Europol, Eurojust and OLAF.
Â Â  .â Public opinion sees the EU as, above all, a large-scale organisation far removed from the citizen, and as one offering tremendous scope for fraud.
Fraud is committed by directors, by EU Commissioners and their cabinets; it is committed through the involvement of private companies and by providing people with an income without expecting anything in return.
There is fraud in order to line one's own pockets, fraud to buy one's friends and fraud in order to secure the future of one's own job, irrespective of corporate planning.
In order to fight this kind of fraud, an increasing number of bureaucratic control rules have been established, as well as different control services that work alongside each other, each active within their own limited remits.
The existence of OLAF, and previously UCLAF, did nothing to stop fraud in the past, including the Eurostat scandal that has recently come to light.
The approach so far has been characterised by increasing internal control instead of more openness, which allows public opinion to look on.
Examiners are involved in matters that have to remain secret for fear that they will cross the path of judicial procedures.
OLAF's function would become a great deal more useful if it were also to focus on removing the breeding ground for fraud and on bringing wrongdoing out into the open.
Before it can do that, though, we may need a parliamentary inquiry.
Â Â  .
Transparency in decision-making processes, something that I have always fought for, cannot disappear when it comes to adopting legislative acts.
The increasing complexity and number of the competences conferred on the institutions and bodies of the European Union require closer vigilance over the adequacy, on the one hand, and the legitimacy, on the other, of the use to which the inheritance of Europeâs citizens, which is embodied by the budget, is put.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs evaluation report on the activities of this organisation.
We must pursue some of the approaches put forward by the rapporteur, such as closer coordination between the various institutionsâ monitoring structures, a better definition of OLAFâs working rules, and a definition of a clear policy on prioritising investigations.
It is also worth highlighting one aspect that is often given only perfunctory consideration â with enormous consequences for the success of OLAF â and that is the receptiveness of institutions and bodies to the warnings and reports issued by this organisation.
Â Â  .
There are currently no provisions defining a standard way of repatriating the mortal remains of people who have died in one Member State to another.
Given the lack of any such provision, the cross-border transport of mortal remains is governed by two international legal instruments: the Berlin Agreement of 1937 and the Strasbourg Agreement of 1973, concluded under the auspices of the Council of Europe, to which only some Member States have acceded and which, in the rapporteurâs opinion, are largely obsolete.
The rapporteur is of the view that, on the basis of these agreements, in the event that a citizen of one Member State dies in another Member State, the formalities are more complex, the time that elapses before burial or cremation is longer and the costs are higher than if the death occurred in the country of origin of the deceased person.
For this reason and given that there are large immigrant communities in some Member States with origins in another Member State such as Portugal, for example, we should enhance the value of measures that could meet the specific needs of these communities, especially as regards the set of problems addressed in the report.
Â Â  .
The differences in law found within the national legal systems of the various Member States of the European Union place the relatives of persons who have died in a Member State other than their own in a particularly distressing situation.
The necessary formalities, which are inevitably more complex in such cases, the extra time required and the higher costs incurred by victimsâ families make a painful and very sensitive time even more dismal.
Furthermore, the international legal instruments that apply to these situations are inadequate, given current levels of mobility amongst the citizens, an aspect that takes on greater importance for the freedom of movement of persons in the intra-Community area and which increases the likelihood of such situations occurring.
I agree in particular with the rapporteurâs assertion that freedom of movement is hampered by this legal framework, especially because equal treatment between Community citizens and nationals is not fully respected.
Because I believe that the rapporteurâs suggestions are heading in the right direction, providing for the practical adoption of measures and ending the inactivity of the European Commission in this regard, I voted in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to add to what has been said about the way in which we conduct these meetings.
I think it is scandalous, the way in which we do not bring items to a close in the manner laid down and the way in which we treat our Commissioners.
The latter come in at the time when the President has said we are to vote, and it is completely unacceptable for Parliament to treat our Commissioners in that way.
I note that you were unable to come up with any remarks in response to the British MEP who raised the issue.
May I not, however, ask that the issue be debated at a Conference of Presidents and that a solution be found, for I think that the dignity of Parliament is grossly impaired by the way in which we all conduct ourselves.
Â Â  I will pass your comments on to the President of Parliament, who will raise the matter at the Conference of Presidents.(1)
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 December 2003.(1)
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 11 December 2003 has been distributed.
I have received no requests for changes.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not exactly sure if I am on the order of business. However, I should like to ask, if possible, for the vote on the directive on environmental liability which we are debating tonight not to be held at noon tomorrow but for it to be held at noon on Wednesday.
I know very well, both from my group and from other political groups, that they are still discussing various issues relating to the vote, how it is organised, and so on.
The deadlines were abysmal.
So, if there is no major problem, I would be most grateful if the vote could be held at noon on Wednesday.
Â Â  The problem is, Mr Papayannakis, that under the Rules of Procedure, the services must receive requests for changes to the order of business at least one hour before the opening of the sitting.
No such request has been received, and so, if I follow the Rules, I should dismiss your request.
Are there any other comments on this matter?
Â Â  â Mr President, although this may have been formally incorrect, I have to assume that an agreement has been reached that the vote will indeed be deferred.
The groups thought that we could attempt to resolve the problem â or problems â in good time, so that we could keep to the original timetable, but it has turned out in the meantime that these attempts have â so far at least â proved fruitless.
In that case, we too on our side of the House could support this if you regard it as feasible.
Â Â  Mr President, I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that this is a major codecision text in second reading, for which we require a qualified majority to pass amendments.
Given the relatively low attendance in this House on Thursdays - I make no comment about why that is - it is quite unacceptable for a major codecision text of this kind to be taken on a Thursday.
I would strongly advise against taking this text.
I speak as the deputy coordinator of my Group on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is leading on this text.
Â Â  I should like to clarify matters.
MrÂ Papayannakis wants the vote to be taken on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, in which case it would be reasonable to assume that the requisite number of Members would be present.
Under the Rules, no change should be made because I did not receive a request in writing.
However, if the House wishes to accommodate the request, I am prepared to use our common sense collectively to do so.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as rapporteur, I should like to echo Mr Papayannakisâ request and call for the vote to be moved from Tuesday to Wednesday, the reason being the problems caused by the amendments not having been translated into a number of languages.
This will then also give the various groups the opportunity of concluding compromises.
However â and I support Mr Harbour in this â I would certainly not be in favour of moving the vote to Thursday.
After all, then we run the risk, this being a codecision procedure, of being left with a limited number of people and of not reaching the quorum, particularly as we are nearing Christmas.
I am therefore in favour of moving the vote to Wednesday.
This compromise could then be the starting shot for all groups and rapporteurs to join together in guiding this report through the process.
Â Â  I get the impression that perhaps the groups would agree to having the vote on Wednesday.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have the same problem with the Lisi report concerning the conciliation on compensation and assistance to air passengers.
What is regrettable is that, on Thursdays, Members leave during the vote, and that is a real problem.
So, either these votes, which really are extremely important and require a qualified majority, are indeed transferred to Wednesday, or they take place on Thursday, but right at the beginning of the sitting, so that we do in fact have the quorum needed.
Â Â  We have made several points here.
Concerning Mr Papayannakis' request, in the light of the exchange of views we have had, despite the fact that no request was made in writing, it seems that we have a consensus to move the vote to Wednesday.
As regards Thursday, that is when we have the annual budget vote.
The House had better be quorate indeed more than quorate or we risk having no budget.
So, on Thursday it will be business as usual.
Â Â  Last week at the Conference of Presidents I announced that work to replace the simultaneous interpretation equipment in Strasbourg has now been completed.
However, for technical reasons, the ring on your microphones, which normally appears as red when you speak, will not work during this session.
Please press the speaking button as usual and then proceed in the hope and let us hope, the certainty that your microphone will work, even though the red light will not be on.
Â Â  I should like to welcome members of a delegation from the Romanian Senate to the Official Gallery. They are led by Mr Nicolae PÄtru, Chairman of the Committee for Agriculture of the Senate.
They have come to Strasbourg on a familiarisation visit.
They are very welcome.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is very kind of you to allow me the floor.
I have to say something that relates to you.
I was in my electoral district this morning, and when I opened the newspapers, I learned that you are to receive the international Charlemagne Prize in Aachen next year.
Speaking quite personally, I would like to extend to you my wholehearted congratulations on this.
Mr Laschet, who is a member of the Charlemagne Prize committee, does not appear to be in the Chamber.
He is a Christian Democrat, and so I do not always agree with his decisions; indeed, on the contrary I sometimes think they are quite wrong, but his choice of you as a nominee for this prize is one that I can firmly endorse, and I would like to warmly congratulate you, not only for myself, but also, I believe, on behalf of most of the members of this House.
Â Â  In his absence I should like to thank Mr Laschet.
The award is to be presented in May 2004, some weeks before the election.
In addition to the personal honour, of which I am very conscious, it is a wonderful tribute to the role of the European Parliament in an election year and I would be happy to receive the award in that context on behalf of this House and the contribution it makes to European Union affairs.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to reply to the comments that have been made in previous months at this point on the agenda by Members of the GUE/NGL Group criticising the situation in Latvia, and in particular the position of Russian speakers.
It seems to me that many of those comments have been unfair and misleading.
They do not refer back to the illegal Soviet occupation of Latvia, nor indeed to the Hitler-Stalin or Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact.
I believe that the comments were politically motivated, ignoring the very great diversity within Russian-speaking Latvians.
My final point - because I believe an official rebuttal is needed - is on the Latvian electoral law.
My understanding is that former members of the KGB are not permitted to stand for election; it seems to me that is in accordance with the national legislation.
In this House I am sure we welcome all the new Member States into the European Union.
It is important that we understand the sensitivities and the histories of those countries.
I hope there will be no further comments from the GUE/NGL Group on this subject.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at a time when I believe that we will all be very concerned about mobility because of the New Year celebrations, I would like to report to you and also to the Italian Presidency an extremely distinctive situation that affects Italian residents in Belgium.
Did you know that long-term Italian residents in Belgium today still have to go to their place of birth to renew their identity card?
Furthermore, if by any chance they decide to do without it and to instead use a passportÂ âÂ the cost of which I will leave you to imagineÂ âÂ and if they have the misfortune, or the good fortune, of being divorced, then they still have to ask the consent of their ex-spouse.
All this may seem rather trivial but I think that the Italian Presidency will be able to see that it prevents part of its population from having a completely European mobility and, as a result, from having a little more faith in Europe.
Perhaps you could pass on these remarks to the Italian Presidency?
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to refer to the tragedy of today's dead-heat parliamentary election result in Turkish Northern Cyprus which is insufficient to oust Mr Denktash, who actively opposes the generous US-Annan plan to reunify the island in time to join the European Union next May.
Can you appeal to Mr Denktash to reopen negotiations urgently and accept that the huge swing against him in the election indicates a desire by his impoverished people for a settlement on the island?
Secondly, in Russian Daghestan we have once again seen the brutal action of Chechen guerrillas who beheaded the border guard commander and took hostages including local hospital workers.
This is against the backdrop of a suicide bomber in Moscow last week killing six innocent civilians.
I should like to ask you to send to the Speaker of the new Duma, which is being convened next week, this House's expression of condolences and outrage against such terrorist actions.
Finally, on a different note, I congratulate Prime Minister Berlusconi on securing for historic and gastronomic Parma the seat of the Food Safety Agency.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to inform the House of the ban on Som RÃ dio in the Balearic Islands.
The newly elected government in the Balearic Islands, which belongs to the PP Party, has banned its broadcasts.
Som RÃ dio was the sole broadcaster using the Catalan language, which is the official language in Majorca, Minorca and Ibiza.
A few months ago we talked about the prohibition of the newspaper in the Basque country.
The Spanish Government bans newspapers and radio stations whose opinions differ from its own, especially when the issue is that another language, such as Catalan or Basque, is involved.
Another example of disgraceful behaviour was the position of the Spanish Government on the European Constitution last Saturday in Brussels, which we find unacceptable and which my party and I are completely against.
As you can see, the Spanish Government does not only ban the European Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure that a number of Members like me will be alarmed at suggestions that France is considering a ban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in its state schools.
Indeed, a study in France has now suggested that these scarves, Jewish boys' skull caps and other religious symbols are ostentatious and provocative.
President Chirac has been quoted as saying that for Muslim girls to wear headscarves is a sort of aggression.
Far be it from me to interfere in French internal politics - I am not a Muslim, indeed I am not a follower of any religion - but my belief is that this would not address the challenge that France faces in integrating Muslims and other minorities into its society.
In my part of London - Brent, Harrow, Hounslow, Ealing, I could go on - we found that the opposite policy of respect for peoples' differences, respect for their different religions, respect for different practices and heritage, is a much better way of incorporating minorities into societies.
I hope through you, Mr President, and through our French colleagues here, we can send this message back to President Chirac and the French authorities.
Â Â  Mr President, on the last occasion we met I raised a question about the Scotch whisky industry which was of considerable public concern.
You very kindly, on behalf of the House, took it up with Commissioner Byrne, who is fortuitously here present.
I am glad to report that the Scotch Whisky Association has reached a consensual settlement of that difficult question for the time being.
I hope that it will be possible for the whole matter to be resolved through satisfactory industry standards.
The attention that this House and other public bodies paid to this matter was instrumental in reaching a solution, so I thank you and encourage you all to celebrate the New Year of 2004 with an appropriate beverage!
Â Â  Especially if you are sponsoring it, Mr MacCormick.
Â Â  Mr President, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq is to be very much welcomed.
Nonetheless, the United States' Pentagon website has posted a list of 63 so-called favoured countries which President Bush wants to include in the bidding process for USD 18 billion of contracts to rebuild Iraq.
Mr Bush has excluded from this list a number of European Member States - including Ireland - which have been long-time allies of the United States.
This despite the fact that the European Union has donated EUR 40 million of EU taxpayers' money this year, and that this week we will be voting for a further EUR 500 million.
To add insult to injury, the exclusion of these countries has been deemed as necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States.
Public opinion in Europe was clearly divided over the question of invading Iraq.
I was opposed to it.
I did not believe the justifications given stood up to scrutiny, and this has proven to be the case.
I would appeal to the Commission, to the incoming Irish presidency and to you, Mr President, particularly as the EU-US Summit will be held during the Irish presidency, to impress upon President Bush the serious misjudgment he is making in this matter and the potential negative consequences for us all in western Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, it is Christmas time, which means it is the time for goodwill throughout Europe.
From the platform of this House, I would like to call on the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to give a present to the Italian ex-military internees, the ex-prisoners condemned to forced labour who have not yet received any compensation for this non-voluntary work.
I would like to point out that the German Foundation âMemory, Responsibility and FutureÂ âÂ a direct expression of the German Government and German industryÂ âÂ has decided to exclude Italian ex-military internees alone from this compensation, in conflict with both European Parliament resolution B2-0147/1985 and, most importantly, with all the equal opportunities legislation being developed by Parliament.
These prisoners, these internees, are no different from the others.
Even the Austrian Government decided to make good this debt in 2000.
The deadline for submitting applications is 31 December.
Mr President, I would like to ask you a question: in view of the fact that there is a resolution on this matter drafted by Mr Borghezio but that the timeframes will be very long, why does the German Government not act immediately? Seventy thousand of these internees are still alive.
The harsh statistics tell us that the numbers fall by 10% each year.
We cannot accept this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, at a time when the World Trade Organization is meeting in Geneva, I wish to draw attention to the need to revise current policies for liberalising trade, in order to promote fair and equitable trading systems that are geared towards genuinely enabling each country to develop its true potential, towards solving the problems of poverty, towards promoting better living conditions, without imposing relationships of dominance and dependence.
Mr President, it is important that this Parliament discusses the current Commission mandate, given the failure of the WTO Ministerial Summit in CancÃºn to conclude any agreements, and that we make the appropriate proposals for the future which take account of these concerns.
On the very day that this meeting is taking place in Geneva, the Commission must take account of these concerns.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wanted, all the same, to respond to our fellow Member who took the liberty of addressing Parliament on an issue which is only an issue for French internal policy.
I would like to stress that it is not acceptable for Members of the European Parliament to interfere in a countryâs internal politics.
It is good to draw attention to this rule, especially at a time when Europe in general, and Parliament in particular, is criticised for meddling in everything.
Â Â  MrÂ President, France is, as everyone knows, a secular state.
Secularism is an essential value for French people and it is an intrinsic part of our culture.
The Islamic headscarf is a sign of oppression of women, a sign of male superiority.
This is unacceptable for French people, but also for every man and woman that advocates humanism.
In this House we campaign for equality between men and women.
The issue of the Islamic headscarf is a complex one and we hope that some of our fellow Members will not compound this complexity with their certitudes.
If they possess the truth, then good for them.
As for us, we are searching for the truth, and we will make every effort to promote the secularism that is the only hope for peace between all religions.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Spain and Poland on their courageous and principled stand at the recent IGC, which resulted in the failure of the wretched draft Constitution.
However, I regret that it failed over voting weights, which is essentially a technical issue, when it would have been better had it failed by rejecting in principle this massive step in European integration for which there is no public demand.
There is a disturbing parallel emerging between the political of the EU on the one hand and the former USSR on the other.
Both were obsessed with their own narrow vision of the unification of their continents.
Both showed an arrogant disregard for the ambitions and aspirations of ordinary people and eventually we shall be able to say that both failed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am almost ashamed to mention a simple news item at a time when international news is so important and at a time when we are lamenting the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference.
In my country, in my region, workers have taken the managers of their company hostage.
That is reprehensible, and, we are told, it is not a socially acceptable way of negotiating.
Just after the acceptance of the French plan was achieved in the CommissionÂ âÂ and I would say after a long brave struggleÂ âÂ Alstom decided to quite simply close one of its companies in my region, to relocate it to Montrouge, near Paris.
If a Europe for workers envisages acknowledging that a restructuring plan, accepted by the Commission, will lead to such protectionist measures, then this is a deplorable vision.
We should not then be surprised that managers are taken hostage by workers when there are no longer other means of negotiation.
Â Â  Mr President, the dramatic events of the weekend should not go unnoticed in this Parliament, so let us send our congratulations to the forces of the United States and Britain and other coalition countries whose valiant efforts have ensured over the weekend that the tyrant Saddam Hussein is now in custody.
Those two countries and others have ensured that democracy and freedom can flower in Iraq, where perhaps in the past they would not have done so.
Secondly, echoing the comments made by Mr Helmer, we should congratulate the Polish and Spanish Governments on ensuring that this wretched Constitution may be delayed.
Perhaps that view may not get cheers inside this Parliament but it will get many cheers in the homes and streets of the countries we all represent.
Let us welcome that move and congratulate them on their achievement.
Â Â  We will all have the opportunity tomorrow morning, with the Italian Presidency, to bring our collective wisdom to bear on those issues.
Â Â  Mr President, while General Wesley Clark a certified, as yet unindicted war criminal testified at the so-called International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in absolute secrecy, the Deputy Registrar of the same 'Tribunal' has issued a decision banning practically all contact between the former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the outside world.
A similar decision was taken for Mr Vojislav Seselj.
Both are candidates on the list of the Socialist Party of Serbia for the elections on 28 December.
Whatever opinion one might have on the Milosevic case, it is more than obvious that the ban is a punitive measure in order to prevent Mr Milosevic from exercising his right of freedom of speech and his right, pursuant to Serbian law, to stand as a candidate in the electoral process.
Thus the Deputy Registrar's decision is a blunt intervention in the Serbian elections in favour of those who sold their country to the imperialist powers and an attempt to deny the people of Serbia the right to decide their own fate.
Last but not least, it is a clear threat to the civil rights of all of us.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to place on record my appreciation to Mr Berlusconi for the gift of a tie.
That was a very kind gesture from the Italian presidency.
I assume lady Members may have received scarves, though I am surprised that we do not see any of the ladies wearing scarves here this afternoon.
I wish to say that on 25 September 2003 Parliament passed a resolution requiring the Commission to answer certain questions on the regulation of Lloyd's of London and to give information by 15 November 2003.
That was not received, though a promise was received from the Commission, dated 18 November, that information would be received by 15 December.
Last week I was assured by Commissioner Bolkestein's office that information would be available.
I regret to inform the House, as rapporteur on this item, that I have yet to see any of these documents.
I understand that the British Government is seriously censoring such documents as may be made available.
Unless you can advise me to the contrary that they have now been received, I hope that we can send a gentle but nonetheless firm reminder to the Commission to honour its promises.
Â Â  I am not in a position to give such confirmation.
I will wait until 16 December to see if that is true.
Then we could remind the Commission of its failure to honour the deadline for the forwarding of that material.
Â Â  Mr President, I have listened to Mr Beasley repeat the shameless arguments that, in Latvia and Estonia, they are flagrantly violating the rights of almost half the population in these countries, who were born and have worked there and whose only crime is that they are of Russian extraction or speak Russian.
These people are being forced with humiliating examinations to abandon their country.
At the same time, communist parties are banned in these countries and their cadres are being persecuted, as are the veterans of the anti-fascist war, and monuments are being erected in honour of the SS and the Nazi conquerors.
At the same time, the universities are being closed, while the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is being forced to open universities and to ensure the Albanian minority, 25% of the population, is represented in the parliament and in the government.
The problem is that similar views and these sorts of violations are also being supported by the Commissioner materially responsible for enlargement, Mr Verheugen, and by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who said in a recent response to my letter that, in his view, the ban on a communist party was no reason to censure a country by preventing it from becoming a member of the European Union.
However, because the communist parties in the Member States of the European Union are still legal, I fear that this is a foretaste of autocratic and anti-democratic measures to come.
That is why I am protesting, and I have insisted today also that this protest on my part go on record.
Â Â  You did so in twice the time allowed.
As a result you can explain to your colleague, who will be excluded from speaking in this item, why that is so.
Â Â  Mr President, Julio Medem's film is a bid to start dialogue using the metaphor of the Basque national game.
It has been highly acclaimed by the Basque people, but has been condemned by the Spanish Government and by Â¡Basta Ya!, the Sakharov Prize winner in this Parliament two years ago.
For the Spanish nationalists, political dialogue in the Basque country is unacceptable because, as they say, it would mean agreeing with the will of ETA.
As a matter of fact, those reactions may be the film's strongest endorsement, as its current success proves.
Last week the Spanish Government announced a change in the criminal code, making authorities that consult their citizens through referenda liable to prison sentences.
This could also affect citizens who participate in the consultation procedure.
From this morning, Mr Maragall, the new president of Catalonia, like Mr Ibarretxe in the Basque country, risks coming under these legal provisions.
Mr President, honourable Members, in your experience as politicians have you ever heard of any purportedly democratic government behaving in a similar way?
Â Â  Mr President, I have requested the floor following the speech by Mr Gorostiaga.
It is difficult to understand his approach, since he is confusing a film with a provision by a government which intends to guarantee democracy.
And, furthermore, you say this as a representative of a political party which is illegal in Spain, which defends terrorists and kills those of us who defend our ideas.
Mr Gorostiaga, your approach is totally out of line with what we in this House defend: freedom of expression, which you do not defend in any of your considerations and even less in your speech this afternoon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0387/2003) from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells (10133/3/2003 â C5-0416/2003 â 2002/0128(COD)) (Rapporteur: Peter Liese).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue here is the transplantation of cells and tissues, a fast-growing branch of medicine.
Although it will not cure all the things that people are currently promising it will, the transplantation of cells and tissues will, in future, be able to help many people who suffer from hitherto incurable illnesses.
Even today, people can survive them by means of the transplantation of bone marrow, heart valves and skin, and the new biotechnological discipline of tissue engineering will certainly lead to new triumphs in the future.
It does have its risks, though, such as, for example, the transmission of pathogens or the uncontrolled growth of cells, which can result in cancer, and the ethical problems associated with it must always, of course, be considered.
We must make use of the opportunities presented by this technology, while limiting its risks.
I believe that Parliamentâs amendments to the Common Position, which are before you, make an important contribution in this regard.
In the course of the past week, we have succeeded in coming to an agreement with the Italian Presidency of the Council on a whole range of amendments, which means that, what you will be voting on tomorrow at midday is a package of compromises to which the Council has already agreed with the permanent representatives, and if this House adopts it, we can avoid a conciliation procedure.
I am grateful to all those who have helped to bring this agreement about, especially to the Italian Council Presidency, and most particularly to the Minister of Health, Professor Sirchia, who has personally committed himself to it.
My thanks go also to the Commissionâs staff and, of course, to my fellow-Members as well.
Above all else, Parliament aimed to prevent the donation of cells and tissues being commercialised, and, to a large extent, we have succeeded in achieving this important objective.
In contrast to the vague wording proposed by the Council and the Commission, the agreement we now have makes provision for unambiguous rules.
We draw a distinction between payment for the donation of cells and tissues, which is to be prohibited, and compensation for costs incurred by a donor, which is perfectly permissible.
We want the compensation to be clearly defined and the Member States to shoulder their responsibility in this regard.
It was at this point that great controversy erupted, with the Council and the Commission initially contending that Parliamentâs demands lacked any basis in law.
We were, however, able to persuade them both that a non-commercial approach was called for not only in terms of considerations of ethics, but also of health protection.
It is quite simply unthinkable, for example, that one should offer a great deal of money for the donation of cells and tissues and only then ask the donor whether he is at any sort of medical risk.
The possibility of medical risks being concealed is always a factor when large amounts of money are involved, and this presents dangers not only for the donor but also for the recipient.
We have also made it clear that there is to be no trading in cells and tissues as such, but that there is no objection to trading in medicines manufactured from them.
As is made clear in one of the recitals, industry has an important part to play in this.
This House takes the view that a ban on commercialisation is an absolute necessity, being something that is not merely included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also a requirement on which Parliament has insisted on repeated occasions, both within Europe and outside it.
Let me take this opportunity to mention a visit to this House on Wednesday by a Ukrainian woman who campaigns for human rights, who will, on that occasion, be describing instances in which new-born children are taken away from their parents, the suspected purpose of this being the transplantation of their organs or tissues.
Even outside Europe, I believe, we have to keep a watchful eye on this.
At first reading, this House also called for a comprehensive ban on the cloning of human beings, which we have not been able to persuade the Council to accept.
The Council of Ministers firmly refused to accept this amendment, and, in the negotiations, I no longer insisted on it in order to avoid the need for a conciliation procedure.
This does not, however, mean that Parliament has changed its opinion about this.
I believe this to be another area in which safety considerations demand that we be very careful, and we will continue to keep a watchful eye on this in future.
In addition to this, we have also managed to bring about a whole range of further improvements, with better-framed provisions on anonymity, reinforcement of Parliamentâs rights in the event of the directive being amended, and a series of clarifications on, among other things, the import of cells and tissues.
The cumulative effect of these small improvements in these areas is to clarify the Common Position and to make it more precise, and the non-commercialisation aspect has been greatly improved.
I can therefore recommend that the Members of this House, tomorrow morning, vote to adopt the compromise amendments, which have been submitted by several groups and negotiated with the Council, and to do so in the interests of unambiguous regulation and an improved Common Position.
Â Â  . Mr President, eight months have passed since I had the pleasure of addressing you on the Commissionâs proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells.
Since that occasion in April 2003 there has been a considerable amount of effort, discussion and negotiation on the part of Parliament and the Council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today.
I am fully aware of the tremendous work that these institutions have undertaken with the Commission over the recent months.
Let me specifically express my appreciation to the rapporteur and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work on this important proposal.
The compromise package will ensure that the increasing number of patients in Europe who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are not only safe but also of good quality.
It constitutes another step forward in the regulatory framework on substances of human origin under Article 152 that we initiated a couple of years ago with the blood directive.
In my view, the main concerns of the European Parliament have been successfully addressed in the compromise â and that is very much down to your rapporteur.
Let me now turn to some of the key concerns.
I appreciate the difficult issues the Environment Committee had to address â in particular regarding ethics and other related issues.
The Commission is willing to accept the compromise position that strikes a balance between Parliamentâs wish to 'ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations, and the current proposal, which 'encourages' such donations.
This amendment would introduce the wording 'endeavours to ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations and the idea of compensation in specific cases, leaving the responsibility of defining such compensation to the Member States themselves.
I must, however, make it clear that this compromise solution goes to the very limit of what the Commission believes to be legally acceptable, given the restrictions of the Treaty.
The Council of Europe and the European Group on Ethics have stressed the principle of not-for-profit procurement of tissues and cells.
The directive should therefore accord with this principle.
However, I must draw a distinction between the act of procurement, to which the 'not-for-profit' principle should apply, and the secondary activities, such as the further processing, manipulation, testing, or the manufacturing of products, to which it should not apply.
For example, whilst it might be considered unacceptable to take heart valves from a deceased donor and sell them, heart valves need to be treated to ensure the absence of infectious agents and preserved so that they can be stored for a longer period.
These and other processes that have served to improve the quality and usefulness of the heart valve should not be constrained by the 'not-for-profit' principle.
This point has been clarified in the compromise package.
Some amendments refer to prohibition of the use of 'cells derived from cloned embryos' for 'transplantation' â so-called 'therapeutic cloning'.
Such applications remain highly controversial with no consistent opinion amongst the Member States as to either their ethical legitimacy or their safety.
I would add that there is no likelihood of any such opinion emerging in the near future.
We therefore consider it necessary to refrain from interference regarding decisions to be made by individual Member States on the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells or tissues.
I believe the best solution is to set a Community framework on safety and quality requirements with sufficient scope to cover the use of such cells in those Member States where it is permitted.
The compromise package reinforces the thrust of the Commission proposal in this respect.
Anonymity is another important issue.
It is generally accepted that tissue and cell donation should respect the anonymity of both donors and recipients.
This principle aims first to respect the confidentiality of the donor and the recipient, and second, to encourage altruistic donations.
The common position introduces the possibility for Member States to maintain or adopt different legislation in exceptional circumstances, such as the right of a child to know the genetic parents in case of the donation of gametes.
I can accept further clarification of the rights of Member States to make exceptions.
Finally, a word on organs.
While the quality and safety of organs is indeed important, priority at this stage should be given to addressing the serious shortages of organs and the prevention of organ trafficking.
The Commission wishes to reflect on how it could best address the concerns of Parliament in this sensitive area.
We need first to get the overall framework right before proposing specific solutions.
To this end, the Commission is willing to present a declaration as follows: 'The important differences between organ transplantation and the use of other human substances such as blood, tissues and cells mean that a specific approach for organs in order to ensure safety and quality is necessary.
Such an approach in the current situation characterised by shortages of organs has to balance two factors: the need for organ transplantation, which is usually a matter of life and death, with the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety.
The Commission believes that before considering any proposal it is necessary to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation regarding organ transplantation.
The Commission will present a report on the conclusions of the analysis it undertakes as soon as possible.'
To conclude, I look forward to your endorsement of the orientation presented in the compromise package.
I believe that if Parliament and the Council can endorse the amendments, so too can the Commission.
I will be very disappointed if we cannot reach agreement.
Discussions on the 70 amendments would be very complicated, and I very much doubt whether we would arrive at a better solution than that offered by this compromise package.
Â Â  â Mr President, I advocate here the position adopted by Parliament at first reading.
We wanted to safeguard the voluntary and unpaid donation of cells and tissues and ban the trade in unmodified cells and tissues, while at the same time protecting industrial activity in this area.
The Council wanted to abrogate Parliamentâs position on non-payment, suggesting it was an ethical question outside the competence of the EU.
In my opinion it would be a big mistake to exclude ethical issues from EU decision-making, especially when we talk about a Community which likes to call itself a community of values.
Besides, ethical issues rarely arise in isolation in some moral vacuum.
They are ethical for the very reason that they have an effect on peopleâs health, for example, as in this case.
Here we arrive at a key policy issue in which Parliamentâs work, under the leadership of my colleague, Peter Liese, is extremely important.
A certain Italian film director â if in honour of Italyâs presidential term, coming to its end as it is, I may return once again in this House to the subject of Italian films â said that the way you define the angle of view is an ethical choice.
Ethical issues cannot be passed over, because that in itself is an ethical choice.
I, who had an education in philosophy, feel compelled to say this.
We also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world imitates our practices.
If we allow trade in human body parts we have to bear in mind that the developing countries will follow Europeâs example.
This sort of commercialisation will lead to exploitation, and, moreover, to increased risk.
The approach chosen by the Council also risks accusations of inconsistency. Several Member States of the European Union have signed a Convention on bioethics which categorically prohibits the financial exploitation of the human body and its parts.
Our rapporteurâs conclusion is well argued.
The legal basis of the Directive is Article 152 of the Treaty on European Union, which deals with health matters, but all the âethical issuesâ addressed by Parliament are also linked to protecting the health of donors and recipients.
Any donation made in dubious circumstances, for example in response to financial pressure, is also a danger for the recipient of cells and tissues.
This view is also widely shared within the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an important report and it must be approved and brought into law across Europe as quickly as possible.
For that reason I can confirm that, although the Socialists did not sign the compromise package of amendments, we will support them as we favour most of them and do not wish to hinder bringing them into law.
We urgently need this legislation on the quality and safety of tissues and cells across Europe.
This is a growing sector, with many new opportunities for the relief of pain and suffering and we do not want to stop anyone taking advantage of it.
Many of the diseases and ailments from which people are currently suffering can be cured by various therapies that can be derived from this sector.
It is important that, whilst human need is met, standards of health and safety and quality be maintained.
Ethical standards on donation, confidentiality, freedom of choice and other issues of concern to individual Member States need to be respected and addressed.
I am glad the Commission has recognised that in terms of the amendments it has accepted from Parliament.
New technologies, such as embryo stem cell research, cannot be ruled out as sources of future therapies for either medical or ethical reasons.
We have gone as far as we can to satisfy those people with specific ethical concerns on those issues and with regard to other new technologies.
We must recognise that our primary duty here today is to ensure the quality and safety of tissues and cells that are going to be used for the relief of human suffering, as they move around the single market to various destinations.
That is our duty: to give the people of Europe common choice, common opportunities and common relief from many of the diseases and ailments from which they currently suffer.
Â Â  MrÂ President, after more than a year of discussion regarding this directive, the position of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is clear and has remained almost unchanged.
It has been said that it is a public health directive, as Commissioner Byrne mentioned just now.
Furthermore, if it is trueÂ âÂ and I am answering MrsÂ KorholaÂ âÂ that ethical principles are at the heart, and form the basis, of the majority of our decisions, then it is not for Europe to regulate and, even less so, to harmonise in this area.
We must, therefore, concentrate on the amendments that, in practice, meet the needs of potential recipients.
The report has made much progress along these lines, even in this House, thanks to the tireless work of MrÂ Liese whom I thank.
Let us take note that the progress includes effective traceability at all times; the possibility of authorising, in exceptional circumstances, the lifting of anonymity for gamete donationsÂ âÂ this was crucial for thousands of infertile couples waiting for the gift of life; and adding to the text an amendment, which I tabled, on information campaigns designed to raise living citizensâ awareness concerning the donation of tissue and cells.
To move on now to the controversial issue of voluntary and unpaid donation, the liberal group is satisfied with the compromise that was reached, a better compromise than the one reached for directive 100.
The text specifies that the donation must be made of the donorâs free will without payment, with the exception of possible compensation, for which detailed rules are to be laid down by Member States on the basis of subsidiarity.
All the same, I am sorry to see that amendments that explicitly encouraged the donation of umbilical cord blood and the registration of potential bone marrow donors were refused.
As regards organs, the Commission has been promising us a legislative initiative since this was first an issue, because this is a considerable problem taking various forms: organised trafficking, shortage etc. It does not, howeverÂ âÂ and this is understandableÂ âÂ want to act with great haste and it puts forwardthestatement discussed in detail by the Commissioner.
So be it!
Having said that, and on this issue of the difficulty of finding compatible organs, we could perhaps suggest the inclusion of a proposal, within the framework of this declaration, to encourage European cooperation through the Retransplant consortium.
Currently, only six countries are involved in it and that is not enough.
To conclude, MrÂ President, I welcome the fact that, as regards this issue, which, as we can see, is complex and sensitive, the European law that we are in the process of drawing up in this House establishes first and foremost general principles and rules, which must be flexible and progressive in the interests of putting patients first.
It was both important and vital not to close the door on genetic research, in particular for stem cells.
We achieved this and, therefore, I recommend, on behalf of the liberal group, that we adopt, without modification, the overall compromise reached between MrÂ Liese, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency.
The objective sought with this text, and I would remind you of this, is to resolutely combat shortage and trafficking, and to promote solidarity and quality.
This is the only message that Europe should send out to the hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for heart valve transplants, corneas, bone cells, donated sperm and oocyte, or simply for reparatory transplants for severe burns.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in April 2003, when there was the debate at first reading of the Liese report, I spoke then on behalf of my group on this important issue.
On that occasion I mentioned three principles, which led me to reject many amendments.
The first principle was that the draft directive had a scope that should not, above all, be extended, in particular so as not to reopen the debate on embryonic stem cell research, or even on voluntary abortion.
The second principle: although, of course, there have to be strict ethical rules, there should not be any religious or sectarian bans of whatever origin.
The third principle: the human body is not for sale, not to be bought and not to be stolen.
At the time, the European Parliament broadly followed these principles when voting, thus leaving authors of amendments that could be described as reactionary in the objective sense of the word in the minority.
During the preparation for the second reading, the rapporteur, MrÂ Liese, true to his ideas and as pugnacious as ever, once again tried to extend the scope of the draft directive to reopen other debates and perhaps, one day, win the battle that he has regularly lost since the adoption of the sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development.
I was therefore getting ready, this evening, for a new attack on behalf of a large majority of our fellow citizens, on behalf of many researchers, on behalf of public health and, above all, on behalf of the patients who are waiting for treatments and for transplants.
Some amendments, which were, moreover, adopted in the committee, seemed to me in fact to be inappropriate, even dangerous.
I am glad to see that this eveningÂ âÂ and perhaps this is a Christmas presentÂ âÂ the rapporteur is tabling 21 more or less satisfactory compromise amendments.
Fortunately they clarify some provisions of the text.
They clearly set down principles to which we attach importance: that donations are made voluntarily and without payment, although compensation is possible; Member States guarantee these donations; respect for anonymity is confirmed, with the exception of what is stated in ArticlesÂ 8 and 16 which leave the matter to Member Statesâ legislation on the basis of subsidiarity; traceability was officially sanctioned and validated.
I particularly welcome the removal of two amendments: 35, which related to abortion, and 38, which did not distinguish between therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning.
As a result, on behalf of my group, I can support the 21 compromise amendments with the Council, accompanied moreover, by some assessments of their legality, which I heard from CommissionerÂ Byrne, and I am glad that common sense largely prevailed.
I too would, therefore, like to thank the rapporteur MrÂ Liese, since once is not the norm here, who undoubtedly played a very positive role in drafting these compromise amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, I commend Mr Liese for his dedicated work on this very sensitive and technical subject.
Tomorrow we will vote on a compromise package of 21 amendments.
The fact that an agreement was struck between Parliament and the Council is, in no small measure, due to the unstinting efforts of the rapporteur, who made every effort to keep all the political groups on side and who vigorously defended the views of Parliament with the other institutions.
The common position was totally unacceptable from Parliament's point of view.
The Council gave scant regard to over 50 amendments adopted by this House in the first reading.
The final deal before us this week is far more reflective of the reality of the Council and Parliament being equal legislators in this area.
Through our perseverance Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal.
As far as ethical principles are concerned, I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary unpaid donations of cells and tissues.
I am also very pleased with the new wording in relation to the protection of the anonymity of the donor.
The wording is now clearer in terms of many crucial aspects: the basic principle that human body parts, be they tissues or cells, must not be treated like some commercially tradable product.
As regards organs, Parliament has accepted that this directive is not the appropriate place in which to deal with organ transplants.
Nevertheless, we look forward to a proposal from the Commission on the subject, which is of great importance.
Regarding the issue of cloning, I would have been happier with the original Amendment No 38, but there are sufficient safeguards included in this compromise.
Member States have an explicit right to put stringent public health rules in place, including a total exclusion of cloned human material or human animal hybrids, as transplantable material.
Apart from the clear health risks involved in transplanting cloned material when so much is unknown about the future consequences, I oppose the creation of human life as raw material for tissues and cells.
I believe this to be a serious violation of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning and is committed to a universal ban on human cloning.
In conclusion, my Group supports the compromise and tabled the full set of amendments involved.
This is an important directive that will, I am sure, be a vital contribution to public health in the European Union by ensuring a high quality of tissues and cells for transplantation, while at the same time respecting fundamental ethical considerations.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is unfortunate that nearly all of Parliamentâs amendments have been dropped from the common position adopting the directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.
Important points, such as unpaid and voluntary donations, reference to fundamental ethical principles and the request for a directive applying also to organs, have been brushed off the table.
This is why we have supported the re-submission of these amendments at second reading.
In order to avoid a stalemate between Parliament and the Council, with a long conciliation procedure to follow, the rapporteur has pulled out all the stops to look for compromises, and, thanks to his considerable efforts, there is now a package of compromise amendments before us.
Most of these compromises receive our support, even though not everything is exactly as we would like it, but that is one of the essential characteristics of a compromise.
The compromise on unpaid donations causes us a dilemma.
Amendment No 31, which clearly states that Member States shall ensure voluntary and unpaid donations, is being traded for a text which states that Member States shall take the necessary measures to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations.
Paid or involuntary donations within the European Union should be rejected unequivocally.
Quite apart from the fact that this should be considered unethical, it can also present risks to public health.
The inclusion of the recital is merely a pretext.
All things considered, we will support the compromise package, but with precious little enthusiasm.
The statement that Commissioner Byrne made a moment ago about a directive for organ transplantation only partly meets this Houseâs wishes as expressed at first reading.
Nevertheless, I should like to thank him for this, because this has made it clear that this is an area to which priority should be given.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a very sensitive issue and Mr Liese and I have crossed swords on it, which is sad because we belong to the same Group.
Nevertheless, we are both sincere in our views, opposing though they may be.
As Mr Bowe said, this is a very good and much-needed proposal and I welcome it.
I also welcome the way in which Mr Liese has been flexible - finally - about the amendments and we now have a chance of getting this legislation on to the statute book as soon as possible.
However, this issue of tissues and cells and how we deal with it has raised an interesting question about subsidiarity.
One of the reasons why I have been so stirred up about all this is that I have been on the receiving end of a large number of letters from people in my own country who suffer from Parkinson's Disease, chronic heart disease or diabetes, or from their carers in the case of Alzheimer's Disease.
People who suffer from these diseases have a life sentence: they do not die, they stay alive and their condition degenerates.
They know it is degenerating and they know that research that might help them is being carried on, often involving stem cells.
It is their only ray of hope.
Let me quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Cornwall.
Mr Alan Cole from Liskeard suffers from Parkinson's Disease.
He states: 'Rightly or wrongly, each day I listen to the TV or radio hoping to hear that a cure for Parkinson's Disease is on the way.
I then become aware of stem cell research and how this might lead to a breakthrough for sufferers like me.
A ray of hope - albeit a long way off - could be my miracle.
I then discover that people are opposed to this type of research.
Who are these people?
They cannot possibly suffer with Parkinson's Disease or any other disability.'
Who are these people?
Well, they are here, sitting in the rather remote European Parliament.
The decision of whether or not stem cell research should go forward and the kind of research which Mr Liese was dealing with in his report would be much better dealt with in the national context than in some rather remote European one.
I would also point out that one of the ironies of the situation is that those who suffer from Parkinson's Disease in countries which do not allow this research to be done with stem cells may well benefit from research being done in countries where it is allowed and may, in the end, be very grateful for it.
The other issue that came up between us was the question of the payment of donors.
There is a particular situation in the United Kingdom regarding the payment of donors.
We need to have subsidiarity here so that some countries may go ahead and continue to pay them.
We now have a compromise.
Mr Blokland has rightly observed that it is a bit of a fudge.
However, the text as agreed in Amendment No 69 is an acceptable compromise.
That is the way forward.
I regret that we have given the impression in this Parliament that we are against stem cell research.
In fact we voted for stem cell research to be financed from the EU budget at the last part-session.
That has now being reversed by the Council of Ministers.
Let us show that in this debate we are very much in favour of a sensible proposal from the Commission on the safety of tissues and cells and we can all agree, including Mr Liese and myself, in wishing this proposal well.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this is the second reading of a very important legislative measure on specifications for the quality and safety of human tissues and cells for use in transplants, the priority objective of which is to provide a very high level of protection for human health.
It is a fact that tissues and cells help on a daily basis to restore health, which is why we need to lay down a specific European framework which will guarantee supply and sufficiency and, at the same time, safeguard the physical integrity of those who receive them, of the recipients.
The demand for tissues and cells in Europe is far greater than the supply; thus the imports necessarily being made from third countries must respect the same legislative framework, because this is the only way to prevent the illegal trade.
As regards the codes of conduct with which we are so preoccupied, everyone agrees that the new technologies must respect human dignity and the non-commercialisation of the human body.
At the same time, human tissue and cell donations must be based on the free will of the donor, not the fee.
The human body, as has been emphasised on numerous occasions, is inviolable and inalienable and must not therefore be turned into a source of financial gain.
The compromise reached during negotiations satisfactorily covers the above principles.
The addendum, whereby donors may receive compensation which is severely restricted to compensating the expenses and procedure connected with the donation, does not violate the principle of voluntary donation and allows the Member States to lay down the preconditions under which compensation may be granted.
It is also a good thing that under this directive, as with blood, the data needed to ensure traceability at all stages are kept for at least thirty years after clinical use.
Full and in-depth information for the donor, from a trained person, on the purpose, nature, consequences and risks involved in the donation is a necessary precondition to free consent.
Protection of the donor's details and medical secrecy are, I think, satisfactorily protected by the corresponding points in the annex.
I should like to mention that, even if the package of compromise amendments does not include other important points approved by the relevant committee of the European Union, I shall ultimately agree, considering that the priority is to get the present directive applied as quickly as possible.
Of course we are waiting directly for the Commission proposal on the preconditions for organ transplants, as you yourself promised us Commissioner.
Allow me to conclude by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Peter Liese, on his work and on the huge effort which he made for the procedure to be concluded as quickly as possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, the global agreement put forward today by the rapporteur is a good compromise, which takes on board the key European Parliament amendments while still being in line with the Commission proposal on the essential questions.
It is good news for patients that we will soon have Community legislation on tissues and cells.
It also achieves an optimum solution for the updating of technical standards, maintaining all the political issues under the codecision procedure, while leaving the technical details for comitology.
I note that many of you, including Dr Liese, are not entirely satisfied that the Commission has not offered to go further on the so-called ethical issues.
This is not because we do not consider ethical standards to be important.
Quite the contrary: it is precisely because ethical standards are so important to our citizens that we must not overstep the mark.
I refer to what Mrs Jackson said in relation to subsidiarity, with which I agree.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty.
We have to respect the advice of our Legal Service â advice echoed by the Legal Service of the Council.
A satisfactory compromise is proposed today on voluntary and unpaid donation and the non-profit character of the procurement of tissues and cells as such, which reflects the goodwill on all sides.
A series of amendments aims to limit the use of certain types of cells, such as cells derived from cloning or abortion.
With this proposal we seek neither to mandate nor to prohibit the use of specific types of cells.
If, however, any particular use of such cells is authorised in a Member State, then the directive will apply, to require the application of all provisions necessary to protect public health.
The quality and safety of organs is a major concern of the European Parliament.
The Commission is acutely aware of the importance of this matter and we have taken concrete steps to address this issue.
The Commission statement on organs proposed as part of this compromise is a real commitment to continue work in this area and to find the best approach to the current situation, which is characterised by a shortage of organs.
As I have already said, any approach needs to balance two factors: the need for the transplantation of organs - which is usually a matter of life or death - and the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety of such organs.
The Commission statement is complemented by the Council statement that it intends to intensify efforts to combat organ trafficking.
In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to accept the compromise package on the table today.
I thank you all once again for your strenuous efforts on this dossier.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0469/2003) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on takeover bids (COM(2002) 534 â C5-0481/2002 â 2002/0240(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, last October, I presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market the new Commission proposal for a takeover bids directive.
That proposal was aimed primarily at meeting the Parliament's criticism that the earlier proposal had not gone far enough in establishing a level playing field.
That proposal has been discussed and amended by Member States and, on 27 November 2003, the Competitiveness Council adopted a general orientation on a compromise text presented by the Italian presidency.
On the same day, Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted Mr Lehne's report, based on the same compromise text.
At this point, I would like to express my surprise about all the changes in this report between the vote of the Legal Affairs Committee and the plenary session.
The proposal now on the table is based on the text, dated 7 May 2003, that was worked on during the Greek presidency including multiple voting rights in the scope of the breakthrough and draws on the suggestion put forward by the Portuguese delegation to introduce options for Member States and for companies in the application of Articles 9 and 11.
I can only repeat here what I already said in the Council.
Articles 9 and 11 are crucial elements of this proposal.
Article 9 contains the basic principle that the board of an offeree company may only take defensive measures after prior consultation of the general meeting of shareholders.
Article 11 makes it possible for an offeror who has acquired 75% of the capital to break through certain defensive mechanisms set up by the offeree company.
I indicated quite clearly during the discussions that I would not accept as a compromise the deletion of those Articles.
Nor can I accept an arrangement whereby those Articles are to be made optional.
That will not achieve the harmonisation that the Commission intended when it tabled this proposal.
Moreover, it goes back on the level of harmonisation that we agreed last time, before Parliament objected to the first proposal on the grounds that it did not go far enough in establishing a level playing field.
At the moment no level playing field whatsoever is established.
Therefore, you will not be surprised that I cannot accept Amendment 5 or Amendment 21, which introduce these optional arrangements.
I have some difficulties as well with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning 'special rights'.
This confuses rights in private law and those in public law, which are not covered by the directive.
I know that time is running out and that we have already spent a great deal of time discussing this proposal.
However, I do not think that we are sending the right message to the markets by adopting the proposal in its current form.
Is it really a worthwhile contribution to our project which seeks to build the most competitive market in the world by 2010?
I sincerely hope that we can do better, even if we need more time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directiveâs story is never-ending; Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been discussing this issue for well over 15 years.
Right now, I have no desire to go through everything that has happened in relation to it in the past.
I share the Commissionerâs view that something more would have been desirable.
I still believe that a better solution was represented by the joint initiative that we set in motion during the Greek Presidency of the Council with the aim of finding an overall solution that would create truly uniform conditions of competition in Europe.
As tends to be the case with political change, we ended up having to make compromises, and the best is the enemy of the good.
What we have before us is what was negotiated with the Italian Presidency and unanimously adopted in the Council as part of a political agreement and, in essence, the same as what was adopted by this Houseâs Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
It is a compromise with which all parties can live under the prevailing circumstances, and that in itself shows that it is a good one.
We will achieve the goals of which the Commissioner spoke, but, for now, they do no more than indicate what is currently achievable in terms of European law.
The rest we can leave to the markets.
We have been given an objective to aim at, but, according to this proposal, it will ultimately be the markets that decide whether or not what is proposed is right, and in which direction things will change.
Having had in-depth discussions with the various Council Presidencies â starting with the Danes, then with the Greeks, and now with the Italians â we now have the opportunity of wrapping up this issue once and for all.
The Italian Presidency of the Council has offered us the possibility of completing this procedure in one reading, and, as we are in any case approaching the end of this Parliament, I believe that we should make use of this opportunity.
Over recent months, the rapporteur and the committees were kept fully and regularly informed of the progress of the deliberations.
People from all quarters of this House were involved.
I therefore ask you to vote in favour of the Commission proposal.
I cannot but note with regret that a number of groups have submitted amendments aimed in particular at further extending the rights of workers.
It is with reference to them that I wish to make it clear that this compromise already includes workersâ rights; it is explicitly laid down in the compromise reached on Article 9, that the workersâ representatives have to be informed and that they can make a statement, which, together with the boardâs statement, must be made available to the shareholders and to the public.
By way of a compromise, Article 13 ensures that all existing rights of workers to participation and co-determination â be they put in place by the nation states or by Europe â are retained and remain unaffected by this directive.
Here too, I think, one must be amenable to compromise.
Rather than constantly wanting to enforce pure doctrine, one must at some point reach a compromise.
There is something positively paradoxical about a situation in which it is the Socialist governments in the Council that want to prevent workers gaining more rights â the examples I would give are the Swedes and the British Labour Government â while, here in this House, the Left, led by the Socialists, who are willing to let these directives and this proposal fail, even though their own governments, at Council level, are blocking these compromises that go even further.
This compromise will, in my view, provide adequate protection for workersâ rights.
There is no reason to go further.
I would therefore ask you to reject these amendments, for, if you do not â for so we have been told in unambiguous terms by the Council â the whole of the compromise that has been achieved will be in jeopardy.
If we approve this directive, this compromise, we will be demonstrating the European Unionâs capacity to act in difficult times.
It is for that reason that I ask you to vote in favour.
We could now bring this never-ending story to a close.
I want especially to thank all the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups.
I want to make especial mention, by name, of Mr Huhne, with whom I have enjoyed the closest possible cooperation.
We have run the Rule 162a â enhanced cooperation â procedure very well and have achieved a good result.
What I ask this House to do is to bring this never-ending story to a full stop by voting in favour and letting the end of this year be marked by a real success for the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am not going to make any great claims for this draft directive.
I fully sympathise with what the Commissioner has said and those who argue that it will not create a level playing field in cross-border takeovers in the Union.
There is no doubt about that.
Member States will still be able to sanction their companies to take anti-bid measures with the approval of only the board and not of the shareholders.
Therefore, it fails to deal with a major potential obstacle to cross-border takeovers and restructuring.
The choice of whether to apply the rules is only a fig leaf to disguise that reality.
Many Member States, including some like Germany who proclaim themselves in favour of more political integration, are against foreigners taking over their own companies.
In Britain we have many hang-ups but, fortunately, not that one.
We have been losing foreign direct investment due to our failure to join the euro, but the signal that this part of the directive sends out about France and Germany may help to sustain Britain's share.
For the euro area in particular this failure is a serious own goal.
Why then is this draft worth supporting?
The provisions in this text to protect minority shareholders are important and will encourage more cross-border portfolio share ownership.
By ensuring that there is a threshold in each Member State at which someone taking control of a company has to launch a full bid for the other shares, this directive stops creeping control of a company.
It therefore means that a new shareholder with perhaps only 30% of the stock cannot decide, without providing an exit for all the other shareholders, to pay themselves special dividends or to sell off assets cheaply to another private company that they happen to control.
By reassuring investors about those practices, by no means unknown in many Union financial markets, the directive will encourage more cross-border share ownership.
That is crucial to the efficiency and returns on pension funds, for the support of the retired and for insurance funds for the compensation of the distressed.
Overall, however, this is clearly a modest measure.
It does no harm, it does some good.
It sends the wrong signals but, in reality, it changes too little; it does not change anything in the reverse direction.
Certainly calling it a takeover directive is a misnomer and would probably be a breach of the United Kingdom's Trades Descriptions Act.
But all that is politically attainable at present.
For those who would like to see more radical opening-up of cross-border mergers, there is also the promise of a clearer view in the next Parliament and the prospect that the markets themselves can add to the pressures on companies to apply best practice in consulting their shareholders.
Transparency in this matter, as in others, may help, and we must not let the best be the enemy of the good.
Let me finally reiterate something on the debate with the Socialist Group on employee consultation.
Mr Lehne, to whom I would like to pay tribute, has certainly worked very hard, as I did, on a text that would have satisfied the PSE Group, even though the position on takeovers, as we have seen, is effectively unchanged.
Takeovers will not be made any easier but, nevertheless, the PSE Group wanted a form of words to provide some political concession, as if they were being made easier.
In reality, that form of words in their amendments merely echoes what is already in the information and consultation directive.
It provides employees with nothing new, but potential differences in the legal text between this draft directive if it is voted and that one could mean a risk of litigation over takeovers if it is voted through.
For that reason, we should vote against these amendments and support what is, I agree, a flawed and partial compromise, but, nevertheless, one which makes some progress.
Â Â  . â Mr President, a year ago, in the spirit of Christmas, I prepared an opinion for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which was adopted in February 2003.
This has been somewhat overlooked in the whole debate, although we have already heard about the latest developments.
I should like to remind you that the lack of arrangements for employees' information and consultation was one of the main reasons for rejecting the previous proposal for a directive on takeover bids in 2001.
The Commission acknowledged that, to a certain extent, in providing us with Article 13, but our Employment and Social Affairs Committee was almost unanimous in its opinion that it was not enough.
The Commission refers only to national Member States' practices and the Employment Committee's opinion explicitly makes information and consultation a mandatory part of takeover bid procedure, both for the companies making the bids â Article 6 â and the target companies â in Article 9.
The PSE Group is still of that opinion, and over the last month I have prepared a text which is adapted to the situations in different Member States.
This was a big concession to the United Kingdom, whose standards for takeover bids differ from those in the continental Member States.
We also adapted the text to bring it into line with the provisions of the directive on the information and consultation of workers.
That is why the references are there.
So there is no real problem as regards differences of opinion.
The only thing is that the main Articles of the directive should explicitly mention information and consultation.
My Group wishes to stress that this should be a normal part of the procedure.
That is made clear by three amendments that have now been re-tabled: Amendments Nos 35, 36 and 37, and by other amendments that have been tabled by the Verts/ALE and GUE/NGL Groups.
Mr Lehne, Mr Huhne and I had a compromise on this, but between Monday 24 November when these three amendments were adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Thursday 27 November, before the Council took its position, they left the deal and voted against the three amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That is why that compromise is not in there now.
Mr Lehne's argument that it would have complicated the decision-making process is not convincing.
The only reason he does not want this to be included is that he wants to press for a first-reading agreement, but in our opinion this takes away Parliament's right to have any input in the discussion.
It is still early enough in the negotiations to make this input.
The Italian presidency did discuss this seriously enough with the Council: there is still a chance to do so.
Our Group is ready to support the compromise, although we are not very enthusiastic about it.
Our original position was to make a directive without Articles 9 and 11 protecting minority shareholders' rights.
But we only want to support it if these three amendments are adopted.
If that is not the case we will vote against the compromise package.
Â Â  . Mr President, perhaps I can reassure Mrs van den Burg that the concerns of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were rather carried over into the debate on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and indeed a number of the amendments that were adopted by us in our opinion at first reading were, in my view as draftsman, more appropriate to your committee.
Nevertheless, the opinion that we put forward reflected the concerns of a majority of our members and those concerns were particularly directed at the need for, and importance of, employee information and consultation.
A number of amendments concerned informing the employees of the target or offeree company, and another amendment concerned the importance of consulting the employees of the offeror or predatory company.
The second area of concern to us, where we were in line with a number of other committees, is the issue of jurisdiction.
We felt it very important that jurisdiction should be in the Member State of the offeree company to avoid any ambiguity or confusion.
We also put forward an amendment covering the issue of jurisdiction on bids originating from companies in countries outside the European Union â third countries â and the need for those to be subject to national authorisation within.
A third area of concern which was addressed in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was that of the Scandinavian countries in particular over multiple classes of shares.
Those were the three points that our committee was concerned about.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, MrÂ Klaus-Heiner Lehne: the affair of the takeover bids directive really does seem to be never-ending.
Starting life in January 1989 with the first Commission proposal, a proposal that was, moreover, ambitious, pursuing the objective of achieving a single market in corporate control, the progress of the takeover bids directive through the legislative process seems to have been a kind of obstacle course, with texts alternating between maximalist proposals unacceptable to someÂ âÂ the individual States and the Council of MinistersÂ âÂ and minimalist compromises unacceptable to othersÂ âÂ the European Parliament.
Of this obstacle course, I remember that the European Parliament rejected a Conciliation Committee joint text on 4 July 2001I also remember the extremely interesting Commission proposal of October 2002, drawn up after a group of high-level experts had been consulted.
This proposal, in addition to preserving the passivity rule in Article 9, sought to achieve the objectives set by the European Parliament and the wise men consulted, the neutralisation of some pre-bid defensive measures and proportionality between risk capital and voting rights, while I am afraid the very points that we might call most dangerous such as large corporations and multiple voting rights were excluded.
Another obstacle course has started, with regard to which we thought that the intuition of the Council Presidency in June 2002 provided a way out: giving the Member States and quoted companies respectively the possibility of choosing between the directiveâs model with the passivity rule and the neutralisation of defensive measuresÂ -Â type A companiesÂ -Â or preservation of defensive measuresÂ -Â type B companiesÂ -Â all supplemented by a requirement of maximum transparency in a system to which a company is subject.
To put all the operators on a level playing field, provision is made for type A companies to decide not to let themselves be taken over by a type B company. The solution has many advantages: it shows which is the ideal solution â type A, the benchmark â and creates reciprocity.
Moreover, the neutralisation of defensive measures requires an initial uniform rule of European company law: Article 11, which provides for the options, is essentially a derogation from the usual system.
These options can be withdrawn once the market, favouring type A companies, has created the right conditions.
There is more.
With the current system, quoted companies subject to systems which do not provide for passivity rules or neutralisation can opt for competitiveness, which would not be possible without the directive.
Moreover, the maximum transparency of company systemsand internal rules required by both Article 10 of the proposal for a directive and the parallel proposal for a directive on the transparency of quoted companiesÂ -Â which is also currently being debated in Parliament and the CouncilÂ -Â ensures that companies which fully accept Articles 9 and 11, the stars, are the true European companies and clearly identifiable as such.
In this way, it is made possible for the market to reward them.
Indeed, institutional investors should explain to their clients why they are investing in non-competitive, type B companies rather than in a competitive, type A company.
Lastly, the compromise, providing for preventive partial takeover bids, allows many countries not to make substantial changes to their legislation, while, at the same time, it does not riskexposing companies to unfair competition from companies in other countries.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please believe me when I say that I am not particularly interested in stirring up past issues.
If I am doing so, however, it is also the case that, when it appears that a high degree of consensus has been reached on certain issues, it is good to consider what has happened, at least so that, if not in this case, then certainly in the future, we can draw conclusions on how parliamentary tasks are carried out within the codecision procedure.
I am therefore going to focus exclusively on two aspects of the first occasion on which â as all the honourable Members will remember â during this legislature, Parliament did not approve the text of the Conciliation Committee, which was basically in line with the text of the common position.
The first of these aspects will allow me to remind the honourable Members of the different formulae which were considered on the initiative of the European Parliament in terms of regulating administration bodiesâ neutrality obligation and comparing them â where appropriate â with the formulae now being presented.
And in view of this comparison I do not believe that what we are going to approve today improves on what on that previous occasion had been proposed, at least by the European Parliament.
Because at that time this House proposed maintaining the administration bodiesâ neutrality obligation â which is positive â although, simply for certain cases in which it is not possible for the board of directors to meet, it proposed certain formulae, which were not accepted by the Council or by the Commission.
What is happening now?
Well it has only been possible to reach a consensus by greatly reducing the Commissionâs initial proposals. Ultimately, by not regulating the section relating to the neutrality obligation and consequently allowing the legislations of the Member States to regulate, by means of handy subsidiarity, issues relating to the prohibition or non-prohibition of defensive measures.
I do not believe that this is a good formula for legislation.
I believe that, if certain proposals presented by Parliament had been approved at that time, we would have had more suitable legislation.
The second aspect â which has been mentioned by my colleague, Mrs van den Burg â relates to the chapter on information and consultation for workers.
I would like to point out that, on that occasion, a large majority of Members of Parliament approved rights to information and consultation for workers which were shared by the immense majority of these Members.
Some people pointed out on that occasion that there had been an alliance between certain conservative sectors and the Socialists, as a result of which the former had obtained flexible treatment for the prohibition of defensive measures, while the latter obtained broad recognition of the participation of workers.
At that time it was also proposed that we Socialists should break the pact and vote in favour of the proposals in the common position in exchange for recognising the workersâ right to information.
Well, on that occasion we did not do so, but â as Mrs van den Burg has said â if this aspect is not recognised and if the relevant amendments are not approved we will be obliged to vote against.
Â Â  â Mr President, the proposal for a directive that is currently before us is a muchâwatered-down version of what Parliament undermined eighteen months ago, unfortunately only by one vote.
The current proposal leaves a great deal of scope for Member States and companies themselves, such as a company's optional, or even temporary, permission to take defensive mechanisms when it is faced with what it views as a hostile takeover bid.
The question can therefore be posed whether takeovers are still to be possible at European level and whether this directive will, in practice, make any actual change to the current situation.
Nevertheless, I think that we should approve this proposal, even if it were to finally end the discussion in the European Union about takeover bids â which has been going on for thirteen years now â and set up a first, albeit hesitant, regulation.
According to a Flemish saying, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
The takeover directive is indeed an important component of the Lisbon agenda on a strong, competitive European Union and is essential to the further completion of the European internal market.
We should therefore ensure that this directive enters into force as soon as possible, so that we, along with the market operators, can immediately learn whether, and how, we can give this regulation more depth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when, for the first time, I became involved in discussing this issue a couple of years ago, I was very surprised that only different forms of shareholder interests were discussed: the German tradition as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon tradition and so forth.
Eventually, the matter went back to the Commission, which has had ample time available to it, and it might therefore have been thought that the proposal had been developed.
Now, a compromise is being presented between different owner constructions and owner interests, but still no concern is being shown for the employees.
I think that is incredibly strange.
It must be obvious that the employees, just like the shareholders, are interested parties in takeover situations, and it is unrealistic to ignore the fact.
In a way, the employees are perhaps interested parties to an even greater degree than the shareholders, because hostile takeover bids are almost always combined with plans for restructuring and, perhaps, cut-backs.
In other contexts, we talk solemnly about the social dialogue in the European employment strategy as progress in EU policy.
We talk about the Lisbon strategy in which the two sides of industry and the social dialogue are also important.
In the present context, all this is conspicuous by its absence, and the old idea still prevails that companies only belong to their owners and that, in general, the employees are no more important than machines or other loose fittings.
It is an old-fashioned, unrealistic and out-of-date idea.
There can be no legislation on takeover bids that is not in some way grounded in the fact that a company is also its employees.
That is absolutely fundamental.
We shall of course support the amendments concerning improved information and consultation.
Information is, of course, important, but I want at the same time to say that it is not enough.
It must be possible, in one way or another, to use information for something.
There must be certain rights.
The employees must have certain opportunities to act in situations such as these.
If the matter were now to go back to the Commission, I should like to give MrÂ Bolkestein a piece of advice.
I think that the offeror should also be required to present an adjustment plan for the new company that is coming into being.
A development and adjustment programme of this kind should also take account of the employeesâ interests and talk about what will happen to them.
There should also be a guarantee against at least short-term dismissal.
Â Â  Mr President, you will no doubt recall as vividly as I do the late nights in Luxembourg in June 2001 when we last went through this exercise, followed by the heated third-reading debate in this House shortly thereafter, which was lost by a tie.
It is worth reminding ourselves that although technically we are now at first reading, this is in fact a fourth reading, even just for those of us who have participated in the present Parliament.
We have been through this a long way and I myself am one of those who think that if we can bring it to a successful conclusion this time, then we should do so.
I take the point made by Mr Huhne and Mr Bolkestein that there are further problems we did not have before.
It is perhaps a little like the story of the Sybilline Books.
The first time they were offered as a set of 12 and Tarquin refused them.
Three of them were then burned and they were offered as a set of nine at a higher price: each time the price goes up and the quality goes down.
Maybe that is so, or maybe not, but we are now in a position where we have to make up our minds.
My Group is firmly of the conviction that we must take full and proper account of employees' rights in this context.
Employees are not just pawns on the chess board.
Employees are the people who make companies work and make them function effectively.
Their interests have to be taken fairly and fully into account.
Their right to consultation and information has to be taken seriously.
On that account, my Group will certainly vote for the sets of amendments agreed between us, the GUE/NGL Group and the PSE Group when the vote is held tomorrow.
Thereafter we are of two minds: some of us are firmly of the view that we should adhere to this to the last, and that if they are not carried then we will vote against the directive in its present form.
If that means the compromise collapses then it will simply have to go to second reading, and so on.
Others - and I am one of those others - think that the time has come to reach a conclusion.
I shall vote for these amendments, but at the end of the day I shall try to get this through at this reading.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a short while ago the issue of takeover bids at European level showed, with some degree of sensation, two of the main problems of European integration.
First of all, the blind submission of the Commission in Brussels to the demands of the financial markets to the detriment, most of the time, of the European Unionâs economic, industrial and even financial interests.
The Commission became renowned in many ways, last year, for this waywardness.
Then, the dominant position granted to Germany in this Parliament, of which we have been able to measure the effectiveness, since the whole of the German representation voted along the same lines.
As the much loved saying goes, you should choose the lesser of two evils.
Subject to Member Statesâ law being preserved, in particular by ArticleÂ 5, we will vote in favour of the new draft regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, I think I can say, in line with the opinions expressed by Commissioner Bolkestein, that we have lost yet another opportunity to modernise the capital market, first and foremost through rules which can ensure greater competitiveness of European companies and thus more effective protection of shareholders.
We need to understand each other: I believe that calling this a takeover bids directiveÂ âÂ as Mr Huhne said earlierÂ -Â is an exaggeration.
What we are doing here is acknowledging that there are different regulations and guaranteeing to the different countries that they can maintain protectionist legislation with regard to their companies, their national public or private market leaders.
I believe that we needed to go much further, to decide whether to aim at an integrated, effective, competitive European capital market which would provide fresh opportunities for growth for the European Union, not least in the field of employment, or not to take this so-called âriskâ and remain in our current situation.
The rules, as proposed by the Council, eliminate very few of the obstacles that some Statesâ rules place in the way of companiesâ competitiveness, with the result that I am sad to say that hostile bidsÂ âÂ as are the norm in a mature financial market, in which capital is moved where there are thought to be efficiency margins to recover, in the interests of the companies and the workers of those companies and of other companies, in the interests of the consumers of products, goods or servicesÂ âÂ become impossible.
There is also the risk that this crystallisation of the current situation will take us a step backwards.
In Italy, where the current legislationÂ âÂ the Draghi lawÂ âÂ is extremely open and effective from this point of view, we are already being asked to take a step backwards, and I would point out that we are not going so far in Europe in opening up to the competitiveness of companies.
I hope that, should this measureÂ âÂ which is not, I repeat, a takeover bids directiveÂ âÂ be adopted tomorrow by Parliament too, it will generate genuine competition between legal systems and ensure that those systems in which takeover bids are penalised and obstructed pay the price for it through having their international investors âvote with their feetâ.
There are very few positive elements: recognition of the protection of the rights of minorities and the sunset clauseÂ -Â the idea that the debate on the issue can be reopened.
Maybe for this reason alone, it is worth adopting this measure, which is not a European law on takeover bids.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that employment in Europe, the interests of workers and the unemployed, are to be protected by effective capital markets too.
At the moment, we do not have them, and I do not believe that this directive will create the necessary conditions either.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is not often that this Chamber witnesses real political drama.
However, it did so on that day some two-and-a-half years ago when Parliament rejected the takeover directive.
Nothing I have seen or heard since then has made me change my mind that what we did was not only wrong but also foolish.
In an increasingly interdependent world, where the globe's economy is seamlessly linking together, the single greatest economic challenge we face in Europe â a challenge which we lose at our peril - is global competitiveness.
We all know that we are very good at talking about it and we are equally bad at doing anything material to address the problem.
Furthermore, whenever Europe has to face up eyeball to eyeball to the challenges posed by competitiveness, we funk it.
We funked it that day two-and-a-half years ago, and we have regularly funked it since.
We always use special pleading about the minutiae as an intellectual fig leaf to avoid the tough decisions.
It must be said that it is all pretty transparent.
To set the picture straight: I may be a British Conservative, but I am not the contemporary equivalent of the hard-faced men who made money out of the war.
I am no Thatcherite â never have been â and I am not a Eurosceptic, but I think â some consider this to be an eccentric point of view â that we should deal with the world as it is and not the world as we would like it to be.
If Europe is to deliver for its citizens â and it has to â our economy has to be competitive.
Part of that state of competitiveness is to have a system of company law and capital markets that enables it to compete.
It does not now, and that problem has to be dealt with.
The proposals we are debating this afternoon are a miserable, insufficient response to today's world.
However, we have to start from where we are.
I hope Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to confirm that in the event of this proposal becoming law further proposals will follow this one, taking the matter forward â and rather more quickly than this one has been taken because, if it is not taken more quickly, if I am lucky I will be drawing my pension and if I am unlucky I shall be dead.
Nevertheless, it is a single, wretched, shuffling step on the journey that Europe has to take.
There is no choice.
It is for that reason we shall support it as long as Mr Lehne's proposals are not amended or watered down.
On balance â just â it is worse to reject it than to support it and for a Conservative that is a good enough reason to vote for it.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
I honestly did not know that there were 275 German MEPs in this House.
That is how many Members rejected the results of the first conciliation procedure.
Ladies and gentlemen, when we consider Europe as a social community and as an example to others, workersâ rights have an important part to play.
It was because they were not sufficiently taken into account that the first takeover directive failed in this House, when the plenary rejected as inadequate what had come out of the conciliation as having been agreed with the Council.
It was clear to us that decisions concerning an enterpriseâs continued existence could not be left to the shareholders alone, but that the people who were employed by it had, at the very outset, to be informed and enabled to influence events.
After all, when an enterprise is taken over, it is not just power and a great deal of money that are at stake, but also the fate of many people.
Issues of the enterpriseâs location and the security of jobs are also involved.
That is why the people affected must be asked their opinion and involved in what happens.
Today sees us making a new start on the takeover directive, and the rapporteur would like us to be able to manage with just one reading.
At an early stage, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have promised him our support, albeit subject to the condition that a satisfactory solution must be found to the issue of workersâ rights.
He has promised that it will be, but I â like everyone else who thought there would be a good solution â am surprised to find a takeover directive that is not one whit better than the first one.
Faced with such an impertinence, we will not be waving this directive through into a fast-track procedure until the workersâ rights issue has been sorted out in a manner favourable to them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, if the EU is to become the worldâs most dynamic and competitive economy, the EUâs decision-makers must act consistently and quickly.
This could have been an important directive for creating better preconditions for growth and for promoting restructuring within Europeâs corporate structure.
It is the dynamic companies that can be restructured that create jobs.
Without jobs, Europe will not survive.
That is genuinely an issue in the employeesâ interests.
The expression âMuch ado about nothingâ is quite a good description of this controversial directive.
For fourteen years, we have tried to bring about these fair and common ground rules.
In fact, we have failed, but it is nonetheless a step in the right direction.
I personally have had some difficulty with this debate.
In principle, my view is that the differentiated voting right does not favour the emergence of efficient companies able to compete in a global market.
Over time, the various voting values tend to consolidate deficient corporate structures.
I also think there are important legal objections to retroactive legislation, and I can also see the point of entrepreneurs being able to go to the stock exchange to obtain extra capital for their lifeâs work without losing complete control of it.
In spite of this, it is incredibly important for us to obtain common corporate ground rules with a view to opening the European market to more liberal restructuring.
We must, however, be able to live with this compromise.
We could have obtained more, and more is what we wanted.
Now, this directive is more about openness and the protection of minority shareholders, and less about takeover rules.
It is, however, a step in the right direction, and I think we can support this compromise, even if it shows that it takes sixteen years for EU legislation to come into effect.
An initial 14 years and then a further two years before it is incorporated.
If we continue in this pattern, we shall never become dynamic and competitive.
Â Â  Mr President, we know that allowing companies to mount hostile takeover bids can jeopardise the right of States to maintain control over strategic businesses and decision-making bodies that are crucial to their development, specifically over companies that perform a public service.
Such takeover bids frequently result in lower value for shareholders in terms of loss of output and, even more seriously, in the destruction of jobs.
It is crucial that company workers and their representatives are, at all stages of the process, properly informed and consulted about the potential effects of a hostile takeover bid on employment and on company restructuring.
Unacceptably, no such guarantees are given.
The European Parliament must, therefore, approve the proposals for amendments intended to achieve this aim, although we must go further and ensure that workers and their representatives have mechanisms that enable them to obstruct a hostile takeover bid that will have potentially disastrous consequences for employment and for other rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Bolkestein, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a few observations.
Although we have known this for a while, it has just dawned on me that Mr Bolkestein is rejecting the defensive mechanisms that are now being proposed in the amendments and that are more or less optional in each country, resulting in the creation, as he intended, of a very watered-down version of the directive.
This also has some advantages for employees, for it means that, in some cases, these mechanisms will still give employees and employers themselves control over a few rights.
Irrespective of that, I am in any case pleased that the new directive now contains what we have decided on in the meantime, namely new guidelines on information and consultation in a number of cases, for which praise is due, for that was one of the stumbling blocks last time.
I should, however, like to add that we would actually want pro-active action to be taken in takeover bids that do not succeed â which is in about 50% of the cases.
This means that consultation must precede the bid, that consultation about this bid must take place before it is made public, and so on.
Mr Bolkestein, it is a matter of modern management, a matter of socially responsible management, that consultation should be further detailed in such a way as to entitle stakeholders, and not only shareholders, to consultation where necessary.
We have tabled those amendments to improve matters.
Although my group is divided on this, I think that the majority are behind our position.
We would like those amendments to be adopted; if they are not, we want to vote against the proposal.
The majority of the group are behind me on this.
It has been said that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
They can stay in the bush as far as I am concerned, and another way could then be found to make consultation more detailed.
Â Â  I would remind the honourable Members that with the new electronic system the red circle does not light up, so you do not need to make any effort or hit the microphone when beginning to speak.
No doubt, as a result of our past habits, we are all expecting to see the red light ...
Â Â  â Mr President, over the past few months, we have followed with great interest the developments surrounding the Directive on takeover bids.
At the start of the parliamentary discussion, it was already clear that only cooperation with the Council and the Commission could secure the proposal wide support.
Consequently, the proposed compromise receives our approval.
In particular, the recognition of employees' rights is a significant improvement on the original proposal.
Despite this, we are also considering giving our support to a few amendments underlining the involvement of employees.
Continuity and employment remain of major importance during takeovers.
We welcome the fact that the proposal no longer includes a ban on temporary defence mechanisms.
Countries such as the Netherlands and Germany were right to be completely opposed to this.
We are not convinced by the rapporteur's arguments against adopting the amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on employees' rights, and we would like to hear from Commissioner Bolkestein whether he will adopt it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, after fourteen years of negotiations to find a minimum agreement on mergers and acquisitions, the European institutions are still divided.
Parliament was in favour of harmonising the law.
As for the Commission, it advocated the principle of competition but deplored the dominant positions, which were the result of this policy.
The Council did not want to see the withdrawal of Member Statesâ means for intervening in the case of attempted hostile takeover bids for their large national companies.
For twenty years, Europe has indeed been systematically destroying the strategic actors that are the Nation States, and what is more without managing to replace them.
The directive proposes to protect the interests of minority shareholders and to keep employees informed.
In fact, it lifts the obstacles to our companies being taken over by interests outside Europe, to the extent that, in ArticleÂ 6 for example, it designates a single supervisory authority and prohibits authorities in Member States from giving their approval or demanding the addition of supplementary information.
Furthermore, this directive does not say anything at all about the specific control that the European Commission exercises over mergers that are likely to lead to misuse of a dominant position, control which, strangely enough, is still opposed to this type of merger when a European company has the dominant position, but much less so when a company from outside Europe has this position.
Our North American competitors do not allow themselves to be so easily deprived.
The Pechiney, CrÃ©dit Lyonnais and Vivendi Universal affairs, show this all to well.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the takeover bids directive is an essential legislative act for the creation of a genuine internal market in corporate control: a legislative act which can give a decisive boost to the virtuous circulation of capital in Europe.
Virtuous circulation means more productivity, more growth, more competitiveness andÂ -Â I am addressing the left-wing Members hereÂ -Â more employment.
After 14 years, we have, at last, reached our goal and it is a pity that the Commission is not taking up the positive aspects of the present compromise.
In recent months, there has been intense cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, and that is a positive result in itself.
Europe certainly needs positive results right now!
This is, of course, a compromise, the only compromise possible at the present time.
We would have liked more, especially my country, whose legislation on the matter is very advanced and open; we would have liked a directive creating a genuinely level playing field with the passivity rule and the total neutralisation of defensive measures.
We tried, but it was not possible because of the opposition of certain Member States which are now probably hiding behind so-called social amendments.
The compromise to be put to the vote tomorrow reflects the state of European capitalism, which is still a mixture of small-scale and large-scale capitalism.
However, it does provide proper protection of workersâ rights.
Hence the opt-in/opt-out system as regards the level playing field.
However, the undertaking is given to try again in a few years, with the useful sunset clause, when the time will be ripe because the financial markets will have favoured the companies which opt to be competitive.
All we will have to do then is delete Article 11 A, make a few cosmetic adjustments, and we will have a new directive ready for the future.
With this directive and the others which we are adopting in the framework of the Financial Services Action Plan, competitive companies, their governance and their balance sheets will be transparent.
