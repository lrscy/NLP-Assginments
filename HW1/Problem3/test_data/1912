I believe that this is currently the great challenge for the Commissioner and for Parliament.
I believe that the aid must be maintained, that we have to be imaginative and must ensure that the Funds continue to reach all the regions.
Otherwise, the differences will increase.
We must make an effort to ensure that the enlargement countries also become economic motors which will allow this policy of economic and social cohesion to eventually lead to a much more just and free Europe.
We have seen recent examples of the results of poverty and fanaticism.
Mr President, Commissioner, we in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have already told Mr Nogueira that we do not share his negative view - or at least his excessively critical view - of the application of economic and social cohesion.
I would even go as far as to say that that evaluation should be positive or even better, given how brilliant the results are.
We would like to make some very specific comments in relation to these two reports on the application of the Funds during the years in question.
It is the case that the information is good because, firstly, Parliament' s recommendations are complied with.
The balance between investments in railways and in road infrastructures, in terms of the environment, has moved into line with the parliamentary recommendation.
There is no report on fraud in the application of these Funds and another series of statistical criteria are correctly complied with.
But we are not the Court of Auditors.
What these reports lack is more of a qualitative character: we want to know what qualitative economic and political effect these investments are having; to what extent is the metabolism of these regions being changed; to what extent are the governments correctly applying the investments, directly towards productive investments, as the structural policy demands.
That is what is lacking in the reports on the application of the Cohesion Fund.
And this is true in all respects.
Next year we will have to examine the reports on the application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in 2000 and 2001.
The data will not be good, but I do not want to condemn it in advance because, if the Commission demonstrates that they have been well used in terms of programming, this will be a qualitative element which Parliament will have to take into account.
Mr President, Commissioner, this 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds may be the last one on the 1994-1999 programme, but it has many lessons to teach us.
First of all, we agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, says about the lack of a complete quantitative description or detailed explanations of these funds.
Europe must have a genuine return on the funding it grants in order, on the one hand, to monitor that the projects are effectively carried out and that public monies are being put to good use and, on the other hand, to optimise the new programmes.
Furthermore, the citizens of my region keep making the same criticisms: too complicated, too much red tape, too slow.
I think we do not give enough precedence to the small structural projects where simplicity and speed are of the essence if we want to respond to real needs on the ground.
I cannot help wondering about the contradiction between saying we want to give priority to employment, with reference in particular to the Lisbon European Council declarations, while at the same time paying so little attention to the small micro-enterprise and SME projects which, after all and as everyone knows, are the prime job creators.
It is vital that all of us, beginning with the Commission, try to work more closely with all our fellow-citizens.
In conclusion, I want to protest about a practice that I personally find unfair and unfounded.
What I mean is that the Commission could use a form of blackmail - and I am weighing my words here - by tying the funding to strict respect for the environmental obligations it lays down.
I entirely agree about the growing need to respect our environment, but I am equally against this kind of pseudo-ecological diktat.
I think that would be a real diversion of these funds which, let me remind you, are supposed to help finance job-creation and wealth-creation projects to combat the economic imbalances between the various European regions.
Since I know that economic cohesion remains unsatisfactory, let me end by asking what is really behind the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund policy: are these funds designed to be a means of applying pressure or are they designed to provide genuine economic assistance?
It is a question worth asking.
Mr President, I thank both Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n for their fine reports, as I thank all the speakers for their comments.
With regard to Mr Marques' report, relating to 1999, it did indeed arrive rather late, in January 2001.
I can tell the rapporteur that this was due to the problems of reorganising our Directorate-General.
Let me now assure him that the report for the year 2000 has been finalised and that the Commission will most probably adopt it in early October.
Briefly, there are four lessons to be learned.
The first concerns total and complete financial implementation throughout the programming period.
It is true that not all the payment appropriations for 1999 were used in full; only 91.6% of available payment appropriations were implemented.
The reason why the appropriations were not all used is the large number of applications for payments reaching the Commission in December 1999.
But, on a more positive note, not a single case of fraud or double financing between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community source was detected in 1999.
I have kept Parliament informed at regular intervals of the progress in implementing the budget and will continue to do so.
Secondly, there is the question of balancing investment in transport and investment in the environment, which, like you, I consider important.
Thirdly, I understand and endorse your wish to see the Commission devote more resources to on-the-spot checks.
Here again, the reorganisation of our departments and in particular the decentralisation of those activities has caused some problems.
Our Directorate-General is now responsible for carrying out on-the-spot checks of Cohesion Fund measures but also of all the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds.
Fourthly, Mr Marques, coordination between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has been given real impetus with the new regulations for the period 2000-2006 and, within the Directorate-General, with the integrated management of the various departments concerned with the Cohesion Fund and the other Structural Funds.
That is what I wanted to say, very briefly - following the President's advice - in response to the four points made in Mr Marques' report, for which I thank him.
Turning now to the report by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, while thanking him too for his fine report, I would again like to make four comments.
Firstly, regarding the implementation of the funds in 1999, 99% of appropriations for the period 1994-1999 were committed and 75% were paid.
That is a figure that, I believe, is broadly satisfactory.
As you know, on-site payments can be made up to 31 December this year, in accordance with the regulations.
The payment appropriations will, I think, be implemented in full and for the last two years - this was a job that began before my arrival - I have been working with the Member States to ensure that they are taken up as fully as possible.
That is a concern that Mr Pittella also raised a moment ago.
The delays in the start-up of some programmes in 1994 and 1995 have, therefore, been overcome for most of the actions under the on-going programme.
A similar improvement in the rate of execution can be seen in the programme of Community initiatives, although here the delays were a little more serious.
It is true, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, that many outstanding commitments still remained to be paid at the end of 1999.
Basically that was because of the accumulation of projects at the end of the programming period.
But let me point out that the situation quite clearly improved in 2000, since the commitments remaining to be paid at the end of 1999 were reduced by 47%.
In order to keep Parliament more fully informed on the subject, at the end of June 2001 the Commission drew up a full report on the unexpected commitments remaining to be paid for all categories of expenditure.
Secondly, the rapporteur welcomed the fact that the horizontal theme of 1999 was equality between women and men in the Structural Funds programmes.
With regard to the Structural Funds for the current period, I can confirm that gender equality has been one of the criteria for accepting plans received from Member States and you can count on Anna Diamantopoulou being very vigilant on this subject; the same applies to Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, as I noted a moment ago.
For the period 1994-1999, however, Member States did not have to provide information on the access of women to the Structural Funds.
That means that we have no detailed information on these matters for that programming period.
Thirdly, there is additionality, which the rapporteur sees as open to question, as I do at times.
On this point I can confirm that the Commission has carefully checked for compliance with this principle during the ex-ante review of new programmes for the period 2000-2006.
Regarding the previous period, the Commission will conclude its final check on additionality at the end of 2002.
I agree about the need for more stringent penalties in the event that a Member State does not respect the principle of additionality.
As honourable Members will know, no provision is made for such penalties under the fund rules for the period 2000-2006.
The legislator, chiefly the Council, was firmly opposed to the idea at the time the regulations were adopted.
We do, however, have some measures we can take in the event that additionality has not been verified and if necessary I shall take these measures in consultation with my colleagues.
On the subject of evaluation and monitoring, as you know the mid-term ex-ante or ex-post review was fully integrated into the programming for this new 2000-2006 period.
The Commission has just launched the ex-post evaluation for Objectives 1 and 2 for the 1994-1999 period, together with thematic evaluations of the information society, sustainable development and small and medium-sized enterprises.
These evaluations, like the mid-term reviews that will be carried out in 2003, will provide answers to any outstanding questions and I will, of course, inform the European Parliament of the results.
Fourthly, with regard to monitoring, the same vigilance will apply; but here the Commission now has a different role to play.
As you know, on-the-spot checks now fall within the remit of each Member State, which is obliged to report back to the Commission at regular intervals.
We for our part will and do verify that each Member State has set up a reliable system of on-the-spot checks.
Lastly, let me emphasise that the number of these checks also rose in 1999, reaching the figure of 120 compared with 100 in 1998.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me repeat that the Commission is committed to the basic principles of the Structural Funds: concentration, additionality and partnership, and the best possible coordination with the Cohesion Fund.
In their reports, the rapporteurs urge us to be even more effective and vigilant.
Let me assure you that I am confident that we will be able to give you even greater satisfaction when we come to study the results and the evaluation for the year 2000.
That is the year when the new programming will start, together with some new rules.
I believe we will be able to present more positive results, in response to your demands and to the vigilance that you are showing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Female genital mutilation
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0285/2001) by Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on female genital mutilation [2001/ 2035(INI)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, 130 million women worldwide have been the victims of genital mutilation.
Every year two million girls are subjected to this horrific practice.
Today the European Parliament must act as a spokesperson with regard to this situation which affects millions of women.
We have tried to work on the basis of consensus with all political groups in producing this report.
We have considered the opinions of experts of both sexes, the governments involved and non-governmental organisations.
Our aim is no less than to convince the communities which practice female genital mutilation of the need to eradicate it.
The custom of partially or totally removing the female sexual organs has it roots in a profoundly unjust notion of the role of women in a society which views them as inferior citizens, controlled by the people who make decisions, who are, in most cases, men.
For us, the defence of these traditions has a very clear limit.
The limit is the defence of human rights.
It is not possible, on behalf of any tradition, to accept that women should be seriously and irreversibly mutilated for the rest of their lives.
Information, education and increased awareness are, therefore, essential factors in relation to the disastrous consequences for women' s lives, even though most of them are not even aware of what these may be.
The truth of the matter is that they are going to suffer an irreversible amputation, but they do not even realise the real consequences of such an act.
We have produced a report which asks the Commission, the Council and the Member States to create an integral strategy, which does not only involve penalties, but which deals with the areas affected by this issue: public health, judicial, legal, political, etc. We view female genital mutilation as a serious attack on human rights, and on the basis of this view we request something which is a logical consequence of it: that the right to asylum be granted to women who wish to flee from this situation, that we take them in so that they may escape from something which will be irreversible for the rest of their lives.
According to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, persecution on the basis of sex must be cause for the granting of asylum rights.
No other persecution on the basis of sex is clearer than this one.
People can abandon their political ideas.
People can abandon their religious beliefs.
But it is impossible to abandon the sex you were born with.
Therefore, since we are dealing with a brutal violation of fundamental rights, it is also fundamental that we offer these individuals the opportunity of refugee status.
I believe that the directive currently being presented by the Commission, on the rules relating to the conditions to be fulfilled by residents of third countries requesting refugee status, moves in this direction, and it will be very important.
For us, this is a question of principle and we cannot abandon this demand.
The report also calls for the promotion of external aid to those African countries which have adopted legislative and administrative measures that prohibit and penalise this practice.
We also urge the European Commission to work closely with non-governmental organisations that make an enormous effort on the ground, very often with scant resources.
We also ask for recourse to the human rights clause in order to make combating genital mutilation a priority action in terms of relations with third countries, in particular with the countries which have close relations with the European Union within the framework of the Cotonou agreement.
Ladies and gentlemen, many women, thousands of African women, are waiting to hear what we have to say in this regard.
It is not solely a problem for African women.
It is a problem for all of us, women and men, because it is a problem of fundamental human rights.
These people are waiting and we must offer them an urgent response.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a small correction to make: I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and not the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I am particularly glad I was appointed draftsman of the opinion on this crucial question, which affects so many women in developing countries aside from those in the Fifteen.
I am glad because the Commission adopted my opinion unanimously.
People often look askance at unanimous decisions, suspecting a degree of inattention.
However, I think the Commission and the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation voted advisedly in this case and were convinced by the various paragraphs that make up the opinion.
I would like to draw Members' attention to two other points, aside from the unanimous vote, given that this unanimity is rather inconsistent with the debate that is still on-going in some political groups.
The first is the right of asylum.
We supported Mrs Valenciano's suggestion to the Council, the Commission and the Member States in her report that the clauses on right of asylum should indeed include one recognising the immediate right of asylum in the Fifteen of women and girls at risk of being subjected to female genital mutilation.
That is most important.
Here the vote was unanimous.
I therefore hope that a large section of Parliament will also vote for this paragraph tomorrow.
My second point, Mr President, concerns money.
We asked for EUR 10 million to finance all the measures aimed at helping these countries escape from this trap.
I hope that Parliament will vote for it tomorrow and that the Committee on Budgets will follow suit, something the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not done so far.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco for her work, which followed on a resolution supported by 316 Members.
This may be part of the reason why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report unanimously.
The most important element, which Mr Dell' Alba and Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco referred to, recognising the right of asylum of women under threat from genital mutilation, is considered by our committee too to be one of the major, crucial points in this battle.
I would like to mention once again the two figures which have already been cited: there are 130 million victims in the world; 2 million children undergo genital mutilation every year.
In addition to the various education and information, humanitarian, social and health initiatives and initiatives supporting non-governmental organisations, in particular, our committee feels that it must single out one in particular: the appeal to the Member States to ensure that female genital mutilation is prosecuted through the rigorous application of existing provisions laying down the right to health and personal integrity as a fundamental right, and the rigorous application of the provisions of the penal code which ban any deliberate action violating this right.
We demand, that is, for there to be no possible recourse to the concept of exception or cultural diversity to justify relativism or the watering down of this fundamental right or of the related legal protection which is incumbent upon the State.
We therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to endeavour to make our resolutions reality with all speed.
Thank you very much, Mr Turco.
We shall now suspend the sitting until 9.00 p.m. when we shall continue the debate.
I hope that you will gather your strength sufficiently to be back here at 9 on the dot.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Women' s Rights which examines a serious problem, the genital mutilation of a great number of women and girls.
This ancient practice violates the fundamental rights of the women and girls who fall victim to it and therefore constitutes an attack on the fundamental human rights recognised in the Treaties and in the Declarations of the United Nations.
The report proposes the extension of protection and prevention in all the countries where it is practised and also in the European Union, where we know it is still practised within immigrant communities, or by means of a visit to the country of origin where the genital mutilation is carried out, since this practice is well-established within the customs of many people in Africa and some in Asia.
Only prevention by means of information campaigns and clear explanation of the irreversible consequences of this practice will help to eradicate it.
These campaigns must be carried out by NGOs, but with the firm commitment of governments and the decisive support of leaders, religious leaders in particular; education campaigns in schools, directed at boys and girls, such as those being carried out with considerable success in Burkina Faso, as Mrs Campaore has told us today.
The prosecution of genital mutilation as a crime, both in the country where it is practised and when it is carried out in another country, that is, the extraterritoriality of the crime, will effectively help to eradicate it.
In serious cases, some countries envisage the right to asylum, as contemplated in the directive under the heading of the right to asylum for reasons of sexual discrimination.
We believe that to include here, in a general way, the right to asylum for alleged victims, that is to say, for millions of girls and teenagers, is inappropriate.
We cannot open doors we are then unable to close, and we in the European Union cannot receive all the alleged victims who want to leave their country for this reason.
The reality is that we cannot do it even if we would like to.
It is on this issue that the Group of the European Peoples' Party differs with this report, which may mean, in the event that it is approved, that we will abstain in the final vote.
This is regrettable, because the report has many positive elements, particularly the need for the commitment to include the fight against genital mutilations in all cooperation programmes and to provide them with adequate financial aid, and the demand that the governments of the states where they are practiced commit themselves effectively to their eradication.
We in the Group of the European Peoples' Party unreservedly condemn genital mutilation and we defend the full physical rights of all women, their full sexual rights and their right to decide on their future even though that decision may be at odds with their people' s traditional past.
We defend the rights of women as human beings, fully safeguarding their lives where ever they may be, and we are committed to continuing the work to eradicate this horrendous practice regardless of what may happen in relation to this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and a few gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Ms Valenciano for her outstanding report, which sends out a very clear message: genital mutilation is a human rights violation!
Various reasons are given to justify this human rights violation in the name of traditional culture or religion.
In reality, this is an instrument which is intended to perpetuate women's oppression.
Women who do not want to practise genital mutilation are excluded from society; as outcasts, they face unimaginable poverty and disgrace.
This grave assault on women, which irreparably damages their bodies, minds and health, has gone largely unnoticed.
It was only the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 which initiated a global debate and solidarity process and called for the international community to take joint action.
We also encounter genitally mutilated women in Europe, as well as many different perpetrators and accomplices.
Although FGM is punishable in many countries, the media and self-help organisations report that there are an estimated 5000 cases in Germany alone, and around four times as many cases involving girls being sent back to their countries of origin to be mutilated.
There are unscrupulous doctors and other individuals who earn between DM 1000 and 3000 per case.
The Socialist Group demands that at-risk women be granted asylum, perpetrators be punished, and that we proceed in accordance with the principle of extraterritoriality.
Let me make this very clear: for my group, this is an important point, and we completely fail to understand why some sections of the PPE-DE - or indeed, the group as a whole - intend to abstain on this asylum issue, have no intention of voting for the report, and are thus abandoning women to their fate.
The fight against ignorance and oppression must be fought at international level, and the Socialist International has therefore launched a worldwide campaign against violence against women.
Fifteen states have already banned FGM, including nine African countries.
More support must be given.
My government in Germany has already allocated DM 3.8 million for education work and projects.
The EU is helping with DAPHNE.
Yet this is just a drop in the ocean.
We must work together to fight for reproductive health and combat AIDS and genital mutilation.
Then we will have a chance of reaching women and giving them the help they need.
Mr President, I would first of all like to express my appreciation to Mrs Valenciano, who, in her excellent report, has tackled this sensitive issue in a clear and compelling manner.
The Liberal Group will therefore support the report.
The genital mutilation of women and girls is a terrible violation of fundamental human rights.
More than 130 million women have already fallen victim to this, and another two million are added every year.
Europe should therefore pull out all the stops to combat this phenomenon, wherever it appears.
I too understand that some Members are considering voting against this report on account of the sections on asylum and extraterritoriality.
However, I would like to reassure everyone: if we consider the present asylum practice, we see that in most of the fifteen Member States, genital mutilation is already a basis for asylum. I believe that to be appropriate.
From that point of view, the report merely accommodates existing practices.
It is true that at present, the principle of extraterritoriality only applies to child-sex tourism, but it should also cover mutilated women or women who are at risk.
For this is the only way to prevent EU citizens, for example from Somalian extraction, from taking their daughters to Somalia during the summer holidays to have them mutilated.
If these people realise that upon their return to Europe, they are at risk of being prosecuted, we then give the parents a weapon with which to protect their daughters against the pressure of society.
Finally, I would like to direct a comment to those who do not want to deal with genital mutilation due to it constituting an expression of a certain culture or religion.
In all countries where genital mutilation is practised, local groups are running campaigns to abolish it.
It is therefore not a case of us imposing our Western standards.
No, it is precisely these women whom we need to support by showing our solidarity tomorrow during the vote.
The Koran too leaves no room for mutilation.
Despite this, it is mainly in Islamic countries that it is practised.
We must therefore call on the Imams to help eradicate this phenomenon.
This is crucial, since we cannot afford negative stereotyping of Islamic beliefs in the current sensitive climate.
Genital mutilation is not a religious phenomenon, it is a violation of a fundamental human right.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my entire group, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano on this sterling report and the recommendations it contains, to which I subscribe 200%.
By far the majority of women who have undergone genital mutilation - reference is made to 130 million - live in Africa.
In at least 28 African countries located between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer, female circumcision is practised systematically.
Outside Africa, it is practised in southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, on the Arab peninsula in Yemen, in Oman and in the United Arab Emirates.
Even in a country like Egypt, few tourists who visit the sphinx realise that 90% of the women are circumcised.
However, some of these women have fled to Europe in order to save their daughters from this treatment, or to have operations in order to ease the pains.
But if these women were to return to their native country, they would be ostracized.
On the other hand, a summer holiday in the country of origin can turn into a nightmare for migrant girls, when family members deem it necessary to uphold their tradition.
I have devoted years of my life to helping women who had fallen victim to the trafficking in human beings.
From my own experience, I know that circumcised women are often considered unclean and are therefore sold as prostitutes. In this way, they become victims twice over.
African girls, who work in brothels day in day out, who, genitally mutilated, are sold and re-sold, rely on their clients to pay off their debts.
I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission once again to recognise genital mutilation, or the threat thereof, as a gender-specific reason for granting asylum.
We should not hide behind a possible review of the Convention of Vienna.
I would ask those in this House who are still not convinced to watch the videos that are being made of these 'festive occasions' , as they are sometimes referred to in those countries.
It is of fundamental importance that the silence around this taboo subject is broken.
That is why socio-cultural programmes in situ, as well as awareness campaigns involving the relevant migrants in Europe must be encouraged.
We cannot continue to accept this flagrant violation of human rights and of the dignity of the women and girls involved, under the guise of national customs and traditions.
I would like to take the opportunity of saying that, in view of the excellent quality of the next report by Mrs Smet, our group will not be taking the floor: that report equals perfection.
By way of conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano once again on the work she has done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance and originality of this courageous report, in comparison with the countless reports and documents adopted by many international bodies, is that, unambiguously and without making any hypocritical concessions, it views the question of female genital mutilation as an issue of freedom, dignity, law and human rights for hundreds, thousands of women in the world. I hope that Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco has the support of all of us here.
She does not make any hypocritical concessions to supposed respect for traditions or cultural relevatism, which we hear talked about so often, nor does she make any concessions even to the cheap efforts to salve our consciences which so often characterise the positions we adopt.
Indeed, while emphasising in the report that female genital mutilation is a crime, which must therefore be prosecuted, she proposes a raft of pro-active measures which it will also be our responsibility and the responsibility of the other institutions - Commission and Council - to implement.
I would, however, like to make one point to Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, for whom I have great admiration.
You presented to us a situation which does not exist, saying that it would be inappropriate to establish the threat of female genital mutilation as grounds for the right of asylum because that would be to open our doors to millions of women seeking protection.
You see, Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, if there were millions of women and children who were able to revolt, to come out into the open and flee family, social and male control, then the problem would already be resolved.
Therefore, the situation must be different: sadly, there are not hundreds of thousands or millions of children and women who currently have the chance to revolt, to come out into the open, to go and knock on the door of an embassy to seek asylum.
We are in a situation in which there are very few indeed who have the courage to do this, and to think about closing the door even on these few - and I beg you once again to consider this - is not responsible. We would not be doing our duty.
We would be back in a situation of preaching empty sermons, of cheap efforts to assuage our consciences, of failing to assume responsibilities that our ours, that are the responsibilities of this free, civil, democratic Europe which upholds the rights of all.
This, I believe, is what we are trying to say in our report tomorrow: we want to say that we are for a world in which human beings are all equal.
I am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow Members, the issue would have been resolved long ago.
The problem is that this is not yet the way in which the world works and it is our responsibility, the responsibility of this institution, to set an example.
Lastly - and I am addressing the Members who are also part of the Committee on Development and Cooperation - today, I have a meeting with the Secretary General of the ACP Secretariat, Ambassador Goulongana, who has declared himself willing to include this matter in the forthcoming meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Brussels at the end of October.
I know that the agendas are fixed and that it may be too late to make changes, but there must also be an element of political interest in all this that will ensure that some flexibility preserved in this rigid climate!
There must be a difference which we can use to our advantage!
I hope that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly will approve our position as well as this House.
Ladies, I would remind all of you who are hesitating that there are very few women - very few indeed - who have the chance, the courage and indeed the good fortune to be able to revolt.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that this report has been presented.
Every one of us who has read 'Desert Flower' by Waris Dirie will always be shocked and appalled by this practice.
I am thinking today of the 130 million women and girls who have been subjected to female genital mutilation, and each year some two million more are affected.
I am also thinking of the many young girls who die horrifically as a result.
Let me say from the outset that I am strongly in favour of the EU and its Member States adopting a joint position to abolish these practices which are harmful to women's sexual and reproductive health.
Within the framework of a joint immigration and asylum policy, the Commission and the Council will have to take account of these aspects of female genital mutilation.
The same applies to refugee policy.
In this context, let me point out - and this is clear, in my view - that asylum will then be granted primarily when political protection is required for reasons of state.
Genital mutilation is a grey area, and it is usually carried out by private individuals.
This makes it even more difficult to combat the practice.
A great deal of persuasion, public information and educational work is required from all of us and a change of attitude is needed in society as a whole.
For me, genital mutilation is a human rights violation which I cannot accept under any circumstances or from anyone.
A public debate on this issue is needed to raise awareness both in the EU and in the developing countries and spare future generations of women this dreadful mutilation.
Above all, we must ensure - and this has been mentioned by previous speakers - that this practice is also outlawed in the Member States, for I know that there is a major grey area here.
I ask everyone to work together with a genuine will to stop this practice.
Mr President, two weeks ago a Swedish TV documentary attracted a great deal of attention when it showed how religious leaders, Christian and Muslim, in Sweden recommend Sunna circumcision, how Swedish citizens have their daughters circumcised in Kenya and Somalia during the summer holidays, how circumcisers are flown into Sweden to conduct circumcisions and how a Swedish doctor failed to report to the social services the fact that he had saved a girl from bleeding to death after her parents had had her circumcised.
For those of us combating female genital mutilation, it is precisely the support of the holy men for this torture which is most disheartening.
Religious leaders have a particular responsibility.
Their influence is enormous and their voices crucial to putting an end to circumcision.
I welcome the excellent report from Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco with its demands for a holistic strategy for eliminating female genital mutilation within the EU through initiatives such as extensive publicity campaigns and laws against female genital mutilation in all Member States.
Of particular importance is the requirement for the introduction of specific national laws which also apply to circumcisions beyond national borders and which make it possible to punish citizens when they return home after travelling abroad to have their daughters circumcised.
In 1999, Sweden became the first and only country in the EU to have this type of extra-territorial legislation, which hopefully will now make it possible to bring to book those Swedes who put their daughters through 'summer holiday circumcision' abroad.
Another key point in the report, which many have already mentioned, is the requirement that escape from this torture should be taken at least as seriously as escape from political persecution.
The US and Canada have, on several occasions, already stopped the deportation of girls and young women who have sought asylum for fear of being circumcised.
Europe should not lag behind in this respect.
It is high time that we took strong measures to save the two million girls around the world who, each year, are at risk of genital mutilation.
We place our hope and our confidence in the Commissioner' s returning with practical proposals on which our ministers can then adopt a position.
Mr President, female genital mutilation is a terrible act of extreme violation which causes serious physical and mental damage and a lifetime of suffering.
The mortality rate among those who are subjected to this practice is high.
There is a need for really vigorous efforts to combat this abomination, this terrible act, wherever it occurs.
This is also a European problem, and it is important to ensure that knowledge, research and documentation on female genital mutilation is improved in Europe.
We need cooperation in order to find common strategies to ensure that this operation, which is not prescribed by any religion, can be abolished.
Several Members have highlighted the need to cooperate with religious leaders.
Those women already circumcised need care and rehabilitation, and we must therefore put our faith in more knowledgeable midwives, social workers and teachers.
Mrs Theorin referred to what we in Sweden call summer holiday circumcision, which is when girls are taken abroad to be circumcised.
In my country this is forbidden, and so it is only natural for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to support the proposals to introduce this ban everywhere.
This would provide a clear signal that female genital mutilation is illegal at home and illegal abroad and that such mutilation constitutes a violation of human rights.
Mr President, the use of genital mutilation is an extreme form of female repression which, in some countries, is as old as time itself.
It was the women of those countries themselves, of Egypt and of Somalia, who told us about their extreme suffering.
They denounced it and had to overcome a world of prejudice in the process, but they did it for the benefit of their sisters, who were often younger, or their daughters.
They are asking us to show the same courage.
A number of women have sent the European Parliament a petition in the same vein.
We are supported by women across the world.
Respect for the human being must be judged the same for men and women alike: women' s rights are human rights.
Allowing this mutilation to take place under medically acceptable conditions does not make the mutilation itself acceptable.
Neither is the fact that this cruel custom is one of the oldest traditions in some communities - I am deliberately avoiding the term 'religions' , for they have little to do with it - reason for us to tolerate it.
The sexual mutilation of girls must be considered a punishable offence in every country and every society, as demanded in various international agreements.
A positive development is that, in any event, an increasing number of countries have prohibited genital mutilation in women.
But in many cases, they are merely paying lip service to this ban, and we should therefore amend the Cotonou Agreement so that we can implement it in the same way as for human rights violations.
For the rest, I share the view of fellow MEPs.
Mr President, Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco' s excellent report clearly states that female genital mutilation is a crime, about which Europe must not remain silent.
I too appeal to all Members of Parliament to show their unanimous support for the report in tomorrow' s vote.
Female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is an act of violence against women, which violates their fundamental rights, their individual integrity, and their physical and mental health.
The rights of women, young girls or baby girls are being trampled on in the name of various cultural traditions or even the assumed dictates of religion.
Ever present in the background, however, is women' s social status and position, which is inferior to that of men in these cultures.
There is therefore also a need to promote equality.
Regrettably, female genital mutilation has been found to have taken place and to be taking place in immigrant communities in the EU also, although this practice is prohibited in the criminal legislation of Member States and it is clearly in breach of the principles of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
No religious or cultural practice can be allowed to take precedence over the basic principles of human rights or someone' s physical and mental integrity, on which European democracy is based.
We must also vehemently resist the demand that genital mutilation should be carried out by doctors in clinical conditions.
This must not be compared to male circumcision, where this practice has been adopted in some Member States.
I support the report' s positive measures that aim to end these crimes in EU Member States.
Information, awareness-raising and prevention must be the priorities.
But we also have to take action where the crime of mutilation has already occurred, with penal measures and sanctions.
Personally, I am also prepared to adopt the principle of extraterritoriality in this connection.
I urge authorities in the Member States, and, as a Finnish member, obviously those in my native country of Finland in particular, to implement all necessary measures as soon as possible to bring to an end these inhuman violations of human rights, which are something out of the Middle Ages.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco on her excellent and comprehensive report.
It is a fact that, for millions of women throughout the world, genital mutilation is an unavoidable, terrifying ordeal which they have to go through if they are to survive.
The absence of any alternative and a complete lack of information are one of the most serious problems for women who suffer this degrading mutilation, which is one of the worse forms of suppression, terrorism and exploitation of women, a criminal practice which violates their personal freedom, their physical integrity, their freedom of conscience and their right to health by causing serious physical injury and mental side effects, not to mention the impact on their sexual identity and ability to bear children.
One hundred and thirty million mutilated women in the world is a terrifying number.
Unfortunately, this horrible practice has also been introduced into the European Union.
According to a statement by the British Medical Association, three thousand women are mutilated in the United Kingdom every year and naturally the fundamentalists, even within the European Union, have no hesitation in applying mediaeval practices in order to subjugate women and control their sexuality.
Every human being is entitled to protection under the law when fundamental freedoms and rights are at risk, as is the case with mutilation.
However, European Union law seriously lacks any teeth, which is why we are calling for legislation to be applied which will make this horrible practice a crime.
And, of course, the European Union can exert a great deal of influence through the trade agreements under the Cotonou agreement which it concludes with countries in which such practices are rife and by introducing extraterritorial legislation.
Finally, I should like to call on the PPE-DE, for us to unite in demonstrating our solidarity with the thousands of women who have undergone this horrible procedure and for you to change your decision by tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, female genital mutilation inflicts endless pain and suffering on women and girls in at least 25 African countries, most of them ACP countries.
Women are the victims of violent and life-threatening cultural traditions which must be ended, for a tradition which violates individual rights - in this case women's rights - in a truly horrific way must not be allowed to continue in the twenty-first century.
Thankfully, the ACP countries in Africa are increasingly recognising this fact.
It is gratifying that Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Uganda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic and the CÃŽte d' Ivoire have legislated against female genital mutilation.
Efforts are also being made - with the support of aid organisations and numerous NGOs - to stop this dreadful practice through public information campaigns and awareness-raising.
In this context, a resolution adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its last meeting in Libreville (Gabon), Ms Bonino, should be emphasised in positive terms.
Supported by the representatives of the ACP countries, the resolution called unanimously on the authorities to take the necessary steps to end this practice, adopting all appropriate legislative, administrative and judicial measures and launching cultural awareness and information campaigns.
The meeting thus branded the practice as a human rights violation. This is a great improvement on the earlier taboos surrounding this issue, and we must pay tribute to it.
However, the battle to protect the physical and mental integrity of women in the ACP countries and elsewhere is still not won.
Our solidarity and support are still needed.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco and start by stressing the political importance and impact of this report, which will of course be even greater if it is supported by a large majority.
This report will give momentum both to the Commission's work and, more importantly, to the women's organisations in Europe and Africa trying to combat this barbaric practice.
This is a problem which, as several Members of Parliament have said, does not only exist in Africa.
According to data from the DAPHNE programme, there are about 700,000 women from these countries in Europe today.
It is difficult to quote an actual figure but we suspect that it is much higher than we can possibly imagine.
This is a difficult, thorny problem.
Obviously cultural traditions which go back centuries in certain areas of our planet form part of it.
But a cultural tradition cannot be used as an alibi for trampling all over human rights.
Obviously, as stated at the World Conference in Beijing, genital mutilation is a violation of human rights and, at a secondary level, it is discrimination, because it only applies to women and girls.
What can the European Union do?
First, proposals and legislation.
There is some disagreement as to whether the present Treaty provides a legal basis for European legislation.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice cannot as yet form a legal basis.
However, legislation is not always the only solution and there is a great deal which can be done in this area.
The question of asylum.
Several speakers raised this argument and the report is clear here.
May I say that, a few days ago, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive to the Council on the adoption of minimum requirements for recognising the status of third country nationals or stateless persons or refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention. After a great deal of discussion and effort, the text includes a clear reference stating that applications for protection for women will be recognised, especially where there is a probability of sexual violence or some other gender-related conduct.
I think, therefore, that it is worth examining this Commission proposal, which could provide a basis for an agreement which would be very important to all the groups in the European Parliament.
However, over and above the legislative framework, current European Union programmes can be used as a basis for supporting action and campaigns to recognise the problem, mobilise society and increase public awareness and, of course, to inform and educate hospital staff.
Medical and health workers in at least five countries in the European Union often come into contact with such cases and they must be specially trained and specially qualified to help these people.
The potential for educating and supporting immigrants.
Clearly, women need financial resources if they are to be financially independent and organise their own rebellion, and support for female immigrants in Europe is therefore paramount.
We can support them and integrate them into the labour market and fund information and public awareness campaigns through existing programmes which we have already debated in Parliament and we are waiting for proposals from non-governmental organisations on these issues.
As far as our relations with the third world are concerned, we have already made a serious effort to ensure that development aid is predicated on respect for human rights by governments, especially in this area, and to take account of governments' efforts to apply policies to educate, train, raise awareness and support women and families.
We already intend, in collaboration with the development sector and the Commissioner responsible, to increase financial support to countries intent on wiping out this practice.
I think we can draw satisfactory conclusions from the implementation of this programme in Ethiopia as to what we can achieve if the European Union works with governments through development aid.
Finally, we appreciate that non-governmental organisations can act as a catalyst both in the European Union and in Africa, which is why they are the Commission's main contacts, our main partners in this endeavour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Equal pay for work of equal value
The next item is the report (A5-0275/2001) drawn up by Mrs Smet on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on equal pay for work of equal value.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the judicial instruments at European level and in the Member States banning wage discrimination, there are still considerable and persistent wage differences between men and women.
The figures that are available to us from - indeed very interesting - European studies, show that there is a wage gap of 25 to 28% and in some countries as high as 30%.
For example, the wage gap is greater in the private sector than in the public sector, the industrial and agricultural sectors have greater wage differentials than the service sector, and the gap seems to be widest in those sectors where women are underrepresented.
It is not always easy to interpret these statistics correctly.
But it is generally accepted that the different career patterns of men and women account for about half of the wage gap - for example, women interrupt their careers more easily than men, with slower career progress as a result - the lower qualifications especially of older working women, the fact that working women are on average younger than working men - in other words, the objective, structural differences.
The other half of the wage gap, however, cannot be explained objectively and seems to suggest that there are hidden mechanisms of discrimination at play which lead to the undervaluing of female-dominated jobs and professions.
The key mechanism is the job evaluation system, by means of which different jobs are ranked according to importance, and according to that job ranking, are allocated their salary scales.
In most cases, this job evaluation is done by the social partners, whether or not based on a system set up by an advisory office.
Discrimination in job evaluation is evident from the fact that too low a value is placed on characteristics associated with traditionally feminine jobs, including social skills, women' s greater capacity to concentrate and greater dexterity. As they are awarded lower scores, valued less, these jobs are thus given too low a place in task hierarchies and payrolls, which means that the wage level for women is lower.
At the same time, the characteristics associated with traditionally masculine jobs, for example technical insight, physically demanding work or financial responsibility, are correspondingly over-valued.
In general, workers do not know how their job is classified.
It is even open to question how much insight the social partners have into how jobs are classified within businesses.
Moreover, women are generally not involved in job evaluation since they are not the negotiators with the social partners.
The question then arises as to what Europe can do about this.
Commissioner, I believe that first of all, the gathering of statistical data on wages of men and women, and on wage differentials, must drastically improve.
At present, the gathering of statistical data both at European level and in most Member States leaves something to be desired.
This should therefore be addressed first.
I know that the Commission has appointed a group of experts to set this in motion, but I would also urge them to look for an explanation of the wage differentials.
Secondly, the European Union would do well to delve deeper into the issue of discrimination in job evaluation.
For this purpose, an initiative could be launched, for example to supplement the Directive of 1975 which deals with equal pay, with an annexe in which a number of rules and criteria are laid down which guarantee a gender-neutral evaluation system.
The Member States need a guide. So do the social partners.
In my opinion, Europe could provide the perfect solution.
Moreover, the social partners must be committed to ensuring transparency concerning the value scales used in the wage formation process.
How can people find out if their wage is or is not the product of discrimination if there is no transparency whatsoever in the way in which their wage is determined?
The social partners should commit in the same way to involving more women in wage negotiations, particularly to removing discrimination and at long last making wage discrimination No 1 on their agenda, for that never happens.
In addition, the guidelines for employment must be tightened up with quantitative objectives, target dates and goals in mind.
They are not included, not even in the new guidelines, even though they are much better than the previous ones.
This must be followed much more closely.
I have never heard the Commission complain about the fact that the national action plans devote too little attention to this issue.
In summary, there is a need for a global policy strategy.
All these elements would form part of this and of the campaign which the Commission intends to launch and which could, in fact, be a useful tool in highlighting a number of these matters.
Commissioner, I would therefore urge you to make this item for once a priority for the benefit of women.
Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her report and thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for adopting so many of the conclusions produced by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Three things are clear: one, women's wages are on average lower than men's across all occupations; two, women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value; three, women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part-time workers than men.
The problem is therefore, clearly a deeply rooted one and cannot be solved without concerted action by all parties.
This must include the introduction of job evaluation schemes based on objective, gender-neutral criteria, so that the current undervaluing of women's skills is brought to an end.
However, we need also, as Mrs Smet has said, a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is appreciative of the extent to which the Commission is already addressing the issue through its proposals for the employment guidelines in 2002.
The emphasis on gender mainstreaming and the strengthening of guideline 17 are particularly welcome.
We also look forward to the proposals the Commission may have for a revision and updating of the 1975 equal pay directive.
In the meantime, we call on both the Member States and the social partners to involve themselves actively in developing measures of the kind urgently needed to eliminate the gender pay gap.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report, which was so necessary and which she has produced in a very professional way, because she has a profound knowledge of the problem and has done a lot of work on it.
But despite the fact that it is a very good report which attempts to study each of the points relating to inequality of pay between men and women, today we are facing a deep-seated problem to which we see no solution.
It is more difficult for women to find work than it is for men, they have more difficulties in terms of training and professional promotion and they have lower salaries than men.
But this does not only affect women who have been in the labour market for some time, but it also affects young women who are very well prepared, in many cases better prepared than men, who do brilliant work and who receive lower salaries than their male colleagues.
There is no justification for it whatsoever, there is no legislation which allows it in any of the countries of the European Union but, despite all this, it is a reality which we are facing and which we have no idea how to solve.
Social partners, both company organisations and unions, probably have a large role to play in resolving this problem.
I am sure that, if there were more women in the leadership of these organisations, the issue would probably have been dealt with a long time ago.
It is very regrettable that, while we are combating many other types of discrimination which are sometimes difficult to demonstrate, we have still not been able to resolve this one which is so obvious, which is reflected in the figures which appear on everybody' s payslips every month.
I believe that the fact that women' s work is undervalued, that their work has always been considered subordinate to men' s work, that it has always been thought that they are not capable of holding top positions, are prejudices which are still present in society' s mentality, which hinder equality, professional access and greater promotion for women.
I would ask the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem.
If in a Member State of the European Union somebody suffering discrimination presents a case and wins it, if they work in the public sector, their greatest problem will be confronting the dirty looks of their colleagues, but if they work in the private sector, sooner or later it will lead to them leaving their job.
This means that many women do not even use the legal resources available to them.
Mr President, this is a very important issue because this is discrimination which faces all women, not only in the EU, but across the world.
We therefore welcome this report as its findings are indeed serious.
It shows, as the rapporteur said, that there is a 20-25% difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse.
This report is a very practical one, putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue.
So we support the measures set out in the report and call for this action to be taken sooner rather than later, because this is discrimination that women have faced for a very long time.
We have hundreds of years of discrimination to address and we need to get on with doing that.
I certainly support all calls for this to become a priority for the EU and for the Commission.
I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse, worse enough for them to be singled out in the report.
Those Member States therefore have a special responsibility to take action and to ensure that they get themselves up to the EU average as quickly as possible.
There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight.
First of all awareness campaigns: these are something that Member States could actually do without too much difficulty.
They will not address the actual issues in the workplace, but it is something which governments can do relatively easily.
The other thing which the report mentions, which I would like to draw attention to, is that governments themselves can provide a model, and I therefore call on Member State governments to look at their own employment policies and identify how they might become better employers themselves.
Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Smet for a quite outstanding report.
However, I cannot omit to say that I find it disgraceful that, in the year 2001, we are still discussing these problems, and we know into the bargain that enlargement is not going to make matters any better, to put it mildly.
The conclusion is that not only do women have lower paid jobs but, as a result, they do not get the plum management positions either, their having access to which is one of the prerequisites for our being able to change the situation.
If, however, I wanted to take the floor here this evening, it is because I want to draw your attention to a study which has just been published in Denmark and which shows that 'unequal pay' has its origins in childhood.
The study shows that girls receive far less pocket money than boys.
They are given far fewer consumer goods than boys and they earn less than boys, which means that boys begin saving up while they are still children. Inequality has thus already been established.
This applies to all age groups, except for the 16 to 18 group.
In all other age groups, girls are given less pocket money than boys.
It is parents themselves, indeed women themselves, who give their girls less pocket money than their boys.
It might also be added that boys have much better jobs and so earn more, too.
The situation is the same regarding consumer goods.
It turns out, of course, that boys have more TV sets, more PCs in their rooms etc. Perhaps we should begin with ourselves.
Parents must give some thought to how they treat their children and prevent their being treated unequally from the cradle onwards.
I recommend obtaining this Danish report.
I thought it was very interesting.
I thank Mrs Smet for having taken the initiative to draft this report.
I would like to point to three difficulties but first of all I want to make one thing clear: when we refer to a 25% wage gap, this covers all occupations taken together.
In general the figure is 15% in the case of equal work.
The reason I want to remind you of these two figures and these two concepts is because it is most important to highlight the difficulties we find ourselves in today, as my colleagues have done.
The situation is extremely difficult and the solutions are not very visible or effective.
Let me draw attention to three points.
Firstly, in France, for example, women only occupy 10% of all jobs.
Of every 300 jobs, only 30 are filled by women.
Women therefore have access to 10% of all the jobs on offer.
So there certainly is a need for a change of approach.
Secondly, in this report we refer to atypical work.
It is also known as part-time work.
Some countries think it is good for women.
Personally, I do not think so at all.
That is not the way to achieve equal pay and economic equality.
For there cannot be equal pay without economic equality.
Thirdly, we need equal representation in the social partners' decision-making bodies.
I would certainly be the first to fight for parity between men and women in the social partners' decision-making.
But there are many jobs where no social partners exist, that is, all service jobs.
So what can we do there?
We have laid down a law on night work in France, which says that the social partners must address the matter.
But there are no social partners in the case of these jobs, which poses serious problems.
I would just like to ask the Commissioner for one thing in face of all these immense difficulties: that we lay emphasis on the question of equal pay at the second reading of the 1976 directive we are currently revising together with you and with the Council.
This issue does not seem to be welcome in the discussions with the Council.
I think it is quite essential if there is to be any point to this revision of the 1976 directive.
If we are once again to talk about equal pay, even if it is a principle that has already been introduced by the Treaty of Rome, it must be time for us to ask ourselves whether other strategies might not be necessary to abolish the wage gap between men and women when the EU' s overall efforts have proved a failure.
I believe that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we must in future transfer more of the responsibility to the individual Member States.
It is in individual workplaces that experience is gained.
To be quite specific, it must be up to the individual countries, via the two sides of industry, to incorporate the principle of equal pay into national collective agreements.
We must take account of the fact that there are differences between collective agreements and wage agreement systems in the Member States.
Instead of direct EU legislation in this area, the EU must provide guidelines and recommendations, and the principle must be incorporated, more than it has been so far, into national action plans for employment and non-discrimination.
In the years to come, the labour market will have a need for a larger workforce, and it is therefore important for us to expend more energy on creating better conditions for women.
All in all, I am able to support all the initiatives put forward in the Smet report.
Mr President, efforts to equalise pay for male and female workers for work of equal value have been made at European level since 1951.
In 1957, this was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome as a guiding principle and in 1975 in a directive.
Despite the legal ban on wage discrimination, there is, as has been said on several occasions today, still a wage gap in the EU at the moment.
That is unacceptable.
I appreciate that in some cases, it is difficult to establish an objective wage formation process or job evaluation procedure, but that does not take away from the need for more transparency and gender-neutrality.
The report rightly mentions value discrimination.
That is where the government could step in, but so could the social partners.
As stated before, they too play a significant role.
It is also important to involve women more in wage negotiations and in the decision-making process in general, and to recruit more women in decision-making bodies.
It is embarrassing that the statistics available at European level on male and female wage differentials are out of date and incomplete.
I therefore welcome the initiative to collect new data and I support the idea of carrying out further studies into the factors which affect salary scales, as well as the causes of unequal pay for work of equal value.
A wage difference of 15% remaining after taking into consideration aspects such as age, training and career level is, as already mentioned, not acceptable.
The topic we are discussing at the moment cannot be seen in isolation from other aspects related to women and the participation of women in work.
It is closely related to aspects such as access to work, chances of promotion, a combination of work and care, etc.
Equal pay for work of equal value can help break the vicious circle of lifelong inequality: lower pay leads to a smaller pension or to more work in order to obtain the same pension; more work often entails a greater need for child care, less time to develop other talents or abilities or to relax outside work, etc.
I am pleased that the Belgian Presidency prioritises this issue and hope that the Member States will take this appeal seriously this time.
I am also expecting the campaign on this topic in the year 2002 to provide a boost for it.
The report we are discussing is an initiative report.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet, on her work. It is mainly thanks to her commitment that this initiative report is now before us.
It outlines once more a number of aspects very clearly and offers specific directions for solutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has played a decisive role in condemning and in attempting to resolve the problem of pay inequalities between men and women that exist in our fifteen countries.
Both the Treaties and now national laws uphold the principle of equal pay for men and women.
No country, however, complies with its own laws in this field.
The differences vary from country to country, but the outcome is the same.
When employment in a given sector is dominated by women, the outcome is lower pay.
It is the jobs mainly held by women that society accepts should be the least well paid.
Even in Scandinavian countries, where women have achieved equality, even in political life, it is proving difficult for them to enter decision-making positions in privately owned companies, where salaries are higher.
We therefore have a situation that is out of kilter, in that the laws impose equality but society continues to accept a model that fails to value work undertaken by women.
In order to ensure that real democracy is practised and that a new social model that accepts equality is created, we need to give men greater rights in the field of their private lives.
The laws that have been adopted and the proposals in this area are quite telling.
In Portugal, for example, the government recently presented Parliament with a proposal for a law making parental leave mandatory for a period of at least five days. No European country currently has such a law.
This type of leave is granted at the employer' s discretion and the aim of this law is to attempt to change people' s way of thinking.
The fact that society continues to accept men' s abdication of duties in their home lives constitutes a genuine form of unfair competition to which women are subjected in their professional lives.
If we want to change the situation of disadvantage that women continue to experience in the workplace, we need to change people's attitudes and the practices of the social partners.
And here, the European Union must continue to play a key role.
At the Lisbon Summit, Europe acknowledged that only by increasing the rate of employment for women will it be able to achieve, within ten years, the economic and social development that it wants to see.
Europe must now acknowledge that it needs not only more working women but also the jobs that women do.
To this end, the Commission proposed and the Council accepted equal pay as one of the priorities for 2001 in its programme for equality.
The European Trade Union Confederation has also decided to make this issue its priority for this year.
In drafting this own-initiative report, the European Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
...
I only wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet and say that I agree with her proposals.
Mr President, the report's estimated 28% pay differential between men and women is particularly revolting because in many cases even men are not paid nearly enough to make a decent living in the twenty-first century.
But it is not enough simply to make this statement; if Parliament really wanted to put an end to this injustice it would take binding measures and force all employers without exception to respect the principle of equal treatment for men and women on pain of heavy penalties.
There are areas in which Parliament is able to adopt binding measures.
But judging by the woolly proposals in the report, there is no question of adopting coercive measures towards employers.
Under these circumstances, even if the European Parliament votes in favour this will be a complete waste of time.
It will be up to working women to impose equality themselves, joining forces with the workers to demand a living wage for all.
Mr President, Mrs Smet's report is the outcome of serious study as well as political experience and personal commitment, which is why it was enthusiastically adopted by a large majority in committee.
It deals with a general practice, which is common to all the social and economic systems of Europe, a harsh reality which will cancel out all legislative progress, be it at national or European level.
Women have difficulty not just in accessing work but in advancing their careers and levels of pay.
The last report on employment tell us that most of the Member States have given up trying to right this wrong and that this issue is missing from the social dialogue agenda in most countries.
We urge the Commission to call on the Member States to conduct a serious assessment, as the rapporteur suggests.
And to avoid repeating what has been said by my fellow Members, with whom I fully concur, I should like to suggest to you, Commissioner, that we take a global approach to this issue both in your policy and in that of the Member States.
The political practices which apply in numerous countries in the European Union in the area of women's employment, social protection and pensions marginalise them professionally, marginalise their ambitions, efforts, competitiveness and claims and hence their pay.
Our role, your role is a difficult one; we must convince public opinion and women themselves that all these issues are interlinked. We must convince them that their so-called vested rights run counter to their interests and to the quality and viability of and pay for their work.
Commissioner, please help the governments bear the political price which this endeavour and change usually imply.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report and on the thorough, comprehensive document before us.
The wage gap between men and women is a well-known phenomenon which is present in all the States of the Union, although in different proportions, and the issue has been on our agendas for a long time now. Previous speakers have mentioned the World Labour Organisation Convention of 1951, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the 1995 directive and the Treaty of Amsterdam.
A great deal has been done, including in terms of the measures to be taken.
The Commission has been presenting recommendations for over 10 years now, sometimes at Parliament' s request; I also remember the code of conduct prepared by the Commission which sought to raise awareness in the Member States and the two sides of industry in order to take practical action in this field.
Although the information is still not complete, analysis of the phenomenon allows us to understand the reasons for the existence of the differentials.
There are structural reasons, which have been recorded, such as age, training, seniority, and precarious and part-time work, in which mainly women are employed.
However, there is also genuine discrimination, direct discrimination - in some cases there is unequal pay for equal work - but, above all, value discrimination: women' s work is still considered to be of less value than men' s, even when they have the same qualifications and responsibilities.
Here is an example from my country: it was only in the mid-1980' s, after 15 years of campaigning, that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers' pay agreement for the category of workers 'packing supervisor' , which exists in the textiles sector. This only happened, that is, when women lost their jobs during restructuring in this profession, which had been a typically female profession, and men began to be employed as well.
I feel that this is a tangible example of an issue which was only resolved in Italy in the mid-80s and which still remains unresolved today in a great many other situations.
The rapporteur has made numerous proposals and, in my opinion, we should follow her recommendations.
The Commissioner and the Commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too.
Mr President, I too want to begin by thanking Mrs Smet for the excellent job she has done and, in particular, for the high quality of her explanatory statement.
Looking at this report, we all have to acknowledge a sad fact today.
In spite of the many initiatives taken over the years and in spite of the positive action taken by the Commission, the pay gap between the women and men of the European Union remains.
Not only do women on average earn 28% less than men for a job of equal value, often their jobs are also more precarious and unpleasant, an issue that is not raised often enough.
More women than men are unemployed and more of them are long-term unemployed; finally, most of the time it is they who look after the children and sometimes other dependents too.
Of course we have to take action, and in several directions.
That is why I agree with the spirit and the proposals in this report: we need to set up a group of experts to improve the collection of statistical data; it is a good idea to launch a major Europe-wide campaign in 2002; and it would no doubt be useful to take that opportunity to publish a comparative report on the various Member States.
Similarly, as the rapporteur proposes, we must review the 1975 directive and do something about training, to ensure that women really have the right to lifelong training, encourage the social partners to increase the participation of women in collective bargaining and, finally, take measures to help reconcile working and family life.
To ensure, however, that this goes beyond statements of intent, all the political leaders of the Union really must get down to work and clearly state their resolve to do so.
Indeed, at a time when we are entering a new world and facing terrible challenges, those who govern us must realise that this situation is not just discriminatory and unjust, it is not just counterproductive; it is a daily contradiction of the values we believe in and the model of society that Europe must uphold.
Mr President, I too should like to make a point of congratulating Mrs Smet, whose report demonstrates her personal knowledge of and experience in this matter.
The pay differential is the clearest and plainest expression of inequality between the sexes.
We have heard data and analyses of the causes of the present inequality and I do not intend to repeat them.
I intend to talk about what is being done today in terms of policy and planning.
As you know, the fourth line of action in the strategy on employment, which relates to equal opportunities, has dealt with the issue of unequal pay since the strategy on employment was first implemented back in 1999.
Over the years, from 1999 onwards, the Commission has evaluated the policies of each Member State on the question of equal pay.
What we have found over the last three years is that several, not all of the Member States, have noticed the differential, have noticed the problem and have proposed policies and measures to combat it.
The Commission refers specifically to this issue every year in its joint report on the basis of the data at its disposal and makes suggestions to the Member States as regards their policies.
The question which arises here is what tools does the Commission have at hand to make this assessment. And this, of course, is where we come up against the problem of indicators and statistics to which Mrs Smet referred.
We need new subjects and new statistical analyses of them so that we can formulate the problem in absolute terms.
The Commission is already working on this and I should like to give you one example.
We need a statistical analysis of the ratio between men and women as regards the hourly wage for paid employees working longer than 15 hours.
We need to analyse gross and net salaries in the public and private sectors and that means a breakdown by age, education, profession, economic activity, type of work and employment status.
Very few countries have statistics in the form which I have referred to.
And apart from the problem of the subject of the statistical analysis, we also have the problem of how to carry out statistical research.
In some Member States, there is a huge gap between the date on which data is collected and the date on which the final results are published.
And this does not just apply to the Member States, it also applies to some of the statistics published by the European Union itself.
So improving statistics, which are a very important tool for improving policies, is our number one priority.
You will see that this year's suggestions to several Member States refer specifically to the need to improve statistics systems.
The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002.
I appreciate that this is a very clear strategy which calls on the Member States to set specific targets to reduce the wage differential between men and women.
And, of course, our objective is to work with all the Member States and to exchange best practices so that some countries can imitate changes which are already under way.
The third point I wish to raise is that in the fifth programme, which is starting up now - the evaluation of the proposals submitted is being completed - the first priority when selecting proposals is the question of equal pay.
We have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady Members, that is, the need for an integrated strategy.
A few days ago, on 13 September, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission held a major conference on the question of equal pay.
Mr President, honourable Members, may I say that our final decision on revising the existing directive will take account of the results of all these actions and the policy evaluation which I mentioned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Harassment in the work place
The next item is the report (A5-0283/2001) drawn up by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on harassment at the workplace.
Mr President, the subject of this own-initiative report is certainly not a new problem, but a problem only recently highlighted.
According to the Dublin Foundation, harassment in the workplace is on quite an extensive scale.
Eight percent of EU citizens, or around twelve million people, have felt harassed in the workplace during the past twelve months.
What is this due to, and are there any connections to be made? Yes.
We know, for example, that insecurity of employment plays a role.
We also know that those who are harassed suffer more stress than others.
We know that those with high-pressure jobs also suffer more.
The issue is one of security in working life and the organisation of work.
What are the consequences of harassment?
Harassment naturally has consequences for the individual, who feels less well, is absent from work more often and is ill more often.
The whole team, including those who are not themselves being bullied, functions less well.
Bullying also has consequences for companies in the form of lower productivity, reduced profitability and poorer working conditions within the company
I have been asked why the EU should concern itself with these issues and what all this has to do with the Community.
Well, harassment in the workplace is a problem common to all Member States, but it receives very different attention in different places.
In recent years, we have increasingly started to talk about more job opportunities and better workplaces, that is, about the quality of working life.
Quality in working life is about health and safety and the organisation of work, and so harassment in the workplace is a problem.
The EU has had legislation for a long time regarding health and safety at work.
What do we need to do?
Firstly, we have to review the definition of harassment and, at the same time, try to obtain a common definition.
We have to obtain significantly better statistical data, and the Dublin Foundation and Eurostat have a future role to play in this connection.
We also have to work on the open coordination method.
Member States need to develop their legislation, regulations, etc. so that best practice prevails, and that means looking at each others' solutions.
The Lisbon Process also includes qualitative indicators.
Where does legislation come in?
Should we state in advance that legislation is not needed in this area, bordering as it does upon another area in which the EU already has legislation, namely that of health and safety?
We currently have a major ongoing debate on health and safety in which it is assumed that it is not only the physical, but also the psycho-social, working environment which has an impact and which will be of ever greater significance for the new working life of the future.
Women in particular are affected by atypical jobs, insecure employment, etc.
The issue of legislation is highlighted in two points in the report, although it is not stated that we definitely should have legislation or how such legislation should be formulated.
In issuing its communications about a Community strategy concerning health and safety at work and the strengthening of the quality dimension in employment and social policy, as well as in publishing its Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility, the Commission is urged to take account of the problem of harassment in the workplace and to consider the need for legislation.
Of course, it is possible that the Commission will say that we do not need, and will not have, such legislation.
In that case, we shall have to conduct an analysis, but I find it pretty incomprehensible why the possibility of legislation should be ruled out in advance.
It is likely that the framework directive on health and safety at work also covers aspects of the psycho-social working environment, but we would like clarification on this point.
If we receive such clarification, there is no problem but, otherwise, the scope of the framework directive will have to be expanded to include the essential 'new' area.
In this context, it must also be considered whether there is a need for some kind of regulations or legislation regarding harassment in the workplace.
Let me take an example from my own country.
We have framework legislation which states that the employer is responsible for dealing with harassment in the workplace when this occurs.
It does not state in detail how, in fact, it should be dealt with, but it is clear that the employer has a responsibility.
Paragraph 24 of the report urges the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the situation regarding harassment in the workplace and then to present an action programme.
This is probably the most important point in the whole report.
Mr President, first of all, allow me to congratulate the instigator of this report, Mr Andersson: he has tackled a new issue that is regulated in some measure in only a few Member States.
I welcome the fact that, as frequently happens, Europe leads the way in a number of cases.
Well done.
Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities give its opinion specifically on this subject matter?
It is, of course, a problem which affects men and women alike, but our committee considered that women often, far more often in fact, fall victim to this and other kinds of harassment, which very often lead to sexual harassment.
Our committee therefore had its role to fulfil and has issued its advice.
I think that we should all be aware of the fact that this is a new problem.
We can learn from the measures which many Member States have taken in terms of sexual violence, for coming up with a policy to tackle moral intimidation in the work place is not so easy or self-evident.
But there are a number of Member States that are attempting to do just that, and many Member States have experience of combating sexual violence.
What can we do?
First of all, a preventive approach can be adopted, which means that companies must make it clear to their staff that they do not tolerate harassment at work.
That would introduce a preventive stance.
Secondly, an intermediary could be appointed who could mediate between two parties if a problem arises.
To reach a solution in a company via mediation is always preferable to one of the parties having to take matters to court.
I prefer this type of solution.
Thirdly, if a solution is difficult to find, the management could impose penalties.
Fourthly, the option of going to court must at any rate remain open.
The above appear to me to be practical solutions which we could put in place.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been intending to discuss the problem of workplace harassment here in the European Parliament for some time.
The debate has been a long time coming, for the question which has always arisen is this: is this House the right forum for this debate?
Some members of my group reject the report because they believe that this is not a European issue.
The majority will follow my recommendation and vote for the report, because it is indeed a Europe-wide issue and problem.
Bullying exists in every country of the European Union, in all sectors, and even in the EU institutions themselves. It is a difficult issue.
It is very embarrassing for many people, and a large number of cases go unreported because no one really wants to talk about it. Victims feel ashamed, exploited and stressed.
Their distress often has a high cost, not only in terms of their own mental and physical health, but also economically: sick leave, medical and treatment expenses, a high staff turnover, lower productivity, a loss of quality and image for the company or institution, and therefore also a decline in the number of customers.
Bullying causes all these problems.
The dignity of every individual should not be upheld solely on paper and in the Basic Law, but also in our social relations.
A little more respect and fairness and a little less egotism would probably make our debate about harassment unnecessary.
European legislation is unsuitable as a means to address the causes of bullying and is likely to be ineffective.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for including my ideas in his report.
Measures to tackle bullying should focus primarily on the Member State and actively include the social partners.
It is in companies' own interests to ensure that these incidents do not occur within their organisations.
Due to the difficulties in arriving at a precise definition, the Commission will not find it easy to draft its proposed Green Paper.
However, there are a few models of good practice in tackling bullying here in the European Union, and I believe that everyone should learn from each other.
Tasks must be assigned effectively to the most appropriate levels; this will also increase the desire to take action and ensure that this difficult issue is taken seriously.
I want first of all on behalf of my group to thank the rapporteur for this report.
It is an important report because harassment is a far too prevalent problem in the workplace.
My group will be supporting the report as it stands in its entirety and will not be expecting or requesting any deletions of parts of paragraphs or phrases.
It is a sad fact that the Dublin Foundation has found that over 15 million people have reported violence, sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace.
It should not be allowed to continue because this kind of bullying and harassment can be fatal and has in many instances resulted in people either taking their own lives or, through misadventure in the workplace, in others taking their lives.
It seems to me therefore that it is something which the Commission and the Parliament should address.
Legislation is in place in Ireland, as part of the health and safety legislation, to ensure that large companies put in place codes of practice to deal with bullying.
However, it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation.
I came across a case recently where a young man starting in a job in a state company was bullied consistently by older men in the job, not by women, but by men, who simply did not want him in that job because they felt threatened by his presence.
They did not succeed in forcing him out of that job but it was extraordinary that this should occur in this day and age.
It is true that the trends emerging over the last ten years, as shown by the Dublin Foundation, have been on the rise.
It is clear also that this is largely due to insecurity in the workplace and changes in the nature of work.
Typical work is causing stresses and strains which are being reflected in this kind of activity, so I support the call by the rapporteur for a communication from the Commission by next year and a programme of action by the Commission by the end of next year.
Could I say before I sit down on an entirely different matter, but one related to the work of the Commission, that I would appeal to the Commissioner to ask our colleagues in the Commission to take steps to relax the rules and regulations governing state aid for the aviation industry, otherwise we are going to have to deal with tens of thousands of workers right across Europe who could well be unemployed in the not too distant future.
This is what I call harassment in the workplace.
I cannot speak without people smoking behind me and that gives me an asthma attack and that is harassment.
I congratulate Mr Andersson on his report.
It is important for action at both national and European level because, as we have heard, 12 million people are harassed or bullied in the workplace every year.
There are many forms of harassment and as I said, smoking in the workplace in no-smoking areas is a form of harassment.
It can also have devastating effects, both physically and pyschologically.
The level of stress caused by bullying and harassment in a workplace is tremendous.
Disabled people, women and in particular, ethnic minorities, suffer a great deal.
They can be doubly discriminated against and are harassed simply because they come from those disadvantaged, discriminated groups.
I am also glad that Mr Andersson referred to those on short-term contracts because again we have evidence that those too, are bullied.
But can I turn quickly to the reason for the split votes that the ELDR has asked for on paragraphs 8 and 13.
I believe that it is a role of the European Union to have common guidelines, best practice and benchmarking across the Member States, but I do not believe that we need more binding legislation: that is a role for the Member States and a question of subsidiarity.
So although I agree with much of Mr Andersson's report, I disagree with the fact that we should have binding legislation and that is why we have called for the split vote.
Mr President, my group would also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for his work on this excellent own-initiative report: it has been a very good evening for those.
As has already been said, we should not underestimate the effect that harassment in all its forms has on people's lives and health and the long-term mental and psychological problems we have heard about.
If we are looking at figures, then if we were to take this Parliament as an example, we would be looking at a group roughly the size of the Liberal Democrat group as the percentage of those suffering harassment.
Up to now, very little has really been done to address the problem of harassment generally, so this report is especially welcome as it allows an open debate on an issue that has all too often been ignored.
A French survey also reveals that 70% of harassment of victims are women and this applies at all points of the employment process, so not only do you get paid less, you get harassed as well, and chauvinist and sexist connotations, which are more often targeted at women than at men, can frequently turn into something more serious.
Therefore the Commission should give particular attention to ways of tackling this unacceptable situation for women in Europe.
Mr Andersson is right, employers must have the responsibility for preventing harassment in the workplace, not colluding with it, or practising it.
However the framework directive on health and safety at work does not clarify whether employers are responsible for the mental, psycho-social or social working environment, so I believe steps should be taken to revise the directive to include this definition.
Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work, although we do not have a definition of harassment, perhaps because harassment takes many forms and is difficult to define.
I would like to express my solidarity with, and sympathy for, Mrs Lynne, who has just told us of a new form of harassment.
By way of analysis, an acceptable definition seems to me to be that of the Irish working group for the prevention of harassment, which defines it as direct or indirect, inappropriate and repeated behaviour of a verbal, physical or other nature, directed by one or more persons against a third party or parties in the workplace and/or in the execution of their work, which may justifiably be considered to violate an individual' s right to dignity at work.
And, of course, an isolated incident of behaviour such as that described in the definition may constitute an affront to dignity at work, but an individual and isolated incident would not be considered harassment.
We can accept this definition or any other.
The fact is that up to 12 million people in the European Union claim to have been morally harassed over the last twelve months, women appear to be victims of harassment to a greater extent than men and certain sectors of activity seem to be particularly affected.
Harassment has repercussions for the economy of the company, leads to absenteeism, inefficiency and low productivity.
For society, harassment may lead to medical and psychological costs, sick leave, early retirement, etc. Above all it affects the worker and presents risks which add to problems of physical violence and ergonomic issues.
Furthermore, there remains much to do in order to eliminate risks to health, both of a physical and chemical origin.
Above all, moral harassment, pestering - which is one possible name for it - seems to me incompatible with Article 1 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'Human dignity is inviolable.
It must be respected and protected' .
Harassment therefore constitutes a risk to health but above all an attack on the person' s dignity.
I therefore welcome this initiative aimed at preventing harassment in the workplace and at preventing workers suffering the pain of helplessness.
Mr President, the question of harassment in the workplace relates directly to respect for fundamental personal rights, the right to dignity and the right to participate in economic and social life on equal terms.
In his initiative, Mr Andersson has revealed new aspects to us which need to be borne in mind when it comes to the material application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to a more integrated approach to policy on employment standards.
Most importantly, we should welcome this initiative because it gives us an opportunity, with an issue which is played down and which is usually included in our interests as an afterthought, to see how important it is if we are to issue a successful series of policies, such as a policy against discrimination and exclusion, a policy for the disabled, a policy for unemployment and employment standards.
Only once all employees feel safe in the workplace from harassment from colleagues and superiors, once all employees, rather than being ridiculed for their disadvantages, feel comfortable in the work environment, then the groups - and there are a lot of them - which fall victim to harassment will choose to enter the labour market and the fruits of their labour will far exceed any weaknesses they may have.
If we bear in mind that, according to the statistics, the number of people which make up these vulnerable groups is over 8%, the political dimension is easy to see.
At the same time, there are numerous groups which fall victim to harassment, from women and the disabled to foreigners and people of a different faith. This gives us an idea of the size of the problem.
We must use this report as a springboard to draw up a plan to combat all levels of harassment, which starts as simple sarcasm and disdain, coupled with intimidation, humiliation and undermining, and ends up in more violent acts, a plan which will be applied irrespective of whether it is top-down harassment of an employee by a superior, bottom-up harassment or horizontal harassment.
In addition to measures to ban harassment, the action plan must require employers to foster a climate of non-harassment between colleagues, accompanied by mutual encouragement between colleagues in the workplace.
And because no one is deliberately bad, it must be flanked by measures to abolish distrust and superstition towards the people which make up these groups.
Mr President, the report we are discussing today concerns 12 to 15 million people in Europe, that is, between 8% and 10% of European workers.
There are three aspects to this modern evil.
There is an economic aspect, since according to the report of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions the deterioration in working conditions over the past 10 years is due to the faster working rate and to flexibility in all its forms.
There is a sociological aspect, symptomatic of the individualism that is increasingly threatening to take over our society.
There is a psychological aspect, which makes harassment particularly odious and can sometimes cause individuals to suffer a breakdown without leaving the slightest trace.
At present there is a serious legal vacuum at national level and a wide disparity at European level, which, however, is being counteracted by an increasingly solid body of case law.
That is why this report, which is well documented and rigorous, provides a highly encouraging response and sends out a strong signal to the working environment.
In paragraph 12, among the envisaged measures, it emphasises the need for more serious dialogue on this subject between all the social partners and the appointment of an independent external mediator, as also advocated in the amendment I tabled, which I regard as an important guarantee of real progress in this field.
But it is up to all the European institutions to continue to fight an evil that is now firmly entrenched, as they have been urged to do since the European Social Charter.
I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposal to call on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and to present a Community action programme by next year.
On behalf of my group I also support the inclusion of these matters in the Green Paper discussions on corporate social responsibility.
We must all support this fight, at our own level, persuaded as we are that society as a whole will enjoy the benefits of balance within society and within individuals.
Mr President, around 12 million people in the EU are reported to have been subjected to bullying at work.
The real figure is far higher.
The victims suffer exclusion and harassment, rumours are spread about them, they are deliberately denied information and scapegoated.
Managers or staff - anyone can become a victim or a bully.
The impact of harassment is still completely underestimated, so very few effective instruments are available.
Yet it is a serious workplace problem.
It causes aggression and stress, sickness, resignations, staff turnover - all of which cost the economy and the social systems several 100 million euro per year.
Together, the fifteen EU Member States must take stock of the situation.
Best practice approaches will help us all benefit from an exchange of experience and devise effective measures to combat the problem.
However, solutions must be tailored to the type of bullying involved, which can be gender-specific, age-specific or racist.
Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report. It was quite rightly adopted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Almost all the proposed amendments from the PPE-DE have been integrated, such as consultation with Europe's social partners on developing joint anti-harassment strategies.
In practice, this will involve constructive conflict management, better internal communications, and the creation of support networks for victims.
We also propose appointing a confidential mediator at the workplace to whom employees can turn if they so wish.
Ms Diamantopoulou, we firmly expect the Commission to submit a Green Paper next year on the issue of bullying at work so that we can develop an action programme which will have a sustained impact.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his excellent report.
I quite agree that harassment is an extremely important issue, it is dangerous in the workplace and it has significant social and economic repercussions not just on the employee and the company but also on the economy as a whole in that it is one of the main reasons for falling productivity.
I should like to assure the House that the Commission is fully aware of the problem, which is why this issue is one of the important aspects of the Commission communication on standards released in June and one of the issues for which we are also examining the question of indicators.
Similarly, as regards current tools, I must remind you that the social partners need to provide protection and can play an important role here and remind you of Directive 89/391/ÃC which states that, when preventing danger in the workplace, account must also be taken of psychosomatic pressure which, of course, is not always easy to define.
I should like to inform you that an advisory committee of representatives of the Member States is already up and running and is examining the question of health and safety. It has set up a sub-committee especially to study the question of violence in the workplace.
This committee completed its work yesterday and we now have a general definition of violence in the workplace.
The proposal for an initiative and a Green Paper on this subject is not feasible now and I can tell you why immediately. As you know, the Commission has taken the initiative to overhaul its strategy on health and safety in the workplace.
And this report will play an important part; it will help bring about change and propose a new strategy on health and safety and for this reason I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Air pollution
The next item is a joint debate on the following reports.
A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants, and
A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Riitta Myller on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants.
Mr President, it is nearly three years since the Commission tabled a proposal for a directive amending the rules on the emission of pollutants from large combustion plants.
After those three years, we have this week finally reached completion of this - what I believe to be - very important dossier.
Nobody will blame me for saying that we have travelled an arduous road, a road that has also been peppered with painful experiences.
We have met with a great deal of opposition, not only on the part of a number of Member States, but also among some fellow MEPs.
There have been strong warnings and protests from interested parties, also from the electricity industry in some Member States.
Despite this, we managed to amend without any problem the original regulation in the form it was submitted and which, in my opinion - and that shared by a few fellow MEPs - was far too weak.
After all, the technical possibilities are not lacking, and in a large number of the EU Member States, those rules which we incorporated at first reading have long since been prescribed and form part of regular policy.
The original Commission proposal to amend the directive from 1998 was, according to the majority of this House, not a huge success.
Regulation was too weak and moreover, existing plants were excluded from the directive' s scope.
We as the European Parliament have collectively given real significance to the environmental policy, and I should once again like to extend a warm thanks to all the fellow MEPs who contributed to this.
We have demonstrated what it means if we really want to do something about this filthy air pollution, which is so harmful to people.
We as Parliament made great improvements to emission standards at first reading, and we also brought existing combustion plants within the scope of the directive.
Then came the Council' s collective standpoint. This was arrived at with the greatest difficulty, it has to be said.
Legislation was tightened up to some extent, but the European Parliament' s wish for existing combustion plants to be brought within the scope of the directive was accommodated.
But alas, each country stipulated its own exceptions, and had it been up to the Council of Ministers, we would have continued using old, outdated polluting plants ad infinitum.
In our opinion, the common position lacked all vision. It had become a pick-and-mix with something for everyone.
If I compare this with the regulations which currently apply in Japan and the United States, we, who all want things to be done just so, would have cut a very poor figure with the Council' s emission regulations during the discussions on Kyoto.
There were calls that it was not necessary to prescribe regulations for combustion plants because this was to be addressed by Mrs Myller' s very fine report on emission ceilings, and that there was therefore no need to interfere as a European authority until those emission ceilings were in place, for everything was to be regulated on that basis, every Member State adopting them as a binding measure.
But things on that front too ultimately took a different turn.
If we were to meet the expectations of those in favour of liberalising the energy market, in other words, if we did not prescribe any regulations or if we agreed to exceptions in order to generate electricity using old, polluting power stations, we believe that the market mechanism would be disrupted, and those who neglect the environment would be rewarded with a head-start, because they would be able to charge lower energy prices with their old power stations.
Since the Council refused to accept Parliament' s amendments, we had to resort to conciliation, whereby the present report was combined with the report by Mrs Riitta Myller. I would like to thank her too.
She proved to be an excellent partner in those negotiations.
In fact, during the trilogue with the Swedish Presidency and the Commission in May and June of this year, considerable progress was made straight away where the emission reduction of SO2, sulphur dioxide and a number of major technical topics were concerned.
As for NOx and the nitrogen oxides, progress was only made with the greatest difficulty.
At the trilogue, agreement was reached provisionally on the Commission' s obligation to extend monitoring - for which we have Mr Hans Blokland to thank - to include emissions of heavy metals.
In addition, the Council met Parliament half-way and deleted certain exceptions, especially for certain plants which are fired with solid fuels and native brown coal.
Unfortunately, during the first meeting, we failed to reach genuine agreement on what strikes me as the most important point, namely NOx.
After first reading, we made huge progress when the Council agreed to allow old plants to be brought within the scope of the directive.
That was important because those old plants are often least efficient in terms of energy, and also emit a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gases.
By means of the compromise achieved by conciliation, the European Parliament managed to tighten the proposed limits for SO2 and NOx.
The Council agreed, straight away in fact, to a considerable reduction in SO2, especially for the medium-size and large combustion plants, for that is where it matters most.
With regard to NOx emissions, we as Parliament upheld the reduction of NOx limits for large combustion plants between 650 mg per cubic metre and 200 mg for those plants which run on solid fuels.
These limits, however, only apply from 2016 to new and existing plants.
That is, in fact, too late.
As I stated earlier, a number of Member States introduced these standards some three years ago.
We did not object to this for it marked a huge step forward, also in view of the fact that this is an important condition which we will soon be able to apply to the candidate countries.
Furthermore, we managed to reduce the exception which the Council wanted for peak-load power stations, with the result that the polluting emission can be curtailed in this respect too.
All in all, I am therefore of the opinion that conciliation produced a satisfactory agreement and that we went much further than we deemed possible at second reading.
I thank the Swedish Presidency. I thank all my fellow MEPs, especially Mrs Myller.
I thank the Commission for its constructive support.
I would therefore recommend, also on behalf of the delegation, that this proposal be adopted.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament' s objective with respect to this directive was to achieve the strictest possible ceilings for air emissions responsible for acidification.
Acidification, ground-level ozone, and soil eutrophication are interconnected problems caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and ammonia.
It seems only reasonable to examine these problems together, as in that way we could succeed in reducing emissions in the most cost-effective way.
On this basis, the Commission in its proposal had calculated for each Member State the ceilings they should achieve by the year 2010.
In both the fifth environmental action programme and its acidification strategy, the Community - the European Union - laid down its objective to guarantee that people would be protected from all known air pollutants.
The Commission stated in its proposal that at this stage it was unable to set 'final targets' for critical loads and levels: to achieve a final, long-term objective it was necessary to proceed via some interim target values, which the Commission set for 2001.
Except with regard to ammonia, Parliament approved the Commission' s targets in its second reading, with the addition of a long-term objective.
In Parliament' s view, the interim target values should be achieved by 2010, and the final objective, whereby people would be protected throughout the EU from all known atmospheric pollutants, should be achieved by 2020.
By the time it had reached the conciliation stage all positions were clear, and the Council clearly gave us to understand that it was unable to alter the figures, which it had approved within the framework of a common position.
Neither was it prepared to approve the long-term objective on the grounds that the demand that critical levels and loads should not be exceeded in any area was not, in the opinion of the Council and the Commission too, technically feasible.
The Council' s common position on emission ceilings was a long way from the Commission' s figures relatively speaking, but, nevertheless, better than the 'Gothenburg' values that most of the Member States had sworn by.
Approval of the Council' s common position would have meant that we would have been raising our hands in favour of improving air quality and protecting the health of our citizens.
At the conciliation stage, after some considerable amount of arm wrestling, with the Commission busy producing compromises, the main principles of the directive were pulled in the direction of Parliament' s views.
During conciliation the Commission' s and Parliament' s stricter emission limits were approved as indicative values and the Council' s common position was recognised as binding on Member States.
Indicativeness means the Commission is obliged to reappraise the directive in its reports for 2004 and 2008, taking account of future scientific and technological developments and hence the possibility of achieving stricter emission limits.
With these investigations it must also be considered to what extent the long-term objectives can be achieved by 2020.
The result of conciliation was thus to give the Commission the tools to make the directive' s target levels stricter and require it to study reductions in emissions in the long-term also, the aim being that critical levels and loads are not exceeded and that people really are protected effectively from all atmospheric pollutants.
It was quite an achievement to have this long-term objective included in an Article of the directive, but it was perhaps the most important accomplishment during conciliation.
The emission sources causing acidification that are the hardest to deal with are emissions from aircraft and ships.
We have made progress in this area too, and the Commission is being asked to propose measures to deal with this problem.
I would also like to thank Ria Oomen-Ruijten for her excellent show of co-operation during conciliation.
It was really most significant that the directive on large combustion plants was dealt with so successfully, as it will be a key instrument in helping to carry through this directive on emissions ceilings.
I also want to thank the President of Parliament' s delegation, the Members, the representatives of the Commission and Sweden, as the country holding the presidency at the time, for their excellent show of co-operation.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the Parliament's rapporteurs on the hard work that they put in.
They produced a result which they can be proud of. It was produced after an immense amount of work very late at night.
However, speaking as a British Member of the European Parliament there were enormous difficulties about these directives, particularly the Large Combustion Plants Directive.
I want to focus on the point that we laboured under the enormous difficulty that neither the Commission nor the Council really came clean about the impact of what they were proposing.
Nor did they give us an accurate assessment or help us assess the impact of what the European Parliament was proposing.
Mr Bowe and I, as British Members of the European Parliament, were faced with lobbies from Britain basically saying that if we adopted the Parliament's amendments, the British coal mines which are still in production would all have to close down.
We were therefore faced with the possibility of voting for amendments and voting for reports from our own committee which would have had a very serious economic impact in our own Member State.
When we went to the Council of Ministers meeting, we found that there were other Member States with exactly the same problems, Finland, for example, where the ministers and governments of those countries had never really contacted their Members of the European Parliament to explain the difficulties they thought they were going to have.
We also had the extraordinary situation, when we got to the codecision meeting, where four civil servants delivered speeches that really should have been made by ministers.
The point I want to make is this.
We need two things: we need much greater honesty from Member States and the Commission about the actual impact in the Member States of what is being proposed and what is being discussed.
There should at least be some advice on that.
Secondly, when we go to the codecision meetings we must stop having meetings between fifteen MEPs, one minister, and fourteen civil servants.
That is ridiculous.
Many of the points made to us on the reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller should have been made by ministers.
It is ministers we want to meet when we go to the codecision meetings.
Mr President, I will just simply say first as a British Member, that I would endorse what Mrs Jackson said.
Only the people in this room really know just how much work both the rapporteurs did to reach this final position and to get these two reports as proposals to this Parliament for a final vote.
We are your peers and we know how much hard work you did and we congratulate you both on that work.
It has been a very long time and this is one of the most difficult reports I have seen in twelve years in Parliament.
Finally though, despite all the difficulties and even the final conciliation, we have a workable and practical proposal.
It is not going to be easy.
It is going, in fact, to be extremely hard with regard to some of the requirements, but it strikes a satisfactory balance between the protection of the environment on the one hand and society's need for a reliable and secure source of power at an affordable price, which is something we cannot ignore.
Changes are going to have to take place to meet the requirements of this proposal.
The power industry will undoubtedly be required to replace some old plant, hopefully by some more modern sources of power generation.
There is going to be a substantial reduction in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions which are the main causes of acid rain and ground-level ozone with a consequent improvement in the environmental conditions for human health.
One possible side effect may be that as the general efficiency of power plant operation improves, we will see an overall reduction in carbon dioxide in comparison to the energy generated.
That would be a helpful and useful side effect of this legislation.
It will not be easy to put all these measures into place.
There is a long time scale.
That is acceptable and understandable in these circumstances, so on behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome these proposals and we will give them our support in the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I would like to welcome both the directives and congratulate both rapporteurs as other Members have done.
I have particularly followed the debate on the limitation of emissions of large combustion plants.
These plants are one of the biggest emitters of air pollutants in Europe after transport emissions and therefore it is very important we have stringent legislation to control this.
The inclusion of existing plants is a major improvement on former legislation.
It means there will be a level playing field for all plants including the worst polluters and some plants in the applicant countries, which can generate electricity more cheaply because they have fewer controls and do not have to meet the same standards.
Again, as other Members have said, we can reassure people that because of the various derogations and allowances for lower standards, which were built into the final compromise text, current power stations such as Aberthaw in my own constituency are under no threat.
Aberthaw coal-fired power station has been the subject of considerable press and media attention due to perceived threats to its viability and its profitability from this directive.
In fact the opposite is true.
The directive will actually protect jobs in the Welsh coal and generating industries in the longer term.
This has been a very important debate, because it has shown that there is not a straight choice between cleaner air standards and employment, as some would have us believe.
Work to combat pollution can go hand-in-hand with protecting jobs and sustaining communities.
My group also supports the compromise which tightens the limit values for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and introduces generally stronger standards.
The group also supports the results of the conciliation on Mrs Myller's report on the National Emission Ceilings Directive and we will be voting in favour of that too.
Mr President, I will confine myself to air pollution caused by large combustion plants.
I am still of the opinion that the outcome of conciliation has been overtaken by the current technical potential to reduce polluting emissions.
Bizarre exemption provisions were left in the directive, as well as the permission for large old combustion plants to pollute for 2 000 hours per year, and the exceptions for Spain, Crete and Rhodes.
Existing plants will continue to pollute the air enormously by emitting sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
Particularly with regard to nitrogen oxides, the outcome of the conciliation is saddening, since at the moment, the standards in the United States already far outstrip those which will not come into force for a number of years in the European Union.
Moreover, we already notice that much biomass is being used as a supplement in coal-fired power plants.
For these, far less stringent emission standards apply compared to waste incineration plants.
I should have known that as a result of the liberalisation of the energy market, equal environmental conditions would be used to prevent distortion of competition.
In conclusion, the reason why I shall be voting in favour of this directive is not that it will effectively fight air pollution, but because, compared to the previous directive, this new directive is the lesser of two evils.
Mr President, my colleague, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, deserves praise for her work as rapporteur at all three stages of the reading of the directive on large combustion plants.
We have before us now a revised directive that can be expected to have an important impact on reducing emissions from large combustion plants, at the same time, however, taking account of the practical realities of life.
I am grateful for having been involved in tabling the amendments of compromise and that first the rapporteur and then Parliament adopted them.
These amendments are still visible in this directive even after conciliation and, among other things, make possible combined heat and power production, which is essential from the point of view of sustainable development.
At first there was a danger that the directive would have made CHP unprofitable. That would clearly have meant a step backwards.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report, like that of my colleague Mrs Myller, are examples of how the codecision procedure can also achieve a successful end result when the subject-matter is very difficult and demanding.
These two directives are obviously in this category.
National limits for emissions and emissions from large energy plants are matters in which Member States have traditionally looked after their own interests and tried to prevent the setting of targets that could jeopardise the competitiveness of Member States themselves or that of the EU as a whole.
The Commission had to take this into account when drafting its proposal.
Parliament too, for all its idealism, had to take account of political realities.
In spite of this, the result can be considered to be an ambitious one. It will be important right away as far as air quality in Europe is concerned.
In addition, it indicates something important for the future: the EU is ready to work to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol within the framework of practical policy as well.
We still expect the Commission to make several important proposals this autumn to combat climatic change.
The two reports now to be decided on promise good results.
The EU institutions are capable of producing a balanced result, from which we can expect challenging results.
In the face of the facts of climatic change anything less is out of the question.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their tenacity and commitment. I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council, especially in the discussions about large combustion plants.
This House was determined to ensure that old plants were included in this directive as well, and finally achieved this goal.
This is a key area in which we have been successful.
However, we have not been entirely successful.
We have had to accept a great many derogations, extensions and lower limit values, not because no other option was technically feasible - for otherwise we would frequently have been accused of trying to achieve the impossible.
In this instance, it is quite obvious that upgrading existing plants to meet the standards in modern installations presents no problems from a technical point of view.
Indeed, in many sectors, this is already a reality.
No, the resistance focussed solely on microeconomic factors relating to specific large combustion plants.
This is a short-sighted view.
We must think macroeconomically and take account of the public health costs of pollution and harmful emissions.
In this respect, I simply cannot understand the Council's negotiating position on this issue.
However, as the directive now includes old plants, I shall vote for the compromise as well.
Mr President, neither the time nor the mood feels right for starting any sort of squabble - either with the Committee Chairman or with other British Members of this Parliament - on who has most to lose from acidification or measures against acidification.
Instead, I will try to be rather more positive and thank the British Members for managing to get through this directive and for ensuring that tomorrow we shall be able to make a decision.
To put it rather dramatically, this decision means that my region can come back to life and that forestry, the fishing industry and biodiversity will be given a chance to repair the damage which has occurred over decades and perhaps even a whole century.
This is an excellent example of the benefit of practical and solid European cooperation.
Through this kind of cooperation, we can achieve a change in my region which we should not have been able to bring about ourselves, that is, a halt to acidification.
Even if we cannot eradicate acidification completely, we can halt it and try to repair some of the damage which it has caused.
I look forward to the review which is to be carried out, as I know that such measures are insufficient.
Acidification will continue, despite the decision we shall make tomorrow.
I wish to thank the Members and the Commission for the work we have carried out together.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased that these two important additions to Community legislation on air pollution are reaching the stage of final adoption.
I join with you in congratulating and thanking both rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller, for their efforts, but I would also like to thank the President of Parliament's delegation, Mr Friedrich, for his role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion - unfortunately he cannot be here this evening - and Mr Provan for stepping in at the last moment in what proved to be one of the finest evenings of the summer.
The proposals on national emission ceilings (NECs) and large combustion plants (LCPs) represent a major advance in Community legislation on air pollution.
As you know, the NEC proposal would help to establish an ongoing programme for tackling transboundary air pollution by requiring Members States to limit the emissions which cause most damage, not only to themselves but, as Mrs HulthÃ©n said, to their neighbours.
The first stage sets legally binding emissions ceilings which Member States will have to meet by 2010.
It provides for a series of periodic reviews - in 2004, 2008 and 2012 - in order to reduce emissions ceilings more in the future: this review system has been strengthened a great deal in response to Parliament's concerns.
The first reviews will try to make up the shortfall by 2010 taking into account total emissions for the Community as a whole as set out in the Commission original proposal.
All reviews will look at how we can achieve our long-term goals of staying below critical environmental levels after 2010.
The year 2020 will then be taken as a benchmark.
In subsequent reviews, the Commission will report, in particular, on progress towards attaining our long-term goals and, with these aims in mind, will consider what further measures are necessary to achieve these goals, as the rapporteur has said, "preferably by 2020".
At the same time, with the large combustion plant proposal, new and tougher emissions standards will apply in the power generation sector, in particular for older power plants which are a major cause of acidification and ozone pollution.
The Commission's analysis of the common position on large combustion plants shows that both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from this sector will fall substantially as a result of this legislation.
The compromise on the LCP proposal will provide medium-term flexibility to take account of differing circumstances in the Member States as well as substantial environmental benefits in the long term in an enlarged Community.
Parliament has achieved a great deal in this debate and should be very proud of its contribution.
The Commission is pleased with the outcome.
By approving this legislation, the Commission will be under an obligation to return in 2004 to review both directives and present its proposals for further progress.
We have already explained how we intend to prepare for this first review in the communication on clean air for Europe which we presented in May 2001, and work is already under way on this.
In conclusion, I invite Parliament to adopt the outcome of conciliation and to join us in moving forward.
I look forward to Parliament's support for CAFE.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, my name is not on the list of those present at yesterday' s meeting, but I was present, as shown by the signatures to all my group' s meetings.
I would be grateful if you could have this oversight remedied.
Mr Santini, that will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, I sat here throughout the debate yesterday on the statements by the Commission and the Council in relation to the tragedy in the United States.
Not a single mention was made of the crisis being faced by the aviation industry in Europe as a result of this atrocity.
It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general, so that we can maintain a European aviation industry, particularly our airlines.
Otherwise, we would be in a very serious situation, particularly if, as is proposed, the United States provides aid to their airlines.
It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved.
Mr De Rossa, we have noted your comments.
The agenda for the next session will be set by the Conference of Presidents.
We will put forward your suggestion.
Decisions on freezing assets or evidence
The next item is the report (A5-0274/2991) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the governments of the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing assets or evidence (5126/2001 - C5Â­0055/2001 - 2001/0803(CNS)).
Mr President, this report concerns the recognition by one Member State of orders made by a court in another Member State on the freezing of assets or evidence within its territory in order to ensure the integrity of the legal process up to the final judgment.
This framework decision, which is an initiative by the governments of France, Sweden and Belgium, is to enter into force by 31 December 2002 and will apply to all the Member States without any need for ratification, a very important point indeed. This is the general position regarding mechanisms for the recognition of criminal sentences which have existed up to now.
In short this is about ensuring that an order made in one Member State automatically guarantees that assets and evidence essential for the prosecution and punishment of a crime and which may be located in any part of the European Union are not lost, do not disappear or are not concealed from criminal investigation.
In the original version of the decision, this mutual recognition mechanism relates to cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities' financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings.
However, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs considered that this classification of offences, which is limited to types of crime relating in particular to the functioning of the single market, excludes other criminal offences and especially, and this is indeed topical, the type of crime we are most concerned with now, crime relating to terrorism.
I believe that the new version of Article 2, prepared with the invaluable help of Mrs PalÃ¡cio Vallelersundi and approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, is far more appropriate and effective in the context of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is a matter of strengthening the principle of mutual recognition which will be the basis for the prosecution of criminals and criminal organisations in the European Union.
I think that we are now perfectly aware of the vital importance of this, and I therefore call on this Chamber to adopt Amendment No 5 on Article 2 of the original proposal for a decision, and ask the Commission and the Council to take this on board. This will bring the proposal for a decision before us in line with others which will soon follow in relation to the war on terrorism, as announced yesterday by Commissioner Vitorino.
Mr President, this decision, in as far as it goes, will make a small contribution to the creation of a European area of justice, but it is these small things, these small stones, that will build the foundations of a European area of justice capable of protecting our citizens.
In this way we can counter the judicial void that exists in Europe and thus fight against the inertia and bureaucracy of the institutions.
It is our job to prove to the public that Europe is also there to protect them, and that a European civil and criminal legal system is possible.
This is about promoting citizenship, of course, but it is also about fighting the anonymous and stateless crime which is so prevalent.
Not even the greatest pessimists would deny that these are steps in the right direction.
Isolationist sovereignty makes crime easier and helps criminals.
As from tomorrow, and I mean tomorrow, the date of the Extraordinary European Council, we will be speeding up the creation of a Europe of freedoms, that is to say the largest area of democracy, freedom and justice in the world.
Mr President, I endorse what the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, said.
The truly tragic events of last week emphasise the importance of the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
The coalition we are striving to build across the world to fight against terrorism is trying to find a cure to the problem, but there is also the issue of prevention in terms of security and diplomacy.
Other steps too are necessary if we are going to prevent those kinds of crimes from happening again.
The second directive on money laundering is already in conciliation and we are trying to get it through.
We have to recognise that at European Union level we need only one legal area.
It is illogical for people to apply for asylum between one Member State and another within the European Union.
It is illogical for us to have a situation where a warrant for arrest is not applicable across the whole of the European Union.
There was a case where someone fled to the United Kingdom from France and managed to stall his extradition back to France for the crime of terrorism.
He has actually faced the courts for a period of five years.
The series of reports we have before us this morning attempt to move things forward.
Mr Marinho's report is part of that initiative by the French, Swedish and Belgian governments and I congratulate him and them on this report.
A judicial decision in one Member State must have automatic application across the whole of the Union.
We must have the mutual recognition that Mr Marinho calls for.
Mr bin Laden has a London bank account.
One might hope that this report will make it easier for that account and similar accounts elsewhere in Europe to be frozen if that was proven necessary.
On behalf of the party of European Socialists, I support this report and the similar measures that will follow in the other reports this morning and in subsequent weeks and months.
The best memorial for those innocent people who died so tragically last week is to take action to prevent its repetition.
This is one small part of that process.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the initiative by France, Sweden and Belgium on the mutual recognition of orders freezing assets or evidence.
This is in fact the first fundamental proposal to be made since the adoption by the Council and the Commission of the programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.
I am also very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Marinho.
His report is excellent and as he has stressed, mutual recognition will be a crucial step forward in judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
As you all know, traditional judicial cooperation is slow and bureaucratic, which runs totally counter to the interests of the public, and the current situation highlights the need for swift and effective judicial cooperation.
I also welcome the approach adopted by the rapporteur in his amendments, and in particular the implication that this initiative does not go far enough.
It only applies to a very limited list of offences already harmonised at EU level and does not cover certain traditional offences such as murder, armed robbery and rape.
Nor does it cover terrorist acts.
The rapporteur accordingly suggests that the provisions of the proposed decision should extend to any offence punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months, and the Commission is totally in agreement with this.
Furthermore, the Commission is already advocating such an extension to the Council and negotiations are under way.
Parliament therefore has a good chance of making this initiative more ambitious, which would reflect the objectives of the Heads of State and Government, who established the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters at the Tampere European Council.
Mr President, it is in this spirit that I welcome the adoption of this positive and ambitious report.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
External borders and Schengen
The next item is the report (A5-0233/2001) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation (10846/1999 - C5Â­0042/2000) + (11329/3/1999 - C5Â­0043/2000) + (SCHAC 2533/1/2000 - C5Â­0729/2000) + (SEC(2000) 1439 - C5Â­0730/2000 - 2000/2015(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation under Schengen started in 1985 between five Member States.
The idea was to abolish internal borders so as to allow the free movement of persons and to adopt compensatory measures, including measures concerning police cooperation, the fight against drugs, extradition and the creation of the Schengen Information System.
All the Member States now belong to Schengen, although the United Kingdom and Ireland only partially participate.
In addition, two non-member countries also participate, namely Iceland and Norway, which belong to the Nordic Passport Union.
With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Schengen acquis has been integrated into the treaties and there has been a communitarisation of certain third pillar issues, which have been transferred to the Community pillar. This applies, for example, to visas, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation on civil matters.
In the process of preparing this report, I had to deal with a number of issues which I would like to see resolved as quickly as possible.
The first of these is extension to include the remaining Member States.
Whilst welcoming the extension of the Schengen area, the European Parliament regrets the fact that it has not been sufficiently well informed or even formally consulted on the changes that have taken place in this area.
We see the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which we regard as a positive development, as being a provisional situation and a step towards full participation.
Secondly, there is a lack of transparency.
Everyone hoped that the integration of the Schengen acquis would lead to a considerable improvement in transparency.
However, the results have been disappointing.
To be precise, the acquis was published late and not in full, and, paradoxically, the European Parliament now receives less information on Schengen than it used to receive when Schengen was of a clearly intergovernmental nature.
Thirdly, there is the issue of the integration of the acquis in the treaties.
