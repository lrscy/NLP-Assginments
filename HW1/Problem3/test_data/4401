Many laws are just a dead letter in some Member States, and permissible environmental levels in some cases are more permissive than in many non-EU countries.
The Lisbon goals are therefore appropriate, but implementing them in the era of consolidation following the great boom of EU expansion will require a lot more effort than before.
in writing. - I welcome the efforts to fulfil the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, but I am not very convinced that fulfilling its plans is practically possible by the set deadline.
It is, therefore, highly important to emphasise the knowledge-driven society.
Spending on science in the EU is less than in the US and today we are facing the fact that we cannot compete on the world market in the field of inventions or technology.
The EU and its Member States have to put more effort and allocate more financial resources to developing and updating European education and science.
The Baltic Sea has become an internal sea of the European Union, showing stable, high economic growth.
The Baltic Sea region has the potential to become one of the most competitive regions in the world.
The Baltic Sea strategy foresees sustainable development and growth, it foresees and maps all the areas which can be further developed, and therefore can in reality become maybe the only region actually fulfilling the Lisbon Strategy.
Therefore I strongly urge the EU, and especially the Member States around the Baltic Sea, to use this strategy to its fullest.
The Baltic Sea strategy has the potential to become a success story of Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - (RO) The fundamental objectives of the Lisbon Strategy cannot be achieved without developing competitiveness, taking into consideration all the current global challenges (globalization, climate changes, fluctuations on the financial markets, international markets openness).
In order to increase competitiveness, the EU should accelerate its efforts to build a society based on knowledge and to continuously improve the administrative capacity.
The development of stable communities and the coherence of industry and cross-industry policies cannot be achieved without good operation of the local and regional potential, by enhancing the competencies of local and regional authorities, and fully complying with the diversity and consolidation of inter-regional and cross-border relations and exchanges.
Romania has planned to follow the convergence process and to reduce the gaps existing at the moment of accession.
Its human and material resources are an important source of competitiveness for all the Member States, which represents one of the main advantages that our country's accession has brought to the Union.
The growth potential of the Romanian economy, of the energy resources and the overall natural resources, its attractiveness and territorial accessibility are an advantage for the interdependence of the European economies and we rely on the solidary support of the older Member States so that, beyond any conjectural and temporary dissensions, the Romanian resources would be showed to be an advantage at their true potential, to the Union's benefit.
in writing. - (FI) The EU has many good intentions, one of the older ones being the Lisbon Strategy we are now debating and one of the more recent ones being the latest energy package.
The means employed to achieve these purposes are not in line with the targets.
You could sum it up by saying that the Lisbon Strategy is not being implemented in the way planned and that the Member States are not actually committed enough to realise its objectives.
In a way that is good: the Lisbon Strategy is designed to run counter to the construction of a socialist Europe.
Non-implementation might also go the way of energy targets: they will not be achieved by 2020.
The markets are moving in another direction, and the EU does not go against market trends.
Given this situation, the Lisbon Strategy needs to be reconsidered: we should defy the power of the markets.
Commission Question Time
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) I am happy to reply to Mrs Jensen's question.
Pending the final reports of the investigations into the three accidents involving DASH8 Q400 aircraft, the Commission feels that it is premature to speculate about the factors which caused these specific events, as well as any possible design errors or construction defects.
The task of the European Aviation Safety Agency is, of course, to ensure the highest possible level of safety.
The Agency has monitored this case very closely, and is continuing to do so, given that 170 aircraft of this particular type have been supplied around the world and are therefore in operation today.
According to detailed information received from the EASA, there has been contact on a number of occasions between the EASA, the civil aviation authorities in Norway and Denmark, the Canadian civil aviation authorities and the aircraft manufacturer.
A number of things have been done as a result, including the publication by the EASA of airworthiness directives prescribing corrective measures to be taken.
A detailed evaluation of the landing gear retraction system in this type of aircraft led the EASA to conclude that the safety of the aircraft was not in doubt.
The Scandinavian authorities were therefore recommended to restore the aircraft's certificate of airworthiness, once the necessary corrective measures had been taken, of course.
The Scandinavian authorities informed the airline of the conditions to be met in order to have the airworthiness certificates restored for the fleet of aircraft concerned.
However, the airline has not yet provided the proof needed for its aircraft to be deemed to have undergone the inspections and modifications requested.
At this stage the European Aviation Safety Agency has not been informed that the Danish authorities have restored the airworthiness certificates for SAS' fleet of Q400s.
The EASA remains in contact with the Danish authorities in an attempt to clarify this question.
Mr President, this was the answer I wanted to give to Mrs Jensen.
(DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Vice-President Barrot for this account.
It is true that the disagreement that I referred to in my question may have been partially corrected; however, it is still the case that the Danish aviation authority does not permit SAS planes to take off before they have resolved the technical problems, while other aviation companies are actually using planes which have these technical problems.
I feel that the fundamental problem here - apart from the discrimination between SAS Scandinavian Airlines on the one hand and other aviation companies such as Flybe, Augsburg, Tyrolean and Luxair on the other - is that we citizens may not be able to expect aviation safety.
What would you do, Mr Barrot, to ensure that I can be just as confident in the common aviation authority as in the national aviation authorities, as it is after all these authorities that we are talking about?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) The EASA has given definite instructions which, if they are followed, will mean that these aircraft are airworthy.
There is therefore not a safety problem, it is just that the Danish authorities have not notified the EASA of the replies from the airline in question.
Mrs Jensen, the fact of the matter is that the EASA has issued full instructions for rectifying the problems that might arise from the use of these aircraft.
For the time being the EASA is having to wait for the results of the investigations before it can take a final view on the matter, but I would stress that the Agency has obviously given full instructions for the safe use of these aircraft, which have not actually caused accidents in which anyone was hurt, but which have, as you said, nevertheless been involved in accidents, and action must be taken to put matters right.
(DE) Commissioner, paradoxically the situation now appears to be that one European air safety agency is forbidding aircraft from flying while another, like the Austrian agency, believes they could so after all.
My question to you is this: will the EASA find things easier now, as a result of the wider competences we have decided on in this area, given that it seems - as you have said - that the company that produces these aircraft is creating certain difficulties at present?
If the EASA can now do what we have agreed, namely also impose fines and not immediately withdraw a licence, will it find things easier?
I think these wider competences we have decided will make things easier for the EASA in future.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Let me make it quite clear that the EASA has issued instructions, and all the airlines are required to apply the rules laid down by the Agency.
Your question is broader than that, however.
Yes, the EASA has responsibilities when it comes to certifying aircraft, and it has responsibilities for issuing design approval certificates all over the world, but it relies on inspections in the EU Member States to monitor whether the joint rules are being applied uniformly.
In other words, as you rightly said, we have extended the Agency's powers, but not to the point where the civil aviation authorities in the various Member States have no responsibilities whatsoever.
The Member States must carry out their responsibilities through their civil aviation authorities.
One day we will perhaps be able to go further, but for the moment the EASA has a number of difficult tasks to carry out, and it must be able to continue to monitor the application of the joint rules very closely through inspections in the Member States.
In this particular case I think that the EASA has done exactly what is necessary to ensure safety.
Member of the Commission. - Management pay is a topical issue and has been for quite some time.
In reaction, the Commission has taken steps to increase transparency regarding management pay.
The Commission recommendation adopted in 2004 provides for annual disclosure regarding both the company policy on directors' remuneration and the remuneration of individual directors.
The Commission has also followed up on this recommendation by checking whether it is actually applied by Member States.
We have recently made an overview of this.
The large majority of Member States have introduced high disclosure standards on the remuneration of individual executives in their national corporate governance code or in binding legislation.
However, only around 60% of Member States have followed the recommendation as regards transparency on their remuneration policy.
Only a very few recommend putting this to the vote in the company's general meeting.
There is scope for improvement here.
The Commission will also evaluate the extent to which companies adhere to the recommended transparency standards in practice.
Remuneration is a field in which some companies have shown strong reluctance to disclose information, despite the recommendations of the national corporate governance code.
We will look into this question.
(DE) Commissioner, you said yourself that 60% of undertakings intend to do nothing.
Now I ask you: what does the Commission intend to do?
I come to my second question.
We have now learned from an actual case in Germany that these gentlemen - for they are mainly gentlemen - not only earn very good money but do not want to pay tax on what they earn, which is why they go to Liechtenstein and elsewhere.
What does the Commission intend to do in future to put a stop to such practices?
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, I should firstly like to remind you of the Commission's firm resolve: however useful or necessary a project may be, it should never be realised to the detriment of the environment, public health or the cultural heritage of a Member State.
The Member States must take all the requisite steps to protect and safeguard cultural heritage.
This is especially true of their historic city centres, which occasionally suffer from the additional pressures of increasing urbanisation.
As for the question by the honourable Member, I should like to point out the following: the high-speed Madrid-Saragossa-Barcelona rail line construction projects have been co-funded only partly by the Cohesion Fund.
The Trans-European Transport Networks Fund co-finances the preparation of studies on projects along the whole length of the track, including the extension from Barcelona to Gerona and Figueres.
Nevertheless, resources from the European funds may not have been accounted for or used for projects connected with the Barcelona underground line.
It should also be noted that the planning and completion of projects is the exclusive responsibility of the Member State, which has an obligation to comply with and strictly implement the relevant rules of Community legislation.
In this particular case, there was no Community funding for the preparatory work on the section linking Sants and Sagrega stations, or for the tunnel to be opened near the Sagrada FamÃ­lia.
The Commission was thus not kept informed, nor did it receive a copy of the environmental impact assessment completed by the Spanish authorities.
The Commission is aware that the relevant Spanish authority, namely the Secretariat-General for the Prevention of Pollution and Climate Change, has approved the environmental impact assessment pursuant to its decision of 30 May 2007.
The text of the approving decision was published in the official Spanish Government journal in June 2007.
The text contains references to the effect the project will have on cultural heritage, such as on the Sagrada FamÃ­lia.
Finally, the Commission has not been informed about the study drawn up by Pompeu Fabra University.
The Spanish authorities are responsible for taking into account both the content of studies, as in this case, and public opinion.
The Commission will continue to monitor the situation.
We hope that no harm will be done to this historic monument of cultural heritage belonging to the city of Barcelona.
(ES) Mr President, I have no doubt that the legal procedures have been followed correctly; with a minimum of compulsion shall we say.
I am approaching the Commission to seek its help as guardian of the Treaties and I appeal to its conscience to reject the measures and to apply the environmental impact directive scrupulously in that capacity.
The fact that this part of the tunnel is not going to be funded by the European Union is beside the point as we are all aware that splitting projects into sections is bad practice and, indeed, one which the European Union has had occasion to criticise.
Why was the AVE not declared a major project requiring detailed impact studies given that we know that it will go under very sensitive areas such as the Pedrera and, especially, alongside the Sagrada Familia?
The spirit of Article 3 of the EIA Directive requires assessment to be made of potential repercussions on the cultural heritage.
The 40-metre-deep protective wall which is to be built is only one and a half metres away from the faÃ§ade of the Sagrada Familia, which weighs 40 000 tonnes.
Moreover, given the characteristics of the terrain and the fact that the cathedral is an extremely intricate work of genius, all I ask is for all sides to be heard and taken into account.
I am very glad that the AVE is on its way but this is not a party-political issue, it was the PP that changed the route and I now think that it should be changed once again to run along Valencia Street.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Once again I should like to stress that the Commission does not have the authority to intervene.
Certainly, the honourable Member is right in saying that we must take particular care in maintaining our cultural heritage and especially that of our architectural masterpieces.
Hitherto, however, we have not been alerted of any danger: the draft environmental assessment carried out has not been presented to us as incorrect.
All that has been brought to the Commission's attention is the matter of the petitions submitted to the relevant European Parliament committee by the Llave para Litoral association, the members of which want a shoreline route different from the underground one.
These, however, remain problems for the local authorities, regional authorities and central government to solve by applying the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.
They have an obligation to do so in order to maintain our cultural heritage.
(ES) Mr President, I would just like to add a few details and say, to put people's minds at rest perhaps, that full geological information is available for these works, the building technique is appropriate for the conditions on the ground, preventive treatment will be carried out before work begins alongside existing structures, there will be continued soundings to immediately identify the slightest possibility of movement or settling of the ground, there will be no negative impact on neighbouring structures and guarantees of transparency will be provided in respect of information provided to the public.
What I am trying to say is that I do not believe anyone has a greater interest than the Spanish, Catalan and local government authorities in ensuring that neither this historic monument nor the people who live in the area suffer any damage whatever.
Member of the Commission. - (RO) The Commission's Communication, named the European Indicator of Language Competence, adopted in 2005, proposed a detailed strategic approach for conducting a European survey on language competence, an instrument that will allow the collection of the necessary data to prepare a European indicator in this field and improve knowledge regarding the teaching of foreign languages.
On this basis, in May 2006, the Council presented its conclusions on a series of fundamental problems regarding the European Indicator of Language Competence.
As regards the foreign language to be tested, the Council decided that the European Indicator of Language Competence shall be decided for the official languages of the European Union.
This means that only living languages are aimed at by this project.
Consequently, the possibility to test Latin or Ancient Greek has not been taken into consideration.
For practical reasons, the Council decided that, during the first phase of the European survey on language competence, the pupils' language competence will be assessed for the first and the second foreign language of the most studied official foreign languages in the European Union, namely English, French, German, Spanish and Italian and data shall be collected for three competencies: reading, listening and writing.
Nevertheless, the testing instrument will be available for all the countries that want to make sure that the tests, other than those for these five foreign languages, can be included as national options.
The Commission will also take the initiative to make sure that the next stage of the survey will comprise all the official languages that are studied in the European Union.
(EL) Mr President, I see that teaching is not within your sphere of responsibilities, nor dissemination, nor, as I also mentioned in writing, the maintenance of the common heritage which springs from the Classical languages.
Is this within your sphere of responsibilities or not?
That is my first question.
My second question is, does the European research programme relate to research in these languages or not?
Do you know anything about this matter?
Member of the Commission. - (RO) The question I was asked was related to the European Indicator of Language Competence.
As I answered, only the official languages of the European Union are subject to this action.
On the other hand, the European Commission has no information regarding possible research or studies conducted in the Member States or in regions of the Member States regarding the mentioned languages.
(EL) Commissioner, as rapporteur on the European Indicator of Language Competence, I should like to point out that the duty of the indicator in question is to assess at regular intervals the overall competence in modern languages of all the Member States.
We agreed that this indicator would initially measure linguistic competence in the five most widespread languages in the EU's educational systems: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
Nevertheless, Parliament called on the Commission and the Council to take the requisite steps to extend this test as soon as possible to a wider spectrum of official languages of the Union, provided this did not adversely affect the teaching or development of modern languages.
Can the Commissioner tell us what stage we have reached and, if possible, which languages will be included in the next stage?
(DE) Commissioner, there is a Polish-German-Czech meeting centre in the former monastery of Haindorf in Northern Bohemia, where all the inscriptions and signs are in Latin.
Could we not do the same in the European institutions buildings?
Second proposal: could we not produce a Latin text for the European anthem that everybody can sing in unison, which the individual Member States can then translate into their own languages, while the common text would be in Latin?
Member of the Commission. - (RO) In the 2007 call for proposals, one network and three projects were selected, which address minority languages for financing in the lifelong learning programme.
Key activity 2: foreign languages. The network designed to promote language diversity, coordinated by the Welsh Language Board, aims at the following languages: Basque, Breton, Catalan, Cornish, East Frisian, Scottish Gaelic, North Frisian, Welsh, West Frisian, Slovak, Ladin, Galician, Friulian, Sardinian, Estonian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Finnish and Swedish.
The European Office for less widespread languages is one of the partners of this 3-year project, meant to facilitate the exchange of current good practice and the development of new and innovative ideas in the field of education and language planning in the context of regional, minority, indigenous, cross-border languages, languages of smaller nations and less widespread languages.
The 3 multi-annual projects funded in 2007 include minority and world languages such as Catalan, Basque, Sardinian, Sicilian, Irish, Russian, Arabic and Hindi.
For the period of 2008-2010, priority will be given to the projects aiming at less widespread European languages.
In the context of the 2007-2013 lifelong learning programme, all languages are eligible for financing, thus including German-speaking minorities.
(DE) Commissioner, did I understand you correctly that German-speaking minorities cannot receive support until 2013?
Surely it is the case, for example, that real minorities exist, like the Germans in the Czech Republic, the Poles in Lithuania, the Poles in the Czech Republic etc. So if they have media or cultural projects, they cannot receive any support at all at present.
Or have I misunderstood?
Member of the Commission. - (RO) The Commission has no intention to present a new programme of concrete promotion of the use of less widespread languages in Europe in the near future.
In fact, the Commission's 2007-2013 new generation of programmes, namely the lifelong learning programme, offers a broad range of financing possibilities for these languages.
All the languages are eligible for this programme.
Financing is accessible in all the 4 sub-programmes of the lifelong learning programme: COMENIUS, ERASMUS, Grundvig and Leonardo da Vinci.
This financing is also possible in the newly-created transversal section of the lifelong learning programme, especially by way of the key activity - foreign languages - which proposes the financing of projects and networks with the established purpose to promote the learning of foreign languages and language diversity.
Following the 2007 general call for proposals, a network and three projects designed for less widespread languages were selected for funding as part of the key activity 2.
For the period of 2008-2010, priority will be given to the projects aiming at less widespread languages in Europe.
In 2008, the available budget for the key activity 2 is of 9.9 million euros but, taking into account that the funding of language-related activities and projects is part of a dominant trend, additional funds are available in the lifelong learning programme.
(GA) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response.
Does he accept however, that it is important that help is given to lesser used languages in their own context and not to tie them in too much with lifelong learning?
These languages are vulnerable and if they do not receive significant support they will be even more vulnerable in the future.
Of course, financial support is important, but symbolic support is even more important.
Would the Commissioner agree that this should be increased?
Member of the Commission. - (RO) I can only repeat what I have just said, namely that, by the actions taken by the European Commission to support language diversity, not only the 23 official languages are supported, but also the other languages spoken in the European Union, including the regional languages, the less widespread languages.
Moreover, via the data I supplied, I have shown that this support is a concrete one, an important financial support provided to the development of these languages.
(GA) Mr President, my colleague Mr SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain speaks Irish fluently.
I am unable to however.
My apologies.
Could I put a question to you?
I agree with the premise of your answer.
Money is important, but is it not more important that we know how to teach languages better?
In countries like Ireland, where people, like myself, would dearly love to speak the language but came through a system that did not give us the ability to do so, we need to find ways of teaching us how to speak our native tongue, because we would dearly love to do that.
Member of the Commission. - (RO) The European Commission intends to present a new strategy regarding multilingualism in the second half of 2008.
In this strategy, the educational component will hold a very important place.
The composition and ways of learning foreign language will play a very important role.
As regards the Irish language, I would like to inform you that I have recently made a visit to Dublin, I have had the opportunity to discuss with the Irish authorities, at that moment and afterwards and I have insisted on the need for the broadest possible training of people capable to work, at Community level and not only, as translators or interpreters.
This is an essential element in order to be able to ensure a completely equal position for the Irish language together with the other official languages of the Union.
Mr President, I really expected to have an answer from the Commissioner tonight.
The floor is given to people to make statements and ask questions.
I have a question and I would like to have an answer to that question.
It is as simple as that.
Time is being wasted on statements tonight.
Could you please, in this case, let the Commissioner answer very quickly?
I will not ask any particular questions after that.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me say that, in the process of preparing for the new generation of cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013, the Commission has insisted that, during the negotiations, the Roma issue, which is of particular importance to the honourable Member, is included in planning and programming.
I must admit that Member States have responded very positively by including the Roma issue as a cross-cutting issue in many national strategic reference frameworks and also through direct references in operational programmes.
This is particularly strongly visible in the case of countries like Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia and Spain, but also in the case of Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania and Finland.
Due to the decentralised way of managing the Structural Funds, it is not possible for the Commission to identify clearly which projects are targeting and will in the future target, and how much money will be available for, the Roma issue.
However, our presence in the monitoring committee for the period 2000-2006 clearly shows that there is a multitude of very interesting and complementary programmes and projects which support Roma inclusion.
We have, in many ESF and ERDF programmes, either specific implementation allocations or support for Roma inclusion indirectly, through references to vulnerable groups.
This is, for example, the case in Estonia, Finland and Poland.
On the issue of the publication of data, I must say that, for the period 2007-2013, Member States, as you probably know, are required to publish details of the beneficiaries under each programme, but this system does not extend explicitly to identifying the ethnic background of the beneficiaries.
Nevertheless, on the basis of this list that we will receive, we will be able to identify areas in which the European policy is active.
Let me also say that DG REGIO has prepared, for the period 2007-2013, guidance for internal Commission work on the Roma issue, which has been used across the services in the programming period.
There is a Roma inter-service group working on Structural Funds chaired by DG REGIO.
Let me also say that in many Member States - and Hungary is a good example here - we also have steering mechanisms which are specially created for the process of new regional policy.
In Hungary, for example, there is a network of advisers of Roma origin to assist Roma applicants in preparation of the project at different stages.
The Commission is also currently working on, and will present by June 2008, an overview of all the Community instruments and policies, including the Structural Funds, and their impact on Roma inclusion.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that very comprehensive answer.
I would also like to thank you for your recent work in my constituency in London in sorting out our own Structural Fund problems.
Can I take you deeper into the question of identifying whether ethnic minorities are actually being targeted properly?
In December the European Council specifically asked you and the Commission to look deeper into this issue.
Do you feel, aside from the comprehensive answer you have given me, that there is some scope for identifying whether the Roma and other groups are in fact being targeted well, or whether money is being filtered in other places?
Is there scope for you to go further on this issue?
Member of the Commission. - It is actually Commissioner Å pidla who is in charge of the preparation of the Commission document in response to the Council request.
Nevertheless, through the inter-service groups we are all participating in this process.
As I said, we will have the information from the report on final beneficiaries, so we will know what is being done for the Roma or for other minorities.
We will not have ethnically-segregated data with regard to the background of beneficiaries.
Nevertheless, the area in which the project will be functioning will be absolutely clear, so, on the basis of this, we will know for the period 2007-2013 much more than we know so far.
Let me also say that the Commission, in its function as observer within the management system in the committees in the Member States, is also looking at and actively participating in the assessment of the allocation of funds in the areas important to ethnic minorities, so we have different sorts of information.
But I must admit that we do not have a fully-fledged instrument to identify the entire scope of the intervention taking place through the policy, but we are certainly very aware and we are using all the opportunities that we have.
We will see.
We are now preparing the input into the Commission document for the Council.
We will also see where the black areas are, where we do not have information, and what kind of action we might still need.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner if single-parent families and poor families with a large number of children are included in the definition of vulnerable groups, whether they are minority groups or not.
Further, can the criteria be combined and can benefits to groups of this kind be increased?
Member of the Commission. - With regard to Ireland and the allocation for 2007-2013 and the division between the two major regions, let me say that the Border, Midlands and Western (BMW) region, which is a phasing-in region within the second objective, will receive a per capita financial allocation which is four times higher than that of its neighbour, the more prosperous Southern and Eastern region of the Republic.
Of the total EUR 901 million allocated to Ireland, EUR 457 million will go to the BMW region and EUR 293 million to the Southern and Eastern region.
We also have EUR 150 million that will go to cooperation programmes, which translates into a per capita allocation of approximately EUR 400 in the BMW and approximately EUR 95 in the Southern and Eastern region.
Let me also say that the BMW region has performed very well over the recent programming period with the assistance of the EU Structural Funds.
The region had already reached 102.9% of the EU-27 average GDP per capita by 2004.
But I admit that the gap in regional GDP for the BMW region and the neighbouring region remains a challenge, which is why we hope that in the 2007-2013 programmes, under both the ESF and ERDF, we will see a further reduction in this gap.
(GA) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.
I would like to place the major road scheme, which is very important in remote areas, in context.
In 2006, 14 major road schemes were completed, but not one of them was in the BMW region.
In the same year, there were new road schemes under construction, but only one of them was in the West - in the BMW Region.
In the same year 11 road schemes were started which covered 222 kilometres, but there are only two schemes in the West which cover 25 kilometres.
You are correct in saying, that on examining the GDP or the GVP, for example, that it is clear that the gap is widening and that something must be done about it.
Member of the Commission. - Everyone in this Chamber will know that the Commission has been a very strong and present partner in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland for years.
For the period 2007-2013, a little over EUR 1.2 billion will be invested in Northern Ireland overall.
That will come from the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, but there will also be an additional amount of EUR 477 million allocated to the Peace 3 programme.
There will also be the IFI and Interreg 4 programmes, which will invest not only in Northern Ireland but also in the border regions of Ireland.
Looking at the past, which was also part of the question, with regard to 1994-99 and 2000-06, the EU will have invested more than EUR 2 billion for 1994-99 and nearly EUR 1.8 billion for 2000-06.
So, over the whole period 1994-2013, we will have invested nearly EUR 5 billion in Northern Ireland.
What is also important now, with the new taskforce and the new approach and engagement from the European Commission, is that we can have benefits over and above the financial allocation, deriving from the stronger involvement of Northern Ireland in European policies.
That is what we are working on, together with the Northern Ireland Executive and other partners.
Deputising for the author.- (GA) Commissioner, the support for the peace process in Northern Ireland and Border Region has been very successful.
Commissioner, can you say if this initiative will be continued when the expenditure period ends in 2013?
(GA) Mr President, I am in full agreement with my colleague SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain and we are very thankful to the European Union for its financial contribution to Northern Ireland, especially in the Border Region.
It is wonderful that there is peace there now and we would all like to thank the European Union for its contribution.
On examining the figures, and I have written a report recently on the International Fund for Ireland, we can see that more than five thousand jobs have been created due to this Fund.
Nevertheless, I fully agree with the question which has been tabled by my colleague SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain.
Member of the Commission. - Let me say, in answer to the question of whether we will continue our presence in Northern Ireland after 2013, that the IFI, which, as we know, is not a Commission programme to which the Commission and the Council are contributing, will come to an end in 2010.
Therefore, we do not know whether the international community will be willing to proceed with a second stage or second edition of this programme.
With regard to the European programmes, Northern Ireland is an Objective 2 programme.
I sincerely hope we will continue with the Objective 2 programme, because I do not believe in a regional policy which is just for part of Europe, with other parts left out.
If there is no Objective 2, there will be no qualification for Northern Ireland.
However, I also believe that the cross-border and transnational cooperation in which Northern Ireland participates - especially the new cross-border programme through 'C' - is also very important, because we believe that this interregional cooperation - especially with a cross-border dimension - is also very important to bring Northern Ireland closer to Europe and to cooperation with other regions and other Member States.
So it is open.
The Commission will certainly be involved in supporting the idea of continuing this presence.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is aware of the threshold that was introduced by the Scottish authorities.
Let me also say that the Scottish authorities were fully transparent, throughout the negotiations, on the issue of introducing the threshold.
The authorities were transparent not only with regard to the Commission, in our contacts, but also within Scotland, in the consultation process with all the stakeholders and partners in Scotland.
I should like to stress that there is an absolutely clear understanding that the threshold that was introduced does not exclude small projects, but aims to encourage those projects to group together thematically or regionally to reach the required threshold.
The Scottish authorities have committed themselves to ensuring that assistance is given to smaller project holders, so that smaller projects below the threshold can at any time be presented to the intermediate administrative body, which will bring them together, whenever possible, in order to build a more strategic proposal.
This is, in fact, aimed at minimising the financial and audit risk of funding to small projects.
It is also aimed at promoting linkages between smaller projects, to make them a part of comprehensive strategy, and aimed at reducing the administrative burden, which is often seen as a barrier to small projects.
So the intention is good, and there is a mechanism to help small projects to form bigger packages that would then be presented to apply for funding.
Very briefly, Commissioner, because I know we are up against the clock: if the Scottish authorities were to come to you and suggest a lower threshold, would that be possible, and would you look at it sympathetically?
Member of the Commission. - The honourable Member refers to the Commission's proposal to set up a European electronic communications market authority.
We believe that there should be a separate entity which is independent of the Commission and accountable to the European Parliament, and that this entity could assist the Commission in tackling the remaining problems of inconsistency in regulation, which leads to the fragmentation of European markets.
I have ongoing contact with the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) and I take note of their views regarding the powers and responsibilities of the proposed authority.
Concerning the European Regulators Group (ERG), which has expressed its preference for strengthening its own model, with a view to continuing to improve the quality, consistency and coordination of regulation across Europe, I would just like to quote the ERG: 'If Europe wants to play a leading role in the global economy, its 27 Members will need to work closely to ensure that business can take full advantage of the European market'.
That means that it does not today and that we need to find solutions so that it does in future.
The impact assessment accompanying the review proposals states that the European authority would contribute to improving the efficiency of decision-making, most of all in decision-making concerning cross-border actions.
We need this in order to build up the internal market.
We concluded as a Commission, therefore, that there is a need for a separate entity established within the Community's existing institutional structure, because the ERG is today outside this structure - that means it is just a private organisation.
Inside the institutional structure, it would reinforce the powers of the NRAs by taking over the functions of the ERG and giving them a foundation in Community law.
Concerning the question of the distribution of competences, the authority would assist the Commission in issues having impact on the internal market and would have an inherent crossborder character, and would draw, of course, on the expertise and the daily regulatory work of the national regulators.
This system, based on the experience of 27 national regulators and the experience accumulated by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), aims at reinforcing the coherence and consistency of EU rules, improving the decision-making process and contributing to promote a high and effective level of network and information security.
(EL) Commissioner, if a European citizen is affected by an administrative act, to which of the triangle of bodies should he turn in defence of his legitimate interests: to the national regulatory authorities, the European telecommunications market authority currently being established or the Commission?
Will the decisions of the authority currently being established be enforceable?
Does the Commission itself intend to bear the additional costs that will arise from the proposed revision of the legislative framework, given the existing asymmetrical development of telecommunications structures among the newer and older Member States?
Member of the Commission - The high-speed internet is the internet of the future, and we would not like this internet to be available only to some.
This is why the information society for all is one of the Lisbon Strategy postulates for open and competitive markets.
Because our regulatory instruments today, even before the reform, enable this open approach to the e-communications framework - it is also bolstered by general competition rules - this has made markets too open to competition, which in turn has driven the roll-out of broadband access networks in Europe.
I am worried that in some countries it worked well - these are the countries where competition is functioning well, where you have penetration rates of up to 37%, even 40% - whereas in some other countries the penetration rates are very low.
I would like to get rid of this variation.
I would like to bring those who are in the very low category up the ladder.
This is why the Commission proposes, as part of the reform, to enable the Commission to oversee the regulatory remedies put in place by national regulatory authorities, backed up by the possibility of the national regulatory authorities imposing functional separation if they think it necessary in order to open the markets.
In parallel, the Commission deals with anti-competitive behaviour as a priority.
For instance, in 2003 we fined France TÃ©lÃ©com and Deutsche Telekom for abusive behaviour in the broadband markets and, most recently, on 4 July 2007 the Commission fined TelefÃ³nica for having abused its dominant position by margin squeeze in the Spanish broadband market.
I would also like to say that a communication was issued in March 2006 on bridging the broadband gap.
I really believe that we need broadband for all, and this is why I believe we need to have national broadband strategies which reflect regional and local needs.
Moving to the question raised about transparency, the Commission is about to launch a web portal that should start to operate around May-June 2008 on the question of broadband and the citizens.
Last but not least, the Commission has a favourable view regarding the use of public funds, including EU funds - Structural Funds - to extend broadband in areas where commercial deployment is inadequate.
Several such projects have already been established.
We also support the development of information societies through regional policy.
A provisional estimate puts the investment at about EUR 15 billion, which is 4.4% of the total spending for the period 2007-2013, and of this figure EUR 2.2 billion is expected to be spent on broadband infrastructures.
Through these combined efforts we hope that the penetration figures of today - where we have, incidentally, four world leaders in broadband penetration - will make many more countries leaders in the world and particularly in Europe.
(FR) Commissioner, you have had to impose maximum prices for roaming, and you said last week that you might be forced to do the same for e-mailing.
Will you not also be forced, in the near future, to control internet access prices at European level?
I know that there are plans for harmonisation in some countries, which will reduce the number of operators.
Will this mean that prices will come down?
I doubt it, if you do not mind me saying so, Commissioner.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this subject is very dear to my heart, because it concerns children and their safety.
I believe that the new technology is wonderful for children, but it also has dangers, and we have to fight these.
This is why we have established two extensive European networks: the INHOPE network of hotlines, where members of the public can report illegal content, and the INSAFE awareness-raising network, which aims to spread knowledge about the safer use of online technologies to children, parents, schools, policy-makers and the media.
All these are organised under the Safer Internet Programme and are unique pan-European initiatives.
INHOPE's hotlines exist in 24 European countries, and it also has an international outreach with members in Asia and the United States.
The number of reports of child-abuse material processed by the network and passed on to law enforcement authorities has increased by 15% in recent years, so we can really see the importance of those hotlines.
The second network is INSAFE, which coordinates awareness centres in 23 European countries and also organises the Safer Internet Day every year - this year it was on 12 February.
We organised the Pan-European Youth Forum, where a number of Members of Parliament and representatives from industry were present to speak directly about their experiences with social networking and mobile phone use.
The EU Kids Online network coordinates researchers from 21 countries who focus on child safety online, and every year the Safer Internet Forum brings together non-governmental organisations, industry researchers and policy-makers to discuss how to fight illegal content efficiently, Web 2.0 and other relevant topics.
The programme also encourages the engagement of the private sector.
The Safer Internet Plus programme will end in December 2008, which is why Parliament will very soon have the opportunity to look at the review of this programme for the period 2009-2013.
I am sure Parliament will take an active part in this decision-making process.
We have seen good results so far and we can reinforce these.
The problem is not becoming smaller, it is continuing to grow, so I believe these programmes should continue.
Commissioner, thank you for that response.
Since the problem is growing and is set to grow, can you confirm that you will recommend that the budget will also continue to grow?
The budget for the last five years was EUR 45 million.
Are you aware that a survey in 2003 showed that 40% of children said that people they had only met online asked them to meet in person and in 2006 22% of them actually met the person. 51% of them never told their parents or their teachers.
In that context, what targets have you set yourself, what measurements have you set against those targets, and what progress will you be in a position to report to Parliament when we next come to renew this programme for the period up to 2013?
I strongly support this programme and I would urge you, Commissioner, to seek whatever resources you need to advance it.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Can I ask what action the Commission will take to intensify its work with parents?
That is the real problem.
Children are unfortunately way ahead of us in this area.
I am alarmed that this programme will end in 2008, and am also conscious that not everyone knows about it, even if many do.
I hope you will take this point on board, and I believe that you need to do more, proactively, to encourage awareness.
Member of the Commission. - I completely agree with the honourable Members.
That is indeed a big problem.
For once, children in our society know more than parents, which is not such a bad thing, but it creates problems for parents in helping their children to overcome the problem.
By the way, it concerns not only parents but also grandparents -very often grandparents are the first to buy a mobile phone for their grandchildren, in order to communicate with them.
And it concerns educators, of course.
That is the reason why we not only propose to expand the programme with an increased budget of EUR 55 million - and I hope Parliament will increase that budget - but are also working together with private organisations, such as SchoolNet.
The SchoolNet programme exists in many of our European schools and really tackles this problem in order to make the children aware of the problems and show them that not everybody they may come into contact with is someone they should be in contact with.
It also provides information through hotlines and the Safer Internet Programme activities, and provides awareness centres to make parents understand what is going on.
Very often, parents do not have any idea about the advantages and the disadvantages of new technologies.
I am responsible for new technology and I really believe that the majority of actions through new technology are positive ones.
I would not like a few negative aspects to completely prevent the younger generation from having contact with new technology.
That is why I also believe very strongly in the self-regulation capacity of the industry.
A year ago, I asked mobile phone operators to do something to ensure that, in the third generation of mobile phones, problems with the internet will not directly cross over to mobile phones.
I am very glad to say that, this year, the mobile phone industry came up with very concrete actions to inform parents and children about the difficulties and to block programmes which are dangerous for children in the third generation of mobile phones.
So progress is being made.
I think that maybe the European elections will be a very good moment for the European Parliament to bring to the attention of citizens the actions which have been put in place.
These are concrete actions.
You are right that not everybody knows about them.
So why not take advantage of the huge movement towards the general public during the parliamentary campaign for the elections to explain to citizens what concrete actions the European Community is taking in favour of society?
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
An EU Strategy for Central Asia (debate)
(DE) The next item is the report by Cem Ãzdemir, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on an EU Strategy for Central Asia.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their support and valuable suggestions for the report on Central Asia.
I would also like to take this opportunity, however, specifically to thank the AFET secretariat and of course also Group colleagues, who should not be forgotten at this point and without whom this report could not have come into being.
Let me mention just a few of them: Dag Sourander, Paolo Bergamaschi, Rosemary Opacic, Andrew Woodcock, Margaret FranÃ§ois and my colleague Rana AydÄ±n.
We in the European Parliament are discussing the report on Central Asia for the first time this evening.
I think this is a special moment for Parliament because it reflects the importance we attach to the Central Asian region in our relations.
Central Asia is becoming an increasingly important strategic partner for the European Union.
After years of neglect the European Union has recognised the need for a coherent strategy towards the five Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the five republics became members of the OSCE, which means indeed that they have also undertaken to accept the values, standards and principles we share within the OSCE.
Under the German Presidency of the Council, on 20/21 June 2007 the European Council adopted a common strategy for Central Asia.
That strategy offers the five republics a share in Europe's experience and expertise in key areas, such as good governance, the rule of law, democratisation, human rights and education and training.
The European Union's dependence on external energy sources and its need for a diversified energy policy in order to guarantee security of energy supplies is a common interest of both the EU and the Central Asian republics.
In that respect we have common interests.
Basically, however, when it comes to energy sources, we are speaking of two countries, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, for instance, have energy problems themselves, as we have learned again in recent times.
When it comes to water, the Kyrgyz Republic is rich in energy, which is why we deliberately mentioned it.
Here we are following the proposal from the Commission and embassies in situ to set up a Water and Energy Academy that can look at the question as a whole, from the point of view also of the environment and sustainability.
It is also in the interest of the countries concerned to diversify their energy routes, because it cannot be in our interest to see a further increase in dependence on Russia.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreements are important instruments of bilateral cooperation with those states.
The agreements with Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have already entered into force, while the agreement with Tajikistan has not yet been ratified by all Member States.
To date we have not signed an agreement with Turkmenistan.
The reasons are well known.
They are to do with the regime of isolation that prevailed in Ashgabat until the end of 2006.
We hope - and I assume I am speaking on behalf of everybody here - that we will see a new beginning in Turkmenistan and we very much hope it will pursue its democratic reforms.
Yet we must also admit at this point that there is still a very long way to go.
We welcome the first steps that have been taken in the direction of more openness.
We hope, however, that this is just the beginning of what we would like to see.
This report sets out clear objectives and priorities for relations with those five republics.
We must combine country-specific and regional approaches.
We are concerned with democracy and the rule of law, without forgetting human rights.
We want clear benchmarks that define indicators and objectives so that our partners know what they are dealing with.
I also hope the Commission and the Council will continue to call very clearly for the release of political prisoners and for media independence.
I hope too that the governments will feel encouraged by this report to take the necessary measures in relation to human rights and in particular will release all human rights activists unconditionally and without any delay.
One thing is clear to us: we will only achieve long-term stability in the region if it goes hand in hand with the development of civil society.
Without active civil societies and the rule of law there can be no stability in the long term.
Even if we want energy security for ourselves, we must not play off democracy against it.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ãzdemir, we too regard Central Asia as a region of growing importance and I entirely agree with you that it forms a bridge between Europe and Asia, has great strategic importance and is indeed a neighbour of neighbours, when you think of the Caucasus.
In fact, as you said, the Central Asian countries are now members of the OSCE and as such also wish for close ties with Europe.
It is important that we continue to support that.
We want to satisfy that wish and we worked together really well with the German Presidency.
We as the Commission submitted proposals that were then accepted by everybody.
As a result we have a new and most important Central Asia strategy.
I am glad that the European Parliament and Mr Ãzdemir have taken up precisely that question with this sound report.
It is indeed most important to make progress with implementing this strategy in the future.
Of course we must always remember that although the European Union has been active in those countries since their independence, we have now received a kind of new impetus and are devoting more attention to them.
I therefore very much welcome the clear statement in the report that the European Parliament encourages Member States to ratify the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Tajikistan in particular.
I hope the same will also happen in the case of Turkmenistan, where a broader contractual framework would also allow more intensive support for the framework conditions and reforms.
As you know, we have been providing bilateral technical aid for many years in the framework of the reform process, as also humanitarian aid.
So we are not starting from scratch.
There is, however, enormous potential for developing our relations further.
That is why we set out quite clearly in the new strategy what objectives we want to achieve through this closer involvement: genuine support for reforms in the field of human rights, democracy, support for economic development, investment support, protection of the environment, environmental sustainability, development of energy and transport links, as also measures to tackle common challenges such as drugs trafficking.
This strategy is also flanked by the European Union's strategy of regional aid for Central Asia. That supports our political aims and also makes major contributions to achieving the millennium development goals, especially in the areas of poverty reduction and health.
I believe it is most important to make progress in specific areas such as human rights, but also in education, in the rule of law, in important regional projects in West and Central Asia, in the water industry, in expanding the EIB's mandate.
You rightly referred to the dialogue on energy policy and to the fact that an agreement should be concluded with Turkmenistan on cooperation in the field of energy.
In that respect both Kazakhstan as also Turkmenistan are of course especially important to us.
In this connection, let me briefly point out that the EU House, the EU information centre, will open in the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat in spring, which will make our measures much more visible there.
I hope I will be able to open it myself.
Finally, preparations for setting up a delegation in Uzbekistan and for upgrading the delegations in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic are also going according to plan.
Let me conclude briefly with the latest news about the current energy and food crisis in Tajikistan.
My colleague Louis Michel is in the process of looking into the ECHO proposal to allocate EUR 750 000 for a range of urgent aid measures, and I hope that proposal will be approved in the near future.
I could certainly go on for much longer, but my speaking time is limited like everyone else's.
Draftsman for the Development Committee. - (ES) Madam President, as the rapporteur has said, this region requires a consistent strategy from Europe.
Consistency means complying with the European consensus on development and, in particular, the use of the financing instrument for development cooperation aimed principally at eradicating poverty and attaining the Millennium Goals.
It is, however, very unlikely that the region will be able to attain the goals and it is obvious that poverty continues to be one of the most pressing issues in the countries in the region, except those which have oil.
However, this strategy makes no mention either of eradicating poverty or social inclusion among its essential priorities, and neither does it place special emphasis on public health issues or on issues of elimination of gender-discrimination.
The Development Committee asks for these goals to be emphasised in any strategy which aims to be consistent with regard to those countries and with regard to the European Union's other policy instruments.
We welcome the fact that education matters, particularly in relation to primary school education, are mentioned as one area of cooperation.
They need to be, because education is the millennium objective which these countries are furthest from achieving.
We also welcome the reference to the ILO Conventions on the concept of decent work and stress that these standards must play an integral role in economic cooperation, investment and trade relations, in particular in combating child labour, which continues to be a most serious problem in those countries, especially Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ãzdemir, on his fine work and I would like to thank him for his cooperation on this report, which expresses the clear political will of the European Union for greater strategic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of central Asia, whose democratic and economic progress is important for global stability.
The report welcomes in realistic and favourable terms the progress achieved by the countries of this region in many different areas.
At the same time it is constructively critical of political shortcomings, especially in the areas of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, environmental protection and health.
The report was prepared with full awareness of the diversity of the countries of central Asia and with the conviction that it is of mutual interest to deepen the cooperation not only in the area of energy, but also in the broader area of politics and security and in other fields.
The aspiration for new dynamic relationships is also reflected in the proposal to assess the progress in cooperation every two years, and in the suggestion that the European Commission should urgently provide for the establishment of delegations in all central Asian countries.
The countries of central Asia and all the Member States of the European Union are participants in OSCE and are committed to the same values and principles.
Kazakhstan will take over the Presidency of OSCE in 2010, and it has thereby gained great confidence and will be the first of the countries of central Asia to take over such an important responsibility.
I hope that this fact will also contribute to further democratic and all-round progress in Kazakhstan and all the other countries of the region, and to closer links with the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that, where central Asia is concerned, the European Commission, the Council and Parliament are speaking the same language.
It is time to elevate the relationship and cooperation between the European Union and the countries of central Asia to a higher level on the basis of a clear and binding strategy.
on behalf of the PSE. - (ET) Madam President, Commissioner, unfortunately the European Union discovered Central Asia for itself relatively late in the day and I am not entirely sure whether even today we understand the region's importance in economic and security policy terms.
A glance around this chamber shows that it is not exactly the most popular of places.
In any event, however, the Central Asia Strategy adopted last year during the German Presidency and this European Parliament report mark a good step forward.
I congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his pleasant and constructive cooperation.
The principal issues affecting Central Asia are reflected in this report, including security issues, combating terrorism, energy, combating poverty, transit of narcotic drugs, trafficking in human beings, environmental issues and the development of relations with the European Union, regional cooperation and the challenges of globalisation.
The important aspects are on the one hand to take a regional approach yet on the other hand to assess each country on its merits, because although we are dealing with a single region here, the countries within it nonetheless differ from each other to a fairly marked degree.
The most important aspect of the report is the good balance it strikes between economic aspects and human rights.
As the countries in question are rich in resources there is a danger that interests may come to dominate over values in our relations.
This may be further complicated by the fact that there is no previous democratic experience in Central Asia, making the implementation of international standards there difficult a result.
The situation is made yet more complex by the traditional clan-based ties and the continuing Soviet legacy.
It could therefore seem that we are using the same vocabulary, such as human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, but the content we ascribe to them is fairly different.
As a result, cooperation is not easy but we must take advantage of the interest which Central Asian countries have in the European Union.
We are not, however, their only life-line.
In recent years Russia has been vigorously developing relations there anew, as have Asian countries.
Nonetheless, the European Union has a better opportunity than ever to develop its relations by using the ties and experiences which the Baltic countries, for example, which now belong to the European Union, along with other new members have previously had with the countries of Central Asia.
To conclude, it is very important to increase our presence in the region, although going by what the Commissioner said and the fact that in Central Asia we are dealing with countries where the majority of the population is, by contrast with European Union, young, our projects should focus on them in particular.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Cem Ãzdemir, for producing a successful report.
He has worked hard in this area and raised some fundamental issues on the EU and Central Asia strategy.
It is evident from the report that the EU views Central Asia from two standpoints.
The Union wants to increase imports of natural gas and oil from the region and diversify transit routes.
At the same time it wants to improve the human rights situation, promote democracy and equality, and reform systems of governance and the judiciary.
Finding the right balance for these objectives will be a challenging task.
The EU will need to step up the implementation of its Central Asia strategy, speed up the implementation of projects, and broaden its approach both at nation and local level.
I want to emphasise how important it is for there to be dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Central Asia.
At the same time the Union must also support relations between the countries of Central Asia and provide technical assistance for the fight against human and drug trafficking.
EU aid for healthcare, social and educational reforms and cooperation in the field of science will increase the number of contacts in civil society and strengthen European values, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
This will also pave the way for cooperation in energy policy.
I also want to mention the importance of EU support for basic and further education and training, which will bring with it better opportunities for study in the EU and for exchanges with students from universities in the EU.
The EU also needs to support and encourage the countries of Central Asia to take more effective measures in the area of environmental protection and in their quest for sustainable water use and for their use of other natural resources.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I too would like to thank Mr Ãzdemir for his excellent report.
Energy security, Commissioner, is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges facing the European Union in the 21st century.
It can be achieved only by diversifying our energy supply sources so as to free EU Member States from dependence on companies controlled by the Russian security services.
The main source for diversification could be the countries of Central Asia.
This would appear to suit both sides: the EU Member States, which are looking for other energy supply sources, and the countries of Central Asia, which would like to sell their raw materials at higher prices.
Meanwhile, extension of the Odessa-Brody pipeline to the Polish port of Gdansk has not taken place, and the Nabucco pipeline, the only pipeline that could carry natural gas to EU Member States independently of Russia, now looks much less likely to be built in view of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan's agreement with Russia last year on the construction of a gas pipeline along the shore of the Caspian Sea, as well as the recent agreement between Russia and Bulgaria and privatisation of the Serbian oil industry.
The result is that, owing to lack of solidarity within the European Union and ineffective EU diplomacy, our countries are letting Russia and China push them out of this important region of the world.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner what concrete steps the European Commission intends to take in favour of projects like the Odessa-Brody-Gdansk and Nabucco pipelines.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for devoting so much time and effort to the preparation of this report.
However, regrettably I am obliged to follow this positive statement with the observation that the proposal in question is extremely rambling and poorly structured, with many elements repeated throughout.
My main question is: to whom is it actually addressed?
I am afraid that there will be a sense of unease within the targeted nations about this text.
It will be a headache for these countries' diplomats, as they grapple with the task of navigating the criticisms contained in the report.
I think that for future reference it would be appropriate to separate the resolution and explanatory report.
I would like to quote the example of one of the countries in question, Kazakhstan.
At the end of 2006 the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbajev, came to Brussels.
I think that the Commissioner was present with us at the time.
On that occasion words of appreciation and praise were spoken.
On reading the report, however, the overall impression is that the acclamations were not serious or sincere.
Is the rate of gas and oil supply the measure of our objectiveness?
Do we not know that Kazakhstan has been actually carrying out a program entitled 'Pass to Europe', which reflects this Republic's sincere desire to move closer to the EU in the fields concerned?
I feel that the report does not offer an honest answer to the Kazakhs' question as to whether Kazakhstan can be considered in geographical as well as in more general terms part of Europe.
I also feel that the traditionally patronising tone of the report with which the EU addresses its illiterate poor relatives is inappropriate.
The text does not distinguish at all between the different countries in the region, be it in relation to human rights or issues of economic and social development.
The obligation to include among them the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia appears comprehensible only as an effort to unite under one umbrella states regarded by the rapporteurs as places of similar geopolitical importance, presumably as potential platforms against Russia and China.
Some of the wording in the motion for a resolution is questionable.
What does recital R mean it states that a number of different countries, have had, historically or more recently, vested interests in the region?
Does it express our support of the colonial ambitions of some European powers in the past or is it an expression of concern for the interests of some oil companies?
In addition, the statement that Russia and China tried to increase their spheres of influence in Central Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation does not make sense to me.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the admirable intentions of improving the EU's relations with the countries of Central Asia and the efforts to support local democratic and socio-political development have been, in the drafting of the resolution, obscured by the highly problematic interests of certain ambitious groups.
Considering the actual objectives and needs of the EU, the resulting text is, in my view, unacceptable.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr Ãzdemir rightly emphasises in his report that Central Asia is of major strategic significance to the Union.
He also says that agreements with non-member countries must be conditional on a clear commitment to human rights in the partner country.
Dialogue has to be clear and frank.
Turkmenistan is one of the Central Asian countries the rapporteur mentions.
Religious freedom in that country is a total fiction.
Religion is entirely state-controlled.
'Ruhnama' - the state religion and personality cult surrounding former President Niyazov - remains the standard.
Non-registered faith groups have a hard time of it as a result. They find themselves between a rock and a hard place.
Intimidation by officialdom curbs their religious freedom and they encounter problems in moving about freely and owning property.
The situation of the Russian Baptist pastors Kalataevsky and Potolov, about whom I put questions to the Commission last autumn, is just one example of this appalling everyday reality.
So I would again ask you to be good enough to consider the amendments I have put down, namely numbers 12 and 13.
Turkmenistan is a country that matters as the European Union seeks to diversify its sources of energy supply; that much is beyond dispute.
But it also merits attention on account of the position of the religious groups I referred to earlier and of other minorities.
The same goes for our other partners in Central Asia.
I am counting on your support.
Madam President, a partnership between the EU and Central Asia is long overdue, and I congratulate Mr Ãzdemir on his report.
This vast and strategically vital region is being pulled three ways: by China, by Russia and by Europe.
It is essential that we do all we can to ensure that central Asia's rational choice is partnership with the European Union.
Turkmenistan's gradual emergence from isolation provides the EU with a crucial window of opportunity.
Ensuring regular, reliable supplies of ample Turkmen hydrocarbon resources will diminish Europe's current overdependence on Russia.
This will require a new trans-Caspian pipeline to link up with the Nabucco project.
Uzbekistan, which was rightfully ostracised following the Andijan massacre, has begun to engage in dialogue on human rights with the EU.
This is a considerable step forward.
Clearly there is much progress still to be made before Uzbekistan can be considered a properly democratic country.
However, Uzbekistan is a vital ally in the war on international terrorism, especially with regard to Afghanistan.
For the EU, Kazakhstan should be considered the jewel in the crown of central Asia.
The country's vast oil, gas and mineral resources, including uranium, are an obvious attraction.
Although Kazakhstan is not a western liberal democracy in our tradition, it is making considerable progress as a multi-religious, secular, Muslim-majority country.
Given the fact that only 17 years ago it was a republic of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's presidency of the OSCE in 2010 will further consolidate the momentum towards greater political freedom and human rights in that country.
As rapporteur of the eastern dimension of the ENP, I once suggested that Kazakhstan might one day become a member of the ENP.
I believe that something rather like this arrangement, one day, will come to pass.
(NL) Madam President, my compliments too to the rapporteur, Cem Ãzdemir.
It is a pity that most of the population of Central Asia will probably have gone to sleep ages ago.
The European Union has long neglected Central Asia.
The strategy now devised is a welcome step towards plugging that gap.
As many speakers have said, the Union has considerable interests in the region.
We are opting for a realistic strategy that takes a cohesive view of the various facets of our relationship with Central Asia and developments there.
As our EU Special Representative, Pierre Morel, has said on countless occasions, there is no way an energy dialogue can develop unless we help with the construction of properly-functioning states.
And properly-functioning states mean democratisation.
There is no guarantee that the new strategy will succeed.
That will depend very much on how it is implemented.
We are looking above all to the European Commission to flesh out the strategy in practice.
Of course the issue of human rights must not be lost sight of in all this.
On Uzbekistan, I stand by my view that we must remain tough in our dealings with that country until such time as the regime there clearly signals that it is genuinely ready to move towards democracy.
Kazakhstan, an important point.
I share the general view that this country is pivotal in the region.
I do not agree with Mr Tannock that it should be included in the ENP, but we ought to look at ways of improving our relationship with Kazakhstan.
I have been there myself and was impressed by the country's energy - not just economically but also socially.
I am glad that agreement has been reached on whether or not Kazakhstan can take on the chairmanship of the OSCE.
I am glad too that that agreement, that decision, comes with a few conditions attached.
We can keep an eye on Kazakhstan in the years ahead to see if it meets those conditions.
One final comment. There are all kinds of things we can do in Central Asia.
But only if we also bear in mind the role of Russia and China in the region. So in our policy towards Russia and China we must also think about the form that our growing interest in that region should take.
When I was there, in Kazakhstan, I learned that to them China and Russia are not their only major partners; they also want closer ties with the European Union.
Our new strategy may prove a very good response to that.
Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Ãzdemir for preparing this very comprehensive report.
As chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries, and in connection with this resolution, I would like to address a few issues which I consider important.
Firstly, Central Asia has an obvious growing importance for the European Union and the world as a whole, no doubt owing to its rich energy resources.
We have many shared interests in promoting security and tackling threats such as terrorism and drug-smuggling.
I am glad that the European Union's strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia addresses those matters very firmly, as does as this resolution.
This region occupies a crucial geostrategic position, particularly as it shares a border with Afghanistan, China and Russia.
Therefore, we must clearly define our objectives and priorities, bearing in mind this context.
In 2010, Kazakhstan will become the presiding country of the OSCE, which is responsible for ensuring democracy and fundamental human rights.
I am pleased for my colleagues, but I worry about the people of Kazakhstan, where the current elected Parliament does not include a single opposition member.
All the countries of Central Asia still have a long way to go on the road to economic and political reform and the building of democratic societies.
The example of the former Soviet republics, including my country, Lithuania, shows that 17 years of independence is not long enough to fully achieve real change.
However, we must deliver our overriding message, which is that Europe will not seek material benefits at the expense of human values.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the achievement of independence almost 20 years ago by the Central Asia countries discussed in Mr Ãzdemir's report brought a complete culture change after years of enslavement.
Obviously, these countries used their newfound freedom in line with past practice and habits.
Change is hard to achieve in such a short time.
These nations endured through the centuries thanks to cultural difference based on long tradition.
That is something we should and must respect.
Change must come slowly, so as not to arouse hostility to our own culture and expectations.
Economic ties with the Russian Federation remained after independence, and are still strong.
Russian culture, its science and its economy had an enormous influence on what are now independent states.
Unless we build alternative ties with the European Union we are bound to fail, despite the expectations which these countries have of us.
We must start with the economy: let us replace Russian pipelines by ours, Russian technical plant by ours and the Russian language by English.
That will bring about a systematic change in culture.
Madam President, this report expresses concern that the new Kyrgyz Constitution, voted on in a referendum in October 2007 without wide-ranging debate, could alter the balance of power.
The Kyrgyz Constitution was amended in a controversial referendum in 1996, and in 2003 there was another referendum which approved further constitutional change.
The report goes on to deprecate, in the Central Asian republics, the 'anxiety to maintain internal control', which 'is a given in regimes which show little interest in seeking popular consent on which to base their rule'.
Hang on a moment, who are we talking about here?
Constitutional change that will 'alter the balance of power'.
'Anxiety to maintain internal control', with 'little interest in seeking popular consent' on which to base the rule of a political elite.
This sounds like an extract from a UK Independence Party report on the European Constitution - sorry, I mean the Lisbon Treaty.
I doubt that the five Central Asian republics are models of democracy and the rule of law, but at least when the politicians of Kyrgyzstan wanted to change the constitution, they had the decency to ask the people for their approval in a referendum.
That is something the European Union has had neither the decency nor the courage to do of the European people.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner.
First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and their assistants, since the report is very comprehensive and contains a great many references and documentary research, with a separate analysis for each country.
However, I would like to draw your attention to a few matters that in my view have not been tackled adequately.
Yes, I would also like to add that the Commissioner's description of the specific activities to be carried out in those countries in the near future was very welcome.
It seems to me, however, that in the report and in the European Union's strategy in general there are not enough strategic decisions or actions relating to these countries, whereas it appears to me that Russia, China, South Korea and India all influence those regions very significantly.
I would also like to draw your attention to something that I think my fellow Member Adam Bielan has already mentioned - on 10 October 2007 the leaders of several countries met in Vilnius to discuss energy supply pipelines from the Caspian Sea.
A week before that, Mr Putin, who is not at all a frequent visitor to other countries, went with Mr Nazarbayev to Turkmenistan and, offering a slightly higher price for gas, signed a political agreement to the effect that all existing gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan would go via Russia's pipelines.
Thus, in fact, we might say that he hurried ahead of the decision by our fellow Member.
Likewise, I think, a certain similarity can be seen to the events at Andijan, where afterwards, a few months later, the President of Uzbekistan was forced to demand the closure of the US base.
It seems to me that we also need to pay more attention to these aspects ...
I would simply like to draw attention to the fact that we need to analyse much more attentively and take account of these strategic aspects too.
Thank you.
Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Ãzdemir on his excellent report on the EU strategy for Central Asia.
Central Asia is part of the road which has connected the great Euro-Asiatic civilisations since antiquity.
In today's global context, the ancient Silk Road can be taken as a symbol of the high political, cultural and trade potential of that region.
Central Asia is the region where the European Union, China, India and Iran meet.
There is no doubt that the countries of this region - Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - will be one of the main areas of EU external activity in the coming years.
By the way, Central Asia is a region in which the EU and Turkey have a shared interest.
Turkey's cultural, linguistic and strategic influence in the region is one of the arguments for Turkish membership of the EU.
Let me make two points.
Firstly, the EU should provide assistance in these countries in a perspective of human rights, democracy and education.
There is a need for EU support for the development of civil society, liberal democratic change and the rule of law in these countries.
Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of partnership in the field of energy policy.
Special attention should be given to projects connecting oil and gas fields and the distribution system in Central Asia to pipelines connecting with the European Union, including future projects such as Nabucco.
Further strengthening cooperation between Central Asia and the Black Sea region in the fields of energy and transportation is essential for the accomplishment of the EU's goals.
(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, the EU strategy for Central Asia is a big step forward.
Increasing our common visibility through a special representative and planning to set up delegations in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan will give us better opportunities to conduct an intensive dialogue with the individual countries and will change the way we can work in the region.
Central Asia will become more important, in particular, as has been mentioned, with regard to access to energy that is not controlled directly or indirectly by Russia.
The region is composed of new states that need support in developing and strengthening their democracy, support in combating crime and in stopping the passage of drugs to both Russia and the EU through certain countries in the region.
At the same time these countries are of course important partners in combating a global breeding ground for terrorism.
The EU has an opportunity to show its benefit in terms of foreign policy, by using all the tools of soft policy, both aid and trade.
In addition, the EU can help to build democratic institutions and a working state based on the rule of law which respects human rights and genuine freedom of speech and of the press.
The Central Asian countries have a strong interest in creating an opportunity to diversify their oil and gas exports.
We in the EU must put forward effective, properly financed alternatives to Russian and Chinese gas pipelines.
The EU must accept its responsibility for our common energy security.
Otherwise there is a risk that all our common efforts will founder.
More Russian-owned oil and gas pipelines from Central Asia is not the independence in the energy sector that we should aim for in the EU.
(PL) Madam President, Kazakhstan is the Central Asian country I know best.
It is a large country stretching between China, Siberia and Europe.
Paradoxically, we count countries as Central Asian when part of their territory belongs geographically to Europe.
Kazakhstan, with a population of 16 million and over 100 ethnic groups and religions, is distant from us in its traditions and history, and yet the politics of this country and the aspirations of its people show a strong desire for rapprochement with Europe.
From the cultural point of view, moreover, Kazakhstan is more European than Asiatic.
It is grappling with problems, but it is a stable country engaged in democratic reforms, and stability in this region is very important for the security of the whole world.
We should support the process of stabilisation and rapprochement with Europe in Kazakhstan and the other countries of Central Asia.
We should support everything that serves to bring the Central Asian countries closer to Europe, especially as they can play an important role in ensuring Europe's energy supply security.
(RO) Ladies and gentlemen, as Rapporteur for the Black Sea cooperation, I would like to emphasize the major importance of the inter-regional cooperation between Central Asia and the Black Sea region.
I thank the Rapporteur for taking into consideration my suggestions on this theme and I hope that both the Commission and the Council will submit sustained efforts in order to put them into practice by implementing the new strategy for Central Asia.
The cooperation between the two regions and its consolidation represents an objective both for the European Union and for the countries of Central Asia and the Black Sea region.
This appears most explicitly in the field of energy and transport, since Central Asia represents an important source of energy resources for the European Union.
Consequently, I welcome the fact that the report is focused on two key ideas in this regard.
First of all, it is necessary to develop the transport routes and energy infrastructure connecting the sources from Central Asia to the Black Sea region and, finally, the European Union as an important element for ensuring energy security and diversity in the European Union.
Therefore, I insist on the crucial importance of the Nabucco project and I join the report in its call to pay increased attention to its successful development.
Secondly, a strong policy in the energy field also involves the creation of a transparent and competitive energy market.
It is important for the European Union to encourage actions in this direction, both by intensifying the dialogue with the countries of Central Asia and the Black Sea region, and by additional measures, such as stimulating the accession to the World Trade Organization.
Nevertheless, these objectives should integrate into a global strategy for Central Asia, focused on sustained stability and development.
For these reasons, besides the energy policy, it is very important to promote reform in all the five republics, while human rights and good governance, education and lifelong training should represent its essential elements.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mr Ãzdemir on his very successful report.
The European Union joined the race for Central Asia with very hesitant steps and was late to take an interest in the region, following behind Russia, China and the USA.
Until now, Central Asia has not perceived the European Union as a global player.
An EU strategy for Central Asia is long overdue, especially as a means of reducing its energy dependence on Russia.
The German Presidency initiated it.
It is important that we now see a follow-up.
Sadly it keeps emerging that the EU still does not speak with one voice in its external energy policy.
We in Europe should focus above all on diversification, on representing our common interests and on solidarity in the event of crises.
Yet the bilateral energy agreements the EU Member States concludes with third countries keep putting in question the European Union's ability to take a common stand.
But it is in the interest of the European Union and its citizens to pursue a common external energy policy.
We must not, however, regard energy supplies, which are extremely important to our citizens, as the only reason for EU relations with that region.
We are not trying to profit unilaterally from a strategy for Central Asia.
In that respect Europe must distinguish itself from other players in the region.
It is far more a question of helping the Central Asian republics to develop the rule of law and democratic forms of society, together with a sound economy.
If Europe does that, the citizens of the region should become far more aware of it.
Yet Europe must also move with the necessary caution, because advice from the West could all too easily be mistaken for patronisation or intervention.
The world is growing closer together outside the EU too and we should seek a constructive partnership with the Central Asian countries, a partnership that does not give the impression that Europeans are concerned only with what is useful to them, a partnership founded on mutual advantage.
(HU) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, 150 years ago, a countryman of mine by the name of Ãrmin VÃ¡mbÃ©ry was the first European to bring news of the closed societies of Central Asia to the wider world, and information on the cultural, administrative and economic situation of this region prior to the Russian conquest.
Even at that time this region, like the Silk Road, had for centuries formed an overland umbilical cord linking Europe and Asia.
Following a long period of Russian and Soviet domination, the five countries of Central Asia can once again assume this role of umbilical cord linking Europe and Asia.
In many instances, it is unfortunately already doing so; a large proportion of the illegal trade in people and drugs arrives in Europe via these countries, as does natural gas.
This is why Europe needed, and needs, a strategy to develop its relations with Central Asia.
Europe cannot, however, expect cooperation to be only about preventing the dangers emanating from there, or about gaining access to energy and raw materials, or about how Europe can teach this region about democracy and human rights.
We must develop genuine cooperation with this region, and this is why I support European Union efforts to promote WTO membership for the countries of Central Asia and their integration into world trade.
Europe must use all means at its disposal to foster the economic, social and political development and modernisation of this region.
This, however, can only be done on the basis of mutual trust.
This is why it is important to prioritise environmental protection as part of this cooperation.
Climate change, chronic problems relating to water use and rehabilitation of previously contaminated areas are all issues that warrant greater attention.
In parallel with this, Europe must rigorously eschew any project that pollutes the environment or damages the livelihoods of the people living there.
I have already drawn the Commission's attention to the criticism by Kyrgyz and Uzbek non-governmental organisations concerning gold mining operations using cyanide technology that are partly financed by the EBRD.
Europe cannot on any account support the use of this sort of technology, either within Europe or outside of Europe.
Thank you very much.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mr Ãzdemir and all the shadow rapporteurs who worked on this report.
With this strategy for Central Asia and this first broad debate in the European Parliament, we are actively taking the appropriate steps to promote dialogue and to meet all the challenges that still await us and which the Commissioner addressed.
This strategy will involve small steps down a long road.
I am glad that we will have closer cooperation and that this will not be a one-way street but an exchange of views based on mutual trust.
Today's debate shows us that we have to do a balancing act when we talk about Central Asia.
The various Central Asian republics present very different features.
We have very different requirements to make.
We want to import energy but on a secure basis, and we want to export democracy and human rights.
We want to combine the two, which is not easy.
Since 1999 I have been a member of the delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries; I know those countries.
I have learned from the people there and I know they too have a face and that they do not want to lose it.
We must, therefore, proceed very carefully and sometimes pragmatically.
That brings me to Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan is currently taking big steps that we should strongly welcome.
The death penalty was abolished on 1 January.
I thank the rapporteur for his oral amendment.
Moreover, the habeas corpus principle was introduced, i.e. the principle that the court ascertains whether detention is lawful.
In May this year we will be holding the second human rights dialogue with the Commission.
I am confident it will take place.
That is another good step that continues what we have begun.
May I say here that I will support the amendments tabled by the UEN Group because I agree with them, because I regard them as a step towards dialogue and because we must seek dialogue and partnership.
(PL) Madam President, the European Union should engage more actively in events in Central Asia and in support for economic and social development in the region.
At present our influence is slight: it is mainly Moscow, Beijing and Washington that are doing business there.
To play a more active role, we must develop a vision for economic and political cooperation and join in projects, investments and programmes designed to meet the needs of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
At the same time we should encourage all these countries to engage in more active intra-regional cooperation.
We must bear in mind, however, that it will not be an easy task, because the region is an ethnic, linguistic, religious, political and social patchwork still under strong Russian influence.
The European Union's priority should be to intensify cooperation in areas such as energy, trade, education, infrastructure, security and regional integration.
We should concentrate on supporting the process of democratisation, the development of education and the elimination of poverty.
That will increase security and social and economic stability in this strategic region of the world and render our cooperation more effective.
(PL) Madam President, my first point is this: all five Central Asian countries are members of the OCSE, which means they have undertaken, vis-Ã -vis the international community, obligations regarding respect for basic freedoms, democracy and human rights, although they differ in the degree to which they are meeting those obligations.
Secondly, against a background of regional shortcomings, Kazakhstan stands out favourably.
In August 2007 it held parliamentary elections at which I acted as an observer.
Despite certain reservations, those elections were recognised by the international community as democratic.
Thirdly, if the European Union wishes to find other sources of crude oil and natural gas than Russia, it must seek strategic cooperation with the Central Asian countries, especially Kazakhstan.
And that means encouraging and supporting Kazakhstan's European aspirations.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this was a very interesting debate.
I always regret that it is held late at night and maybe so few Members stay, but thank you for staying.
I think that many of you have mentioned what I personally also feel: there is a strategy that is absolutely necessary and this strategy aims to achieve stabilisation and security in this area.
Indeed, we, the European Union, are very much in favour of going forward.
I was Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE in 2000 and I got to know these countries and, as others have said, they are very interesting countries.
They are all very different.
It is true that Kazakhstan is the star of these countries, but a lot still has to be done.
There is the issue of human rights that everybody has mentioned.
There is the issue of poverty eradication and, particularly, education, but also the questions in the general field of human rights and, of course, the big question of energy.
So I know how much we have to do and I am glad that finally the European Union has done much more than in the past, together, as I said, with the German Presidency.
I shall now say a few words on those different issues.
Poverty eradication is highly important and this is one of the major parts that we focus on in the country strategies.
The policy paper that we have produced for the EU strategy for Central Asia is more a political document on political priorities, but in the country strategies we mention all the requirements under the Development Cooperation Instrument, which is particularly focused on education, on health, on rural development, on social protection and, particularly, on vulnerable families and children in difficulty.
There is also, in terms of public health and communicable diseases, a major factor: the global fund on AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, where, again, the Central Asian countries are eligible.
So this is one side, and we will certainly go on with that.
On the other hand, there is the question of energy - both the Nabucco pipeline and the Odessa-Brody-GdaÅsk pipeline have been mentioned - and, in general, energy security.
I completely agree with you that we want a diversification of our energy policy, even if we have not yet completely reached where we want to go.
But the most important thing is that we have taken this clear decision.
On the Odessa-Brody-GdaÅsk pipeline, I would like to say that the Commission is making every effort to diversify EU energy supplies and routes and, of course, Central Asia is absolutely crucial here.
The pipeline you mentioned is an important project in these efforts, and to feed this pipeline, we need to work first and foremost on the trans-Caspian pipeline, to get the Central Asian resources to the Black Sea.
Just a few days ago, we had the first ever regional conference of the Black Sea Synergy, which was a very first step in working on these issues in a regional dimension.
Apart from that, we also face the issue of energy security regarding the Nabucco pipeline.
It is still a priority for the Commission and we will go on supporting it.
It is not dead, as some of you might think.
So we have energy political priorities.
By the way, we are starting to have a sort of memorandum of understanding on energy with Turkmenistan too.
We already have one with Kazakhstan, and we will certainly try to go on building bridges between the different countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia.
Somebody asked me about Mongolia.
The five countries of the Central Asia region share the same recent past, following the break-up of the Soviet Union, and they are all, of course, very young nations.
This means that we face similar challenges regarding the political and economic transformation of these societies, but, as you know, Mongolian history is quite different, and that is why we did not include Mongolia in the strategy.
However, we do not preclude looking to the south of the Central Asian countries and we are looking towards the possibility of working further with Mongolia.
Today, it is a rather democratised country, where we see a lot of positive measures and positive steps.
Kazakhstan will indeed hold the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010.
I would like to tell you that I have always promoted that, always on condition that Kazakhstan continues to take a lot of important steps that are still necessary.
More has to be done on the freedom of the media, on electoral law and on the issue of registration of political parties, but it is indeed going in the right direction.
Finally, Kazakhstan is a member of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Let us please keep the Central Asia strategy and the ENP somewhat separate, although elements of the Neighbourhood Policy can appear later on in a special agreement, particularly with Kazakhstan, because we know Kazakhstan can be the first country in the Central Asia region to start radiating a positive spirit.
I hope that the others will follow.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, first I want to thank all the colleagues who took part in this debate and to give thanks also for the input of the committees asked for their opinion and, of course, for the Chair of the Delegation, Mrs JukneviÄienÄ.
I am also grateful to those who tabled amendments.
Mrs Jeggle has already referred to the amendment on the abolition of the death penalty in Uzbekistan, which we very much welcome.
I find myself obliged to point out, however, that we note with concern that opposition politicians and journalists in countries that are neighbours of Uzbekistan are dying in mysterious circumstances.
That should also be addressed in this connection.
The crucial question is this: how can we transmit our values without denying our own interests in the matter?
This is precisely where the European Union has an opportunity, because we simply have more to offer than dependence or even exploitation of these countries.
The simple and acute question is how we can combine long-term stability with democratic development.
In that area, there is still great potential for developing a genuine partnership between the Central Asian republics on the one hand and the European Union on the other.
We are looking at nothing less than a total package of economic and democratic development, together with cultural and scientific exchange, which, however, gives clear priority to protection of the environment and the development of civil society.
Let me briefly address one point I am sure is known to all of you: the environmental disaster on the Aral Sea, which has since become known beyond the region and is one of the greatest environmental disasters in the world.
The countries concerned will not be able to resolve this problem without our help.
Here too we must demonstrate our solidarity and do our part to help.
There is good news too, when we remember that we have an important partner in Turkey, which is a close neighbour and, as a country that wishes to join the European Union, can contribute its expertise to the joint development of a strategy.
The success of the European Union can also be measured by the extent to which it manages to develop a coherent strategy for Central Asia.
If it wants to be a global player, the European Union must also develop a strategy within which it formulates its common interests.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 20 February 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) As part of the work of the Delegation for Relations with Central Asia, of which I am a member, I have had the opportunity to visit the countries of the area covered by the report.
I have thus been able to see the substantial progress that these countries have made in many fields, from the environmental to the social, especially as a result of a strong impetus from the EU.
That being said, it is to be hoped that the EU will continue the work it has undertaken in this part of the world, bearing in mind that these nations are key allies in the fight against international terrorism and drug trafficking, by continuing to step up its dialogue with these countries.
The Council and the Commission are also asked to step up efforts to provide citizens with greater protection in key fields of social life and therefore to strengthen the laws in force on women's rights and to improve their application, to continue the strenuous fight against the exploitation of children, to implement major reforms of education and, in view of the substantial increase in infectious diseases in the area, a reform of the health service which is considered to be a key priority for these countries.

Treaty of Lisbon (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Treaty of Lisbon.
rapporteur. - Mr President, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and I have the honour to present this report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
It is a report in which our committee has dwelt not so much on the history of how we got here, but on the simple comparison of whether this new Treaty improves the European Union compared to the current Treaties, whether the Treaties as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon make the European Union more effective, more democratic and better for its citizens.
That is what we have done, and our conclusion is clear.
Firstly, on democratic accountability: this Union will have a system whereby any legislation in the future will be subject to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments and then the double approval of the Council of Ministers, composed of ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments, and the European Parliament, directly elected by citizens to represent them at European level.
That is a level of scrutiny that exists in no other international structure.
You can look at the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF, NATO - nothing above the level of the nation state has that in-built degree of parliamentary scrutiny that we will have with this new Treaty.
The new Treaty also improves the powers of the European Parliament in other respects.
We will elect the President of the Commission and we will have full power over the whole of the European budget, together with the Council, no longer seeing agricultural expenditure ring-fenced from parliamentary scrutiny.
Parliament will have the right to block Commission implementing measures where we disagree with them.
Parliament will have the right to repeal the delegation of powers to the Commission if we feel that is necessary.
I see the Commissioner is already looking worried, but it is an important democratic safeguard.
Parliament will also have the right to make proposals for future revisions of the Treaty, and its right to ratify, to approve international agreements has been extended.
This Treaty, if nothing else, is a massive increase in democracy in the European Union.
Secondly, this Treaty improves the situation for citizens of the Union.
There is, of course, the Charter of Rights, which, throughout the Union, is a guarantee that Union institutions and Union law cannot violate basic standards of human rights - European institutions will have to respect them.
It provides greater clarity for citizens over the competences of the European Union.
It also provides adequate guarantees to allay the misplaced fears of some that we are developing some kind of centralised superstate in the European Union.
Finally, the Treaty will make the European Union more effective, more capable of delivering in those policy areas where we want to act together at European level.
The extension of qualified majority voting, the rationalisation of the size of the Commission, the merging together of the external representation posts into a single High Representative, the longer-term presidency of the European Council and other measures should make our machinery more capable of acting effectively and, therefore, our Union more capable of delivering in those policy areas where we want it to deliver.
So all these are dramatic improvements.
There are some, of course, who will bemoan the loss of the Constitution - a Constitution that was, after all, ratified by a large majority of the Member States.
Even in those countries that had referendums, in total 26.6 million people voted in favour of it and 23 million against.
Even in my country, it was approved at second reading in the House of Commons by a large majority of 215.
So it was a popular Constitution in most respects, but the test is to win the grand slam of 27 'yeses' and zero 'nos'.
That is the very high threshold that it faced.
It did not get through that.
That was why it was abandoned by the Member States and, instead, we have reverted to amending the Treaties that we had before.
However, the content of these amendments makes our Union more democratic, more effective and friendlier to citizens.
I commend it to the House.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would also like to join you in congratulating Richard Corbett.
I think that this collaboration between Richard Corbett and a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shows what Europe ultimately is: that, even though we have different ideas and sensitivities, we are capable of doing things together; we are capable of making progress to improve the life of Europeans.
I would therefore like to thank Richard Corbett for his collaboration and cooperation, which has always been loyal, and has always, I would like to stress, been aimed at doing things together, building, not at being negative or destroying.
Mr President, three years ago Richard Corbett and I presented the Constitutional Treaty to this House, and we are now European Parliament rapporteurs on the Lisbon Treaty.
It is clear, Mr President, that some of us were more ambitious than this Lisbon Treaty, and I think that this House was more ambitious.
It is also clear that this is a unique situation.
The ratification process had not proceeded, so a political solution had to be found, and the Lisbon Treaty is a political solution.
Once again, this is Europe: it is seeking agreements, seeking commitments in order to find a way out of crises and get out of sticky situations.
Mr Corbett has given a very good explanation, and I therefore echo his words concerning the advantages of the Lisbon Treaty over the Treaties currently in force.
I would like to add one thing that Richard Corbett did not say: the Lisbon Treaty is not the Constitutional Treaty.
We had to leave many of our ambitions by the wayside, which I regret, but I also think that the essential elements of the Constitutional Treaty are in the Lisbon Treaty.
Although it is not the same, we have managed to retain the essential elements.
What are the essential elements, then?
What do we gauge as essential?
The essential elements are those that will enable the European Union to be more democratic, those that will enable the European Union to be more efficient, those, in short, that will enable the European Union to provide added value for citizens.
Mr President, this is the only thing that should motivate the European Parliament.
We are the representatives of the European people and they should be the point of reference for our actions.
We are living in a very important time for Europe.
We saw this yesterday, with the situation in Kosovo.
Europe must provide an outlet for the expectations that the European people have placed on us.
Europe cannot adopt a head-in-the-sand policy.
Europe needs to have a voice in the world, it needs to have a presence, and it needs to resolve the problems that exist now, whether that means climate change, combating illegal immigration or combating nuclear proliferation.
We need to tackle these problems.
The Lisbon Treaty, and this is a key question, ladies and gentlemen, gives us the tools and power to do this; obviously there will then have to be the political will to do this, but in this Treaty we have the tools to improve the current situation.
Allow me to say something about building, about doing things together.
As I said before, this is Europe.
Supporting the Lisbon Treaty means doing things together, following the same path.
It is true, as I said before, that we have abandoned some things.
Paul ValÃ©ry, who was a great poet, and therefore perhaps also a great European, said that a poem is never finished, only abandoned.
It is true that we have abandoned some things, but it is also true that, in the future, if we need to recover them, the European Parliament will be in the vanguard.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
On behalf of the Presidency I would like to welcome this opportunity to debate the Treaty of Lisbon.
I would first like to thank the European Parliament for its work and, most of all, for the report prepared by Richard Corbett and ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
I must say from the outset that I agree with the positive assessment of many elements of the new treaty.
The fact is that Europe has for some time been faced with internal and external challenges in the international community.
That is why we undoubtedly need reforms.
The desire to continue the process of improving the efficiency of the European Union and its democratic legitimacy led the leaders of the Member States to sign the treaty in Lisbon in December last year.
Much has been said about the many benefits the Lisbon Treaty will bring.
I will therefore mention just the main ones.
Firstly, it will ensure that all institutions that sustain or link the 27 Member States operate more successfully.
It will improve the efficiency and simplify decision-making processes.
It will increase democracy and the transparency of operations and - this is very important - make the operations of the European Union less remote from its citizens.
Our common aim is to enforce the Lisbon Treaty from 1 January 2009.
To achieve this, our priority task is ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by all the Member States.
May I take this opportunity to congratulate those five Member States which have already done this.
The Presidency is aware that the ratification procedures fall within the exclusive and sovereign competence of the Member States.
Nevertheless I think that we may allow ourselves to express a wish that the procedures run their course unobstructed, smoothly and without complications.
We are convinced that the Lisbon Treaty is a good instrument and a fine document which will make it easier to confront the contemporary challenges facing the European Union.
Full enforcement and implementation of the Lisbon Treaty requires certain preparatory actions.
The Presidency is aware of all these problems and the related need for a unified framework within which to conduct these preparatory actions.
We have established more intensive cooperation with the next Presidency (France) and with other institutions.
The Presidency will ensure that this preparatory work is conducted under supervision at the highest political level, that is to say the European Council, which will follow progress closely.
I would like to stress that many aspects of the new treaty may be realised only if proposed by the European Commission or in close cooperation with the European Parliament.
The Presidency is aware of these aspects and in each case will conduct the preparations in a way that will involve all the parties concerned.
I would like to finish by stating that all those involved in the preparatory work have acted responsibly.
I hope that such conduct will continue because that is the best way of contributing to the success of the ratification procedures and the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all can I say welcome to this report and congratulate both rapporteurs for their work in bringing it to plenary.
The Commission, of course, fully shares the view that the Treaty of Lisbon is a very positive step for the future of the Union.
As we have already heard, it will bring us further down the road to a more effective, more democratic and more transparent Union.
In politics it is important to do the right things, because that is what gives us democratic legitimacy.
But it is equally important to do things right.
So what we are doing in choosing the political agenda of climate change and energy, roaming charges, toy and food safety, transport policy or agricultural policy or trade or what have you, is extremely important, and we are not going to put our feet up until the new Treaty is in force.
But, at the same time, we must also look at the other side of the coin, how we do things and how the Treaty will change the way we do things; how we can become more effective in taking decisions and furthering the political agenda and the priorities of this European Union.
One of the core elements of this Treaty is how it strengthens Europe's democratic legitimacy through changing the role of Parliament, more codecision, a greater say in budgetary matters and international agreements, and a direct link between the results of the European elections and the choice of the Commission President.
It will also provide channels for the greater involvement of national parliaments.
We already have, through these, very positive experience in engaging with national parliaments, in anchoring the policies of the European Union, as well as some elements of participatory democracy for the direct participation of citizens.
Your report, of course, also expresses some concerns on the abandoning of the constitutional approach and on the extension of opt-in arrangements for particular Member States.
We all know - and I have said this before - that this was the price we had to pay to reach a consensus agreement, and I guess we all realise that nothing is perfect - not even the new Reform Treaty is perfect.
It is a compromise, but it is something that we have been able to agree upon.
Ratification is now under way but, with five Member States having approved the Treaty and ten more having launched their procedures, there is clearly still a long way to go, and there is no inevitability about the process.
In the mean time, we need to prepare for what we hope will be the entry into force of the Treaty at the beginning of next year, and the Slovenian Presidency has presented a list of issues where action needs to be taken for its implementation.
Preliminary discussions have already taken place on a number of issues, and these will continue over the coming months.
Some of these issues are subject to Commission proposals, for example, the Citizens' Initiative, which is an important provision to help connect the Union with citizens.
I am willing to do all I can to ensure that Europeans can use this new democratic tool as soon as possible after the Treaty enters into force.
It requires a Commission proposal to be ready in time, and at the same time it is important to consult fully before adopting a proposal.
We will of course keep you informed of further developments, and we look forward to working together on this issue.
Communication with citizens during the ratification process - whatever method for ratification is chosen - as outlined by the European Council in June, is also vital.
For this purpose, and as also recommended in your report, we are working closely with national authorities and the European Parliament offices.
Can I therefore thank you for calling, in your report, for sincere cooperation between EU institutions and national authorities in order to inform European citizens clearly and objectively about the content of the Treaty.
This is fully in line with our approach, and we are pleased to share with Parliament and its offices in the Member States our communication products and information materials on the Treaty - and we have good things to communicate: a Treaty that will give us the tools to move forward in developing the policies that the opinion polls tell us, every time, our citizens want: climate change and energy, migration issues, growth and jobs, the environment and, of course, the EU's role on the global scene.
These are the things that will help us to do both the right things and do them right.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, one of the strongest features of the Treaty will be that it marks the coming of age of the common foreign security and defence policy.
It proposes radical changes to the structure of the EU, notably by upgrading the High Representative as Vice-President of the Commission and a chair of the Council, with a tripartite service of diplomats beneath him.
It is crucial that these arrangements are firmly in place as soon as the Treaty comes into force: delay and quarrelling for the spoils of victory will confuse third countries and cause cynicism within European public opinion.
I strongly commend the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to Parliament.
Mr President, the new Treaty offers great opportunities for development cooperation. This is chiefly because this new Treaty requires that the Commission's action in the field of development cooperation complement the Member States' own initiatives.
This opens up the opportunity for better coordination between the Commission and Member States at long last - which is essential, and which was also called for by the very critical OECD DAC Peer Review.
The focus is on poverty reduction, which is good.
A key sentence has been dropped from the Treaty of Nice: the sentence explicitly excluding the European Development Fund (EDF) from the scope of the Treaty - which means that the EDF can now be included in the EU budget.
This is highly necessary, as it gives the European Parliament full democratic control over the other half of the EU's development activities too, at last - which is both necessary and good.
Without constant control by the European Parliament, however, poverty reduction will not be able to take centre stage in EU foreign policy, still less without the appointment of a separate European Commissioner for Development in future.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (ES) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the co-rapporteurs on the magnificent work they have done and to thank them because, perhaps as an exception to what usually happens in this House, they have succeeded in including the principal suggestion made by the Committee on International Trade with regard to the drawing up of the Lisbon Treaty.
The Treaty maintains the essential elements of the European Constitution in this respect, and this is very important because, in addition to once again stating that common commercial policy is an exclusive competence of the EU and extending its scope, it also introduces the Community method for decision making under the policy, which means more democracy and more effectiveness, which, after all, is the main message that we need to convey to citizens through the Lisbon Treaty.
I was a member of the Convention.
I am proud that the Lisbon Treaty incorporates the essential elements of the Constitution that we drew up, which was endorsed by the majority of countries at the time, but as the co-rapporteur Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said, I would also like to say that this is not the end of the road, it is not the end of the story.
For this reason, the Committee on International Trade also points out some matters that were left out.
We therefore have the reality, which is good - this Treaty - and we have the horizon, which will be better in the future through what we achieve.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (EL) Mr President, I have had the honour of being the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets on the changes being brought about in the budget sector.
It is one of the least known subjects, but I believe it to be one of the most interesting and most typical in the context of what we are debating today, namely the general changes that the Lisbon Treaty is bringing about in our lives.
In the budget sector, Parliament assumes a role equal to that of the Council.
There is no longer a distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
From now on we decide on everything as a Parliament, particularly on agricultural policy, and this is extremely important.
Something else is afoot.
An ongoing change is taking place in the distribution of roles between Parliament and the Council within the budgetary procedure.
This lies in the future; we cannot be certain of the outcome.
I think that this applies to the Lisbon Treaty in general.
The Lisbon Treaty introduces a package of politically far-reaching changes that will serve as a foundation for our political agenda.
I believe that this new political agenda is what the EU needs today.
Now, it is wrong to say that the Lisbon Treaty is the end of the road.
On the contrary, it is an important step allowing us to operate in a better and more successful framework with greater possibilities for Parliament.
This is especially important, if we bear in mind the lessons learnt from the experience of the European Constitution.
The crucially important outcome of the tortuous road to Lisbon is that Europe did not close in on itself or become more defensive; it became more social.
As a result, there are now more social clauses, and more rights.
An attempt is being made to open Europe up to the outside by means of this procedure.
This, I think, is the most significant lesson; it is why the Lisbon Treaty ought to be ratified.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (SK) The new European Treaty, although imperfect in some aspects, represents an important instrument for further and deeper integration of the Member States, as well as for more effective and flexible functioning of structures and institutions both between the individual Member States of the European Union and between the EU and the outside world.
At the same time the Treaty opens the door for further enlargement of the Union to include new Member States, so that many people's dreams of a common European home can come true.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has become a legal component of the Treaty, has of course its own great significance.
However, because it is not very explicit, it can give rise to some questions about natural human rights.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is of the opinion that the new Treaty offers enough space for the realisation of common policies on the one hand, and on the other hand, within the principle of subsidiarity, ensures that the Member States have sufficient competence to push ahead with their own competition policies and strategies, for example in the area of industry.
The European Research Area will strengthen the scientific and technological platform.
This will result in an easier transfer of scientific knowledge and technology and in unlimited cooperation between scientists and researchers, regardless of borders.
As regards the space research programmes, we are pleased that the Treaty offers a platform for a European space policy and explicitly provides for appropriate cooperation with the European Space Agency.
An important success of the Treaty is the agreement on a common energy policy, with emphasis on improvement of the internal energy market, guaranteeing safe supplies, energy efficiency and savings, developing renewable sources and improving network interconnection.
The fact that the Treaty allows individual Member States to continue to make decisions about their own energy mix is also an advantage.
In addition, I am glad to be able to say that the Treaty includes the Euratom Protocol, which will retain its original legal effect: I am sure that this will create the conditions necessary for the logical and safe development of nuclear energy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs expresses its support for the report by our fellow Members Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
We welcome in particular the fact that the report highlights - this is obvious but it is good to mention it - that it is in the area of freedom, security and justice that the Treaty of Lisbon brings in the most changes, with, in particular, the pillars being discontinued and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation being brought under the 'Community' method.
However, although this is an important breakthrough, in our sector it is still accompanied by a reservation that is difficult to accept.
Our fellow Members ought to know that under the Treaty of Lisbon, all the measures that would have been adopted under the third pillar before the Treaty came into force will remain beyond the control of the Commission, and moreover, of the European Court of Justice for a period of five years in such sensitive areas as respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
We find this restrictive provision difficult to swallow, Mr President, and today we confirm our determination to render it ineffective for all the acts to be adopted before the end of the current parliamentary term.
We hope that interinstitutional negotiations between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council can begin as soon as possible to reach agreement on how to overcome this difficulty.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, like everyone else, I would first like to offer our thanks and congratulations to our fellow members ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Richard Corbett for the report on the Treaty of Lisbon and particularly for the excellent work they have done.
As a friend, however, I can also tell them that that is what they are paid for.
Our debate comes at a time when five Member States have already ratified this Treaty and Poland has announced that it is preparing to start its ratification process.
On behalf of the members of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and within the PPE-DE Group, I would like to reiterate how important this Treaty is for the revival of the European dynamic.
After two years of deadlock and institutional misgivings, the European Union has given itself the tools it needs to function effectively.
PPE-DE members believe this Treaty makes the EU more democratic, more visible and therefore more influential within its own borders and in the world.
The Treaty of Lisbon signals the return to politics in Europe.
The increased democracy, clarity and visibility, and the strengthening of the European Union's effectiveness have been highlighted by our rapporteurs as the major advances of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Democracy is strengthened by extending the powers of the European Parliament, the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage.
Codecision becomes the rule.
The President of the Commission will be elected by the European Parliament.
The role of the national parliaments will be enhanced on matters of subsidiarity.
This is something our group is very keen on.
Europe will no longer be absent from national debates.
They will not have an excuse to criticise us any more.
Citizens will now have the right of initiative.
By collecting a million signatures from the citizens of the 27 Member States, they will be able to issue a direct invitation to the Commission to present a new proposal.
In addition, the rights of citizens will be protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the binding legal force of which is enshrined in the Treaty.
We are very proud of this advance.
With the opening to the public of legislative debates in the Council, Europe will be more transparent, and with clarification of the European Union's competences, its functioning will become more comprehensible.
The expansion of qualified majority voting in the Council will reduce the risk of institutional deadlock and make it possible to implement necessary common policies.
Furthermore, Europe will affirm its role as a political actor on the international stage.
Where it is competent, the EU will make its voice heard and make the decisions required for energy policy, foreign policy, judicial and police cooperation and environmental policy.
Regarding energy, the Treaty introduces a legal basis for a European policy on energy supply and renewable energies.
In foreign policy, the EU will finally be represented by a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
In the face of a changing world, with many challenges of all kinds, the European Union must have the means to affirm its position as a key player to its partners throughout the world.
I already noticed, a little while ago in the Middle East, that more was being asked of Europe, not just that Europe should pay but that it should bring its full political weight to bear, and this will also be the case in Kosovo and the Balkans.
In the field of police and judicial cooperation, it is essential that the EU takes robust, coordinated measures to fight the globalisation of crime and terrorist threats.
The Treaty of Lisbon gives the EU the means to undertake far-reaching reforms to achieve this.
Through being more intelligible and more united, the European Union will be able to assert itself as the world leader in the fight against global warming.
It will also send clear messages to the emerging countries encouraging them to adopt a genuine sustainable development strategy.
The members of the PPE-DE truly believe that these areas should be the subject of European policies.
Of course, many of us - as the rapporteurs point out - deplore the fact that the constitutional approach has had to abandon any mention of the symbols of Europe.
The big challenge now is the ratification of the Treaty.
On behalf of PPE-DE members, I call upon the Member States to follow the lead of Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Malta and France, and to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon promptly, so it can enter into force by 2009.
Thank you for your attention, and I hope that today, the chairman of the Socialist Group, Martin Schulz, will follow my example.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in giving my remarks I can certainly save myself the effort of having to go into the details of the Corbett-MÃ©ndez de Vigo report once again.
The rapporteurs and co-rapporteurs of the attendant committees have themselves done so well enough.
Therefore, in the middle of my remarks, I can take the liberty of asking a rather more basic question, a question associated with the fact that on a day like today, when the European Parliament is delivering its opinion on a fundamental achievement in the history of European unity, we might pause for a moment and allow ourselves to ask: why are we doing this?
What is the actual aim of this practice?
Why do we need this Treaty?
In the history of the people of this continent, 100 years is a short time.
However, when you look back 100 years to 1908, a Sultan governed Turkey.
Russia was ruled by the Tsars.
This city here was part of the German Reich ruled by Wilhelm II.
France had a vast colonial empire and Great Britain its own Empire.
Fifty years ago, Adolf Hitler's takeover - which took place 75 years ago - was already 25 years in the past.
In the meantime Joseph Stalin had been committing his atrocious crimes, Auschwitz had happened and 50 years ago the Soviet Union, led by Nikita Khrushchev and the United States, governed by Eisenhower, sealed the post-war order of Yalta.
Twenty-five years ago the power of the Soviet Union was exhausted and the world instead set off on the wrong track - as far as the economy was concerned - of 'Reaganomics'.
Today we cannot even imagine what will be happening in 25 years' time.
One thing is certain: the only chance that the states that ruled half the world 100 years ago - France and Great Britain - still have of being able to secure their influence in the world today and of perhaps still being able to play a part in 25, 50 and 100 years' time, is not that we put up attractive flags, but that we ask the question: how do I guarantee, in a smaller world with limited influence - because there are far more players, such as China, India and the Latin American continent, for instance - how do I guarantee as a responsible politician in this global village that my people, my country, are able to play their part in global democracy, welfare and social stability?
We can no longer go it alone.
We can only do it together - the Europeans, at any rate.
Perhaps the United States can survive on its own in this global-style competition.
Perhaps China, too, and perhaps India - although China and India are already concluding cooperation agreements of a technological nature with each other.
When we talk about this Treaty, I would very much like to talk again about why we never actually discuss the fact that the Industry and Development Ministers of China and India have been meeting over the past year to conclude a cooperation agreement.
Here are two countries, which make up a third of the world's population, concluding a cooperation agreement!
And we Europeans, what are we doing?
We are staying on the right track, albeit not consistently enough and not completely, but we are staying on the right track, the track described by the saying: unity is strength!
Anyone who goes it alone will lose out in the long run.
Anyone who sails in an escorted convoy, anyone who brings a ship safely in, not behind a flagship, but in a line of ships on an equal footing, will win - whether we are a large state or a small one, we are all on an equal footing in this Union.
However, we join forces in a framework that enables us to cooperate economically, socially and democratically as equals with other regions of this world, to safeguard human rights and peace in the world.
That is the purpose of this Treaty!
Therefore, we social democrats, we socialists in this House, want to endorse this Treaty and the opinion of our rapporteurs on this Treaty out of a deep conviction because we believe that this is the right path.
To those who preached 100 years ago that the world was to recover in the German manner or that the Pax Britannica was to dominate the world, or that in the CommunautÃ© FranÃ§aise French superiority was to reign, or that the Caesaropapism prevailing in Moscow at the time meant that we were to worship one person as Emperor and God; to those who told the world that the flag behind which we would have to assemble was the most important thing, and not the spirit of the peace we consider most important; to those who maintained that nationalism and national primacy would lead to the objective, to those we can only say that the 100 years of history behind us proves the opposite.
FranÃ§ois Mitterrand was right when he said in this House that nationalism ultimately always meant one thing: war.
In European history, evidence has been offered to suggest that ultra-nationalism always means war.
We would counter this with: nationalism is never the solution of the future! Solidarity among the nations: that is the solution of the future, that is the purpose of the Treaty.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the world awaits a European Union with a stronger capacity to act across the world stage.
Inside the Union there are plenty of people who wish to see an end to the seemingly interminable quarrels about our system of government.
Although I have enjoyed myself in the IGC and previously in the Convention, I think I can speak for us all in saying that we share the opinion that we should settle some of these quarrelsome problems for a substantial time.
Certainly, I look forward to a time when we can focus on improving the quality of policy which flows out of Brussels and Strasbourg.
That time will come when the Treaty of Lisbon is brought into force, because it successfully connects policy change with desirable and necessary reforms to powers, to instruments and to procedures.
There are some - certainly in this Chamber - who would prefer to reject the Treaty and turn the clock back to Nice, and perhaps even further to 19th-century thinking.
These people include, unfortunately, the British Conservative Party, which fails to proffer a shared European solution to the common problems that we all face as Europeans.
I know that the United Kingdom is a strangely insular place, and it is true that even its Government is too frightened to face up to nationalists and xenophobes and has insisted on asserting self-defeating opt-outs from key areas of European unity, sometimes pushing Britain to the margins.
Liberal Democrats regret that, and look forward to the time when the UK will find a more comfortable place within the stronger and more united democratic and efficient Union promised by this great Treaty.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the leaders of the European Union signed the Reform Treaty on the European Union last December.
This Treaty will ensure that the European Union will operate more effectively in the years to come.
A more effective Union means a stronger economy for Europe and for Ireland.
Any body which as been around for fifty years makes changes in order to address new challenges.
The Irish people have very good reasons for voting in favour of this Treaty.
The economic and financial benefits coming from involvement within the European Union are self-evident to anybody in any Member State.
Indeed, the single market is one of the most important developments that we have seen over the last 30 years of development within the European Union.
