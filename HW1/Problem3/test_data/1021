in writing. - (FR) I should like to begin by highlighting the effective work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, who has ensured that the adopted text is markedly better than Mr Bolkestein's initial draft.
Nevertheless, even though her work was remarkable, I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive and of the amendments that I co-signed, together with those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, because the text at second reading does not go as far as the one at first reading.
Many grey areas remain in the text, and they would have needed to be clarified before we were able to accept such an important text as this, which involves the future of the people of Europe.
Furthermore, certain services, such as services of general interest, have not been removed from the framework of this directive, and this could lead to wayward paths being taken.
I feel that the Court of Justice and the Commission have been given too much influence over the control of the Member States and the interpretation of the directive.
The legislator gives more than its due to the government of the courts.
That concludes this item.

Situation in Gaza (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Gaza.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is deeply concerned about the violence in Gaza in recent weeks.
During a military operation by Israel, several people died in Beit Hanoun on 8 November, and in a disastrous barrage of artillery fire almost 20 Palestinians, women and children included, lost their lives as they were leaving the area.
In addition, several people were injured.
Military action also caused destruction to the town's infrastructure.
The European Union profoundly regrets the violence and injury that resulted from these violent acts.
At the same time, the Palestinians have continued to fire Kassam rockets indiscriminately at Israel, at the cities of Ashkelon and Sderot, for example.
These strikes have now also resulted in one death, several injuries and material damage.
The Union has called on Palestinian leaders to do all they can to end these attacks.
The European Union cannot accept the use of violence.
Every country has the right to defend itself, but that does not entitle it to use unreasonable force on a large scale or take the sort of action witnessed in Beit Hanoun.
Israel must adjust the scale of its action to the situation.
It has to comply with international humanitarian law.
Security does not just apply to one side, but to everyone in the Middle East region.
The European Union has called on Israel to cease its military action in Gaza.
The Union has also urged the Palestinian leadership to halt the rocket strikes that have continued to varying degrees throughout the autumn.
The purpose of the strikes is probably to increase fear and insecurity, which is obviously wrongly aimed at the civil population.
The Israelis should no longer be living in a climate of continued fear: they too have a right to peace.
The Palestinians must stop using violence for political ends.
The deepening spiral of violence is threatening to destroy any chances of restarting the Middle East peace process.
Events like those described here only serve to estrange the parties from the opportunities available, especially right now when a peace process aimed at negotiating the establishment of a two-state model is needed.
The aim is still the creation of a viable Palestinian state, one which exists in peace alongside Israel.
The European Union hopes that the events in Beit Hanoun will not discourage the parties and the international community or prompt them to abandon the pursuit of lasting and equitable peace.
The European Union also hopes that the strikes at Beit Hanoun will not discourage the Palestinians from continuing the quest for mutual harmony and the formation of a government of national unity which could fulfil the conditions set by the Quartet.
The entire international community needs a noteworthy party as its partner.
The Palestinians have a right to a government that represents the interests of all citizens.
At the same time, the humanitarian situation among the Palestinians has been a big worry for the European Union.
The economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories is intolerable.
The situation would be considerably improved if Israel kept the border posts at Rafah and Karni open and improved Palestinian mobility.
What is more, the European Union has urged Israel to recognise as income the customs duties and taxes which they have collected and which belong to the Palestinians. This could make the Palestinians' economic situation considerably easier.
The EU itself has tried to help the Palestinians.
More than EUR 650 million has been given in aid through various channels this year, and that is around 25% more than last year.
The Temporary International Mechanism has been a functional means of aiding the Palestinians, and we hope that Israel and other parties can also make good use of it.
The situation in the Middle East is thus not very promising in the light of the events of recent days, but in spite of this we have to continue to believe in a better future.
The European Union will do all it can to support the peace process.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, thank you for inviting me on this symbolic date, 15 November, which is Palestinian National Day, to speak on the situation in Gaza.
The escalating violence in Gaza recently culminated in the attack by the Israeli Defence Forces on Beit Hanoun on 8 November, which resulted in the death of 18 Palestinian civilians.
In response, my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner made a statement saying that she was 'profoundly shocked by this particular event'.
Our thoughts now go to the Uthamina family in particular, who lost six women and eight children, killed in their sleep, and to all the innocent Palestinians and Israelis who have lost their lives in this spiral of violence.
After the attack, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called on all sides to stop violence and give dialogue a chance.
Palestinian factions should stop firing rockets into Israeli territory.
Whilst we recognise Israel's right to self defence, this should not come at the price of innocent lives.
The Beit Hanoun attack is the latest in a series of incursions into the Gaza Strip which started on 28 June.
Military operations have caused damage to vital infrastructure, especially in Gaza - including the power plant, major roads and bridges, and government buildings - and killed almost 300 Palestinians, mostly civilians.
In response, the Commission has this year stepped up its assistance to meet increased emergency and humanitarian needs.
In June 2006, we launched the Temporary International Mechanism, which channels Member State and European Community Budget resources to contribute to relieve the socio-economic crisis in the Palestinian territories.
This Temporary International Mechanism has supported the delivery of basic services to 1.3 million people living in the Gaza Strip and social allowances to 100 000 vulnerable Palestinians.
The operation is now increasing its outreach to 150 000 cases.
The Commission, through ECHO, has allocated EUR 84 million to help vulnerable Palestinian households through the provision of food, water supply and sanitation, healthcare and social protection.
The European Commission is also providing a EUR 26 million package of food aid.
Food and cash subsidies are channelled through the UN Relief and Works Agency to Palestinian refugees registered as special hardship cases, while food packages are distributed to non-refugees via the UN World Food Programme.
The Commission is also a major donor to the UN Relief and Works Agency.
In 2006 we provided EUR 64 million to its General Fund.
It manages health, education and other social services for Palestinian refugees.
In Gaza these services constitute the only element of stability in an insecure environment.
Our efforts can alleviate the humanitarian crisis for the Palestinians.
However, its root cause, which is the lack of hope in a peaceful solution for Israelis and Palestinians, must be tackled urgently.
There is an urgent need to return to a comprehensive peace process with a clear political perspective.
The process of reconciliation between Palestinians must be given a chance.
We should encourage President Abbas to continue efforts to form a national unity government, with a platform reflecting the so-called 'Quartet principles' of non-violence, recognition of international agreements, recognition of Israel as a state and allowing for early engagement.
This will contribute to restoring hope for a viable and independent state for the Palestinians.
That is why the General Affairs and External Relation Council, which met on Monday, has welcomed the Commission's proposal to provide additional support to the Palestinians as soon as a national unity government is formed.
In order to provide this support before the end of the year, we will have to resort to the emergency aid reserve and obtain the agreement of the budget authority.
The Commission will count on the support of the European Parliament.
In parallel to EU assistance, Israel should release hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and customs revenues, which it has collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and which it has withheld since March in response to the formation of the Hamas-led Government.
We should all work together so that on the occasion of next year's Palestinian National Day, we can celebrate progress towards the creation of a democratic, viable and sovereign Palestinian State.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East is at once worrying, dangerous and tragic.
It is worrying because the conflicts have been going on for decades and there is no end in sight.
It is dangerous because tensions between the opposing parties are constantly escalating, and because external powers - such as Syria and Iran - are increasingly exerting an influence.
Finally, it is tragic because ordinary people, particularly large numbers of children, are among the victims.
As we tell all the parties in the Middle East, a military solution is out of the question - we need peace through dialogue and through negotiations.
We also say that a policy of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' is out of the question, as the situation will only escalate further, with each side responding to an attack by attacking the other with greater force.
We need to break this cycle of violence.
We ask this of both the Israeli and Palestinian sides.
The position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is crystal clear.
We want to see an Israeli state with secure borders and, equally, a Palestinian state with secure borders.
The dignity of an Israeli is the same as that of a Palestinian, and we must not apply double standards.
We want to see an independent, democratic Lebanese state.
Anyone who calls into question the right to exist of any of these states - there are already Israeli and Lebanese states, and there should be a Palestinian one - threatens to do lasting damage not only to peace in that region but also, the way circumstances are, to world peace.
The EU and others must now make a contribution to peace.
I believe that the EU is very glad to be indeed making such a contribution by stationing troops in the region, although we should have liked to see a European armed forces rather than national troops from the individual Member States.
This is an issue that the EU must consider for the future, however, as a means of making a genuinely European contribution in this regard.
Nevertheless, the mere fact that troops are stationed there represents progress.
The development towards our making a genuinely pan-European contribution - including military - must now continue, however.
It is now the turn of politicians, whose most important assets are confidence and credibility.
When there is something to criticise, we must do so, irrespective of whether it is the Israelis or the Palestinians who are responsible.
With regard to decisions of the Security Council - and I say this as someone who is very pro-American - it is unacceptable that all criticism or condemnation of Israel is vetoed by the United States.
(Applause)
I would say in all seriousness that this is not the way to achieve credibility nor, in particular, to build confidence in all the partners concerned.
I believe that the EU's opportunity lies in its credibility on this issue, because we recognise the right to exist of both the Israeli and Palestinian states and want to see peace in Lebanon.
If, with the massacre in Beit Hanoun - supposedly owing to a technical error - Israel caused these terrible consequences, an apology is not sufficient.
Its policymaking in future must ensure it does not constantly react according to the 'eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth' principle.
(Applause)
I have just been informed that a woman has been killed and a minister's bodyguard has had both legs blown off today by Qassam rockets.
This has to stop.
We have to say this to both sides, and we have to be credible.
We Europeans must not turn a blind eye, but instead must take responsibility.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time Parliament has discussed the situation in Gaza, and it is unlikely to be the last.
It is the first time, however, that a discussion has revealed the formation of an opinion in this House that will entail a change in the EU's relations with one of its partner countries, namely Israel.
Mr Poettering's remarks show that we need a discussion across the group divide on what position the EU should take with regard to this development and, above all, to the role of Israel and the Israeli Government in developments in that region.
I have no expectations of terrorist organisations.
What do we expect from terrorists?
The answer is terror, contempt for mankind, the unspeakable suffering these criminals have caused in the world and continue to cause every day - of which Mr Poettering has just given an example.
What expectations does a common system of law such as the EU have of such people?
The answer is 'none'.
They are not suitable partners for us.
They are not the people on whom we should and can pin our hopes when it comes to building peace.
Yet we should have expectations of a democratic country based on the rule of law.
Israel, that wonderful country, the country founded in response to the lowest point in the history of mankind, has a right to our absolute solidarity in the region.
Anyone who so much as attempts to threaten this state or call into question its right to exist will face opposition from all Europeans.
There are no limits to our solidarity with Israel.
Nevertheless, as a democratic country based on the rule of law, Israel must be open to questions.
It must be possible to ask a democracy built on the same fundamental values as ours how something like Beit Hanoun can be described as a technical incident.
My expectations of a democratic legal culture are that the parties responsible for this 'technical incident' should be held accountable for their actions.
(Applause)
Regrettably, Parliament's summer recess was interrupted by a technical incident such as this in Cana.
I am still left wondering who was responsible for that.
If there is collateral damage from developments in the region, Israel must take care that its legal culture is not among it.
It goes without saying that Israel has to defend itself and be able to do so, and that we have to lend the country a hand.
Events in Lebanon serve the interests of Israeli security.
What Europeans want, for there to be a stable Palestinian state, serves the interests of Israeli security.
All our endeavours - be they financial or diplomatic, or now military - serve the interests of Israeli security.
What the EU, a common system of law, cannot accept, however, is meeting lawlessness with lawlessness.
That is unacceptable.
What is also unacceptable is for us to stay silent when a party that judges citizens by their ethnic origin, as Mr Liebermann's party does, joins the government of a country such as Israel.
That is unacceptable.
(Applause)
It is the Israelis' sovereign right to elect a party such as this, but it is also our sovereign right as Members of this House to condemn such a policy.
No social democrat anywhere in the world has anything in common with Mr Liebermann.
The only opportunity for a solution in that region is the renunciation of violence.
Dialogue is the only way.
The parties must try to look beyond all the violence and all the painful experiences and to talk to each other.
There have been some good attempts: let us remember the efforts of Yitzhak Rabin, who was Chief of Staff of the Israeli military forces, but still knew that dialogue is the only way of overcoming war and conflict.
Dialogue is no guarantee of success, but what is certain is that, without it, there is no chance for peace.
Thus, we expect Israel, in particular, to give priority to political dialogue rather than further militarisation.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times we have debated the Middle East in recent months, but I do know that, since our debate in September, 150 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, 70 in the last week alone.
The atrocity in Beit Hanoun, where 18 Palestinian civilians were killed, is as indefensible as it is inexplicable.
In a spiral of violence where there is armed aggression on both sides, it is often hard to tell what is attack and what is retaliation, but there is no doubt in my mind that David Grossman was right when he said last week that the behaviour of Israel's leaders is the conduct of scoundrels.
My colleague Mr Davies was recently in Gaza.
He reports as others do that Gaza has become a prison, with daily reports of extrajudicial executions, of lives disrupted and rendered miserable, disproportionate retaliation - especially since Operation Summer Rains, the Qassam rockets have killed 14 civilians over two years.
The IDF response has killed 126 people in the last month, of whom 63 were not involved in fighting.
The time is over.
We cannot wait any longer.
The international community cannot continue to condemn while waiting to solve the situation.
It is a disastrous strategy that leaves the stage to others.
We must relaunch the talks and the negotiations.
We must waste no time in deploying international and military observers in Gaza.
We must reinvigorate the commitment of the Quartet, and I hope that the US will reinforce its role by assisting in the negotiations as a test-case of a new multilateralism.
Palestinians must understand that the use of terror will never earn them the recognition they seek, and Israelis must understand that they are losing recognition by their incessant flouting of international law and disproportionate military action against civil targets.
At Yitzhak Rabin's memorial service, Mr Grossman spoke of a country hypnotised by insanity, rudeness, violence and racism, of a state squandering its goodwill, squandering its own people, especially its young.
The same Israel has recently used army bulldozers to destroy the graves of British soldiers killed in Gaza in 1917 and on 31 October sent F-15 fighter planes to dive at French soldiers serving with the UNIFIL force in Lebanon.
How many enemies do the Israelis want?
How long do they believe they can sustain themselves in a state of unresolved conflict?
It is time for reasonable people on both sides to come together, perhaps to relaunch the Geneva Process, and it is time for the European Union to do what it can to promote, encourage and support that process.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I was with Mr Davies, Mrs Morgantini and other Members in Gaza two weeks ago on the day that the Israeli army began the siege of Beit Hanoun. It was the beginning of a campaign of extrajudicial executions, of massacres and of the destruction of civil property.
Israel, the occupying power in the Palestinian territories, constantly violates human rights and international humanitarian law with complete impunity.
The use of excessive and indiscriminate force against civilians and civil property, the destruction of installations supplying electricity and water, the blowing up of public buildings, the restrictions on freedom of movement and the consequences of all these actions for public health, diet, family life and the psychological state of the Palestinian people constitute a blatant collective punishment which is itself a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Admittedly, there is no excuse for the constant launching of Kassam rockets against Israel, but nothing can justify subjecting a whole people to a draconian punishment like that imposed by Israel.
In such circumstances, the European Union must stop giving its backing to Israeli policy.
In particular, it must assume its full responsibilities when it comes to supervising the Rafa crossing point and no longer simply bow to the will of the Israeli Government.
The EU must use the tools available to it within the framework of the Association Agreement, and in particular the human rights clause, in order to ensure that violations of human rights and humanitarian law do not go unpunished.
It must demand the reimbursement of taxes collected illegally by the Israelis.
Dialogue with the future government of national unity must be reinstituted as quickly as possible, and direct aid to the Palestinian institutions must be resumed.
Finally, the European Union and the Member States must do all they can to have the International Court of Justice's opinion on the illegal construction of the Wall applied.
A meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council must be called as a matter of urgency.
Consideration will have to be given to reviewing the Agreement if the violations continue.
Finally, the European Union must play its full part in organising an international conference to promote peace in the region.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'Why does the political leadership continue to reflect the positions of the radicals and not those of the majority of the electorate?
How has that happened?
How can we stand by and watch today, as though hypnotised, the flood of madness, brutality, violence and racism in our country? [...]
Our political and military leadership lacks substance.
[Dear Mr Olmert,] for once, really watch the Palestinians, not through the sights of a gun or from behind the closed barriers of a check-point: you will see a population that is no less tortured than ours, that is defeated, oppressed and hopeless.
Perhaps for that reason, the majority of us have reacted indifferently to the harsh blow dealt to democracy by the ministerial appointment of Avigdor Liebermann, a potential pyromaniac who has been made head of government services, with responsibility for putting out fires.'
Those are obviously not my words: I am not an Israeli or a Palestinian.
They are the words of David Grossmann, who lost a son in a pointless war, a war that was also caused, of course, by the Katyusha rockets, but that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli citizens, including the son of David Grossmann.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said that today, 15 November, is Palestinian National Day.
What happened on 15 November 1988?
The declaration and acceptance on the part of the Palestinians of a Palestinian State based on the 1967 territories: thus recognition of the State of Israel.
However, there was no such move by the Israeli Government, which has never recognised either the 1967 secure borders - since it continues to build settlements - or the Palestinian State.
I am tired: in my seven and a half years' term of office in this Parliament, I have heard the timeworn phrase 'two peoples, two States' repeated over and over again.
Every effort must certainly be made to ensure that there are two peoples and two States that can peacefully coexist.
But why continue to repeat empty clichÃ©s, given that the Palestinian State is not actually being built and that political decision-making, helped as it is by the madness of Palestinian extremists, is not helping the Palestinian State to grow, but, rather, is helping to continually wear away its land?
I went to Gaza last week - and I regret that Parliament's official delegation did not go - with 12 MEPs: we saw what it means to live inside there, in that open-air prison; we saw what it means to use weapons that no one yet knows about and that are perhaps tried out on the torn-apart bodies of the young people killed by bombs that were falling and demolishing houses; we saw it, just as you must see it!
That is why we can no longer just talk about 'two peoples, two States': we must take decisive action.
I believe that there is a crucial need for an international peace conference with all of the parties involved.
We really do need to organise it, though; we need to act!
The Palestinians would not need our EUR 650 million if the Israelis paid the taxes that belong to the Palestinians: let us make sure, just as we force others to do - and obviously not through the use of weapons - that Israel fulfils its ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the international community has taken its eye off the ball in relation to the ongoing crisis in Gaza.
It has been distracted by other Middle East events such as the war in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran.
We must all renew our efforts to find and encourage a peace process in Gaza.
Compromises have to be made by both the Palestinians and the Israelis to end the conflict, which is destroying so many lives on both sides.
I welcome efforts from Hamas and Fatah to form a unity government in an effort to end the international embargo on Palestine.
I urge Hamas, under the new Administration, to recognise Israel or accept a viable two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, which I believe is the only way forward.
I condemn the rocket fire by Palestinian militants from Gaza this morning, which killed an elderly woman and wounded another person in the Israeli town of Sderot.
I also condemn the deaths of the 18 civilians in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli defence forces last week.
But an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.
While I recognise that Israel has the right to defend itself against attack, many of us saw the documentary on Gaza yesterday and listened to our colleagues who had recently visited the region.
I was shocked by what I heard and saw: the sheer brutality that has been inflicted on Palestinian civilians.
Both sides have to realise that the only solution is to sit down and talk.
Dialogue is the only way forward.
Courageous leadership is needed on both sides.
We are only too aware in Ireland of the cycle of violence caused by such conflicts.
We also know only too well the enormous benefits that can accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place.
We must all strive to build confidence.
The EU has increased assistance to the Palestinian people this year and has called for the immediate payment by Israel of withheld tax and customs revenue.
It also continues to seek the release of the captured Israeli soldier and of Palestinian legislators detained in Israel, as well as the reopening of the Gaza crossing points.
The EU has an obligation to protect civilian lives.
At this time, it is in a stronger position to act as an honest broker than Britain or America.
Reasonable people must stand up and do something about what is going on.
Evil will continue to prevail if we do nothing.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, seven Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli territory this morning resulted in the sad statistic of one fatality and one seriously injured in the town of Sderot.
Those carrying out the violence claim that this is revenge action for last week's blood bath in Beit Hanoun, in any event not on behalf of the seriously affected Athamna family from Beit Hanoun.
Quite the reverse; they underline - and you can see it for yourself in today's Israeli press - that there has been enough blood shed.
Sadly enough, this Palestinian spirit of reconciliation meets with no response at all from various prominent representatives of Hamas.
Over the past few days, they have stressed most emphatically that the new Palestinian Government is not required to recognise the Zionist enemy.
Can the Council and the Commission shed light on this repeated Palestinian political controversy between Fatah and Hamas?
At the same time, I should like to know their reaction to the statement made by Mohammed Shabir, who has been proposed as Prime Minister of a Palestinian united Cabinet: 'I shall make my position clear after the appointment'.
Have you been in contact with him yet?
The Quartet is reported to be meeting in Cairo today in order to relaunch the peace process.
I expect the explosive situation in Gaza will be high on the agenda.
After all, the Council and the Commission will not be unaware of what the Chief of Shin Bet, Israel's Security Agency, told the Knesset, to the effect that, if the radical political and military tide in Gaza does not turn, Israel will have no choice but to mount a large-scale military operation.
Shin Bet's Chief, Mr Diskin, also shared that since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, no fewer than 33 tonnes of military explosives, large quantities of weapons and between USD 50 million and USD 70 million in cash have been smuggled into the Gaza Strip.
Egypt, in particular, has cried off, although this is in contravention of the specified military agreement with Israel.
In summary, the European Union must take the Quartet meeting as an opportunity to remind Egypt, and, in fact, the rest of the Arab world, of their responsibilities.
Gaza should not turn into the much-dreaded Hamasstan.
(IT) Mr President, I have just come back from Palestine.
I set off without any prejudices or preconceived ideas, but the situation I found was worse than I had expected: it is a powder keg ready to explode, and it will have a domino effect throughout the area.
Nine months is the length of time that wages have not been paid because of the blockade on money transfers, with the result that public offices are locked up, schools are closed, and hospitals are only accepting the all too frequent emergencies.
Eleven thousand is the number of Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails, including 400 children and 41 members of parliament elected in polls that the international community accepted were free and transparent.
Nineteen, including twelve minors, is the death toll of the clashes of the last few days, which in fact started the day after we left.
Nine hundred and twelve kilometres is the length of the gigantic wall that is tearing the country apart and separating entire families, for reasons that have little or nothing to do with security.
Nine hundred thousand olive trees, some of them centuries old, have been destroyed to make this impressive but useless structure.
Eighty-seven per cent is the poverty rate in Gaza, where all outside links have been cut and importing or exporting goods is impossible.
One thousand three hundred and fifteen metres is the width of Gaza's militarised border, which can only be crossed on foot, even by the elderly and children, after interminable checks: it is an incredibly grim crossing, like something from another time.
Even so, as you wander the streets there is still a glimmer of hope in people's tired eyes.
Europe still has a chance to redeem itself, if we start again from where we left off and pick up the thread that has recently been broken.
Let us work towards a fair and just solution providing for two peoples and two states: security for the State of Israel, the recognition of which is not up for discussion, and rights for a free and independent Palestine.
Time is up: either we adopt a strong, incisive initiative now, or otherwise we must accept full responsibility for having been unwilling or unable to do enough.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I believe that we should draw two conclusions from the debate that we are holding this afternoon.
The first of them has been mentioned by the President of my group, Mr Poettering, who said that we must be consistent with the positions we have taken in the past and, just as we have condemned the indiscriminate attacks against innocent Israelis, we must also condemn this disproportionate attack by Israeli forces, which has caused civilian deaths, particularly amongst women and children.
Unfortunately, Mr President, in spite of the Prime Minister's apologies and the investigation to be carried out by the Israeli Government, these people will not be brought back to life.
Mr President, in the formal sitting this morning we were reminded that these problems of recurrent violence in the Middle East can only be resolved by means of a fair and all-encompassing solution.
I am struck however - and I am glad that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is here - by the regrettable fact - and the Belgian Prime Minister, Mark Eyskens, reminded us of this - that, for every one hundred times that the European Union votes in the United Nations, on sixty occasions each Member State does so in its own way.
Mr President, the European Union will not be a major player on the international stage if it acts in that way.
I believe that everybody in this House recognises Israel's legitimate right to defend itself, but it would have been no bad thing for the United Nations to have condemned this tragic event.
I would therefore call upon the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to work to ensure that, if the European Union wants to be a major player on the international stage, it can speak with one voice, at least on the international stage and, in particular, in the United Nations, where our Member States should not act in the lamentable way they did in relation to these tragic events that we are condemning.
(FR) Mr President, more than 300 people have been killed in Palestine since June.
The diplomatic term for this is 'disproportionate response'.
Wherein lies the disproportion?
It lies in the fact that ten Palestinians have been killed for each Israeli during this second intifada, and 100 to one since the Lebanese war.
There is therefore a lack of proportionality. The fact is, however, that each of these deaths is pointless.
At present, the highest international bodies - both the UN and the Quartet - appear paralysed in the face of the United States.
Europe should therefore do what it has done in Lebanon and adopt a position that is strong and unanimous, as is today's joint resolution by Parliament.
It should therefore use all the political tools at its disposal, including the Association Agreement with Israel, in order to put an end to the violence.
This violence condemns all Palestinians to death, but it also condemns Israeli democracy.
It puts an end to democracy in Israel, whose government has just allied itself with a xenophobic partner which supports ideas of ethnic cleansing.
Let us be at least as brave as those Israelis who invoke justice and international law in writing to us today of their horror at the massacres in question. I am thinking in particular of the courageous signatories of the manifesto published by the main Israeli human rights organisations, which are demanding an end to the stranglehold placed on Gaza.
That is why I call for the blockade on Gaza to be lifted and for aid to Palestine to be resumed, as well as for support to be given to the government of national unity that is about to be formed.
This would be a victory by moderates against extremists on all sides.
I am also concerned about the Israelis possibly using new weapons of destruction in this dirty war - weapons whose use has already been suspected in Lebanon - and I call for an international inquiry to be launched in this connection.
I support the idea of an international peace conference, bringing together all the players in the Middle East including Syria and Iran and, in common with the editorial in the newspaper Haaretz, I call for an international intervention force to be sent to Gaza.
Finally, I would urge the European Union to seize every opportunity for peace in this explosive situation. Death and famine are emphatically not fertile ground for peace.
We do not bear every responsibility in this crisis, but we do have responsibilities.
I would venture to say that, by interrupting aid to Palestine prematurely and by putting in place an intermediate mechanism that has taken some time to be implemented, we have helped bring about the prevailing chaos in Palestine.
To each his particular task, certainly, but we have mistakes to remedy and responsibilities to assume.
Mr President, I, like many others present today, was with Mrs Morgantini in Gaza just a couple of weeks ago as this latest round in the current crisis was kicking off.
We witnessed the systematic, deliberate and very sophisticated and effective brutalisation of an entire people.
Gaza is a prison without hope.
Any moderate Palestinians are blocked at every turn as they try to develop a systematic Palestinian state that might be successful.
They are being blocked by the Israelis, and we must place the blame appropriately.
The only result of all this can be violence forever more, and we can only treat the symptoms for so long.
We saw well-meaning EU officials - we have heard today about the Temporary International Mechanism - and the EU is indeed doing a number of things to tackle the humanitarian symptoms of this disaster.
However, as the Commissioner said earlier, the roots of this situation are political and the solution to it must be political.
The association agreement must be brought onto the table and sanctions considered, or we will be treating the symptoms of a humanitarian disaster forever more.
We are not without weapons and must use everything we have at our disposal.
(EL) Mr President, 'Europe', 'peace', 'human rights', 'Palestine', 'Gaza': a vocabulary that we use which is rich in words.
The reality is full of war, misery and pain and here we keep talking, passing resolutions, and repeating 'human rights' and 'peace'.
All we do is to keep talking.
How many crimes and how much death is needed for Europe to stop acting as Pontius Pilate?
In Palestine, it is not just people that are dying; hope is also dying and yet I believe that human suffering is not something you get used to.
The visit by the European Parliament has been postponed for technical reasons, or so they say.
Someone needs to explain to us what the technical reasons were and who is responsible for them.
Maybe certain parties did not want us to go?
And if we do not react, we shall again be accomplices to the crimes being committed, not today, not yesterday but, to our knowledge, for decades.
Words need to become deeds at long last.
Within the frameworks of international law and without there being any intention to hurt the man in the street, sanctions need to be imposed on Israel.
When, at long last, will the state of Israel be content to return the money it has kept to its rightful owners in Palestine who are dying of starvation?
The Palestinians are not terrorists, nor are they begging for charity.
They are a people fighting against third party interests for their dignity and survival.
They are a people who, in the face of the hypocrisy of the international community, the occupation and terror, are fighting for their continuing existence.
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the most important point with regard to these issues is that people on both sides are suffering at the hands of politics.
The second point is that, seen in an international context, the Middle East conflict has now reached such proportions that it is at the heart of efforts to safeguard world peace and also of threats to such peace.
Both of these are reasons why the conflict must be resolved quickly and the Quartet must appear there together in full and make exacting personal demands rather than each member just drawing up papers on its own.
We must recognise that Israel has left Gaza and that what is happening there is partly an internal conflict between Palestinians, accompanied by terrorism, which is escalating almost into civil war there.
In addition, Israel as a state has to respond to terrorist organisations that are not the responsibility of any particular state.
This explains why we have difficulty judging the situation.
It is no excuse, however, for actions such as the bombardment of civilians and their houses, because Israel, too, has to understand that the only chance for it to enjoy peace and lasting security, as for a viable Palestinian state, consists in breaking the cycle of violence.
For this reason, Israel must consider whether its strategies are really the right ones to adopt.
After all, what has Israel gained from the war it waged in Lebanon in revenge for the capture of individual soldiers that ultimately resulted in the pro-Syrian forces taking power over the chain Iran-Syria-Hezbollah in Lebanon?
In what way have Israel's interests been served by that war?
A kind of responsibility should be seen here, too, and the new consensus government in the Palestinian territories that has come into being recently may represent a means to make a new start, in order to ensure world peace and give the people in the region a future.
Mr President, Gaza is a prison camp for 1.3 million Palestinians, sealed tight by Israel.

The occupants are being starved; their health and education infrastructure is being destroyed; their economy is being laid waste; and they are being massacred.
As many as eighty - not just eighteen - men, women and children were killed last week, most of them civilians simply going about their daily business and trying to get on with life.
This is all being done by a State which claims to be the only democracy in the region.
What a shameful expression of democracy.
Israel is now also pulverising these unfortunate people with experimental weapons.
We have no word from the Commission or from the Council as to what they are doing about investigating that matter.
Launching Qassam rockets will not bring freedom for the Palestinian people, and I condemn such launches.
However, it is also clear that Israeli firepower and Israeli oppression of the Palestinian people will not bring a secure future for Israel either.
Only negotiations on a two-state solution will bring that security, and I would appeal to all concerned to start those as soon as possible.
(FR) Mr President, following the massacre in Qana in Lebanon, we have seen a further massacre of civilians, this time in Beit Hanoun.
The Israeli Government has expressed its deep concern at this new tragedy, describing it as a technical error.
However, we know already that this acknowledgement will not be enough to prevent the massacre of other innocents in the future.
In order to put a stop to this interminable escalation, Europe must rouse itself from its inertia and finally take strong initiatives to bring about a sustainable peace quickly.
Firstly, we must remove our financial stranglehold on the Palestinian territories, a measure one might have thought designed specifically to increase the violence and bring about chaos there.
Next, a military force needs to be interposed as soon as possible between Israel and Palestine, as was done between Lebanon and Israel with the FINUL.
If such a force is effective in Lebanon, it will be so in Palestine.
Above all, we must finally demand that a Palestinian State be created, with safe and recognised borders.
With the results of the mid-term elections in the United States, a window is perhaps being half-opened today.
The American administration will, I hope, redefine its policy in the Middle East.
In the new strategy that is taking shape, Europe must initiate a new dynamic for peace in which it finally embraces its own political role and ceases merely to be a source of funding.
We must never forget that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not just a conflict like any other.
There is an international dimension at stake.
The moment has come, and there is no time to waste.
Let us be courageous and assume our responsibilities before it is too late.
(EL) Mr President, the sortie by black-clad mothers rescuing their children in Beit Hanoun, as shown on the international media, was the chorus of the modern tragedy being lived through by a Palestinian people seeking its liberation.
However, there can be no liberation for the Palestinian people while the dangerous and deadlocked strategy of the United Nations continues in the area, while the dangerous and deadlocked policy of the civil-military leadership of Israel continues.
Unfortunately, today we have heard the Commissioner talking as if the European Union were an international non-governmental humanitarian organisation.
However, the European Union, Commissioner, is a political organisation with international obligations and a duty to defend democratic principles and international humanitarian law.
The European Union, once again, has demonstrated the huge strategic deficit on the question of Palestine.
Mr Solana should have been here today to see the results of the decision by the Council of Ministers in February, when they imposed economic sanctions on a Palestinian people which expressed itself democratically in the elections.
These deadlocks in the European Union are being paid for today, politically and humanitarianly, by the Palestinian people.
Mr President, the Israeli Government and the army have apologised for the tragic 'technical mistake' that resulted in the killing of 19 innocent civilians, mostly women and children, at Beit Hanoun.
The issue is not whether that apology is acceptable or not; it is that the use of such powerful force so easily and so frequently is bound to result in 'technical mistakes', particularly when the threshold of consideration for human life is so low.
Israel and Palestine will never find peace and tranquillity if they carry on being trigger-happy.
The Palestinians will never succeed with Qassam rockets and suicide bombers.
The Israelis will always invite more Qassams and more suicide bombers when they respond so disproportionately and so powerfully.
No side can win unilaterally.
Unilateralism is dead and buried in Lebanon.
Thinking positively, let us take stock of Prime Minister Olmert's call to President Abbas for talks without preconditions, progress in the formation of a national unity government between Fatah and Hamas, a government of technocrats - with Prime Minister Haniya abstaining from its leadership - and implicit acceptance by Hamas that they should sit at the same table with Israel.
It is time for the Quartet to act and for the European Union to cease being a passive member of it.
Finally, I hope that the result of the American elections will make the American Administration review its policy and role in the Middle East.
(FR) Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, for my part, am delighted with the almost historic consensus obtained by the various political groups within our Parliament - a consensus that enables us to send out a clear political message.
It is transparently obvious that the strikes by the Israeli army cannot by any stretch of the imagination be referred to as a 'technical error'.
One gets the feeling that they are, rather, one more collective punishment inflicted on the Palestinians, who are being blamed for the political choices made following the last legislative elections.
I cannot but lament the similarity between these strikes and the methods used against the civilian populations of Southern Lebanon during the war in the summer of 2006, with cluster bombs being used in both cases.
Admittedly, the Israeli population is also the target of murderous attacks.
One is, however, entitled to expect a democratic state like Israel to behave in accordance with international law - something that cannot be demanded of terrorist organisations.
Faced with this situation, the European Union must assert itself as the driving force of the Quartet and be in favour of reinstating the Road Map.
The new political order in the United States, the prospect of a government of national unity being formed in Palestine and also, and above all, the voices of protest raised in Israeli society are hopeful factors in terms of the re-launch of the peace process.
Mr President, last week's incident in Gaza, when an IDF shell mistakenly struck Beit Hanoun causing the death of 19 innocent Palestinians, is clearly tragic.
The Prime Minister of Israel has apologised and ordered a full investigation.
Israel, it must be recalled, withdrew from Gaza in good faith, but the Palestinian Authority failed to establish law and order there.
Instead we have witnessed a degeneration into chaos, internecine warfare and repeated Qassam rockets being deliberately fired at innocent Israeli civilian targets, such as the woman killed today in Sderot, with no apologies from the militants, such as Hamas, and the militias effectively using human shields as Hizbollah did in Lebanon by firing rockets from civilian areas, thus inviting retribution which resulted in the tragedy of Beit Hanoun.
Furthermore, these Hamas-controlled militias have yet to release kidnapped Corporal Shalit.
Yesterday it was announced that a new government of national unity has been formed under independent technocrat Mohammad Shbair, but its spokesman, Fawzi Barhoom, denies that Hamas will now recognise Israel and instead disappointingly stated that the new government will recognise the terms of the 'Prisoners' Document', a declaration signed this year by Palestinians held in Israeli jails that implicitly - but not explicitly - recognises Israel by calling for a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza.
It remains to be seen if this will suffice to dismantle the TIM and resume full PA aid, and reassurances on ending terrorist violence will have to be forthcoming too.
I will be reluctantly supporting this resolution, but cannot support its call for a multinational UN force to police the occupied territories, as the track record of UNIFIL in Lebanon remains unproven.
I fear that, as we speak, Hizbollah is busy rearming itself and looking for a pretext to start yet another war against Israel.
Neither do I call for an immediate cessation by Israel of all military action whilst it is still being attacked, as argued by my Liberal colleague Mr Davies.
Mr President, when I look at our policy towards the Palestinians I can see our stick but where is our carrot?
The Palestinians are losing any faith they had left in a solution and in us as part of the international community.
We are faced with two peoples who are craving peace and quiet in their lives, and we cannot rely on old rhetoric any longer.
We all know where the solution lies.
We need to acknowledge that the two sides are not making it on their own.
A call for negotiations - no matter how justified - will not be enough this time around.
I want to ask the Council and the Commission: are you willing to consider bold ideas?
Let the Palestinians define their state with the Green Line as its border.
Let us then recognise it, let us use all our weight to get the Quartet to recognise it as well and let us then force Israel to accept it.
Only then will steps to increase trust and confidence have any chance to succeed, because there can be no peace without justice.
I say this as a friend of Israel, convinced, as I am, that we should not just save the future of the Palestinian state, we also need to protect Israel from itself.
This is our responsibility.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gaza is the nub of the nub of the problem: it is the nub of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and of the crisis in the Middle East.
It has engendered terrorism's major offensive; the failure to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem has given rise to 9/11, the growing strength of Al Qaeda and the Middle East crisis.
That is why Europe needs to play a major role and involve countries like Syria, whose role must be seen as separate from that of Iran.
Of course, none of us means to exonerate Israel for what has been happening in Gaza in recent days - the Israeli armed forces have to accept some of the responsibility - but it would be a serious mistake to point the finger just at Israel for the crisis as a whole.
We must not forget what is going on, with missiles being launched from Palestinian territory often with the backing of terrorist and extremist organisations, because there are some who do not want to thwart the peace process.
Europe needs to play a constructive, decisive role to advance the peace process and must defuse any act by either side that might be provocative.
Its role has to be balanced: it would be a disaster if Europe took sides against Israel and considered that it was to blame for everything that has happened, because we would not resolve the situation like that.
We have to commit to establishing a Palestinian state and make every effort for Israel to feel secure within its own borders, so that no Israeli family feels forced to send one child to school on one bus and another child on a different bus every morning, because they do not know which of the two will return home.
We have to stand very firm on that, and make Hamas realise that there is no room for military and terrorist action, and Hezbollah that there is no room for it to play a political role in the peace process.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, thank you to the Members of Parliament for this very valuable debate.
The Council shares the view so powerfully put forward in this discussion that this is a time for policy.
It is a time for policy and we have been of the opinion the whole time that this crisis cannot be solved militarily; instead, what is needed is a comprehensive political solution.
We need a solution that proposes a two-state model and that will require the people in the region, including ordinary people, to accept this goal of coexistence properly, and to commit to it at all levels of society.
The hope has been powerfully expressed here that the European Union will do what it can.
On behalf of the Council, I can assure you that the Union and the Presidency will do whatever it can.
The European Union's potential and strength in a solution to this crisis lies in the fact that the Union is a credible player in the eyes of all parties.
You cannot find this kind of strength just anywhere.
For the Union to be able to continue its work and its role as a credible player in a solution to this crisis, it must be able to sustain a united and consistent policy, and the question of how to foster this coherence is a daily challenge.
We are taking robust action to ensure that the Quartet also has a leading role to play in resolving this crisis, and we will aim to support the Quartet's active involvement.
It is also vital that, in order to find a comprehensive solution, we are able to persuade the countries in the region to commit to an involvement in this process.
The next occasion on which the Middle East question will be on the agenda in our multilateral forum of cooperation will certainly be next week at the EU-Russia Summit, and then at the end of November at the Foreign Ministers' meeting of the Barcelona Process at Tampere.
We will also work hard to get the Quartet to convene in December.
This is an important issue and a serious, long-term problem right on Europe's doorstep, so we have to pool all our resources to find a comprehensive, long-term and lasting political solution.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, escalating violence in Gaza only increases civilian suffering and fuels extremism.
As I have said, the Commission has stepped up its assistance for meeting emergency and humanitarian needs.
That is a useful contribution, but the solution lies elsewhere.
The only way forward for Israel and the Palestinians is the negotiation of a viable two-state solution.
The international community - as many of you have already said - has the duty to revive a credible peace process.
The European Union should play a leading role in that respect and, through its participation in the Quartet, encourage any ideas aimed at furthering peace in that area, including an international conference on the Middle East process.
In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Written statement (Rule 142)
The European Union must do everything in its power and use every instrument at our disposal, including the EU association agreement with Israel, to end the violence in Gaza.
The ongoing violence condemns the Palestinians to a slow death and risks setting the whole of the Middle East on fire.
Death and famine are not fertile ground for peace.
We need an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, resumption of aid to Palestine and support for a government of national unity.
I fully support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East, including Syria and Iran.
We need an international force in Gaza as a matter of urgency.
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), cluster bombs and conventional weapons (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the conference for examining the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), which will take place in 2006.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, issues relating to weapons of mass destruction and arms control have in recent years been central to the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy.
Multilateral action on arms control and disarmament has nevertheless had to face enormous challenges in previous years, and the results achieved have been modest.
There is an urgent need to alter this trend.
The Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is currently taking place in Geneva.
Both this conference and the Sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention to be held in late November and early December are an opportunity to show that the international community is able effectively to respond to the challenges of arms control and disarmament today.
The civilian population is all too often the victim of the use of weapons covered under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
The clearance of explosive remnants of war is an ever-growing burden for the international community.
The universalisation of Protocol V to the CCW on Explosive Remnants of War and its effective implementation mean that we all have to make an effort.
The European Union welcomed the entry into force of the Protocol at the Review Conference.
The Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War was drafted in response to the humanitarian threat caused by unexploded ordnance, including cluster bombs, to civilian populations in the aftermath of a war.
The recent events in southern Lebanon bring to mind the dangers caused to the civilian population by explosive remnants of war, especially cluster bombs, and the difficulty and expense of clearing them.
This problem has to be addressed without delay.
Therefore, the EU has proposed that the work of the CCW Group of Governmental Experts should be continued in 2007.
The Group's current mandate includes the development of preventative measures to improve the design of certain types of munitions, with a view to minimising their risk to humanity.
In addition, several EU Member States have individually pledged to start negotiations on a legally binding protocol which would respond to the risks to humanity arising from cluster bombs.
The EU Member States, however, do not have a shared view on how to deal with the rather restricted area of cluster bombs within the framework of the CCW.
This morning at the Review Conference, it was agreed that the Union's position on cluster bombs would be endorsed, and the decision was taken to propose the establishment of a think-tank of experts, whose purpose would be to prepare recommendations for future action to deal with cluster bombs within the CCW framework.
In the course of the five years of negotiations on anti-vehicle landmines, the EU has consistently made mention of the fact that our objective is a legally binding protocol which endorses international humanitarian law and brings added value to it.
Agreement on the protocol at the Review Conference, however, seems unlikely.
For more than 30 years now, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention has served as the normative and legal cornerstone of biological disarmament and non-proliferation.
Today, biosciences are one of the most rapidly evolving branches of science, with infinite potential for both good and bad.
The BTWC has to be capable of being adjusted to scientific developments and responding to any possible challenges that go with them.
The Review Conferences are an opportunity for this.
The European Union has made thorough preparations for the Sixth Review Conference of the BTWC, in accordance with the objectives of the EU Strategy Against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
These objectives include, in particular, making the BTWC apply worldwide, promoting the national implementation of, and compliance with, the Convention at national level, and reinforcement of the Convention.
In February this year, the Council adopted a common position on the Sixth Review Conference.
The Union's position is a balance between a realistic and an ambitious approach, nevertheless insisting on a comprehensive review of the Convention and practical improvements for its implementation.
As an add-on to the common position, the Union has drafted thematic working documents on several topics.
In addition to joint action, the EU agreed on an Action Plan on the BTWC.
In it, Member States committed to taking measures to strengthen the Convention, such as an announcement of any confidence-building measures that have been taken.
These concrete measures will make the main aims of the EU's common position on the Review Conference of the BTWC more plausible.
The Third Review Conference of the CCW has a good, though not perhaps optimal, chance of success.
We hope for a successful outcome, however.
The Sixth Review Conference of the BTWC also stands every chance of a successful outcome.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, weapons of mass destruction are potentially the greatest threat to European security and, in terms of the ability to inflict mass casualties, the weapons of most concern are clearly nuclear and biological.
While we all carry with us the collective memory of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there are no equivalent common images for biological weapons.
Mass death from biological agents, or diseases like the plague, appear by contrast to be part of 'ancient history' or science fiction.
We must hope that it stays that way, but we cannot be complacent.
Consider the following.
Firstly, unlike nuclear weapons, biological weapons are not dependent on limited supplies of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium.
The rapid development and dissemination of biosciences is bringing weapons capabilities within reach of those who could do us harm.
The danger that humans, animals or plants might be attacked by biological agents is a real one.
Secondly, official reports suggest that terrorists are seeking bio-weapons.
If terrorists were to start biological attacks across Europe, many lives would be at risk and our lifestyle could change dramatically.
Thirdly, biological weapons have been used in the recent past.
The anthrax attacks in the United States in late 2001 killed few people but caused significant, wider social and political disruption, and the perpetrators remain at large.
How protected are we today?
All use and possession of biological weapons has been prohibited since the Biological Weapons Convention came into force in 1975.
However, this Convention is the weakest of the regimes addressing weapons of mass destruction.
It has no provision for verification of compliance or implementation, and, unlike the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, there is no central institution with oversight.
Furthermore, there are fewer parties to the Convention than to either of those two treaties.
Our security would be enhanced, therefore, if the effectiveness of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention could be strengthened and its implementation improved.
State parties should be encouraged to address these weaknesses at the forthcoming review conference later this month.
Good security starts at home.
My colleague, Commissioner Frattini, is well aware of the need for action.
The Commission is examining potential responses through a common framework approach.
National responses to biological threats are clearly insufficient.
Alongside the work on strengthening public health and medical surveillance and response, we will be issuing a Green Paper on European bio-preparedness in spring 2007.
Disaster and disease do not respect borders.
The issue of bio-threats is one where internal and external policies are inextricably linked.
Much can be achieved through better international collaboration and coordination.
We will aim to share best practice on bio-preparedness: by helping to protect others, we will better protect ourselves.
I would also like to say a few words on a very different type of deadly weapon.
Unexploded cluster ammunition represents a threat to human security and sustainable development.
Such munitions kill innocent people every day and 30% of those killed are children.
They represent major challenges, both politically and to daily life in former war zones.
A review conference is currently under way.
It will see Protocol V to the convention, on 'Explosive Remnants of War' - i.e. failed explosive ordnance, ammunition or sub-munitions from cluster bombs, - enter into force.
The implementation of this protocol, intended to eradicate the threat that such legacies of war pose to populations, will be a welcome step forward.
The events in Lebanon this summer highlighted the issue, particularly in view of the high failure rate of the cluster sub-munitions employed.
Helping Lebanon in the difficult task of clearing these deadly remnants of war is important and we have contributed some EUR 5 million to the task.
We also support the need to focus more attention on strengthening and ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law in this area.
Commission assistance and cooperation in humanitarian disarmament - that is to say mine action, clearing the explosive remnants of war and fighting the illicit spread of small arms - all have a positive impact on improving human security.
They contribute to the sustainability of our development policies.
We are grateful for the support of the European Parliament in these efforts.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, with the Conventional Weapons Convention taking place this week and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention next week, it is important that the EU's voice is heard.
One main area that concerns me - the Commissioner talked about it - is the use of cluster bombs.
We have seen the widespread use in recent conflicts: Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to name but a few.
Because they are not covered by the 1997 Treaty on Landmines they are used with impunity, but they still have the same devastating effect, with civilians being killed or maimed for years to come.
According to the report 'Fatal Footprint', published this month by Handicap International, the Israeli defence force delivered at least four million bomblets into Lebanon between July and August this year.
Worldwide, civilians constitute 98% of all recorded cluster bomb casualties.
That is one of the reasons I call on the Council and the Commission to endorse the growing movement for change within the international community and the moves by countries, amongst them Belgium and Norway, to establish national legislation to ban cluster munitions from their territories and armed forces.
I would also like to applaud the Red Cross for its campaign and call for a ban on the use of cluster bombs, for stockpiles to be destroyed and for clearance programmes to be stepped up.
As far as biological and toxic weapons are concerned, we must put more pressure on the United States Government, which has refused to countenance a legally binding verification protocol.
That is damaging the future of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and its credibility.
We must also make sure that a permanent secretariat is set up to oversee the Convention's implementation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, death comes in the aftermath of war, and, rather than these cluster bombs falling from the heavens on their own, we have to be aware that they are dropped by Europe's allies and that those same allies continue to manufacture and export them.
You say that cluster bombs and unexploded munitions represent a challenge to former war zones, and that is where I have to contradict you; on the contrary, they are not a challenge to former war zones, but rather a challenge to the European Union, which must make sure that none of its Member States produces, exports or uses such weapons, and which must no longer permit its allies to do so in the way that the Americans, or the Israelis in the most recent war, have done.
It was with this in mind and considering the European Union's inability to take action that we, a fortnight ago, wrote a letter to the Finnish Presidency - and when I say 'we' I mean not 'we Greens' but rather the coordinators of the conservatives, the socialists, the liberals and I myself - with an urgent appeal for a European position in favour of an outright ban to be tabled at this conference, which represents an historic opportunity for the prohibition of cluster munitions.
You made it plain to this House that you were either unwilling or unable to do so.
You say you are going to set up a working party; well, I am sure you are familiar with the saying that, setting up a working party is what you do when you do not know what to do next.
It is also the cynical way to go about things when one bears in mind the fact that, day in and day out, the lives of civilians, police officers and UN troops sent by us to crisis-hit regions are being put at risk by what is left of these weapons.
I would therefore like, once more, to urge you in strong terms to now seize the initiative and - since you are able to do so - ensure that the national parliaments of the EU's Member States describe these cluster munitions as what they actually are, namely as a form of weaponry worthy of being outlawed and one that Europeans must renounce once and for all, refusing to use them or accept their use in any war whatever.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group is of course in favour of a general, worldwide ban on the production and use of biological weapons and on trade in them, and we hope that the forthcoming Geneva Conference will decide to strengthen the relevant international conventions.
I am pleased to note that the European Union is in the forefront on these issues, and I hope that the Commission will do everything humanly possible to achieve a worldwide ban on these horrific weapons.
We have to acknowledge the fact, however, that the main stumbling block to achieving such a ban has a name that we all know: George W. Bush.
The President of the United States is personally responsible for the US political boycott of the Geneva negotiations.
He has, in fact, decided to pull out of the talks.
Instead, the United States has made the build-up of their biological arsenal and the use of white phosphorus and depleted uranium a strong point in their aggressive and unacceptable military policy.
Similarly, they have neither ratified the Mine Ban Convention nor signed the Third Protocol to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention (CCWC), and they have also revived the Star Wars programme.
This attitude by the United States is a threat to world security.
The European Union needs to overcome its inertia and make putting pressure on the United States a key point in the Geneva negotiations.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki spoke of the European Union's action plan in relation to the Review Conference of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention.
Yet again, the European Union falsely assumes the attributes of a political state empowered to determine policy on what are military and defence measures, which are the proper responsibility of sovereign nations.
The EU has never had to militarily defend its citizens and let us hope that it never has to, for a variety of reasons.
Meanwhile, countries like mine, Great Britain, which are serious military powers, have to discharge that responsibility.
Cluster bombs do indeed need greater international regulation, especially in regard to the so-called dumb bombs, which have no self-destruct mechanism.
Britain is also a leading power in research into defence against biological and toxin weapons, and given the current terrorist threat by fundamentalist Islam, Britain has to maintain its independence and freedom of action in this sphere.
(NL) Mr President, the manufacture and use of biological weapons used to be the preserve of states.
These days, progress in biotechnology is such that ever fewer resources are needed to produce dangerous viruses, bacteria and poisons, and the consequence of this is that terrorist organisations, too, can resort to biological warfare.
In March of this year, Interpol pointed out that there are serious indications that al-Qaeda is preparing to commit acts of biological terrorism.
The scale of the destruction that could result in that way far outstrips that of the attacks in New York, Madrid and London.
It is impossible to conclude agreements with terrorists in the same way as states do with one another.
It is of vital importance that police forces be further trained in order to prevent and control biological terror.
Some legislation may well need to be adapted in order to make it possible to check sensitive scientific research.
There is still a need to give attention to the exchange of information between intelligence services within the European Union, but also with our partners in the United States, Russia and in all other nations that want to discharge their responsibilities in the fight against terrorism.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports this draft resolution, because it sees it as a decisive step in the strategy to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was adopted by Europe in December 2003, and also because it makes reducing the biological weapons threat a top priority.
At the same time, another important initiative is that we are calling on all countries that have not yet done so to abide by the legislation banning biological weapons, not least in order to achieve that universality that is an integral and binding part of international law.
Within this basic framework, there are in any case measures designed to ensure that the Convention is effectively implemented, although in the most recent analysis the United States failed to comply with these measures.
I should also like to stress the importance of the appeal made in the resolution to finalise a specific Protocol 6 unequivocally banning the manufacture and use of cluster bombs, despicable weapons even used in humanitarian wars to get round the Mine Ban Convention.
At the same time, Europe needs to show that there is a direct link between trends towards proliferation, which must be strenuously repressed, and the failure to disarm.
The West will have greater moral authority to oppose the proliferation of any kind of weapon if: 1) the United States stops opposing the adoption of inspection measures and the banning of cluster bombs; and 2) the disarmament process is resumed even within the nuclear club.
What has happened today is therefore an important step, but it is merely the first on the long road towards a ban on all weapons of mass destruction.
(ES) Mr President, like so many other instruments that regulate arms at world level, the existence of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a necessary, though not sufficient, tool in the fight against human irrationality.
There is therefore only one acceptable option for the sixth review conference which is to begin on 20 November: to strengthen that instrument, particularly with a view to developing genuine verification mechanisms, and to promote its universal application.
Furthermore, with regard to cluster bombs, I can only vigorously support the call for the Convention on Inhuman Weapons to be provided with a sixth protocol.
In my view, it should even be provided with a specific and complete treaty, which unambiguously prohibits the production, storage, transfer and use of this kind of weapon, as in the case of anti-personnel mines.
In view of the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs and the enormous impact they have on the civilian population, the use of those weapons must no longer be tolerated in any way.
The case of Lebanon, which is currently under investigation, is just one example of many that illustrate the reason for this.
(PT) In recent years we have witnessed the erosion of the most important legal instruments for combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is no exception.
We are more vulnerable than ever to devastating terrorist attacks.
The main ideas contained in this resolution, on which notable consensus has been reached across all political groups in Parliament, are decades old and applicable to other conventions, too.
These ideas can be summed up under three headings: universalisation, application and verification.
The notorious cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines must be combated.
These immoral arms must also be outlawed.
These bombs spread death indiscriminately and the fact that they have a low rate of immediate explosion means that they continue to kill innocent people many years after conflicts have ended.
The recent war in Lebanon, in which Israel left the country mined with thousands of cluster bombs, should give us the impetus to ban, once and for all, the manufacture and use of all kinds of cluster bomb, as we have done with anti-personnel mines.
Perhaps merely adding a new protocol to the existing Convention against certain conventional weapons is not enough; perhaps the time has come for a specific convention.
This does not matter, provided the EU takes action and the human race joins forces to eradicate these heinous weapons.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union and the Council are very concerned that people in conflict zones are injured or die when the conflict itself has ended.
This is patently clear in the case of Lebanon today, where unexploded bombs are a real problem for the civilian population.
The Presidency is pleased that the Protocol relating to unexploded ordnance has entered into force.
In the future we will be working to ensure that the harm caused to the civilian population by munitions remains minimal.
As for international cooperation on cluster bombs from here on, we will continue our efforts to find a common position in the European Union and make headway on this.
Finally, I wish to say that Mrs Beer and her colleagues will be receiving an answer to their letter to the Presidency in the very near future.
Vice-president of the Commission.
Mr President, the informed debate that has taken place on these issues is one more strand in the argument against war and another argument for prevention and hopefully being able to avoid the use of these weapons.
As you know, under the common foreign and security policy, these are not areas in which the Commission takes the lead.
However, we are part of the solution when dealing with the aftermath of war.
The human suffering, unexploded munitions and humanitarian problems which result from wars around the world are a challenge for us.
The Commission will of course continue to support the clearance of such weapons, working with the international community and NGOs.
The war in Lebanon lasted a few days, but the human suffering will continue for many years.
In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
European initiative in the field of civil protection (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the European initiative in the field of civil protection by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, by Mr Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development and by Mr Daul, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (B6-0442/2006).
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the European Commission, the experience acquired over recent years from dealing with natural and man-made disasters has revealed that there are shortcomings in the capacity for national intervention and, consequently, increased expectations of Community assistance, assistance which will need to have the attributes of effective intervention in the field of prevention and rapid response.
From this point of view, an early warning and response system is needed, based on the following four components: identification and assessment of the risks, constant monitoring of the risks, a warning and communication mechanism and, lastly, preparedness, in other words the ability to respond and help.
Allow me to refer briefly to certain parameters of particular importance which characterise such an effective civil protection mechanism, as referred to in the exceptional Barnier report passed by plenary and in the report which I presented to the Euro-Mediterranean plenary.
We need a lookout system, intervention units from the participating states, response guidelines and the relevant information for citizens, best practices for dealing with situations and mutual consular assistance in determining contact points between Member States.
It goes without saying that, without the necessary funding and the fundamental participation of the Member States, the entire endeavour will remain in abeyance.
The question, therefore, Madam President-in-Office, is whether the Council has the will to respond to the demand and, of course, to secure the necessary cooperation of the Member States.
I believe that, in the relevant decisions, the need to respond to the demand and expectations of the citizens will ultimately prevail, dictated first and foremost by the increase in and frequency and intensity of natural disasters which result in loss of life as well as financial and environmental damage.
In addition, we must always bear in mind that promoting cooperation between the Member States in the field of civil protection will gradually consolidate a European conscience in the citizens and will be a visible example of the solidarity which must distinguish the European Union.
author. - (ES) Mr President, without going into the underlying causes, over recent years several countries have been suffering serious natural disasters.
Particularly in the summer, we have suffered fires, floods and the effects of a particularly severe drought.
We frequently see how the affected regions of the Member States, sometimes of the most developed ones, lack sufficient resources to deal with these phenomena themselves.
Nevertheless, it sometimes seems that we are more conscientious about offering our solidarity when the damage is done thousands of kilometres away than we are when it is done in a Member State.
Despite all of this, the Council appears to be sticking to a passive approach.
Some people will say that no more money should be spent, but it is not a financial issue, and one example of this is that you, representatives of the Council, are not making any progress on the reform of the European Solidarity Fund, which will not cost a single additional euro from the Community budget.
Sometimes we are in no position to criticise.
Plenary approved the sending of a delegation to the most affected regions at the beginning of September, and, Mr President, Parliament's Bureau is still tied up with regulatory issues that it has to sort out before it can give the green light to that delegation.
We shall not lose heart, however, because nobody believes that we should not provide resources for a common effort that will make us more effective when it comes to helping people.
The principle of subsidiarity will be respected as well.
There is no intention of impinging on the sovereignty of any Member State.
There is a report, for which Mr Barnier is responsible, on the table in the Council, which provides a good basis for this work.
I would like to know whether the Council intends to pursue this issue.
The European Parliament will undoubtedly give its enthusiastic support, and Europeans will be grateful for that.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, no region can cope unaided with natural disasters, whether these be forest fires, earthquakes or floods.
Fighting them, and, moreover, coping with their aftermath, goes beyond the capacities of regional authorities, and so the regions affected are reliant on solidarity, primarily on aid from neighbouring regions and support from the national level, with which responsibility for civil protection and disaster prevention lies.
I would like to make it clear that we have no need of new powers at European level, which would duplicate structures and waste money on administrative apparatus.
I also find somewhat problematic the idea of using European money from the structural funds or even money intended for rural development.
European policy for rural areas looks towards the future; it supports the nation states in their regional investment strategies in international competition.
There are those who are now demanding that these valuable resources be put to work in preventing forest fires and compensating their victims, and, on that front too, I have to say that it does not seem to make much sense to use European taxpayers' money for such things as firebreaks.
As we all know, the European Solidarity Fund is there to deal with really major disasters, for those very situations in which individual countries are unable to cope with natural calamities, but I would demand that this fund be more flexible in its use of money.
I also call for more binding rules on the international coordination of crisis interventions, initially bilaterally between the states concerned and in exceptional cases at the European level too, but, please, let there be no new European superstructures in the civil protection field and no more wasting of valuable European resources on tasks that really should, in the main, be left to the nation states!
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in drafting its answer, the Council has gone on the assumption that the honourable Members wish to know how the Union's civil protection services are to be developed and taken forward by the Council.
Their introductory speeches have now confirmed that our assumption was correct and that this is indeed the issue.
The primary goal in the work of the Council is to establish better coordination to ensure that assistance interventions function more efficiently.
The Council will rely on this in existing structures, such as the civil protection monitoring and information centre that operates in association with the Commission and the Secretariat-General of the Council of the European Union.
The second goal of the Council's work is to provide assistance quickly wherever it is needed.
The Member States themselves have the main responsibility for providing assistance in emergencies.
With reference to a Commission proposal for establishing a financial instrument for emergency services and rapid assistance interventions, the Council is examining whether, with certain conditions in place, a proportion of the Community budget appropriations allocated for EU civil protection operations could be used for the hire of transport and equipment.
All this shows that the Council considers it very important to strengthen the European Union's preparedness in the area of civil protection.
Mr President, the fact that this is the third time in recent months that we have discussed this issue demonstrates the enhanced sensitivity of the European Parliament.
I have pointed out on another occasion that it is a paradox that we have a common policy for farmers, the environment and regional development, but have no policy for the natural disasters that affect farmers and regional development and the environment.
This is a paradox in the functioning of the European Union to date.
Furthermore, I consider that indifference on these issues is also strengthening Euro-scepticism.
The image of the European Union would be much more positive if there were a European mechanism and if the European Union were present after any natural disaster at the problem faced at that moment by the citizens.
We need to understand this.
I do not think that particular thought is needed in order to adopt this perception.
We do not want substitution of the Member States.
Of course the Member States will also continue to be present, but what we want is for there to be coordination.
Minister, it was the Council that called on Mr Îarnier, a distinguished European and successful Commissioner, to table a proposal to you, not us.
You noted the Council proposal in June and, since then, the proposal has remained without there being any development.
You need to tell us something.
I know that you do not merely represent your country here; you represent 25 countries and you must coordinate between yourselves, really coordinate.
Months have gone past.
Must we wait again for disasters as happened in Germany in 2002 before we do something?
At that time, the disasters were the reason we set up the Solidarity Fund.
We cannot proceed in this fashion.
You need to say something clearer at some point and you have time up to December to raise the matter and to follow up the Barnier report.
You owe it to yourselves, because you called on him to draft that report, and you owe it, above all, to the citizens of Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as times change, so do needs.
The climate is no longer what it was dozens of years ago.
All year round, parched dry days alternate with days of torrential rain.
'Climate change is not science fiction', said Kofi Annan today as he opened the Climate Change Conference in Nairobi.
Insurance experts have predicted that natural disasters will cause EUR 2.3 billion's worth of damage in 2040.
Climate change lies at the root of natural disasters throughout the world that have left a trail of destruction and death in their wake.
Global warming is one of the major problems of our times.
It is necessary to raise awareness among the citizens and encourage them to take part in the prevention of these disasters, although responsibility for managing the response to natural disasters rests primarily with the country affected, with the Union playing a supporting role.
The Community civil protection mechanism must be strengthened with greater resources and more wide-ranging powers.
This indeed was what you said, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, but what actual form will this process of strengthening take?
What is the Council thinking of doing to enhance the European Civil Protection mechanism?
Does the Council support the idea of creating a European Strategic Coordination Centre responsible for gathering and disseminating information on emergencies and for making rapid reaction resources available for combating the different types of disaster?
What does the Council intend to do with the Barnier report, as mentioned earlier?
These are the questions to which we would like answers.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one area in which all Europeans expect effective Community responses, it is that of large-scale natural disasters.
Everyone has seen how, whenever major disasters such as the tsunami occur, there is a quick response on the part not only of individual countries and NGOs but also of our fellow citizens who, through their gifts of money, clothes and time, are able to join forces and take action.
However, we have also seen, when each of these disasters has occurred, that what was missing was proper organisation.
We are indeed confronted by inadequate organisation.
That is why, together with my group, I am in favour of implementing preventative actions and of putting in place the capacity to respond very quickly to the consequences of tragedies.
In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the quality of the Barnier report, which states the problem well and proposes solutions that are constructive not only - my fellow Members have already emphasised this - in terms, as one would expect, of efficiency but also of subsidiarity.
At this stage, I should like to point out where this report scores.
Although no one questions the fact that it is for the various military organisations, fire services and other players of various kinds to exercise their responsibilities in full, it has to be acknowledged that only the European Union is in a position to ensure preventative and responsive coordination.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that the European Union has thus had the opportunity to demonstrate at a global level that the word 'solidarity' is not devoid of meaning but may be translated as 'practical action'.
If, when disasters similar to those of the past occur - and there is, unfortunately, a danger of their doing so in 2007 - the European Union has a presence on the ground in order to offer a response to human suffering and to mitigate the material, technical and ecological disasters, it will be viewed by the world as a more unified and much more practical enterprise.
For this reason too, it is important for the Presidency successfully to carry out this operation as early as at the beginning of 2007.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - There are indeed two aspects.
There are disasters, natural and man-made, and there is terrorist attack.
Allow me to speak from the perspective of the UK, where we have experienced both of those within the last year.
Last December, at an oil-storage depot near London, we had the biggest fire in peacetime Europe.
In July there was a serious terrorist attack in central London, with three tube trains bombed below ground and a bus above ground.
In each case we coped. And it is more than just a question of subsidiarity.
We do not want to become dependent - and neither should anybody else.
So, I have a question.
What do you mean by 'European Consulates'?
Are these to be imposed upon national systems, over and above them?
Another question: the European Civil Defence Force referred to in the Barnier report - what is it going to do?
Is it an armed unit?
If so, under whose control?
Based where?
Could it be deployed without national government request or permission?
Finally, the Constitution included a European policy on the prevention of natural disasters and on civil protection.
A further question: is this an attempt to introduce parts of the dead Constitution into new legislation?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become very clear from this debate that the Council, Parliament and surely the Commission too share exactly the same goals.
Firstly, we have to be able to establish effective arrangements for coordination in the field of civil protection.
The other goal that we share is that assistance should go wherever it is needed efficiently.
It is worth bearing in mind that a high level of cooperation will be needed to achieve these shared goals.
We do not necessarily or automatically need new structures, and we should not imagine that something will run well merely by creating a new structure.
Cooperation is therefore paramount, and is a keyword here.
Furthermore, when we speak of certain natural disasters we have to remember, particularly when they occur outside the European Union, that there are a lot of players other than the European Union in the field.
In such situations, the Union needs to be part of a wider internationally coordinated operation.
The need for coordination in the field was very evident when the tsunami disaster struck, when there were dozens, even hundreds, of players in the field at the same time.
Mr Barnier's proposals are now being considered and digested by the Member States.
They are very ambitious, and right now the work of the Council work is focussed on finalising decisions on the financial instrument, leading to a common civil protection instrument.
Work is also nevertheless continuing with respect to Mr Barnier's proposals, and he has been invited to present his ideas at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 5 December.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(IT) This umpteenth and timely question on the sensitive matter of EU civil protection capacity puts the spotlight on one of the most convoluted and controversial sectors that the Member States have ever had to deal with.
As I have said before - I have talked to the Commission on a number of occasions and expressed my views in this House - since the civil protection sector is a matter for the individual Member States, it inevitably comes up against very different laws, types of professional training and practices.
For that reason, I have for some time supported the idea of capacity building and strengthening the coordination of the national intervention forces, with the aim of rendering the various national legislations more homogeneous.
In my view, such action has to be delegated to a special European Civil Protection Agency, on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Recent experience has taught us that, if you look beyond the willingness shown, for example, when the horrific tsunami hit part of the Indian Ocean in 2004, the European Union's emergency management is, I am sorry to say, utterly inadequate.
(FR) The strategy developed in the excellent Barnier report with a view to making the most of the very considerable efforts made by Europeans in the field of emergency aid could supplement the Community civil protection mechanism instituted in 2001, whether the crisis were internal or external to the EU.
I particularly approve of the proposal aimed at basing this force in the EU's seven outermost regions, which give Europe a human and territorial presence off the African coast - the Canaries and Madeira - in the Indian Ocean - RÃ©union - and in or close to the Americas - Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Azores - not to mention the overseas territories in the Pacific: French Polynesia and New Caledonia.
We must follow the example of the French Red Cross, which has created overseas-based teams for responding to humanitarian crises. These are capable of rushing to the area concerned in less than 24 hours, setting up emergency hospitals and providing tents, medicines, water supplies, telecommunications and logistical support.
In order to give practical expression to the 'Europe of projects', the European Union must take initiatives inspired by a clear, comprehensible and strong political will.
Enhanced civil protection on the part of Europe would involve a federative dimension, strongly identifying the action concerned as European, and, in accordance with the principle of solidarity dear to our Community, would represent a source of pride for our fellow citizens.
Framework for European Regulatory Agencies (debate)
The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the framework for European regulatory agencies.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its citizens need effective agencies that work transparently.
As you know, in order to promote this objective, on 28 June 2004 the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies.
In these conclusions, the Council focussed attention on the Commission's intention to put forward the proposal as a legally binding instrument, which would define the Regulatory Agencies' horizontal operating framework.
It was the Council's opinion that the proposal should deal with such issues as the establishment, work and monitoring of regulatory agencies, to ensure, in particular, that there would be consistency, transparency, good governance, credibility and cost-effectiveness, and that their activities would be lawful.
Afterwards, in February 2005, the Commission drafted an interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies.
The proposal stated that the purpose of the interinstitutional agreement was to reinforce the horizontal framework for the establishment, structure, work, evaluation and monitoring of the Regulatory Agencies.
When the draft was being considered at working group level, however, the Council, in April 2005, took the view that there could be no agreement on the issue in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, at least in terms of its content.
Nor was it considered possible to admit any legal basis for the Regulatory Agencies, because there is none in the Treaty for a legal act of this kind.
In Council discussions, various models were proposed for moving forward in this matter.
There was no agreement, however, on how this could be achieved.
During our Presidency, we have pondered various options for establishing an interinstitutional agreement on the Regulatory Agencies.
We have been paying particular attention to the content of the Commission's proposal and the matter of a legal basis.
The time has never been ripe, however, for a completely new proposal by the Commission.
So fresh talks on the matter have also been impossible to organise.
It is nonetheless clear that there is a need for more discussions on both the content of any forthcoming Commission proposal as well as its format.
It is important to remember that any horizontal operating framework in respect of the agencies must also function practically.
There needs to be a guarantee that there is a real need for their establishment and work, with a proper analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the project.
The Finnish Presidency is very aware that the European Parliament has focussed its attention on this matter on several occasions.
In its draft for an interinstitutional agreement, the Commission stressed that the Regulatory Bodies would have a public service function to perform.
They would improve the implementation and application of Community rules everywhere in the European Union.
Thus, it is not just a question of the creation of a legally binding framework to enhance the work of the Union.
We need to show the general public that the Union is trying to step up progress on issues that are important to them, credibly and cost-effectively, and in this case with the help of Regulatory Agencies.
Vice-president of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission still considers that an interinstitutional agreement seems the best solution for a framework for regulatory agencies.
Only this legal instrument has the advantage of involving the three institutions from the outset and allows all three to agree good rules of governance applicable to regulatory agencies.
The recent creation of a number of new agencies, with more on the way, makes the case for progress still stronger.
We now have 21 agencies under the first pillar with 2 more on the way: the Gender Institute and the Chemicals Agency to be created under the REACH regulation.
We all seem to agree on the desirability of action.
If the problem is the instrument by which we should move forward and the proposed interinstitutional agreement is questioned, then the Council needs to explain what alternative it proposes.
The Commission is prepared to consider alternatives but needs to know how the Council would like to take this matter forward.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, the function of European regulatory agencies is closely linked both to multi-level European governance and to the European strategy on better lawmaking.
The state of interinstitutional inertia which this issue has reached leads me to address the following questions to the Council and to the Commission:
First, do the basic terms and criteria for the operating framework of the regulatory agencies need to be defined or not?
Secondly, the number of regulatory agencies appears to be on the increase, thereby exacerbating fragmentation and a lack of transparency and uniformity.
Will the Commission and the Council help towards rationalisation, transparency, democratic control and a horizontal approach to regulatory agencies?
Thirdly, the Commission has postponed its initiative.
The European Parliament has also, in turn, formulated its positions ambiguously.
Should the institutional diplomacy of silence on the part of the Council be interpreted as the postponement of the matter ad calendas grecas?
Fourthly, does the Council - and we expect a clear answer - consider the Commission's draft interinstitutional agreement to be a live text?
Fifthly, is the Commission prepared, should the Council take action, to reassess its draft and to restore it with new wording, so that it can form the basis for an interinstitutional agreement?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this state of affairs is, indeed, completely unsatisfactory.
There are 21 European agencies and a confusing plethora of models, all of them impenetrable to the public and Europe's citizens, even, indeed, to the bodies - such as this Parliament - representing them.
It is no good example of good and proper government that it should no longer be possible to gain an insight into what goes on in them.
As long ago as 2003, we warned that new arrangements would have to be made for these agencies, and we said so again in 2005; another year has now gone by, and nothing has happened.
Things cannot carry on like this.
The presidency really must make the effort to establish consensus in the Council as to how it may join with the other institutions - the Commission and Parliament - in putting together an agreement on the administration and accountability of these agencies.
As has been said, we are dealing here with things that the public are interested in; the Food Safety Authority, the Medicines Agency, the Chemicals Agency, the Environment Agency - all these have to do with things in which the people out there are interested, and if nobody has a clue as to who is responsible or how they work it is hardly surprising that people find European politics frustrating.
I have to tell the President-in-Office that what the Council is actually doing is forcing Parliament to have recourse to sharper weapons, for she will have seen how the Committee on Budgets did not release the funds for the new agencies, even though we actually want them.
The funds for the human rights agency, the Agency for Gender Equality and the Chemicals Agency, rather than being released, have been put in reserve in what is almost an emergency operation aimed at compelling the Council to clarify matters once and for all, and I hope that she will succeed in getting things moving on this front.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think it is fair to remind ourselves what would be the position without the existence of these regulatory agencies performing a vital supervisory function at the federal level.
If they were not to exist, the Commission would need to grow one vast centralised bureaucracy and appoint an army of prefects and inspecteurs de finances to patrol the Union.
But we should develop a far less spontaneous and more coordinated approach to setting up the agencies.
They should become an example of modern European governance: consultative, transparent, autonomous and accountable.
Parliament itself should exercise a greater degree of self-restraint here and retain a dispassionate scrutiny, so that we are able to exercise our authority for the discharge.
I agree with the Commission that an interinstitutional agreement is sorely needed, but if it is blocked I would ask the Commission to consider a regulation on the basis of Article 308.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I say thank you for the comments which the Presidency has received on this issue from the various teams.
As I said in my opening speech, this autumn we have thought about and tried to find different alternatives to this interinstitutional agreement.
The particularly crucial aspects of the Commission's proposal are its content and the issue of a legal basis.
It is absolutely essential that we create a regulatory environment and an operating framework that function successfully, rationally and cost-effectively, where it concerns practical matters as well.
We clearly need continued debate among the Member States to hone this project, and we shall endeavour to promote and fine-tune this debate throughout our presidential term.
Vice-President of the Commission.
Mr President, this could be the right moment to repeat the common set of good governance principles that the Commission wanted to include in an interinstitutional agreement to oversee and help the functioning of these agencies, because it would give a definition of these agencies and would create rules on their creation, structure and functioning, including issues of transparency, evaluation and control.
In all this discussion about the format, it is important to remember the content.
We in the Commission are ready to explore the option mentioned by Mr Duff of considering a regulation under Article 308.
We are open to exploring that option.
However, as far as the decision-making process is concerned, the European Parliament, for example, would only have a consultative role in the content of the future regulation.
That is why our preference was for an interinstitutional agreement.
Finally, I can only express our hopes for a dialogue on these issues.
We shall continue to look for the most appropriate, effective and cost-effective method to deal with these necessary issues to try to establish some common rules and a common set of good governance principles for the agencies.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.35 p.m.)
As I explained earlier, the sitting was suspended because Parliament's work was running ahead of time for the first time in this legislative period.
A Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension (debate)
The next item is the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a Baltic Sea strategy for the northern dimension.
rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for those kind words.
I will try to be like a talkative Finn and use a maximum of five minutes of your time.
I would like to set three questions.
First of all, what is this report all about?
Secondly, why are we tabling this report?
And thirdly, what do we actually want?
On the first question of what this report is about, it is about a Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension.
I will stress that again, especially for the Finns sitting across the table.
It is a Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension, so the aim is to strengthen that concept.
Our thinking in this report is that the Northern Dimension is based on three wonderful pillars.
One of them is what we call the Paavo VÃ€yrynen pillar, in other words the Arctic.
The second is what we might call the Mr Paasilinna pillar, which is Russia, and the third is what we would call the Mr Beazley pillar, which is the Baltic and the Baltic Sea Strategy.
This report focuses on the Baltic Sea Strategy only.
The report has three aims.
One: to support the Northern Dimension.
Two: to make the Baltic Sea a priority of the Northern Dimension - we firmly believe that should be the key area of the Northern Dimension itself.
Three: we want to raise awareness of the Baltic Sea as a brand, as a concept.
Why are we tabling this report and why are we tabling it now?
The first reason is general, and it is that after enlargement in 2004 the Baltic Sea became an inner sea, a mare nostrum.
We have eight EU States around the sea, one of them is non-EU, that is Russia and then of course there is Kaliningrad.
But basically it is an EU sea.
We have a wonderful window of opportunity for two reasons.
The first is that we have the Finnish Presidency, which gives us an opportunity to push this issue forward, and the second is that we have an EU-Russia summit on 24 November.
That is why we wanted to push this through as fast as possible.
For those who have not visited the Baltic Sea, I remember from when I was a child that in many places you could actually see the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The average depth is 58 metres.
Standing on the pier you could see to the bottom.
It was clear.
You could see the seaweed.
It was a wonderful place to swim in.
For those who have been there lately, it is green gunk nowadays.
Green gunk!
It is really nasty.
It is in really bad shape.
Oxygen levels are very low.
You can see virtually nothing at all.
It is time to react.
58 metres average depth!
It takes 30 years for a drop of water to go in, and then out of the Baltic Sea, so the circulation is very slow.
People from the Mediterranean may have a completely different understanding of water.
They see the Mediterranean - clear, blue and wonderful.
We see green and nasty.
Something needs to be done.
This report also deals with the economy.
It deals with culture and security.
The third and final point: what do we want?
One could summarise the report in religious terms, saying that we want the Ten Commandments of the Baltic Sea.
The First Commandment goes to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and her team.
It is that we want the Commission to take an initiative on the Baltic Sea Strategy.
It would be wonderful if the Commission could do that in one form or another.
The Second is for a summit meeting before every European Council, where the Heads of State and Governments of the Baltic Sea region, including Germany, get together and discuss their positions.
Third - and this has been an issue that has had overwhelming support among the people around the region, although there are one or two who disagree - we want a separate budget line.
We may think the world revolves around money.
But if you want to have a true Baltic Sea Strategy, you need policies, and for those policies you need money.
It is as simple as that.
We are not saying this should be the only source.
As in the case of the Northern Dimension, support could come, for instance, from the ENP.
The Fourth Commandment is environmental protection, for instance the idea of protected areas.
The Fifth is a rather topical issue, and that is an energy market and an energy policy for this area.
Of course I will not mention the pipeline between Russia and Germany in this instance.
The Sixth Commandment is infrastructure.
We need to work on infrastructure. That means water, air, rail and roads, to get the infrastructure to work well.
Seventh, we would like to see the application of all four free movements in the area, that is, the free movement of money, the free movement of people, the free movement of goods and the free movement of services.
Eighth, we would like to have good exchange among centres of excellence.
We would like to have good student exchanges.
Ninth, and this is a pet subject of Mr Lax, we would like to have fluid border crossings.
Finns know the problems with that.
Tenth, we need the increased presence of Europol.
All in all, I ask for three practical things.
One: a Commission initiative.
Two: for the Finnish Presidency to bring up this issue as part of the Northern Dimension package at the EU-Russia summit.
Four amendments have been tabled.
As rapporteur, I will put a plus sign in my voting list on two of those, and that is the amendment by the Greens and the amendment by Mrs JÃ€Ã€ttenmÃ€ki of the ALDE.
On the third one, which has to do with the Arctic region, I suggest a split vote.
On one part, I will certainly put a minus, on the other one I will put a plus.
On the final amendment, by Mr VÃ€yrynen, which suggests that there should be no separate budget line, I will put a minus and would ask most of my colleagues to do the same.
That is what the Baltic Sea Strategy is about, why we have it, and what we want.
(Applause)
This Presidency also takes note that you are desperate for a Mediterranean holiday.
We shall ask the Italian delegation to invite you down.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament plenary part-session is this week discussing several issues to do with the sea, as it is now with the Baltic Sea strategy.
The Presidency is delighted that regional issues are being discussed as part of a wider whole.
On Monday you held a debate on the EU marine environment strategy and directive, which again are a component in the EU's maritime policy now being prepared.
The parliamentary conference on the Northern Dimension planned for next spring is a welcome example of Parliament's interest in Nordic issues.
Baltic Sea issues affect the eight Member States of the Union that border the Baltic, as well as Russia, very directly.
Norway and Iceland are also involved in Baltic Sea cooperation as members of the Council of Baltic Sea States.
An important shipping waterway, the Baltic Sea is important for all EU countries.
Broad, horizontal cooperation is therefore needed both within the Union and between the EU and Russia and other partners on issues of the environment, energy, traffic, training, justice and home affairs and matters of health.
The Union's common maritime policy presently being drafted will also serve to strengthen this cooperation.
To achieve concrete results, there will also have to be more effective use made of the Union's internal funding programmes and external relations instruments.
Furthermore, there will need to be opportunities for cross-border cooperation, which is also supported by the new Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
The rapporteur's speech makes mention of the Northern Dimension, and it is proposed that the Baltic Sea Strategy is part of it, but the Northern Dimension is also a component in the EU's external relations policy.
It covers the operating sectors in the Four Common Spaces adopted by the EU and Russia, as well as environmental, social and public health issues.
The Baltic Sea is one of the target areas for the Northern Dimension, along with northwest Russia, Kaliningrad and the Arctic regions.
One of the aims of the Finnish Presidency is the review of policy under the Northern Dimension on the basis of the decisions taken at the Northern Dimension ministerial meeting held in November last year.
The new Framework Document for the Northern Dimension was negotiated this year between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland.
The Framework Document and the Political Declaration connected with it are to be adopted on Friday next week in Helsinki.
We believe that the new, jointly agreed policy is likely to strengthen the commitment of partners to the Northern Dimension and to provide a firm basis for practical cooperation in the Baltic Region.
We also hope that a reinforced Northern Dimension will help clarify the work and division of labour associated with the diverse network of cooperation in the Baltic and Arctic Regions.
The Baltic Sea's ecological state is worrying, and calls for urgent action in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The European Union, individual countries and international financial institutions have pooled their resources within a framework of environmental partnership under the Northern Dimension.
Several governments, organisations, in particular HELCOM (the Helsinki Commission), and other players are working to rescue the marine environment of the Baltic Sea.
Northern Dimension environmental partnership projects mainly focus on northwest Russia, but their impact benefits all the countries in the region.
As a result, the Baltic Sea is, fortunately, already a crucial area for the Northern Dimension.
A key instrument in the future for improving the state of all European seas, the Baltic included, will be the EU's Marine Strategy Directive.
Its aim is the achievement of 'good environmental status' by the year 2021.
It is an ambitious goal, and efforts to attain it must be started immediately.
The Finnish Presidency will try to find political consensus on the directive in the Council in December.
The Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing also functions within the framework of the Northern Dimension, and this is aimed at preventing contagious diseases and lifestyle illnesses as well as reducing social problems.
A new element in the Northern Dimension is also being drafted in the shape of a Transport and Logistics Partnership.
The importance of viable transport communications and efficient logistics for economic growth and competitiveness is underlined more than ever when our economies are interlinked.
Right now the European Commission is drafting a new and wide-ranging European maritime policy, one which takes account of the economic, political and environmental values associated with Europe's seas and coastal areas.
The Baltic Sea is one important sea area in Europe, and special attention should be paid to its special problems.
That is also true when it comes to developing the EU's maritime policy.
This evening's debate certainly serves this purpose.
The EU's maritime policy will be a good opportunity for cooperation among the Member States.
This is necessary, as the special characteristics of the northern and Arctic regions and exploitation of the region's potential will require joint research projects and technological development on the part of the EU Member States.
In cooperation with third countries typical of the region, existing international agreements and organisations are made use of.
The large number of challenges in the Baltic Sea area, such as marine conservation, safety at sea, fishing, sustainable use of coastlines and the development of the region's maritime sector, all call for effective, horizontal cooperation.
The Baltic Sea area is a splendid opportunity to test the EU's maritime policy now being drafted and make it beneficial to the entire Union.
The Baltic Sea issue is important, and it is a positive sign that serious attention is being paid to it in the European Union and here in Parliament.
I just have to say that some of the rapporteur's ideas, these Ten Commandments, are already a reality.
It is beneficial and vital to the Baltic question that all the countries in the region are involved in the programme of cooperation and that they are genuinely committed to resolving the challenges that they share.
It is this kind of joint commitment that we need to strive to accomplish in cooperation on the Baltic Sea.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission is most grateful to Mr Stubb for his report, and welcomes the opportunity for a debate.
There is no mistaking his commitment and determination.
The Baltic Sea is a very important sea for the European Union, since eight of the nine countries with a Baltic shoreline are EU Member States.
It is a meeting point for the European Union and Russia.
With this in mind, the new Northern Dimension Policy Framework Document, to be adopted later this month, will have as its priority areas the Baltic and Barents Seas, Kaliningrad and the Arctic.
The new Northern Dimension policy will be the regional expression, in the North, of the EU-Russia Common Spaces, with the full involvement of Norway and Iceland.
The Northern Dimension will also have its own priorities: health and social wellbeing and the protection of indigenous peoples in the High North, as well as particular emphasis on the environment and culture.
A common new Northern Dimension policy implies that all the partners will be bound by the same goal: its success.
Accordingly, cofinancing will be the rule, particularly in a context of an increasingly wealthy Russian Federation.
The Northern Dimension should not only be project-oriented, it should ensure a continuous policy dialogue on the various challenges and opportunities.
The four Northern Regional Councils the Baltic, Barents, Nordic and Arctic Councils are important actors in this dialogue.
The Commission is grateful for the attention Parliament has paid to this policy, and particularly for its resolution of 16 November 2005 ahead of the Northern Dimension ministerial meeting.
The Commission also commends the Parliament's initiative to call for the first conference of a Northern Dimension Parliamentary Forum early next year.
As for a Baltic Strategy within the Northern Dimension that we are discussing today, the Commission will bear this report by Parliament in mind during the discussions at the Northern Dimension event at which the new policy is to be adopted and which will be held back to back with the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki in the presence of the Prime Ministers of Norway and Iceland.
The Northern Dimension is an EU external policy, but it is clearly important to improve the inter-relationship between EU internal policies and the Northern Dimension.
That is why the Commission gives such priority to cross-border cooperation, which is one of the main value-added elements of the Northern Dimension.
This is indeed a field where internal and external policies necessarily meld together.
The Baltic Sea is now a Northern Dimension priority because we are concerned about its fragile environment and the increasing traffic through its waters, as is correctly highlighted in the report.
There are other less tangible threats to the citizens of the Baltic Sea region, including the fight against organised crime, human trafficking, transmissible diseases and unhealthy lifestyles.
All of these require our close cooperation with Russia, as well as with Norway and Iceland.
Furthermore, we see great potential for economic cooperation across the Baltic Sea with Russia.
These are all important objectives to which the Northern Dimension can make a great contribution and which will be elaborated upon in the future.
EU internal policies, with their own tasks and their own instruments, will of course also make a major contribution to meeting these challenges in EU Member States in the Baltic Sea region, and these should be debated in the appropriate contexts.
The Commission looks forward to using the new Northern Dimension policy to provide added value in a forum embracing Russia, Norway and Iceland in order to meet the many challenges facing the northern part of our continent.
In this context, the Commission welcomes the report by Parliament and will certainly convey the importance of the Baltic Sea region.
I will try to integrate relevant elements of this report into the implementation of the new common Northern Dimension policy.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I would like to focus on three of the issues raised in my committee's opinion.
First, I would like to stress our view of the importance of further exploitation of offshore wind energy in the Baltic and the demonstration of different types of wave energy concepts.
Secondly, I would like to emphasise the importance of developing further cooperation with Russia.
We want to cooperate on energy matters that ensure respect for the principles of reciprocity and transparency and we want to encourage Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on transit.
We have a concern about the supply of gas from Russia to Europe.
Thirdly, we invite Northern Dimension member countries to be aware of the importance of two EU programmes in our committee's area of responsibility: Galileo and SESAR, because we believe that the commitment of northern dimension parties to both of these would reinforce sustainable growth and competitiveness in the region.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - My prepared speech has been brilliantly summarised by Mr Stubb, the rapporteur, so I should simply like to put two questions.
First of all to the Minister, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, would she accept that, as the debate has already underlined, circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devised the Northern Dimension?
In other words, there are now eight EU Member States, not four, around the Baltic Sea, not all of which see the Northern Dimension in the same light.
The reason, for example, that the EU-Russia embellishment process has been stalled, as we know, is that Poland has a reserve over Russia's refusal to ratify the Energy Charter.
So would she accept that it would be very helpful at the Council of Ministers, at the preparatory phase of the Northern Dimension discussions and negotiations, first to have an internal EU discussion involving the eight EU Baltic States?
Secondly, I am very grateful to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for her comments and for agreeing to incorporate much of the report into the Commission's thinking about evolving and developing the Northern Dimension into the future.
But she did, I think, neglect to refer to the budget.
It seems to me that this is not a question of Parliament coming cap in hand, begging for support.
We are, after all, an arm of the EU's budgetary authority; it therefore seems to me logical and coherent that, if this is going to be an important element, there would be mechanisms and systems whereby, just as in other parts of the EU - EuroMed for example - we have a dedicated budget.
We should give serious consideration to this and not brush it under the carpet.
My final point is addressed again to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, and concerns communication, which is her brief.
It seems that this is an exercise which can bring a real message of accomplishment and achievement to the citizens of the EU, to show that a region dislocated completely by the Cold War can now have harmony, prosperity and stability restored.
So I think this debate should be taken out into the field, to the public, to show a real success story for the EU.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (LT) The Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension is certainly a significant document.
It reflects the merit of Alexander Stubb, the rapporteur, and the entire Baltic European Intergroup who have worked hard on it.
The storms of the Cold War have caused larger damage to the Baltic coast than to any other sea coast in terms of political, economic and ecological damage.
We can feel it even now, when the Baltic Sea is becoming an internal sea of the EU.
The intervening Russian coast provides a great opportunity to cooperate with this country.
The region, with its population of 85 million, is one of the economically and socially strongest in the EU; the welfare state model is implemented in many areas here.
However, differences in the standards of living among these countries are shocking, and the increase of social exclusion in some places is threatening.
This Strategy should help to overcome such trends.
Particular attention has been paid to environmental protection, economy and transportation.
All three elements of this triad are highly dependent on energy and energy security, which is violated when any one country exerts excessive potential or ambition.
Therefore, the countries in the region need a common energy market.
Even more attention should be paid to efficient energy use and to renewable energy resources.
Discussions and specific actions concerning nuclear energy are inevitable.
At the beginning of December, a power bridge will link Estonia and Finland and it must be reinforced with similar bridges between Lithuania and Sweden, and Lithuania and Poland.
The Strategy urges more rapid and firm networking of highways, railways and seaways in Northern and Central Europe.
Poland is right at the main crossroads.
If Warsaw fails to pay more attention to these projects, they will remain on paper for a long time.
The Baltic Sea is shallow and very vulnerable ecologically.
More than 60 tanker accidents and 400 illegal oil spills at sea are recorded every year.
The sea absorbs the unprocessed wastewater of a population of over a million living along the coast.
Therefore, seacoast protection zones must be established and extended, and more restrictive environmental protection standards must be applied than the ones presently provided for in the EU directives.
The European Union would like to have not merely a good but also a reliable neighbour in the Kaliningrad Region of the Russian Federation.
Georgiy Boos, the governor of the region, is treating Kaliningrad as a Russian window on Europe, as well as the EU's on Russia.
We would like this window to be wide open to fresh winds of cooperation.
A wider opening of this window, or an opposite process, would manifest the direction that Russia is moving in.
The proposal to assign a separate budget line for funding this Strategy would demonstrate the affinity and innovation of the Baltic region.
I am convinced of its worth, since it may and must become a laboratory for new ideas, projects and innovations which are equally significant on a larger scale.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the Northern Dimension is being strengthened in a way that is gratifying.
Here in the European Parliament we presented an initiative last year on a Baltic Sea Strategy realised within the framework of the Northern Dimension, and now we have a special report on it. It covers cooperation between the EU and its Member States, on the one hand, and cooperation with Russia, on the other.
The Commission and the Council have themselves negotiated agreements with Russia, Norway and Iceland, whereby the Northern Dimension of the Union's external relations policy will be a policy common to these countries and the Union.
These agreements are to be signed at the end of November in Helsinki.
The Commission should draw up a proposal for a Baltic Sea Strategy, as requested by Parliament, as soon as possible.
The Strategy should cover all areas of policy and both internal and external policy.
Its preparation and implementation will require the input of all the Commission's Directorates-General, and it should be financed out of all the relevant budget lines.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe does not think it wise to have a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy.
We are now amassing budget funds for neighbouring regions in the shape of the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
No good purpose will be served in splitting it up into new budget lines, and it would not increase funding for the Baltic Sea area; in fact it would more likely have the opposite effect.
It is of course a sexy notion that Mr Stubb has frequently spoken about, but we have to consider things from the point of view of substance, and not image.
The next step could be that the European Parliament might draft a new comprehensive report on the Northern Dimension that would take account of the Baltic Sea report now being discussed, on the one hand, and the agreements concluded with our neighbouring countries, Russia, Norway and Iceland, on the other.
I would finally like to thank Mr Stubb for his excellent levels of cooperation in drafting this report.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Alexander Stubb on his excellent report.
The enlargement of the European Union to take in the Baltic States created an objective need for a revised Northern Dimension instrument.
