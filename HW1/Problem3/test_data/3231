- I voted against the motion for a resolution because the reference in Article 1 to 're-certified aircraft with low by-pass ratios' would effectively put an end to a project to re-engine aircraft in an unemployment blackspot of West Wales which could potentially create 400 jobs.
This is because the engines which the company concerned plans to use have a by-pass ratio of less than three and so would be excluded from EU airspace under the Regulation as it stands.
Article 2(2) excludes from the scope of the Regulation only aircraft which have been completely re-engined 'with engines having a by-pass ratio of three or more' .
This is in spite of the fact that the engines in question would easily meet all noise and emissions standards.
Aircraft noise is not determined by engine by-pass ratio alone, and I believe that aircraft noise should be measured by the actual noise made during take-off, fly-past and landing as is the case under the Chicago Convention.
The aim of the regulation is to reduce noise pollution around Community airports, which are generally close to the Union' s economic centres, hence in highly urbanised zones.
This regulation provides for the banning, as from May 2000, of certain noisy aircraft equipped with noise reduction devices known as 'hushkits' .
The civil aviation industry is experiencing annual growth of some 6% and this is expected to double in 10 years!
This has to be accompanied by a progressive reduction in noise ascribable to aircraft.
The noise issue is equally topical in American airports.
Stricter rules on aircraft noise must be established at international level, within the ICAO.
That is stressed in the resolution.
In 1999, the regulation was suspended for a year. It will be implemented in May with a large number of exemptions.
The latest Euro-American talks suggest this conflict is not about to be settled. On top of everything else, the Americans have lodged an appeal with the ICAO.
The American industry exerts enormous pressure and the situation is distorted by the prospect of the elections.
The United States' position on the regulation is ambiguous; in fact, although the United States government is in favour of ending the litigation, American manufacturers are totally against the standards set out in the regulation which would penalise them.
But how can anyone defend such exemptions on the pretext that there is disagreement?
Did we tell French and Belgian chocolate manufacturers the directive would be suspended or there would be exemptions?
Have we told hunters the 'birds' directive is on the back-burner or exemptions can apply because there is disagreement?
What is the point of a legal text, months of consultation, drafting, work in committee, if it is not to be implemented?
Is the European Union really just there to serve the multinationals and big business?
This is not a lot of fuss about nothing.
The Union should not be afraid of American threats and retaliatory measures.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy unanimously supported the European Commission by adopting a draft resolution rejecting the indefinite postponement of implementation and calling on the United States not to use retaliatory measures.
A strong message is needed so that the international community can get the measure of the strength of European convictions in the battle against noise.
Resolution on Mediterranean policy
What you call a European Union 'Mediterranean policy' merely consists of creating the political conditions to allow the large industrial conglomerates of Europe to take advantage of the low wages, natural resources and government contracts of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, and secure new outlets for their products.
That 'cooperation' is the cooperation of the wolf with the lamb, and the poor majority of the population only get the dubious advantage of being exploited for the benefit not just of local potentates, but of European businesses too.
For two centuries France' s Mediterranean policy consisted of the colonisation of Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. Italy' s was the occupation of Libya, and Britain' s the shameless looting of Egypt.
Voices have been rightly raised in this very House against the dictatorship that holds sway in Tunisia and the one that continues to rule in Morocco, even if it is more moderate.
So why do we forget the material, military and diplomatic support France has given those regimes?
Why do we forget France' s responsibility for the war it waged in Algeria and for the tragic situation that still exists in that country today?
Our solidarity is with the working classes of the Mediterranean region and that means we are opposed to the cooperation between owners and rulers promoted by this resolution.
Since the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership on 27 and 28 November 1995 in Barcelona, the political context has changed.
The partnership has failed to meet the expectations raised by the countries participating in the conference.
We are anxious to preserve the Mediterranean Basin as an area of trade and dialogue, and we want the Barcelona Process relaunched without ill-considered intervention by the European Union.
In fact, the latter must take action to achieve a cultural, social and human partnership.
There are still many social challenges to be faced.
The implementation of an economic partnership is especially vital for agriculture.
The European Union must provide compensation for the crucial difficulties in this sector, notably as regards fruit and vegetables, and wine-growing.
The European Union must consider the island regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in terms of fisheries and agriculture.
We are hoping for synergy in the coordination of the interregional and transnational cooperation programmes, and for coordination between the Interreg and MEDA programmes.
Finally, would it not be appropriate to arrange a Euro-Mediterranean conference on agriculture and fisheries involving the representatives of local and regional communities as well as professional organisations?
Our reluctance to participate in the joint motion for a resolution and the vote is based on our rejection of a situation where the European Union would replace the Member States, come what may, in Mediterranean policy.
In fact, Member States are directly affected by this policy.
The European Union has a duty to be extremely vigilant about imports of agricultural products which threaten to imperil the whole of European production.
HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report (A5-0057/2000)
Mr President, the action plans on asylum and migration, focusing on the problems encountered by the countries of origin and transit of asylum seekers and migrants, seem to us an excellent initiative in principle.
So we are astonished at the severity of the European Parliament' s report and the general tone of yesterday' s debate.
The fact is, to have any impact on migratory flows, it is necessary to act on their indirect causes.
So the action plans aim to draw up a list of problems for each target country, whether they be related to the political institutions, human rights, the economy or the government, and propose an integrated approach to the countries of the Union and to third countries, combining development aid, legal measures or foreign policy actions.
So, in our opinion, it is an intelligent exercise, and the kind of thing which should be done more often at European level.
Why, then, are so many Members critical?
First of all, because in their view this intelligent exercise is taking place in an excessively intergovernmental context and the High Level Working Group responsible for drawing up the plans is made up of Commission representatives and also - I shudder in relating - national civil servants.
But, in our view, while consultation is useful at European level, it is precisely this presence of national civil servants, and the essential inclusion of the Member States in decision making which is the necessary condition of effective action plans
The second criticism is that the action plans are too repressive because they contain measures to combat uncontrolled immigration and they advocate an extension of the readmission agreements with third countries.
But that is not a defect for us; on the contrary, it is a good idea.
Indeed, it is an absolutely indispensable aspect of the plans.
It makes no sense to want everything and its opposite at the same time.
Mr President, I voted against the HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report on asylum seekers and migrants, not because I am opposed to an action plan for receiving and supporting those who are less fortunate than ourselves and who are forced to emigrate and request asylum from countries near or far - for I am strongly in favour of such a measure - but because this report does not place sufficient emphasis on the procedures for distinguishing between genuine and false asylum seekers, for the latter are, sadly, nothing but disruptive elements who damage those who have a genuine, practical need for asylum and assistance, and who must therefore receive it.
I abstained on the final vote on this report on the basis of my speech on Wednesday evening.
I am not in any way against the intentions or sentiments of the report but solely in respect of the action plan on Sri Lanka.
I believe that it is inadequate and that there is far too little attention paid to the need to seek a political solution in Sri Lanka.
It is all too apparent that we cannot rely on the Sri Lankan government to give independent access to politicians or journalists to the war zones, nor for impartial evidence on what is really happening regarding human rights abuses and allegations of torture and similar practices by, or with the tacit approval of, the Sri Lankan government.
The war in Sri Lanka, President, is one that neither side can win and unless and until there are peace negotiations there will always be applications for asylum seekers in the west, almost all of whom will be Tamils.
The European Parliament I believe has a role to play in arguing that the European Union must bring pressure to bear on the Sri Lankan government to seek peace.
Europe can be the peace intermediary to bring such a peaceful solution to the island of Sri Lanka and peace for the Tamil and Sinhalese communities and others in Sri Lanka.
On the pretext of contributing to building a European immigration and asylum policy, this resolution' s standpoint has nothing to do with freedom for the nationals of poor countries to travel and possibly settle in Europe, but is all about bolstering the slave trade which involves regulating the flow of immigrants as a function of demand from the manufacturing companies of Europe.
When it comes to the right of asylum, statements of principle are one thing, the reality of the situation is quite another.
In France, for example, only 2,000 of 7,000 asylum applications have been accepted.
The rejected asylum seekers become stateless people, victims of the open season on migrants, which is no less disgraceful for being regulated.
And what price the subtle distinctions in the report between 'immigration' and 'asylum proper' , when social reality means that a surreal economic organisation condemns millions of people to torture or death by hunger as surely as in dictators' dungeons?
The only reason we are not voting against this text is that we refuse to be associated with the extreme right and their despicable ranting.
But our institutions are organically incapable of eliminating the causes which force tens of millions of men, women and children into exile across the world, fleeing oppression or destitution, because that would require society to share the wealth it produces equally, instead of leaving that to the discretion of a few thousand financial groups and their shareholders.

In the last half century, after several centuries' pause, massive migrations have started again on the planet.
From south to north, from east to west, across Europe, these ceaseless waves of migrants destabilise the economic, budgetary, social, urban, religious and cultural balance.
Security, the first fundamental public freedom, is no longer guaranteed in European towns, the scene, since the 1970s, of drugs, muggings on trains, in the streets, on public transport, cars set alight, schools vandalised, murderous new crimes, lawlessness in the suburbs, town centres emptying and fear seeping in and taking over.
Observation of the facts shows that these two phenomena, migration and insecurity, are linked in time and space and involve the same persons. It can therefore be legitimately concluded that this is a case of cause and effect.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe has been in charge of the regulation of asylum, refugees and migrants. So what is Europe doing?
Europe is drawing up plans and developing measures, 108 to be precise, with unspecified funding of course.
Faced with a planetary phenomenon of migration, we counter it with plans, budgets and information campaigns.
No doubt if Rome, Byzantium, Spain and Europe had had such plans, then Alaric, Attila, the Saracens, Tamburlaine, the Ottomans, the sack of Rome, the fall of Constantinople, the raids on the Mediterranean coasts and centuries of fear could all have been prevented.
What it all adds up to is that, once again, the decision makers of the European Union are not dealing with either the causes or the scope of the problem.
In the end, if there is a migration towards the European continent, that is because this continent is emptying fast.
Italy, for example, will lose 17 million people from the workforce between now and 2050, and you are happy to conclude, along with the UN population division, that 159 million non-Europeans will have to be imported between now and 2050.
But between now and 2050, two generations could be born here, in Europe, with the right demographic policy for the same budgetary cost as has been allocated to importing non-Europeans.
With population growth relaunched, Europe would create the internal market, the new demand and the additional dynamism needed to resolve at a stroke the stupid problem of unemployment created artificially by a policy of recession, immigration and ruinous taxation.
But for that to happen, we would have to deal with causes and the European Union is all about treating symptoms, prescribing palliatives and nursing care for an extremely elderly continent which is being allowed to sink into an Asian and African demographic lagoon.
Klamt report (A5-0052/2000)
Mr President, we have naturally supported Mrs Klamt' s report because of our desire and our duty to protect our children and everyone else in an extremely vulnerable position.
The report is also a good text in that respect.
However, after the speeches other Members have made about the necessary and legitimate condemnation of child prostitution, those who organise it and those who make use of it, I want to talk about the general phenomenon of prostitution.
In the wake of Mrs GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Roure, who tackled this phenomenon, I want to mention the upsurge in prostitution in Strasbourg and Brussels during this Parliament' s part-sessions.
Of course, our institution as such is not responsible for this evil.
All the same, the coincidence is distressing.
Tolerating prostitution, closing one' s eyes to the shop windows, right here in Brussels, where prostitutes are on show like so much merchandise, as if this were a commercial activity which could be listed in a trading register, is ignoble and also irresponsible on the part of elected representatives responsible for the welfare of the community.
We can hardly be surprised that certain individuals, at best psychologically weak, at worst deliberately criminal, lose all their moral principles and commit reprehensible acts not because of any geographic remoteness or cultural difference, but because, in their own countries, those moral principles have disintegrated.
It is not just children' s human dignity that must be defended, even though their natural vulnerability justifies our affording them major protection.
That dignity must be defended and promoted for each and every one of us.
If dignity does not belong to everyone then it ceases to exist.
The struggle against the scourge of prostitution will only be really effective when we stop talking about ourselves in one way and about other people in another way, and when we apply to ourselves the principles and measures we legitimately want to see applied elsewhere.
Selling one' s body to survive is often the outcome of a desperate situation which we must remedy by ambitious policies to develop and support charitable organisations involved in bringing up children.
Exploiting that economic and social misery, as pimp or client, is a criminal act and that is how we must approach it.
The Klamt report is perhaps not sufficiently ambitious, but at least it has the merit of going in the right direction.
Mr President, I voted for the Klamt report, not only because I am in favour of any measure which contributes to eliminating child sex tourism, but also because I want to provide encouragement for more to be done.
I would argue that the report still lacks something, namely greater focus on procedures for punishing the citizens of the European Union States, who, sadly, are the main perpetrators of this abomination.
We must not forget that there are many Europeans who feed this scourge of the new millennium
The text we are debating today certainly affects us more than most since it is about protecting children against sex tourism.
The European Commission has drawn up a report of the measures which have been taken in this field.
In view of the results, it is clear that the European Union and its Member States must increase their efforts to combat sex tourism and the exploitation of children.
The Member States must pass extra-territorial legislation allowing them to carry out investigations, prosecute and punish any individual guilty of crimes committed abroad and linked to child sex abuse.
We must go even further and establish measures such as a coherent child protection policy by creating a new general legal base in the context of the next revision of the Treaty, with adequate Community funding.
I also think it is essential to incorporate the rights of the child into the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.
In conjunction with this, we must take action at grass-roots level by encouraging travel agencies, tour operators, transport and advertising companies to set up self-regulation systems designed to combat child sex tourism, and by creating free helplines for children in distress in every Member State.
Exemplary penalties must be imposed on the people guilty of such monstrous behaviour.
The fact is, when people are in a foreign country, in an unfamiliar region, they can act in complete anonymity and convince themselves that child abuse is less reprehensible in a different social and cultural context, and that the moral principles in force in their own country do not apply.
That is intolerable!
We must not be blind to the fact that the Internet facilitates these 'practices' .
This is why Parliament calls on the Commission to assess the link between child pornography on the Internet and the growth in sex tourism, and to propose practical measures against the phenomenon!
It is also essential to recognise that prostitution in general in the developing countries is very often due to poverty, affecting children, women and men.
We must also fight on those grounds because there will always be unscrupulous people around to exploit human poverty.
I want to end by reaffirming that children, this world' s future, are one of the most vulnerable groups in the population, with specific needs that have to be protected.
We must never forget that every individual' s childhood and the particular circumstances of their family and social circle in large measure determines their adult life.
Consequently, all the European Union and Member State institutions must be inspired in their action by the protection of children' s rights as recognised in the United Nations Convention of 20 November 1989.
I am voting with total conviction in favour of Ewa Klamt' s report on combating child sex tourism.
Amendment No 1, which defines the child as any person under the age of 18 years, seems to me essential to the consistency of this report.
The report rightly places this form of slavery in the general context of cross-border organised crime.
That means the fight we are engaged in here cannot be dissociated from the problem of the trade in human beings and child pornography.
Faced with the exponential development of the latter on the Internet, Amendment No 2 is essential.
It is all the more necessary to criminalise these forms of child slavery because there is a line of thought seeking to gain currency today for the idea that 'sex workers' are workers like any others.
But a fundamental boundary has been overstepped when sexually exploited children are also represented as 'workers' .
In fact, this comes down to accepting the phenomenon of child sex tourism, on the pretext that the social and cultural context is different in countries where it is not unusual to work as a little slave from the age of five.
To stop that kind of sideways drift, the report rightly recommends supporting the draft optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography portraying minors, which would be attached to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Criminal law must remain within the Member States' area of competence but, to be effective, the struggle against organised crime undeniably involves strengthening judicial cooperation in criminal cases, on the basis of extending the Europol mandate.
Amendment No 3 broadens the terms of this measure.
The creation of a European observatory for missing children would seem to respond to the disturbing situations in the candidate countries and the vulnerability of some young people in our own countries (asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, young people from broken homes and marginalised families, and so on).
Let us try to look out for the future of these child victims, not just for the psychological consequences but also for the medical effects.
The sex industry destroys the prospects of children who pick up the AIDS virus and sexually transmissible diseases.
These sick children cannot even return to their families, which are just as crushed by poverty and social or ethnic discrimination.
Any paedophiles found guilty must be banned from activities involving contact with minors and we must crack down hard on them, as called for in Amendment No 9.
Mrs Klamt has presented a good report today.
I am delighted Mr Marchiani' s amendments reaffirming the criminal nature of child sex tourism have been incorporated but, at the same time, I am disappointed at the rejection of other amendments tabled by my colleague which were intended to strengthen the principles set out in the text, without altering its general meaning.
Obviously, this form of 'tourism' is a crime.
How else could we, as parents, especially mothers, and elected representatives, doubly responsible for the continuity of our societies, regard these acts, all the more heinous because they are committed against the weakest of all?
But should we be astonished at this phenomenon when, at the same time, the development of prostitution, more generally, does not cause offence?
How can we criminalise the perverts who go to the ends of the earth to violate children without, at the same time, condemning the pimps and clients who exploit girls from the East attracted to our countries by lies, and even by force?
This is an area where double standards must apply least of all.
Belgian society is currently being rocked by paedophile trials, and similar proceedings often go on in our own countries.
The poverty of some parts of the world is certainly used by irresponsible adults to try to explain the unjustifiable sexual exploitation of children. Nevertheless, the permissiveness of our societies, the libertarian views some people express, even in this House, are undoubtedly the essential root of this evil, with geographical remoteness just an illusory and gratuitous excuse for the depraved.
We cannot rejoice at so-called taboos collapsing, and then lament crimes which are merely the consequence of the disappearance of rules that are natural to all social life.
We must condemn these practices. Our respective states must take the necessary measures to prosecute and sentence those found guilty.
But back home, in our own countries and towns, we must combat the sexual exploitation of children, which is only the most despicable form of sexual exploitation of any human being.
The dignity of the individual, of the weakest in particular and of all in general, must be our guideline, in this area as in any other.
- I wholeheartedly support Ewa Klamt' s report on the fight against child exploitation.
The report focuses specifically on combating child sex tourism but, as we all know, the issue is much broader than this.
Clearly, with new technology and globalisation, child pornography on the Internet, in particular, is an ever-growing international problem.
Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate.
Europe can act by strengthening child protection legislation and ensuring adequate child protection, particularly in some of the applicant countries, such as Romania and Hungary.
At present, it seems that animals have more rights than children in Europe.
I believe we must be vigilant and ensure strong, effective measures are put in place to protect the rights of children in e-Europe.
Progress is, of course, being made.
More and more European money is being given to combat child sex tourism and to increase public awareness about child protection, with a EUR 1 million separate budget line, and the STOP and DAPHNE programmes.
But whilst I welcome the positive noises coming from Brussels, it is not enough.
Mr President, I am not calling for a nanny-state approach, but simply that, in a civilised society, we recognise the right of children to their childhood.
That is too precious to become the plaything of wealthy, western tourists.
MacCormick report (A5-0061/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the MacCormick report on liability for defective products because 'it is meet and right so to do' .
However, allow me to say that it does not go far enough for me or the Pensioners' Party.
The European Union must do more to enforce liability for damages suffered by citizens, particularly the weaker members of society, caused by the defective products of public administration.
How often do European pensioners receive their pensions on time?
How often do widows and elderly people receive the correct allowance?
The States are guilty of such offences and should be held liable.
Since we punish private individuals and make them pay damages, why should we not exact just as much payment, and I would advocate greater penalties, when the damages are caused by public authorities?
Turmes report (A5-0078/2000)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, environmental protection is a prestigious field of politics, and rightly so.
However, it is precisely the subject of renewable energy sources that must be freed from the burden of ideology and wishful thinking, as well as from the material misuse of energy sources themselves.
The present report on the subject of renewable energy sources does precisely the opposite, and that is why I have rejected it.
What, for example, is to be made of the much-touted benefits of wind power, something I consider to be an economic and ecological mistake?
No appreciable percentage of an ultramodern industrial state' s energy needs can be met from wind power.
We are still talking about mere thousandths of the overall requirement.
Last year in Germany, two billion kilowatt hours were generated through wind power.
That is just 0.8% of the total requirement of 2,500 billion kilowatts, and even that has cost the taxpayer DM 3 billion in grants.
Clearly, then, the future does not lie down this particular road, and we should therefore turn back from this economic and ecological blind alley and find ourselves a new direction.
Mr President, I read the Turmes report on electricity very carefully and I voted for it.
How could anybody fail to support any initiative which stresses the importance of electricity, of which we are all aware?
However, I have taken the floor to explain my reasons for voting in this way because I wish to say that, once again, there is something missing.
The Turmes report lacks a recommendation to provide the most vulnerable citizens of our Union, who have the lowest economic means, not with electricity at a reduced price, but with free electricity.
Nowadays, it is impossible to live without electricity.
Electricity is like the water we drink and the air we breathe.
Do we pay for the air we breathe?
Then we should not have to pay for electricity either if we do not have the means to do so.
- (SV) Regarding paragraphs 11-16 concerning supports to renewable energy sources, we would provide the following clarification.
We want to promote the development of renewable energy sources but believe that this should not be done by means of direct subsidies but, instead, through the use of various financial instruments of control, for example higher tax on fossil fuels, environmental charges and stricter application of the polluter-pays principle.
In addition, support ought to be given to research and development projects for the promotion of renewable energy sources.
The final text of Mr Turmes' report is bound to disturb anyone committed to a rational energy policy based on environmental conservation as the vital imperative.
Of course, there is no problem with the general aims of the report. The current situation and its share of disasters now regularly oblige us to recognise the importance of what is at stake, and there is no difficulty at this time in making fishermen, oyster farmers and other operators on the French coast see the advantages of doing away with an energy policy whose conditions require unregulated rusty boats to transport carcinogenic oil waste under flags of convenience.
At that point, however, under the dual influence of the compromises so dear to this House and the environmentalist creed which takes off from confirmed observations into flights of utopian fancy, Mr Turmes report becomes a truly labyrinthine system, producing absolutely everything but the simple promotion of renewable energies.
So we will pass over in silence, out of charity, the side-effects of the rapporteur' s proposal for the creation of a tax on CO2 emissions, which highlights the environmentally-friendly nature of nuclear energy and how 'clean' it is, thus contributing to the preservation of the ozone layer. We are delighted at this possible interpretation, but we doubt whether that was your intention.
But, on the other hand, we must emphasise that from your first paragraph onwards you are proposing nothing less than the creation of a European tax. The adoption of such a measure would be regarded as creating an extremely serious precedent by anyone opposed to a standardised European taxation system.
You ingenuously demand the uniform application of Community guidelines on state aid, with all Member States and all energy subject to the same provisions.
You hope thereby eventually, well, as soon as possible, really, to impose not just common but identical energy policy on Northern Finland, Central Spain, the Southern Alps and the outermost regions of the Union. It is symbolic, and really rather distressing, that the only amendment tabled at the sitting emphasises the specific nature of island situations, proof of the lack of discernment to which your frenzy to impose your idea of energy policy drives you.
But your egalitarian fancy turns into doctrinaire blindness when you express the wish to see restrictive targets imposed on the Member States, supported by sanctions if these targets are not achieved. This type of challenge is not appropriate in an area which has not yet officially ceased regarding the Member States as independent nations, freely implementing policies of their own choice.
You have the merit of having shown your hand, although in a rather peremptory way, by affirming that the Member States recognise that it is necessary to promote renewable sources of energy as a priority.
We believe it is indeed necessary to promote these renewable energy sources, but that the priority is to draw up an overall energy plan which treats existing sources with some respect and, in particular, includes the adaptations of nuclear infrastructure needed for greater safety. Because, actually, its total eradication, which you seem to be so keen on, is impossible without exclusively handing over seven-tenths of the surface of the planet to the development of the replacement energies, as you define them.
That simple observation is all it takes to condemn a text where good intentions are not enough to mask federalist logic and a dangerous lack of realism.
Resolution on the cloning of human beings
Mr President, we agreed with many points in the motion for a resolution, for example with the proposal that the European Parliament should submit a complaint to the Patent Office, but also with the criticism of the structures of the European Patent Office.
However, we were very divided when it came to the vote.
I, for example, voted for the resolution because, for me, it sent out important signals concerning human dignity.
Many in the group - quite rightly, too, I think - abstained from voting because most of the amendments of the Group of the European People' s Party were adopted.
I think it was the wish of the Group of the European People' s Party to attempt to transform this motion for a resolution into an advert for the patenting directive.
They did not succeed, but they have nonetheless weakened the resolution.
However, I am confident that the European Parliament will stop deceiving itself before long, by which I mean deceiving itself that the directive on patenting prohibits the patenting of human genes or parts of the human genetic make-up.
That is unfortunately not the case.
There is absolutely no point in burying one' s head in the sand and always maintaining the opposite of what is in fact the case, on the principle that the more you insist on something, the closer it comes to becoming a reality.
Contrary to what Parliament believes, this patent is no isolated case.
For years, the European Parliament has not patented human genes where they originate, in the body. However, the patenting of human genes and parts of the human genetic make-up still goes on.
This is an affront to human dignity and also signifies a commercialisation of the human body.
I was delighted to see that both the European and the German federations of medical practitioners are so clear-sighted about the fact and have also warned that research might be impeded by the patenting of genes.
It is also nonsense and self-deluding to maintain that the directive on patenting would prohibit this.
I think this very case has shown that we need to revise the directive on patenting and that, above all, we need a moratorium on the patenting of human genes and parts of the human genetic make-up, for I believe that, with the granting of the present patent, the ethical and social consequences have become more than clear.
Mr President, I very much regret, also on behalf of my group, that a minority has succeeded in introducing extraneous ideological factors into the resolution concerning necessary changes to the way in which patent law keeps pace with biotechnology.
This neither helps clarify patent law in the European Union nor makes for better and urgently needed protection against the rampant commercialisation of the building blocks of life. On the contrary.
In its current form, the adopted text further reduces the minimum level of protection provided under the 1998 directive on bio-patents.
In this way, there is a growing danger that the genetic inheritance of mankind will be taken from the community as a whole and made into a profitable commodity for the few.
In order to counter this danger, my group and I have voted in such a way as to reject any elements which have nothing to do with patent protection for biotechnological inventions.
In the end, we have voted as a unit against the resolution.
That does not prevent me and my group from campaigning, in the future too, for a situation in which ethical limits upon medical research and therapy are all complied with.
It is human dignity which provides the decisive standard.
- We have had a lengthy debate in this house on the patenting of biotechnology.
I myself, together with other Green deputies, warned of the consequences at the time.
Specifically, I warned that to make patents on human genes or part of human genes would jeopardise the freedom of research and impede the progress of medicine.
Genetic information can only be discovered, it cannot be invented.
Commercialisation of the knowledge of the human genome, which has been accumulated by research in many parts of the world, would jeopardise the medical application of this important scientific knowledge about the human body and its functions.
The human genome and its sequences should not be patentable.
The granting of this patent by the European Patent Office is deeply shocking and must be revoked.
Because we have no faith in the drug companies which are more interested in profits than in people, or, unfortunately, in certain researchers and doctors who are wedded to their logic, we must obviously agree with the spirit of the (new) Amendment No 3b, rejecting any intervention in the human germline and any cloning of human beings.
Our vote against human cloning is primarily intended to express our lack of confidence in the present economic and social organisation, certainly not our rejection of science and its possibilities.
We are not in principle opposed to intervention in the human germline for people who want to have children without risking malformation, any more than we are opposed to cloning with a view to developing human tissues intended for grafting.
Such techniques would undeniably represent progress for humanity, as would many others still to come, if they were not led astray, as now, by the lure of profit, but were used in an aware and disinterested spirit of humanity.
- My vote in this matter is in support of the need to ensure that the European Patent Office improves its procedures to prevent any patent being used in human cloning.
The University of Edinburgh' s application for this patent has nothing to do with cloning (cloning was considered impossible when the patent was filed!)
It is established and legitimate practice in both academic and biopharmaceutical research to genetically manipulate human cells in tissue culture.
This has been done for many years and is a major method of learning how genes and cells function.
It bears no relation to genetic manipulation of people or embryos.
It is misleading to suggest that the object of this patent is to genetically manipulate humans.
The University of Edinburgh have indicated their willingness to cooperate with any suitable modification of the patent.
It think it should be made clear that the potential application of this patent in human cells is to guide the production of particular cells that could be useful in transplantation therapy for conditions such as Parkinson' s disease, strokes, diabetes and heart failure.
This is what the Edinburgh research is about.
- (SV) On 8 December 1999, the European Patent Office approved 'by mistake' Patent No EP 69 53 51 concerning the genetic manipulation of human cells and embryos.
As a Swedish Social Democratic Member of the European Parliament, I have supported that resolution which now very firmly repudiates the European Patent Office' s decision, a decision which is contrary to people' s moral concepts and to EU and national legislation concerning patent law which applies within the European Union.
By means of this explanation of vote, I want to express my anger and very deep disappointment at the fact that the European Patent Office can deal with a question about life itself in such a totally and indefensibly careless and negligent way.
At the same time, I presume that the European Patent Office as an authority, and its representatives personally, are drawing the necessary conclusions from what has happened.
This totally unacceptable decision on a patent concerning the genetic manipulation of human cells and embryos must consequently be rescinded and revoked as soon as possible, and this in order to protect life, the greatest and most sacred gift we have.
- I would like to first congratulate those who have drafted and voted on Directive 98/44/EC which is a step forward in the protection of the human being.
Unfortunately, companies have already been developing and patenting cloning techniques.
While they state that they support the ban on 'reproductive cloning' , they have already patented and commercialised human closed cells in order to treat age-related and degenerative diseases.
A patent for these techniques has been granted in the UK since August of 1995.
While I understand the argument that bona fide cloning experimentation may contribute to scientific advances which would alleviate human suffering, I must point out that there exists a loophole for the totally unacceptable usage of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells, cultures 'out of their natural environment' .
Indeed, this experimentation, under the guise of 'therapeutic cloning' is already patented, and the object of ongoing research.
In light of this reality, I would ask the Commission to issue a particular reference to the patenting of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells.
Scientific research is now doing more than explore and analyse the world, it is changing it.
The Patent office has acknowledged a 'linguistic' mistake which does not seem to be entirely corroborated by Article 11 of the description of the intervention.
A mistake like that becomes symbolic, a sort of Freudian slip, and it has impelled us today to hold this fundamental debate on cloning, certainly, but above all on whether the living organism should be patented.
Soon we will be cloning our pets. Just recently there was the statement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair on free access to the genetic heritage of human beings, plants, animals and genes have been patented, and Craig Venter claims to own 97% of the human genome.
GM corn, manipulation of the living organism, transplanting animal organs into human beings - we are entering unknown territory and there are great fears we must confront.
Where will it end?
Why should we put our trust in science alone in this new context?
The issues and debates we face are increasingly complex and politicians will soon have to be multilingual and multicultural scientific experts as well, if they want to understand and not accept the word of experts as gospel.
As elected representatives and citizens, we are outpaced by issues where the scientific component is too strong.
Science and the experts are suffering the consequences of serious crises (for instance, mad cow disease) and indeed the implications of crises to come, because they cannot tell us what the results of their interventions will be: dissemination of GMOs in the environment, manipulation of the living organism, genetic manipulation.
Science itself seems outpaced by the onward rush of sorcerer' s apprentices with no longer any taboos, moral boundaries or ethics.
Their research laboratories, which long ago became ivory towers, are increasingly surrounded by the business offices which are proliferating in this new biological El Dorado between knowledge and profit.
There is plenty of money at stake.
Will the political authorities have the power to regulate this new market and ensure that the ethical dimension is respected in genetics?
Or will we soon find ourselves in the kind of world depicted in that excellent film 'Gattaca' ?
It is not enough for the Patent Office to acknowledge a mistake and make its excuses.
There are so many uncertainties at the legal and moral level, about the future acceptability of patents applied for, which are currently in the thousands.
The debate about the moral boundaries of biotechnology and how to control them has begun.
Categories of 'forbidden knowledge' must certainly be created but without making the mistake of those who condemned Copernicus, Harvey (the heart is not the repository of the soul, but a large organ), or Jenner (the smallpox vaccine).
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 30 March 2000.
Madam President, for the past six months to a year, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been calling on the Commission to do something about the drought in Ethiopia.
Nothing has been done although there was an instant reaction from the Commission when the fact that 12 million people are under threat of famine in Ethiopia came to public attention.
I suggest that this week, as a matter of urgency, Commissioner Nielson be called to this House to explain the delay by the European Union in responding to a drought that has been continuing for the past three years.
We seem to be able to get weapons there for the Eritreans and Ethiopians to continue the war of aggression against each other over nonsensical issues and, at the same time, while the European Union and the Western World export weapons to Ethiopia and to Eritrea, the famine continues and the lives of millions and millions of people are threatened.
I have been in this House since 1984, and rarely have I seen such neglect - such wilful neglect - by the European Union in dealing with a famine of this kind that we knew was on our doorstep.
It is a great shame that every time an issue like this is raised with Commissioner Nielson, or raised with the Commission, he passes it off as if it did not matter - as if he did not believe this was happening.
Commissioner Nielson must come to this House and explain his use of PR men and spin doctors in this disgraceful display of neglect.
Despite statements to the contrary, they can most certainly get two billion dollars' worth of weapons into the conflict in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
The whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this House to act.
Mr Andrews, there is of course no need to start a debate on the subject.
I should just like to point out that in a few moments the House will be voting on whether to add another item to the 'Human Rights' section and one of the proposals made by two groups is specifically to do with the problem of the famine in Ethiopia.
Madam President, as many of us know, last Friday saw the inauguration in Vienna of the Monitoring Centre for Racism, Xenophobia and Antisemitism.
I would like to thank you for your forceful intervention.
At this very important juncture, you said that racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are totally incompatible with the defence of human rights and the dignity of the human person.
You stated this very clearly and powerfully and thus sent a message of confidence to the people of Austria and to all the other peoples of Europe.
Many MEPs, representing almost all the Parliamentary groups and many of the Member States, were present, as of course were many Austrian MEPs and the President of the Committee on Citizens' Rights, Graham Watson.
They all asked me - and I am very willing to act as their messenger - to thank you for your speech, which made us proud to be Members of this House.
Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your extremely kind words.
I would like to tell all the Members of Parliament who attended this moving and very important ceremony how well I believe we all represented the European Parliament, and I know that none of the participants failed to notice our attendance in large numbers.
I believe it was very important for this House.
Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your comments.
Madam President, if I have been informed correctly, the Council has postponed its statement on Iraq and it will not now be made this week.
Would it be possible for you to ask the Council to make a statement on Ethiopia in place of the statement on Iraq?
This point would then be filled, depending, of course, on whether the Council is able to oblige.
Mr HÃ€nsch, we shall deal with this point when we come to the draft agenda in a few moments, and we shall make a decision at that time as to how to handle the situation.
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to an internal matter.
Some members of staff of the European Parliament both here and in Brussels, when they try to enforce European Parliament rules - in other words, no smoking in no-smoking areas or any of the other European Parliament rules - are sworn at and abused by some Members of Parliament.
In other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve.
I would hope that happened in the European Parliament.
If the situation does not improve, do you know if there are any disciplinary procedures we could take against those Members who treat the staff in such a disrespectful manner?
Disciplinary procedures? I do not think so, but I do promise to consider very carefully the comments you have made regarding both the no-smoking areas and attitudes towards the ushers.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, reading the international press is an interesting activity should one wish to know how certain MEPs keep themselves occupied here.
Most of the time, the press reports are read with a certain element of interest, fascination or surprise, bearing in mind that the European Parliament is a House which comprises many chambers.
One can form one' s own opinion and keep quiet.
However, there was one incident last week about which we cannot keep quiet any longer.
During an outing as part of his election campaign, a prominent Member of this House, Mr Berlusconi, thought it necessary to make extremely hurtful jokes - they were not even remarks - about people dying of the terrible disease of AIDS.
You will have to forgive me if I tell you what Mr Berlusconi said, but I think it is difficult to judge if you do not know the content.
Mr Berlusconi made the following joke: do you know why an AIDS sufferer needs to take a bath filled with sand?
The answer is in order to get used to lying in the soil.
These words were spoken by a Member of this House.
I refuse to believe that anyone here would keep calm if this joke was aimed at Jews or blacks.
I think that a reaction from yourself, Madam President, would be wholly appropriate.
I would, at the same time, ask the chairman and leader of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his opinion on this matter.
I can only say that these remarks have shocked me deeply.
In solidarity with all the millions of people who suffer from this terrible disease, I can only express my shame on behalf of the honourable Member, Silvio Berlusconi.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you.
The Member you have quoted is not here to answer you or to defend himself...
(Mixed reactions)
Madam President, we have read in the newspapers that five million euros' worth of Parliament property has been purloined and that Parliament' s finances have been poorly managed.
In addition, a report by the Court of Auditors of the European Communities is due shortly on the use of resources by Parliament' s political groups, and it is not a flattering picture.
These are big issues, and Parliament must address them seriously.
I wish to speak about some small matters which I would not normally raise in the parliamentary plenary session, but it is astonishing that the bureaucratic machinery of the House is unable to rectify such small matters.
I have already, on many occasions, bemoaned the fact here in plenary that Parliament' s television system fails to produce a picture for Finnish television.
Finland is the only country whose television picture cannot be picked up in Parliament.
I would have hoped that such a small matter as this would be sorted out. The Dutch often complained about the lack of Dutch television during parliamentary part sessions.
They now get two channels, and I hope that we Finns will now get at least one.
And then, might we not still hope for hot water in the pipes, which has not been available during this new Parliament' s term of office?
I have already complained about this on various occasions in parliamentary sittings.
What is the problem with you bureaucrats, that you cannot sort these things out in this House?
Meanwhile you allow five million euros to be stolen!
Thank you, Mr SeppÃ€nen.
It is not just a little detail.
You are probably aware of the considerable effort that went into arranging for our Dutch Members to have a television channel in their own language, and the problem with regard to Finland has not yet been resolved.
Mrs Banotti, who is dealing with the matter, will be able to give you the latest details.
Madam President, at least three times I went searching for our Finnish colleague to assure him, as I was assured in the last plenary part-session, that he would be handed a card that would enable him to not just hear, but to see Finnish television in Parliament.
I am really sorry that he has not been handed that card.
I will attend to it this week.
In the College of Quaestors we have also discussed - because we too are concerned - robberies that are taking place within Parliament.
I can assure you that the Quaestors are working on it.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, considerable changes have been made to the proposed agenda.
Reports have been shifted around and time slots have even been changed.
Tomorrow we will start at 8.30 a.m. for the first time.
One would have hoped that, due to a heavy agenda, the reports would be spread evenly over these five full days here at Strasbourg, but that is not the case: on Friday, two reports have been dropped and only three oral questions are down on the agenda.
We are now faced with a dilemma.
As elected members of our national parliaments, we represent our electorate and this must be reflected in all votes.
However, the agenda for Fridays, for this Friday and for previous Fridays, is often so light that many MEPs genuinely believe that they can spend their time more productively in their own countries.
I therefore wonder how we are to fulfil our obligations in the best way?
I have talked extensively to MEPs from various groups on this matter and we concluded that Parliament must make a choice: either we give the agenda on Fridays sufficient weight so that more Members attend the votes or we do away with it altogether.
This is not an anti-Strasbourg campaign but a plea for more Members to be present during the votes and also for an increase in Parliament' s prestige.
You received an e-mail last week about our intention to apply for the quorum on Friday.
The Conference of Presidents has also received a letter on this matter.
However, the agenda is not heavier as a result. If anything, as I have already stated, this coming Friday' s agenda is lighter.
Our plans, therefore, remain unchanged, and this means that if, on Friday, the necessary 209 Members are not present, then the vote will not take place.
This is something about which we wanted to give you plenty of notice, so as to enable you, by being either present or absent, and not just by what you affirm, to make it known what you want on Fridays: to make the agenda more substantial or abolish it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you, please, not to use points of order to start a debate on this matter which would keep us here all night.
In return, I promise that I shall raise the matter at the Conference of Presidents.
The Group leaders have heard your points.
There clearly is a problem and it is one that we shall examine at the Conference of Presidents when the next agenda is determined and, of course, more generally after that.
Madam President, I would like to very briefly respond to Mr SeppÃ€nen very briefly; not regarding the matter of Finnish television, but the first point which he raised.
I am aware, of course, that about 10 days ago a certain article from the European Voice was recycled again and again across Europe.
As rapporteur for the discharge of our own institution' s budget, I would have appreciated it if Mr SeppÃ€nen had taken the trouble to cast an eye over my report, which expressly and critically dealt with the issue of the inventory and which was available in all languages to all my colleagues here in the House from 10 February.
I would also appreciate it if we could use this as an opportunity to take a little more interest in our own documents, our own recommendations for decisions, which are equally critical, not least of ourselves, rather than just giving knee-jerk reactions to certain press agencies.
- (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of the President, and of the Bureau in general, to a point of order raised in today' s sitting, which I consider to be extremely important.
In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, which is due to be debated on Wednesday, there is a paragraph, which I shall read in the original French:
"Les affaires du Parlement europÃ©en ne peuvent pas faire l'objet d'un recours juridictionnel." [No actions may be brought in connection with the interna corporis affairs of the European Parliament.]
I consider this to be extremely serious. It is a gross violation of fundamental rights, it is a violation of a fundamental principle of the rule of law and betrays a totalitarian ideology.
In my opinion, the Bureau should rule that a report which has these characteristics is inadmissible.
I would therefore like to draw the President' s attention to this matter, quite frankly, and say that, if it is retained in Wednesday' s agenda, I reserve the right to table a motion under Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro, we shall look into your statement very carefully.
Madam President, I would like to bring to your attention an incident last week where two football fans were tragically murdered on their way to watch their team play in the UEFA Cup.
Football is a sport which transcends the world.
Almost every country plays football.
It is known as a beautiful game.
In about three months Belgium and Holland will play host to Euro 2000.
There is every likelihood that incidents such as those that happened last week will be repeated again in Belgium and Holland.
Can I ask you, through your good offices, to contact all the Member States who are involved, to try and keep such problems to a minimum?
Thank you, Mr Miller.
We shall do so.
We have often voted on recommendations on sports-related violence and what you tell us is rather worrying.
Madam President, Mr HÃ€nsch made an important observation a moment ago and, since his point forms part of the agenda as a whole, I would like to add my thoughts as well.
First of all, I would like to say that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the proposal, now that the Council' s declaration on Iraq is not taking place, to replace Iraq with Ethiopia.
This is a very sensible suggestion in my view.
We would also like to see Iraq treated as an Urgency because, eventually, Parliament will need to pass its verdict.
Just because the Council is not ready, that does not mean that we in Parliament cannot bring the matter up for discussion.
On a final note: we would appreciate it very much, partly in the light of the alarming television pictures we have seen lately, if Zimbabwe too were to be included under the human rights heading.
We have a comprehensive package which will probably enable us to cover all the points which are important to this Parliament.
Mr van Velzen, you will have the opportunity to make your comments in just a moment, as we are about to move on to the agenda.
Agenda
The next item is the examination of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
Sittings in Strasbourg from 10 to 14 April 2000:
Relating to Tuesday:
The Council has informed us that it did not wish to make a statement on Iraq at the present time.
We of course regret this, but the fact remains.
We have no means to force the Council to make a statement.
This being the case, I had a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to bring forward the Council and Commission statements on the Turkish situation, which are currently scheduled for Wednesday 12 April.
Their proposal was to enter these items on the agenda instead of the statement on Iraq.
Let me turn now to Mr HÃ€nsch.
You wish to amend this request, and to have a statement on the Ethiopian famine instead of the statement on Iraq - and, if I have understood correctly, this latter request is supported by Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the PPE Group - and to leave the debate on Turkey as originally scheduled.
Is this what you propose?
Madam President, we would prefer Turkey to be given priority, although if we move it from Wednesday to Tuesday, then there is still room to discuss Ethiopia on Wednesday, if the Council agrees.
So, Tuesday Turkey, Wednesday Ethiopia.
Madam President, I do not think that proposal is such a good one because, if I am properly informed, the Council will not be attending on Wednesday.
I would prefer it if we could hold the debate on Ethiopia when the Council is present.
Mr van Velzen, the Council is indeed in attendance on Wednesday, I am assured.
So, relating to Tuesday, I propose that we bring forward the Council and Commission statements on the Turkish situation and enter them on the agenda instead of the statement on Iraq.
Mr HÃ€nsch has just spoken in support of this request.
If there is no one who wishes to speak against it, I shall put the matter to the vote.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Wednesday:
I now propose to hold the debate on the famine in Ethiopia in the place of the statements on Turkey which we have just brought forward to Tuesday.
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?
Madam President, I would suggest that this will give us the opportunity to adopt a short resolution on Ethiopia.
Yes, of course.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday:
Regarding the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, I have a number of proposed amendments.
First of all, a request from the Liberal Group to replace the first item, 'Non-proliferation treaty' , with a new item entitled 'Iraq' .
Madam President, it would be a great help to many of us if we could vote on item IV first, for I believe there is a large majority in favour of our proposal under item IV.
We shall then be able to withdraw our proposal under item I.
In other words, Mr Haarder, you would like us to move directly to the proposal to replace item IV 'World forum on education' with an item on 'Iraq' , which you tabled in case your first proposal was not adopted.
If I have understood - please correct me if I am wrong - you are going to withdraw your request to replace the item on the 'Non-proliferation Treaty' , and it is item IV that we shall be replacing, if the House agrees, of course.
Unless you want us to proceed directly to the vote on replacing item IV?
Madam President, I should be glad if we could vote on item IV before I decide about that.
Madam President, if I have understood correctly, the Liberal Group has moved that the point concerning the non-proliferation treaty be replaced by Iraq.
For goodness sake, let' s vote on it!
If you want to cancel that and put Iraq in place of the world forum on training, then you must move that and we will then vote on it under item IV when it' s the world forum' s turn.
Yes, I think that is clearer.
I would rather keep to the order in which the proposals were received.
I shall now put to the vote the request from the liberal group to replace the item on the 'Non-proliferation treaty' with a new item entitled 'Iraq' .
(Parliament gave its assent)
On the subject of 'Human Rights' , I have received a request from the Group of the European People' s Party/European Democrats to replace the fourth sub-item 'Death penalty in the United States' with a new sub-item entitled 'Zimbabwe' .
Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?
Madam President, since we now have Ethiopia, which we wanted to add, elsewhere on the agenda, I would like to ask the mover of the motion whether he would agree to adding Zimbabwe as a fifth point.
It is okay to have five points. If we take Zimbabwe as an additional point, we could vote for it.
The originators of the proposal seem to be happy to agree to that.
Thank you for that.
There is therefore no need to vote on this proposal since it has been withdrawn.
I then received five proposals to add a fifth sub-item to the 'Human Rights' section.
Madam President, I would like to be clear that if we have agreed that Zimbabwe would be the fifth point then there is no point in voting in any other points because we already have five points on the agenda.
Mr Elles, first of all, I am going to suggest that we enter Zimbabwe as the fifth sub-item in the 'Human Rights' section, since I believe that is in line with what we have just agreed.
It is up to the House to decide.
I think we are all in agreement.
I shall, however, at least notify you of the other proposals, if only out of consideration for the Members and the groups which tabled them.
So, I have the proposal regarding Zimbabwe.
Next, I have a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for a sub-item on 'Human rights violations in Australia: arbitrary judgements against aborigines' .
The proposal for an item on the Ethiopian famine has been withdrawn.
Then there were the proposals for the item on Zimbabwe which I have already brought forward as the first item, and the proposal from the liberal group to add a sub-item on 'Pinochet' .
Who is in favour of entering Zimbabwe as the fifth sub-item in the Human Rights section?
(Parliament gave its assent) Relating to Friday:
Regarding the oral questions on forestry, the Group of the Party of European Socialists has requested that the debate should conclude with the submission of motions for resolutions which may be tabled but not voted on.
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of or against this proposal?
Madam President, I would like to speak in favour of adopting a resolution in connection with the oral question to the Commission on the consequences of last December' s storms.
The citizens would not understand it if we simply held a debate without then saying what proposed solutions and options the European Union can offer.
I therefore ask that a resolution be taken in connection with the oral question.
Do you mean after the oral question on the storms?
I do not think that would be a problem.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Sittings in Brussels on 3 and 4 May: no amendments.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Child pornography on the Internet
The next item is the report (A5-0090/2000) by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet [10317/1999 - C5-0318/1999 - 1999/0822(CNS)].
Madam President, in 1996 I had the great honour of representing the UK Government at the World Congress, which was held in Stockholm, Sweden, under United Nations auspices, on the subject of the sexual exploitation of children.
At that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children, the most vulnerable section of our society.
Mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world.
They did not, in general, relate to matters concerned with the Internet - this new technology, which has come in at an enormous pace in the last few years; a new technology which has the ability to do good things but also the ability to do evil things.
There are very few regulations which are concerned with what the Internet is used for.
Whilst a lot of countries are keen to see their citizens benefit from the good things it can offer and whilst e-commerce itself is becoming a major feature of life, we have not yet seen any proper regulations to protect those who are abused, and particularly those who are abused by the use of images of themselves in a pornographic manner.
That is the reason for my report - to protect children, to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner.
My report, for the first time, puts forward a definition.
We have been short of a definition until now.
Although there was an initial Austrian initiative, which this report supports, it did not contain a definition.
In our report we have entered a definition which we hope will be acceptable internationally.
We can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion.
We are only dealing with it at European level now, but hopefully the world will react, whether it be through the auspices of the United Nations once more or, indeed, through the common sense of other countries.
If we are lucky, we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices.
We have required within our report that European nation states should have action plans for dealing with the abuses which take place.
We are concerned with the production, sale, distribution and deliberate possession of pornographic images showing children.
We want to stamp out this appalling abuse.
In our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout Europe take action to deal with these matters.
We want to encourage and, indeed, in some circumstances, require nation states to look at their present laws, to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts.
We are faced with a difficult task, not only in regard to the definition which we have decided to offer, but also because so many countries have different attitudes as to what, for instance, is a child.
We have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations.
I believe that we have managed to do so.
I wish to offer my thanks, as rapporteur, to all those who have been concerned, not only on my own committee - the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - but also on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport as well.
We have had nothing but positive contributions.
In my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favour and one abstention.
That I regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future.
Because of all the support for this initiative, both within the committees and from public reaction, I am very hopeful that once it has been considered by Parliament it will be taken up and put into effect and will assist in protecting that vulnerable section of society that needs protection in this fast-moving and growing area of new technology.
Madam President, child pornography is a loathsome form of crime.
Measures at transnational level are required, especially due to the denationalised nature of the Internet.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, for his most excellent report.
In this regard, it is perhaps particularly pleasing that it is from Great Britain that Mr Kirkhope comes.
It is good that he has defined child pornography, and I believe we have arrived at a satisfactory compromise.
It is particularly good that Mr Kirkhope has also stated that everything that has the appearance of being child pornography shall also be included under this definition.
Contact points or special units shall be set up in the Member States according to the draft.
This will hopefully lead to better investigations.
There is a need for more expertise in this area if it is to be possible to carry out professional investigations.
Europol will be involved, as will the candidate countries.
It is a good thing that crime in third countries will be punished in accordance with national legislation.
The definition of "children" - that is, the age up until which a person is to be considered a child - has been formulated in order to show that we want to create the most effective level of protection where child pornography is concerned.
Our line of argument allows for flexibility in defining the age-limit that strikes the hardest blow to child pornography.
It is a question of creating the most effective protection for children so that they are able to hold on to the childhood that they are entitled to.
All children should have the right to a childhood!
That ought to be a basic human right.
For many years the European Parliament, the Member States and a whole range of organisations, by virtue of various legal bases, agreements and resolutions, have been tackling the issues of child protection, children' s rights, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, sex tourism, trade in children and women and child pornography on the Internet.
The initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet will place an obligation on the Member States, and obligation is the crucial word here, to take measures to combat child pornography on the Internet.
This obligation must have legal implications.
The importance of the Internet is obvious to us all.
It has come to be indispensable as a modern communication tool.
We need it for exchanging information, for learning and for all sorts of operations.
However, increased use of the Internet also means increased access to violence and pornography, not least child pornography.
Children themselves have access to violence on the Internet, which must be objectionable to us all.
Parents are powerless in the face of this phenomenon because they cannot keep up with this technological progress.
We are extremely concerned, especially in the new MEDIA 2000 programme which is being drawn up, as to how we should deal with this problem in the future.
Consequently, an urgent need has arisen to combat child pornography on the Internet effectively.
This requires efficient software to determine the country of origin, to trace the images and to catch the perpetrators and those producing the images.
This in turn requires extremely advanced technology. We need specialists who can develop access codes, which will also necessitate certain restrictions being placed on media freedom.
We need to network all the relevant organisations, the welfare organisations and NGOs, to facilitate rapid action and effective procedures.
However, we must not forget one thing: the main reason why children are forced into this is poverty. We must combat poverty and intolerance and take this as our starting point.
This is the key to prevention.
It means that we must understand the children, but also that we must protect the victims, offer them assistance in reintegrating and help them to rediscover a normal life.
We must not, therefore, simply act in a preventative fashion; we must offer long-term help to those children affected.
- (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the need has grown over the last ten years for a policy for children, based on the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by all Member States.
The attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all Member States.
Nevertheless, at European Union level, even though children represent around one fifth of the Union' s population, specific attention is very rarely paid to their needs in economic policies and in other areas.
Thousands of children all over the world suffer serious and systematic violations of their fundamental rights, from domestic cruelty, which goes undetected and unpunished, and the economic exploitation of their labour, which robs them of their childhood and education, to their use in war; from being forced to play the horrific role of child-soldier to their use in prostitution or pornography.
According to the estimates of the Economic and Social Committee, there are more than five million children working in Europe.
Most of these children work in areas such as pornography, drug trafficking, child pornography and sexual tourism.
These children are in particular need of society' s protection.
The evolution of the Internet, its incredibly rapid development and its importance today raise the question of its use for these reprehensible purposes.
In the last part-session, here in Strasbourg, we discussed what needs to be done about the Internet. The European Union' s desire is to make more rapid progress in terms of e-commerce and to make a firmer commitment to the new technologies and to education.
Today we have been discussing what we need to prevent and combat, and that is the circulation and distribution of child pornography, which has been increasing at an alarming rate.
And although it may be true that we have to encourage web-site administrators and service providers to define their standards of conduct and to regulate themselves, and encourage Internet users to inform the authorities whenever they discover child pornography, it is nevertheless true that Union and national law bear some responsibility.
Mr Kirkhope' s excellent report makes it very clear how much we still have to do and where we need to improve, in terms of establishing specialist units, strengthening cooperation and exchanges between States, in terms of Europol' s activities and the efficiency of Member States' actions, including, where necessary, the revision of their own legislation and the procedures in force in these areas so that we can guarantee the effective imposition of criminal sanctions.
As far as the responsibility of the Union itself is concerned, I am delighted at the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights that is being drawn up considers the specific rights of children, and takes account of the areas in which the Union can provide considerable impetus, specifically in these matters.
Madam President, in my opinion perversion is undoubtedly on the increase if, in addition to a child being sexually exploited, the event is recorded, in whatever fashion, and then reused for financial gain.
These events are occurring every day, every hour and perhaps every minute.
The perpetrators are using the most up-to-date technology to distribute their material and in the Internet they have found a medium which is more suited than any other to acting anonymously.
Paedophiles are limited only by their own technical capability or the equipment which they can afford.
When seen against its virtually unlimited potential, society and the state have thus far had very little at their disposal to counter illegal activity on the Internet, in particular since cyberspace has no states or geographical and political borders and its alluring feature is its worldwide accessibility.
The Internet itself cannot commit crimes.
What is criminal is the behaviour of some 3 to 5% of Internet users who misuse the Net for illegal purposes.
95 to 97% of the Internet is legal.
The Internet is therefore a reflection of society as a whole. Just as in the real world, crime is very much a part of the virtual world.
All the same, the Internet is not beyond the law.
The problem of crime on the Internet cannot be resolved by any state in isolation.
For this we need uniform worldwide crimes and definitions so that law enforcement authorities can work together in global terms and not in opposition.
In the area of child pornography in particular, where the rights of children are continually being trampled underfoot, there is an urgent need for global regulation.
The EU has already taken several measures towards this, which I will not go into any further here.
I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report. It is a high-quality text.
Nevertheless, to effectively combat child pornography, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly, as stated in Amendment No 20 from Gerhard Schmid.
All the proposed measures are suitable and necessary to effectively combat child pornography.
However, we must not forget that, in addition to the technological and police measures, we must also combat poverty, ignorance and prejudice in order to improve society' s image of children and children' s image of themselves and to offer help to the victims; thus far, victim support has played too insignificant a role.
We need a social climate in which the victims of vile crimes are not left to fend for themselves whilst the perpetrators are shielded through failure to act and fear of embarrassing revelations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Kirkhope for his excellent report.
There is no doubt in anybody' s mind: the physical and emotional integrity of children and the protection of victims of sexual crimes are of fundamental importance and must lie at the heart of the Union's concerns.
Despite earlier initiatives by the Commission and Parliament, the misuse of the Internet and its harmful and illegal content have only increased, and it is time and again apparent how difficult it is to combat child pornography.
What exactly needs to be done in order to combat child pornography effectively, especially on the Internet?
First of all, we need to set up an easily accessible and recognisable contact point.
In fact, the Netherlands was the first country to set up such a contact point back in 1996, on the initiative of the Internet providers.
Secondly, for the purposes of enforcement, police forces and the judiciary need more expertise regarding the Internet and ancillary digital technology.
This is simply lacking.
Officials need to be trained well, otherwise they will be unable to combat child pornography effectively.
Lastly, the penalties must be harmonised in Europe and must be increased.
If not, the Internet will remain a threat and it will never be the challenge which it could be.
Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope.
In fact, his name fills us with hope.
Mr Kirkhope' s document has lifted the lid on a great deal - a great deal of child suffering and human suffering.
We are delighted that there is now a definition at long last.
Secondly, that this phenomenon must be increasingly brought into the open and binding measures must be drafted. This includes setting up contact points, such as those in Belgium and the Netherlands, and also in the other EU Member States and candidate countries.
After all, there is quite obviously a correlation between child pornography on the Internet and trafficking in children.
This correlation is evident in the countries of origin, the transit countries and the host countries in the European Union.
This is also borne out by the studies carried out by police forces in this field with regard to under-age asylum seekers. They disappear on their own, or even accompanied, from asylum centres and reappear within the world of prostitution.
This correlation is also evident in the case of possibly kidnapped and missing children.
Recently, mothers recognised their own children on a porn website which could be viewed at police stations in France.
We also know that details of people' s identity are used or misused by people with connections in the world of child porn websites.
In order to conceal their own identity, they use the bank details of others.
In order to stamp out child pornography, we need a multi-disciplinary approach.
The police and criminal investigation services must be able to do their jobs well.
This means that the politicians need to ensure that the police can do its job effectively.
The police within the European Union work differently from the police in some candidate countries, as other MEPs have already pointed out.
Politicians too should believe that child pornography exists on the Internet.
The NGOs are doing a great job.
To finish off, I would like to point out that some pimps use the Internet to distribute photographs of young people engaged in prostitution.
Mr President, Mr Kirkhope' s report has the virtue of drawing the Council' s attention to a dreadful criminal activity.
While I support the action stipulated by the report, and I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, I still think the proposed measures do not match up to the scale of the problem before us.
Communication technologies transform data.
The Internet thus has formative and demultiplying effects on the trade and traffic in child pornography.
This trafficking is on a scale hitherto unknown in terms of its extent and the geographical areas covered.
It is an urgent state of affairs, and specific action must be proposed in order to deal with the networks that exist.
In all the States of the Union, individual paedophile acts are suppressed, but ignorance and inefficiency still reign in the suppression of networks.
What we have to deal with here are ephemeral, evolving sites, which adapt constantly and which are complicated to monitor.
This state of affairs makes it essential to draw up a survey of paedophile networks within the countries of the European Union.
The existence of these networks confirms the need for a common judicial area.
Once again, the rapporteur urges the Union to approach the Member States, and ask them to make an effort to harmonise their national legislation in this area.
I share his opinion but, given the cross-border nature of the problem, the response must be at Union level.
The common judicial area does exist with Europol, Schengen and Eurodac.
Let it be noted that it is used primarily, and indeed exclusively, to control the flow of migration and to suppress illegal immigration.
But even if action was undertaken in each Member State to create specialised units working in liaison, as the report advocates, that would not solve the problem of the networks because their work would still be restricted by national borders.
There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography, who are often repeat offenders.
What is needed is prevention, in order to counter their activities and to dismantle their networks.
The European Union must provide itself with a suitable structure, a European instrument to enforce information exchange and action.
This instrument must be such as to make it possible to address States directly in order to urge them to pass on information, but also to issue orders so that the networks can be dismantled.
The Union should be in a position to apply penalties to any State which does not fulfil its criminal law obligations in the matter of combating paedophilia.
The Dutch police have drawn up a file of several hundred children from a CD-ROM containing 10 000 images or sequences of child pornography available on the Internet.
Interpol has acknowledged having a file of 800 photos.
Why are these valuable documents not used?
Who are these children and what is being done to locate them?
If there are records of offenders, it must be possible to keep records of victims.
It is our duty, ethically, as human beings, to do everything we can to find them.
For all these reasons I think the European Union must make combating this form of crime a priority.
Mr Kirkhope' s report is filled with good intentions, but further proposals must be made in order to deal with the present situation.
I think the Commission and the Council should take action which is up to the task of dealing with the high stakes of this crime that affects thousands of innocents.
Mr President, in the wake of Mrs Klamt' s report on sex tourism, Mr Kirkhope' s excellent report takes us back to a debate on one of the sordid moral deviancies in this modern society of ours.
The action proposed by the Austrian Government is heading in the right direction, which is that of strengthening the prosecution of anyone deliberately producing, selling, disseminating or owning materials relating to the sexual exploitation of children.
What, however, are we to think of the limited personnel and financial resources allocated at the present time to the police departments responsible for monitoring Internet networks, which are, by definition, worldwide ones?
To govern, however, means to make plans.
And we have to investigate the deep-seated reasons for this scourge in order to attempt to find an effective cure for the problem.
Admittedly, there is at root the unspeakable vice of certain parties, whose possible distress could never be any justification for these crimes, and the lure of easy profits for the producers and distributors of documents of this type.
We must bring our attention to bear, however, on the economic poverty of the parents who are led to exploit their own children in order to survive, or the poverty of abandoned and defenceless children who have lost their points of reference, and think this is their only way out of the situation.
Our society, and often this House, claims that the future of humanity is freedom without responsibility and rights without duties.
This is an irresponsible attitude.
We are now paying the price for this permissiveness which some parties have been championing as the way of progress for over thirty years, but what progress do we see, except progress in the loneliness of our peers, the broken families and the children left to fend for themselves who, almost naturally, turn to drug addiction, sexual promiscuity, sects and alcoholism.
Respect for human dignity, as the Council decision rightly claims, first involves the uncompromising affirmation of the destructive nature of these abuses and also involves appropriate policies which, in Europe and in third countries, enable families to accommodate, educate and protect their children, and enable children to regain their essential points of reference, which are goodness, truth and beauty.
The legitimately and ultimately repressive message of this report will only be heard and be useful if, at the same time, we clearly reassert the basis of a life-enhancing culture, a culture which respects life, applicable to all people in all places, and if, at Member State and Union level, we provide the practical resources necessary to achieve this.
Mr President, many comments have been made on Mr Kirkhope' s report, which makes many interesting points, and I would like to do more than add a few banal observations to these comments, but I shall nonetheless begin by saying, first of all, that child pornography is the product of essentially two phenomena.
The first phenomenon is the boom in pornography in general, and the second is, obviously, the exploitation of children for sexual purposes.
I mention the boom in pornography in general because I do not think it is possible to isolate child pornography completely from the rest.
The consumer experiences a phenomenon of habituation, if I can call it that, in the face of the incitements to pornography displayed on television, in hotel chains (and that includes here in Strasbourg or Brussels) or in all the magazines in view on shop shelves, and necessarily is driven ultimately to seek ever stronger stimuli, like a drug addict.
This is what happens, and that is why those people who, in France in 1987, for example, thought it right, in the name of freedom, to strenuously oppose the common-sense measure of removing pornographic magazines from display in newsagents' shops, and keeping them under the counter, as it were, have to bear some responsibility for the measures which they are condemning today.
Just now I heard Mrs Ainardi, a left-wing Member of Parliament, complaining, for example, that a number of files have been compiled but are not used in any way for investigation or prosecution purposes, as they should be.
I should simply like to remind my fellow Member that one of the very first measures on jurisdictional, judicial and police matters taken by the left-wing government in France was to order the destruction of the file on sexual perverts.
We should not, therefore, be astonished that our society is in the position that it is in, and that child sex abuse is commonplace.
Is this, though, not also the inevitable continuation of a number of measures which have already been taken?
For example, in the area of trivialising homosexuality.
I am well aware that not all child pornography necessarily...
(Mixed reactions) ... you see, you are proving the truth of what I am trying to say.
Some of our fellow Members who are here condemning child pornography are also demanding, for example, that homosexual couples (indeed why should we limit it to couples?) should be able to adopt children.
This is the total reversal of the idea of adoption, whereby adoption is no longer in the interests of the child adopted but only in the interests of the adopting adult.
This is necessarily the first step on the road which leads ultimately to the deviancies of child pornography.
I know, I am well aware of Mr Schulz' s customary protests.
They are not going to stop me asking whether this horrendous decline in moral standards is not also a continuation of the morality of the termination of unborn children?
Why, when one is prepared to accept state-controlled hospitals organising terminations of unborn children, should one find it absolutely scandalous in moral terms to abuse children, once born, for the sexual pleasure of adults?
That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say.
Such practices have met with leniency, as we all know, within the Member States up to and including at the highest levels of their political classes.
We therefore do not want a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees.
International cooperation is needed in this area, admittedly, as is Europol action, and why do we not extend Interpol' s mandate? If child pornography must be fought, however, then it must be fought as such, whatever the means of transmission!
Whether by personal networks, by telephone, by Minitel, no one considers bringing back censorship or opening mail on the grounds that child pornography may also be sent by post.
The Internet, Minitel, the post are nothing more than the medium.
It is the originators we must combat.
It is not the Internet itself which is to blame, but the child pornographers, and they must be punished severely.
Everyone knows perfectly well that that is not the case today.
(Applause and mixed reactions)
Mr President, the pioneers of the Internet saw the electronic highway as the ultimate means of communication and the road towards a new social order.
It was important for it to be subjected to as few rules as possible.
It has since become apparent that the Internet is merely a reflection of our society.
In addition to a wealth of information and expertise, it also reflects the criminal underbelly of society, including child pornography.
The nature of the Internet is such that it has become easier to disseminate child pornography anonymously, rapidly and across national borders.
This is a good reason to take action against this as a Union.
Our children should be protected against this disrespectful exploitation, which reduces them to mere toys and leaves them damaged for the rest of their lives.
I therefore welcome the Council' s current proposal and Mr Kirkhope' s report with open arms.
I do wonder, however, whether too much is not being asked of the Council through Parliament' s adding new elements to the description of the criminal offence of "child pornography" .
Harmonising criminal law at European level is quite different from creating European criminal law.
Another difficult point is the age limit up to which pornography is considered child pornography.
I myself am in favour of an age limit of 18, rather than 16, years.
But the current compromise, in which both ages are mentioned without opting for one or the other, is confusing.
I do not think that we can seriously expect the Council to adopt this text, but that does not detract from my appreciation of the work which the rapporteur and the Commission have put in.
Mr President, as someone who is deeply dismayed by the on-going out-of-hand condemnation of Austria by fourteen Member States, I am particularly pleased that the initiative for the report in question has come from Austria.
This matter has preoccupied us for a long time, too long in my opinion.
Its importance is demonstrated by the constantly increasing incidence of such delinquency.
Nevertheless, irrespective of the importance of efficient law enforcement in this area, we must not depart from the principle of criminal-law liability and postulate strict liability. The report is therefore on the right track.
In my opinion, the most urgent need is to create, as soon as possible, in all Member States and in the candidate countries, the legal and technological capability to search the contents of the Internet for child pornography.
Finally, I would like to reiterate the view which I have held for some years that an obligation must also be placed on providers and, by way of conclusion, may I again stress that it would perhaps be useful to formulate a uniform definition of "children" within the Union.
Children are taking on various ages in this Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, it has already been mentioned on several occasions that the proposal for a joint initiative by all the EU Member States goes back to the initiative of the Austrian Federal Chancellor, Dr Wolfgang SchÃŒssel, who, as Foreign Minister in 1998, presented it to Europe within the framework of the Austrian Council Presidency, as well as to the United Nations in New York, in order to bring about a resumption of the draft joint action to combat pornography on the Internet.
The motivation for this initiative was clearly that all those who wish to make policy for the future must, on the one hand, have the courage to carry out necessary reforms and, on the other, must positively and effectively avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by technological and global development and human resources, all the while taking responsibility for pointing out risks and undesirable developments and for drawing the necessary boundaries.
Anyone who does not take action against children and minors being abused and lead astray is jeopardising the future.
The aim of the Austrian initiative was, as previous speakers have pointed out, to draw attention to the fact that the Internet, given its special nature, offers new and, in the light of its scope, not always positive, opportunities, indeed incredible opportunities for the distribution of child pornography.
Pornographic material can be distributed via the Internet in unlimited amounts and by the most direct route.
There is the danger that children themselves may surf the Internet and come across pornographic images of their peers, thereby sustaining psychological damage.
Combating child pornography and the misuse of the Internet is, therefore, both a worldwide and a specifically European responsibility and we call upon all Member States to take action in light of this report.
We welcome the debate on the age limit.
However, I share the view of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that we should have fixed the age limit at 18 and I hope that the initiatives will lead to the highest possible age limit being set in all Member States.
We welcome the fact that there will be a uniform definition and I support all measures to also place providers under obligation since today' s discussion can only be the start of a debate and of initiatives and is far from the end.
Actions must follow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a debate in which so many things have already been said I need not repeat myself, but I cannot fail to respond to two comments by Mr Gollnisch who, unfortunately, as usual, has now left the Chamber.
Mr Gollnisch is a fascist delegate in this House who takes advantage of every opportunity, not least in this Chamber, to slander others.
It is the left-wingers or the gays who are responsible for child pornography. He beautifully tars everyone with the same brush.
The left-wing French Government is responsible for the abolition of the criminal register of sex offenders and is therefore responsible, in the logic of this arch-fascist, for child pornography.
This is the type of poison which he spouts here.
Then he slips away because the sole reason why this pack of hounds sits in this Parliament is to permanently set upon others and then slink back into its holes to evade the responsibility of debate.
At any rate, these fine people do not participate in parliamentary work and it is time that this was made known because they are only ever speaking for the benefit of the visitors.
Then it all sounds so wonderful.
The reality is that these fine people do not partake in 99% of the work. They spout their poison and then push off.
I share the opinion of Mr Hager that we should also place an obligation on providers.
I think this is a worthy point which Mr Kirkhope should take into consideration in his report.
I also expressly support the view that we should not move away from criminal-law liability.
It cannot be right to release from criminal-law liability one of the primary areas where human dignity is violated, particularly taking into account the special need to protect minors.
I believe this must be made clear, even if it has sometimes been disputed by the groups on the left. On this point, Mr Hager is correct.
One final comment: the permanent availability of sexual material in the exclusively anonymous private sphere, which is conditioned by the structure of the Internet, and the attendant fact that sexual abuse is removed from public and, hence, social controls, is one of the central challenges with which we are faced as a result of this new aspect of human lifestyle.
We cannot resolve it simply through Interpol and more stringent criminal law.
The Internet, as evidenced by child pornography, presents totally new challenges to our subjective, individual sense of responsibility.
We should discuss this in at least as much detail as the tightening of criminal law.
Mr President, child sex abuse is a criminal offence, whether it is committed by homosexuals or heterosexuals.
The distribution of child pornography on the net is also a criminal offence, and so is making child pornography.
Victims of paedophile activity are often facing lifelong trauma with some of them turning into child abusers themselves.
The distribution of child pornography is facilitated by the Internet.
Not only is the scale of distribution magnified, but there is a risk of the offence being trivialised.
Various MEPs have already spoken a good deal in the wake of this commendable report, commenting for example on how good and necessary it is that there should be contact points, that the police should have the relevant expertise and that there should be clear penalties.
These are all points underlined by Mrs Plooij.
But anyone who is at all familiar with this sordid subject matter knows that the contact points are inundated with information and that - in stark contrast with this - the number of people who analyse this information is very limited.
I feel sorry for them, not only because of what they are witnesses to, but also because of the volume of material in respect of which they must feel powerless.
We pretend that we are all agreed on this, but this is not so in practice.
In actual fact, there is a great deal of resistance.
Tourist areas, also within our own European Union, do not want to admit that poverty forces poor children into prostitution.
The Internet has the aura of progress.
And when it comes to harmonising our legislation at European level, reference is made to all kinds of grand legal principles.
I think that whoever wills the end must also will the means.
Mr President, It is good that we are having this debate on child pornography on the Internet.
Apart from a few rather coarse, ignorant contributions from my opponent, what has been said has been very sensible.
I would like to point out that, in actual fact, many paedophiles assault children that are close to them.
It is not divorce, alcoholism or anything else that encourages this behaviour.
It is fairly well known that being sexually aroused by children is not exactly normal behaviour, and for that we should be grateful.
The Internet makes exchanging pictures easier, and it is this we should be discussing.
I agree totally with Mrs Maes that we have excellent police authorities working with these issues.
However, in relation to how the problem has increased, there are not enough of them to be able to examine the whole situation.
It is, therefore, a shame that we are immediately about to call in Europol.
We have had discussions with representatives from Europol with respect to trafficking in women and children, and they say that they have two reports. However, these reports are not official, so only Europol is aware of Europol's own activities.
This is a problem.
The police that I have been in contact with in my own country, Sweden, who are working on these issues via Interpol, need, of course, more support, just like their colleagues in other countries.
For this is not only an issue within the EU.
There is also much to do when it comes to Thailand, the Philippines and other places around the world, something the police authorities are working on.
It is not exclusively in Western Europe that this issue is being dealt with.
There is one aspect of this matter that has not come up very often in the responses to this report, but which I would, nevertheless, like to raise in the debate, namely the rehabilitation of the victims.
The problem with the Internet is that the pictures are so clear.
Older children are at risk of being continuously pursued on the net and of being recognised for ever and a day.
We must consider how we in the Member States are to take care of the children that have been victims of this crime and whose photographs are on the net.
In Sweden we have also had experience of people finding their way into the school system or child care because they are paedophiles.
It is a shame that we have not discussed the enormous cutbacks and extensive privatisation in these areas.
Of course, we must perhaps also ensure, as a preventative measure, that no-one works alone with children, either in the private or the public school systems or within the child care profession and in other positions.
I truly welcome this debate. However, I would like us to remember that paedophilia is not a common, widespread activity, a fact for which, as I have already said, we must be grateful.
Mr President, likewise dismayed by the persistent out-of-hand condemnation of Austria by the 14 Member States, I consider it particularly important and I am pleased that we are showing unity in this matter.
I only have the following points to add or raise with regard to this excellent report; firstly, the appropriate training of specialists to be able to also prosecute the perpetrators; secondly, the need for the capability to carry out legal proceedings at international level; and thirdly, the need to be able to punish crimes committed in third countries under domestic law.
Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction that the Member States of the EU are so resolutely and actively supporting this Austrian proposal and not just taking refuge in soundbites and clichÃ©s.
Mr President, Commissioner, as long as there is a demand for child pornography, it will be produced.
As long as there is a trade in pornography, the Internet will be used to carry it out, because the Internet offers an extra benefit, namely it masks the consumer and keeps the supplier, for the most part, in the shadows.
However, as long as this demand exists, there will also be abused children scarred for life.
I therefore welcome this initiative, which was finally put forward so comprehensively by the Austrian Presidency.
Above all, I welcome the proposals for expanding the initiative which the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, has made.
He has made a major contribution to the instrument, which the Member States can now take up, being more efficient than ever before.
I would like to pick up on five points which seem to me to be particularly important in the fight against child pornography.
My first point is that not only should the sale and distribution of child pornography be punishable, and indeed should incur punishments that will act as a deterrent, but that the possession of child pornography itself should also be punishable.
My second point is the age limit.
It cannot be set high enough.
I therefore appeal that the target which the Committee has set itself, i.e. of establishing the age of 18 as standard at European level, be implemented as soon as possible.
16 is just the first step. The target must remain 18.
My third point is that we need experts in the fight against child pornography on the Internet.
And it is even more important that these experts join forces, that they are coordinated, and here again Europol presents itself as the appropriate institution.
My fourth point is that the register of persons who have been convicted of the distribution of child pornography or of the sexual abuse of children will hopefully be implemented across Europe as quickly as possible and that access will be available to all Member States and Europol.
My fifth point is that we should proceed according to the personality principle in order to punish criminal acts as efficiently as possible.
In conclusion, I would like to appeal first of all to the individual responsibility of all those who use child pornography for their own gain. They are responsible for its being produced and for the harm it causes children.
I would also like to appeal to the Member States, in the interests of the most vulnerable members of society, to implement as quickly and efficiently as possible the measures proposed by the rapporteur in his excellent report and by the Austrian initiative.
Mr President, thank you for the well-reasoned proposal of the rapporteur!
In this context I would like to propose, in order once again to show the consequence of the proposals, a few follow-up measures, because it is not only e-mails which can be sent anonymously, but letters also.
This is why all public post-boxes should be closed and it should only be possible to send letters at the post-office following official verification of ID.
The second point concerns telephones, because telephone calls can also be made anonymously.
All telephones should also be gotten rid of, except for a few telephone boxes which should, of course, be monitored by the police.
Then all fax machines should be gotten rid of as quickly as possible - nothing else springs to mind!
Mr President, the Commission would like to join several of the speakers in thanking the rapporteur for his excellent report on the draft Council decision.
As has already been stressed, the aim is to intensify actions to prevent and combat the sexual abuse of children, with particular reference to the production, possession and distribution of child pornography through the Internet.
The Austrian initiative to reintroduce the draft joint action to combat child pornography on the Internet, on which Parliament has already delivered a favourable opinion, is welcomed by the Commission.
One essential and positive aspect of the text is the encouragement of international cooperation, which is already well developed in other areas of the fight against criminal activities, such as drugs and illegal immigration.
As the Internet ignores national boundaries, those tracking down Internet crime must also be able to cross them.
International cooperation therefore has to be encouraged as much as possible.
The Commission has been closely involved in international activities and initiatives addressing this issue, such as the International Conference on combating child pornography on the Internet, which was held from 29 September to 1 October 1999 in Vienna.
It was jointly organised by the Austrian and United States Governments and the Commission under the STOP Programme.
The conference adopted conclusions and recommendations that are being actively followed up.
The Commission therefore welcomes the fact that the draft decision underlines the need to engage law enforcement authorities and industry, especially Internet service providers, in a constructive dialogue aimed at improving mutual understanding and sharing respective experiences.
There is a clear need to identify appropriate fora where law enforcement and industry's concerns can be addressed and to encourage the development and implementation of codes of conduct and best practice.
We should bear in mind that the key role must be played by self-regulation and by the individual responsibility of those who use the Internet.
The Commission has long been concerned about child pornography on the Net.
In order to fight against it, it proposed a multiannual Community action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks.
The Council and Parliament adopted it on 25 January 1999.
The action plan provides support for concrete action in four areas: a European network of hotlines, self-regulation by industry, filtering, and rating and awareness.
In addition, the Commission, and the Union as such, is involved in the work of the G8, creating a 24-hour points of contact network.
It is also involved in the current negotiations on a draft convention on cyber crime in the framework of the Council of Europe that will address the specific problem of paedo-pornography on the Internet.
The Commission fully supports the position expressed in the draft report that the subject of child pornography on the Internet should involve the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.
We are convinced that agreements on common definitions, common charges and common sanctions need to be established for certain forms of crime.
We have included in the scoreboard on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice a specific action aimed at criminalising the sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet, as called for by the Heads of States and Government at the Tampere European Summit.
A proposal for a framework decision on common definitions, common charges and common sanctions will be put forward after the summer.
The Commission will participate fully in the discussions that will take place in the Council with a view to adopting this draft decision in order to see whether further action should and would be needed.
We welcome Parliament's proposal on a legal basis: as a framework decision it should be based on Article 34(2)b of the Treaty.
The Commission will also consider, together with the Member States, how to support the implementation of the decision through other projects funded under the STOP programme.
These could be aimed at promoting further training and exchanges between those responsible in the Member States for fighting against this phenomenon, such as the police authorities, but also the judiciary, and at close cooperation between those authorities, Europol and the future Eurojus network.
Finally, the Commission wishes to indicate to Parliament that it can fully support all the amendments tabled by Mr Kirkhope and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, as they provide some very useful clarifications on the definitions and description of the activities to be criminalised, on the age limit, on the offence of possession and on the need for the law enforcement authorities, the police and the judiciary to adopt the necessary technological instruments to scan the net and to make the fight against paedo-pornography not just a rhetorical issue but a concrete action of the Union as such and of each and every Member State.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European Refugee Fund
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0091/2000) by Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision creating a European Refugee Fund [COM(1999) 686 - C5-0120/2000 - 1999/0274(CNS)].
Mr President, because of its wealth, Western Europe is naturally a magnet for everyone seeking protection and fleeing persecution.
Our share in the task arising from a growing influx of refugees must, of course, correspond in scope and importance to our prosperity and to our global and historical role.
But encounters between people from different cultures are not always simple, and they should therefore be helped along, just as refugees should be given support to begin new lives in their new locations.
The Member States each tackle these matters in very different ways, and rightly so, because they each start from perspectives within their different cultures and traditions.
However, all refugees have some basic needs in common, and special groups need professional help and support so that they can again start to live lives appropriate to human beings.
What is more, they need advice and guidance from the authorities in their new countries and in connection with their actual seeking of asylum.
All refugees begin with a dream of returning home.
For some, this becomes a reality but, for others, the period in exile proves to be so long that returning home is unrealistic.
They acquire children and friends and a new life for themselves. The children put down roots in the new country, and these become stronger than their parents' roots in the old country.
Therefore, a number of them choose in the end perhaps to apply for citizenship in the new country. A number of surveys show, however, that, even for those who achieve their dream of returning home, it is very important that the period in exile should have been meaningful, that they should have had the opportunity to grow as people and that their qualifications should have been used so that they do not cease to develop as people and are not hindered from developing professionally in their own fields by stagnation, passivity, uncertainty and lack of qualifications.
Integration and repatriation are not, therefore, opposed to each other, and integration is not only for people who wish to move country for good.
It is also of significant help to those who subsequently return home.
It may, in fact, prove to be a prerequisite of successful repatriation.
I do not, therefore, understand why some people want to distinguish between displaced persons and refugees.
Responsibilities in Europe are unfairly distributed in relation both to the Member States' size and prosperity.
The European Refugee Fund is a first and very modest attempt to distribute resources in proportion to the tasks which individual Member States promise to undertake.
It is not a question of the ratio between the number of refugees and the number of existing citizens. It is a question of the actual task which is to be undertaken.
It is not about relative numbers, but actual numbers.
I think that some of the amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party must be based upon a misunderstanding in this area.
I hope the discussion may make it a little clearer what the thinking here is.
But because the task is a considerable one and because it has been unfairly distributed, it is naturally sad that the fund in question should be so small.
We are talking about EUR 26 million to cover the fixed expenses of the current work, distributed among 15 Member States.
Not much is, in fact, being given to those Member States which really have taken a considerable degree of responsibility upon themselves. By German or Italian reckoning, the amount must seem tiny.
In addition, there is, of course, some uncertainty about the fund' s financial future.
I am very anxious to know whether the Commission has some good news for us and whether it has given the necessary consideration to the issue in question so that the Fund will have a future and not just become a nonsense over the next few years.
All in all, however, the European Refugee Fund is, in fact, to be regarded as a start.
And if it has a good beginning and if we are able to follow up the issue, then it will only be natural for us to increase the amount concerned so that the Fund really can live up to its name as the European Refugee Fund.
Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on her report and would also like to thank her for the cooperation I have received in my capacity as draftsperson of the opinion.
I was very excited when I read the Commission' s proposal.
The Commission is obviously on the right track.
It is important that the financial responsibility for refugees be distributed among Member States.
This is far better than shifting people around and, in this way, it is possible to end the vicious circle of Member States passing the buck, something which they have become familiar with through the international Treaties.
However, the Committee on Budgets is raising two objections.
Firstly, no consideration is given to the Financial Regulation.
Indeed, the programme is multiannual, whilst the financial calculations have only been made for one year.
The second objection is more extensive.
The financial scheme of setting aside 26 million for structural measures whilst keeping ten million in reserve for contingency measures could never lead to the goal which the Commission has in mind, namely an actual spreading of the financial responsibility.
The Member States will, however, need to set up all kinds of structures and procedures in order to share out the money.
In this way, solidarity among Member States and solidarity with those seeking protection threatens to be encumbered by a disproportionately high administrative burden.
The Committee on Budgets therefore suggests that the present proposal with the amounts quoted could be considered as an experiment, a very commendable experiment at that.
But a real European Refugee Fund will cost a great deal more than that.
It will need to be investigated exactly how much more this would cost, and the Committee on Budgets has decided unanimously that we expect the outcome of this investigation before 31 March 2001.
The Commission is on the right track.
We should not, therefore, get distracted by restrictions upon the financial perspective as long as the net result is to be positive.
Mr President, firstly, I too should like to thank Mrs Frahm for her work and willingness to support a number of amendments, both from the committee and from myself.
This has all too often been a very rushed process which has not allowed those of us involved to collaborate as we would have wished to find the best solutions to certain problems.
I would particularly cite the example of the allocation of the funding which does not even meet the Commission's intention to give particular consideration to the Cohesion Fund countries.
So the proposed review process becomes essential.
Asylum-seekers are not a burden but a responsibility.
The European Union Member States are the chosen destination of comparatively few, compared with the world's poor countries such as those in Africa.
A proposed amendment from our committee requires that all measures under this fund should be based on an approach designed to prevent any outbreak of xenophobia, racism, discrimination or inequality.
That is particularly important, especially given recent criticism by the UNHCR of certain parties in my own Member State for their encouragement of such negative views or their failure to challenge them - criticism which is fully justified in my view.
A change to the funding proposed by our committee aims to give a minimum to each state, which could be used to promote public awareness.
My committee feels that the money, inadequate at the moment, should be used to improve the facilities and services offered, which is why we also want to see an overall strategy for the development of services, with a view to refugees and displaced persons being able to play a fully active role in society as equals.
Not to take such an approach would be short-sighted, as others have already pointed out.
The committee also proposed that there should be greater partnership at Member State level in determining and evaluating how the money should be used, including the involvement of refugee organisations themselves.
We also want it to be a duty for the committee assisting the Commission to consult with other organisations.
How we deal with the dispossessed is an issue for society as a whole, not just for governments.
Mr President, my Group is highly delighted with the proposal to set up a European Refugee Fund and also with the way in which Mrs Frahm has tackled this problem in her role as rapporteur.
The asylum policy urgently needs a European approach.
We do not wish to see a downward spiral where Member States compete in making their own country look unattractive, the way the Netherlands did, for example, when it appeared on CNN with leaking tents in which refugees could be received.
As Europeans, we do not want that sort of policy.
We most certainly do not want one country to shift its responsibility to another.
Setting up this fund is therefore a step in the right direction.
It provisionally brings the desired solidarity within the European Union symbolically into focus.
It is only right that the countries which do a great deal per capita of the population should be the first to receive financial support.
This is also the thrust of the amendment tabled by my Group.
Subsequently, the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers.
I suggest including these two values in an algebraic formula, a task which I pass on to the officials with pleasure.
Needless to say, the values will depend on the influx of asylum seekers in each country, the number of people granted refugee status, obviously in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and the number of displaced persons received.
The tasks supported by the fund are covered in the proposal and by the rapporteur.
We are extremely pleased with the broad support for our concept of tailor-made solutions.
As Mrs Frahm mentioned a moment ago, the tailor-made aspect refers to the difference between those who have attained refugee status as individuals and those who are benefiting from temporary protection as displaced persons who have been driven out on a massive scale.
Individual refugees gain from a dynamic approach to their integration in all kinds of areas within the European Union, such as permanent jobs, housing, the settling of whole families etc.
Displaced persons, on the other hand, have been driven out en masse and against their will and want to return to their home country.
For them, it is important to optimise their chance of repatriation with dignity.
In order to achieve this, they need to maintain their own social networks and they need activities which will strengthen their prospects in their country of origin upon their return and, of course, they need to be able to maintain their self-respect.
In this respect, Amendment No 19 deals with refugees, while Amendment No 21 focuses on displaced persons.
We should really spell this out a little more clearly.
In my opinion - and this is my personal opinion - integration should also include the recognition of the religions of the new minorities.
This is why my Amendment No 20, which I supported on my own in committee, has mysteriously found its way back into the report, thus affording Members who wish to prove their broad-mindedness in this respect the final opportunity, in one way or another, to include this amendment in the report.
I have been informed that the European Commission is carrying out a comparative study into the asylum policy of the Member States.
I am very curious to see whether this report will be published before long.
It could, in itself, contribute towards the common policy based on best practices.
It is also vital that this report is made available as soon as possible. This week, for example, in the Dutch Lower Chamber - and undoubtedly elsewhere - an asylum policy is again being discussed which is drafted in such a way as to be completely out of tune with everything that is happening in the EU Member States.
This seems very bad policy on the part of the Netherlands.
However, perhaps this is also happening elsewhere. In my opinion, the Commission should keep its finger on the pulse, in a tactful manner, of course, but a finger on the pulse nonetheless.
It makes sense that the fund should mainly focus on improving the procedures, but at least as interesting is the Community' s approach to the phenomenon of displaced persons.
After all, this is a category which- more than anything - is typified by the need for security, without choosing a particular EU Member State as such.
We are also in favour of EU aid being earmarked for a common follow-up scheme which monitors the experiences of repatriates and which also offers a certain level of guarantee.
It goes without saying that we, as Christian Democrats, welcome the efforts of private organisations and those of refugees and displaced persons themselves with open arms.
On behalf of my Group, I wish this new type of Structural Fund, because this is what it comes down to, every success.
I also want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, on the handling of this important topic and I hope that she will accept my efforts in the field of tailor-made solutions for what they mean as regards, on the one hand, refugees and, on the other, displaced persons.
Mr President, my Group welcomes this proposal.
It is important that this instrument should remain in force for the entire five-year period and that the core elements of a common asylum system should be codified within this period.
The Fund should help to balance up the differences between Member States in the acceptance and integration of persons in need of protection.
A precondition for this is that the various factors must be given due consideration in allocating the money.
It is necessary that the legal basis for the Fund should be adopted as soon as possible so as to ensure continuous EU financing of refugee projects.
I welcome the fact that, under Article 5, the money for routine projects is to be separated from emergency aid measures.
Mass refugee situations require special measures and separate budgetary allocations.
Only in this way can routine long-term measures also be maintained.
The effective distribution of responsibilities which the Fund is striving for can only be achieved in the long term if the existing problems of widely divergent capacities are tackled. This requires additional support for the Member States with a less well established asylum system.
I therefore consider that a fixed sum for the Member States which are experiencing difficulties in establishing their asylum system is advisable.
The description in Article 3 of the tasks and measures which are worthy of promotion could lead to a priori support for measures to improve the acceptance conditions for asylum seekers, but this should not mean that measures necessary for fairer and more effective asylum procedures are neglected.
I am of the opinion that the Fund should finance measures to inform the public concerning the policy and practice of the Member States with regard to refugees, asylum seekers and other temporarily protected persons.
The positive results of such activities in the past speak in favour of the continuation of such financial support, which should be made available to every eligible applicant.
I congratulate Mrs Frahm on her excellent report and gladly support the request of Mrs Frahm and Mrs Buitenweg for the addition of this sum to the Refugee Fund.
Mr President, in Denmark, Pernille Frahm and her party have led the way in the struggle against what they call "more Union" .
They campaigned against Denmark' s joining the single currency, which we are to vote on in September, and they have been on the "no" side in four out of the five previous Danish referenda.
That is why I am so pleased to read Pernille Frahm' s report in which she does not merely approve, but also requests, "more Union" in the form of mutual aid in connection with the burden which the influx of refugees imposes upon us.
To cap it all, she wants more money transferred from the national Refugee Councils to their EU equivalent.
I agree.
If a large number of Albanian refugees arrives in Italy or a large number of Baltic refugees in Scandinavia, it is more sensible to spread the cost over the whole Union than compulsorily to distribute the refugees throughout the Union.
The Refugee Fund makes it possible to help more refugees in the vicinity of their own countries where they can maintain links with their families and native cultures and continue to put pressure upon the tyrants who drove them from their homes.
It is, therefore, also a good thing that the EU should be able to come up with aid in support of large influxes of refugees.
We saw the need during the war in Kosovo.
Just imagine if a great many more Kosovars could have been helped in neighbouring Macedonia and Albania.
They would have much preferred this than to have been sent thousands of kilometres away to distant countries.
If there are any who stand united on this issue, they are Pernille Frahm' s and my own party.
If we could make Pernille Frahm rapporteur for European cooperation, too, then I am sure that we could agree about that issue as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great relief that we welcomed the proposed Council decision on the creation of a European Refugee Fund.
After Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, to cite but a few of the tragedies which bathe our planet in blood, creating such a body is an increasingly urgent matter.
The report shows the extent to which parliamentary activity can be beneficial to Europe.
We therefore support these motions.
We shall here mention only three points.
Firstly, if there is one point on which the report is not satisfactory, it is financial resources.
Very few resources are allocated to the Fund, considering the scale of its activities - improving reception conditions, integrating persons benefiting from international protection, encouraging voluntary return by facilitating reintegration in the country of origin.
These are huge tasks requiring amounts far greater than those initially planned.
We must provide ourselves with the resources to realise our shared ambitions, and make Europe a land of solidarity and hospitality, which respects human dignity and the values which are the reasons for thousands of people to seek asylum, particularly freedom of democratic expression and peace.
Secondly, improving reception conditions should also include providing access to health care for all, the provision of education for children, and also training.
Already made rootless by virtue of their exile, families must be able to benefit from education for their children and training programmes for young people in order to regain some stability, to promote their social and economic integration, and to encourage their possible return to their own country.
Thirdly, many of us are calling for NGOs and the associations working on a day-to-day basis with refugees to be consulted, both in defining the necessary programmes and in their implementation.
It would be a serious mistake to exclude the very women and men who often, with their invaluable experience, make good the omissions of the State, from the process.
Finally, in conclusion, I should like once again to stress the ever more insistent need for Member States to arrive quickly at common legislation in matters of asylum.
It is only this advance which will make it possible to allow this European Fund to make a proper impact.
Mr President, allow me first of all to emphasise that, in the referendum on the Edinburgh Agreement in 1993, the Danish people declined to participate in EU cooperation on legal issues, and Denmark is not, therefore, bound by any legal obligations to allow the EU to decide which refugees are to be received by Denmark.
And one cannot in all decency receive money from the EU if one will not also allow the EU to decide which refugees are to be allocated to which countries.
I think it is the individual countries' responsibility to finance their refugee policies themselves and, for that reason alone, I have to vote against this report.
On Danish television, representatives of the High Commission for Refugees in Geneva have expressed the view that only one in ten asylum seekers are genuine applicants.
If, as in Denmark, the majority of applicants are given asylum or residence permits, then legitimate refugees are left in the lurch.
Denmark offers the world' s highest level of financial aid to refugees and therefore attracts many who are merely economic refugees. And that is not what the Convention on Refugees is about.
I nonetheless agree with Mrs Frahm about one thing, namely that EUR 26 million is far, far too low a level.
In Denmark alone, the level of aid is EUR 2 billion per year so that the present little fund is of absolutely no effect.
We therefore think we need to manage the whole issue of apportioning and prioritising our efforts concerning refugees in a far more rational way.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are many reasons why, in principle, I welcome what the Commission has submitted: firstly, because the Commission is sending a signal to the Member States that they are not alone in the problems of migration, refugees and displaced persons; secondly, because it at least regulates in part the distribution of the burden; and, thirdly, because the Commission is proposing a differentiated package of responsibilities for two different groups, namely recognised refugees and displaced persons, i.e. persons temporarily seeking protection.
I welcome the proposal because it clearly defines the target groups, because the acceptance conditions will be improved and the integration of refugees supported, and because the re-integration of temporary refugees will be promoted.
However, I do not share the view that Mrs Frahm' s report can be accepted almost without criticism because I consider that measures which go beyond these defined responsibilities are inappropriate.
Firstly, the money is not available and, secondly, there are other totally different groups which have a claim to it if you are talking here about groups which are particularly in need of protection, and we are unquestionably talking about persons within the meaning of the Geneva Convention.
I also do not support your proposals for measures which are incompatible with the particular groups.
When it comes to refugees, the measures should be different to those for displaced persons.
You cannot, in the case of displaced persons whose main concern is to return to their homeland, require that the host country integrate them into the labour market.
That contradicts the basic intention.
However, we must seek to make an amendment when it comes to the allocation of funds, taking the number of refugees or displaced persons per capita of the population of a Member State as the basis.
One final point which I would like to mention, and I do not understand why Mrs Frahm does not want this, is that we must also have the option to make money available for refugee reception centres.
You reject this and I simply cannot see why, because this is the first point of contact where we can provide specific help, accelerate processes and promote refugee integration.
However, in all the proposed measures, we must not fail to recognise that one objective has not been addressed here, namely taking into account the distribution of the refugee burden.
Please do so in implementing the measures which are necessary and positive.
Mr President, firstly, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, because I believe she has produced a really good piece of work.
Furthermore, her report expresses this Parliament' s pleasure.
For us, the establishment of this Fund is good news.
Since 1997, we have been trying to carry out coherent work in this respect, and we have had some successes.
However, in order to be fully successful, we need a legal basis to ensure the continuity of the work on improving the reception, the integration, or, where they wish it, the satisfactory return of the asylum seekers and refugees present in the European Union.
Those are three different areas of work.
We have to safeguard all three, and I agree that we must maintain a reserve fund in order to deal with the arrival of displaced persons without endangering the development of better infrastructures and practices within the Union.
With regard to the distribution of resources, we have to take account of the need to show solidarity with countries which are highly committed to the question of refugees, but we also have to bear in mind - as the report says - the need for countries which have less of a tradition of accepting refugees - such as my own - to improve their infrastructures and services so that they may reach the same level as the other countries and take on - because I believe this should be the objective - higher levels of responsibility together with the other countries of the European Union.
The Member States have a major role to play in this respect and must make considerable efforts.
However, I would like to point out that we should also make use of our experience of managing other funds, especially the Structural Funds, in order to involve local and regional administrations and the organisations representing civil society in this management, in addition to the Member States.
This would create added value, because contact with the NGOs and the local administrations could contribute to the fight against racism, to involving society and informing the citizens of the reception countries of the importance of asylum and refugees.
Furthermore, using the practices already developed for the management of those funds could promote interaction between them.
We must develop policies which are coherent with both funds.
Lastly, I would like to add my voice to those which have called for a greater financial contribution to the European Refugee Fund.
Mr President, firstly I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, for this excellent and extensive report.
However, as she herself did, I would like to point out a few problems which, in our opinion, are still important and which need to be remedied.
The allocation criteria, which are based on the average number of asylum applicants and recognised refugees and the nature of the projects, are perhaps not adequate to achieve a fair distribution of the burden.
In practice, the countries which take in the greatest number of refugees will probably receive the most funds.
Insofar as it goes that is okay, but it should not mean that the other EU States go short and, ultimately, that the refugees in these states, who are not particularly numerous, should be the ones to miss out on the benefits.
We must also deal with the actual money to be allocated, which must be in proportion to the stated objectives.
Financing must be ensured up to 2004.
So far, the balance sheet has not made any clear statement for the period after 2001.
