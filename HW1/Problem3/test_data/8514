Following liberal amendments to the Civil Code, debt collectors have seized PLNÂ 2Â billion, with the result that employees have not received their wages.
The seizure of these meagre wages represents a violation of moral principles and of social justice.
It is also a violation of many items of legislation, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I should like to ask whether the Commission intends to introduce a regulation making it possible for financial support ...
Â Â  Mr President, recently the impression has been created that certain antagonisms and divisions from the past are being revived, something which we hoped would never be repeated and never burden relations between nations in the united Europe.
By marking 10 February as a day of remembrance for the tragic events after the Second World War, the Italian Republic is commemorating the suffering of its compatriots, and it has every right to do so.
Yet here, democratic Italy should not forget the suffering which the Fascist regime inflicted on other nations, including Slovenia.
I would like to take this opportunity to support the appeal of democratic circles on both sides of the border that we should move beyond this trauma from our semi-distant history, by telling the whole truth.
The truth, no matter how grievous, is the only way to prevent similar things in the future.
It is also the only basis for coexistence and reconciliation.
And if the conciliatory meeting of the presidents of three neighbouring countries can contribute to this, then I also welcome it.
Moving beyond the revival of nationalist prejudices is to the essence of the European idea.
It is also one of the foundations and reasons behind European cohesion and integration.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent tsunami disaster shocked the world and the huge loss of life it caused is almost inconceivable.
Such disasters are not specific to South-East Asia.
The worst European tsunami in recorded history occurred on 1 November 1755, when a powerful earthquake off Portugal's Atlantic coast sent waves crashing into Lisbon.
Up to 30Â 000 lives were lost in the capital alone that day and the event signalled the decline of the city, which until then had been the fourth largest city in Europe and one of the richest.
The waves also hit the coasts of Belgium, Britain, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.
Twenty Member States of the EU have coastlines.
Given that earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis have taken place in the past, would it not be prudent for the Commission to set up a benchmarking process to facilitate alert strategies to warn of natural disasters of this kind?
Â Â  âMr President, Parliament has consistently campaigned against illegal internment in Guantanamo Bay.
Most of the EU nationals have now been released â certainly all nine British citizens â but around a dozen people who have legal residence in an EU country, for instance as refugees, are still there.
There are five people from the UK whose names we know: Bisher al-Rawi, Jamil al-Banna, Jamal Abdullah, Shaker Aamer and Omar Deghayes.
Reports tell of degrading and inhuman treatment, even torture.
Omar Deghayes claims that he has been blinded in one eye with pepper spray.
Twenty years ago he came as a refugee from Libya, where his father was killed by the Gaddafi regime.
Libyan officials have visited him and threatened him with deportation to Libya and death.
This was obviously done with the collusion of the US Government.
In fact, it sent a plane to Tripoli to pick them up.
It must have been done also with the collusion of the UK Government.
It cannot be allowed to hide behind the Vienna Convention.
It has a moral and â I contend â legal obligation to intervene and rescue these people or put them on trial. Otherwise the pretensions of the EU to have a human rights policy ring hollow.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in September 2004 the Russian Federation set limits on imports of food products from Poland.
Polish companies exporting meat and dairy products were also obliged to undergo special inspections by Russian veterinary and plant health agencies.
Out of a total of 74 dairy companies inspected, only two were authorised to export products to Russia.
In spite of the fact that nearly four months have passed since the inspections were completed, Russia has still not provided Poland with a list of companies that passed the inspections and are permitted to export products.
This is proof that Polish companies are being discriminated against on the Russian market.
In January, Poland was assured that the European Commission would intervene to speed up procedures for allowing Polish companies into the Russian market.
I should like to ask what measures the Commission has taken in this connection, what the outcome of those measures has been and when the discriminatory practices applied by the Russian Federation will cease.
Â Â  Mr President, referring to the proposed European Constitution President Bush has said that he is fascinated to see how the sovereignty of nations can be integrated into a larger whole.
He can afford to be fascinated: it is not his country's freedoms, liberty and democracy that are being dismantled and abolished in that process of integration.
What he does take seriously, however, is Article 16 of the Constitution that commits Member States to a common foreign and security policy.
He has rightly warned that this undermines NATO â and it is NATO that has kept the peace in Europe since 1949, not the European Union.
The British people need to know that the proposed common foreign and security policy will prevent Britain from ever again being able to act independently, militarily or politically, whether in alliance with the USA or not.
That is one more good reason for the British people to reject the European Constitution when they have the opportunity to do so.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of UEFA, the Union of European Football Associations.
At todayâs sitting, I should like to express my wholehearted support for UEFAâs latest project, the aim of which is to ensure that rich and poor clubs in both the old and the new EU, and indeed in all of Europe, enjoy the same opportunities.
The project involves a progressive introduction of quotas for club-trained players, with a minimum of two players in one yearâs time, and eventually of four players.
This is intended to force clubs to work with young players, and to prevent rich clubs from merely buying up talented players.
There will also be quotas for players from the country in which the club is based, which are intended to promote national football.
In practice, these quotas will also deter attempts by the richest clubs to build up football armies of hired âgalÃ¡cticosâ or superstars.
UEFAâs proposals comply with the principle of solidarity, upon which the European Union is founded.
It is worth sacrificing another of the EUâs principles that is in any case frequently violated, namely the principle of free movement of workers, for the sake of this principle of solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to insist on something that the President said at the beginning of this sitting.
As you all know, tomorrow there will be an historic visit by George Bush, the President of the United States of America, to the European Commission, in the Berlaymont building in Brussels.
We must acknowledge and thank the President of the Commission, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso, for the efforts and steps he has taken to ensure that, during this visit, Mr Bush receives the President of this European Parliament, which is you, Mr Borrell.
We in our group naturally hope that this meeting is a success and also that it serves to improve relations between the European Parliament and the United States of America.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Barroso Commission has been doing its job for months now and has appointed all its staff, including the spokespersons, it really is hard to believe that they have not yet succeeded in finding an Italian spokesperson.
How can that be?
What steps has Mr Barroso taken, even after all the parliamentary questions, the urging by Commissioner Frattini and the request made by the whole body of Italian journalists accredited with the Commission and the other European institutions?
Ours is not a religious battle and much less a return to sterile nationalism.
We are proud of our language: our Dante Alighieri is the envy of all.
That is precisely why we cannot understand the failure to appoint an Italian-speaking spokesperson.
Â Â  Mr President, last week I participated in the 'Berlinale', the 54th Berlin Film Festival.
Most of our Member States were represented with new productions either in the competition or in other sections of the festival.
It was amazing to see how many talented film-makers we have in Europe, but it was even more encouraging to see how many people were interested in non-Hollywood films made in Europe or elsewhere in the world.
European films were more popular with the audience than American ones.
The whole event showed me that there is a great interest in European cinema, in spite of the fact that our promotion of cinema production is weaker than that of American movies.
There is a huge need to improve European media and cinema policy.
The protection of our cinema heritage and the production of new films deserve more support, both financially and in terms of legislation.
Â Â  â The lack of rain in recent months in Portugal is causing a major crisis both in terms of autumn-winter crops and livestock feed, and in terms of the low expectations for spring-summer crops.
At the same time, there have also been cases of what is known as âbluetongueâ in animals, and the necessary quarantining, seizures and bans on movement have exacerbated the problems of selling livestock.
Producers and farmers have thus been forced to keep animals much longer than planned and to feed them at extra cost, which has led to financial crises that many of them cannot cope with.
I therefore call on you, Mr President, to notify the Commission of the seriousness of the agriculture situation in Portugal and of the need to bring forward the payment of livestock and crop aid.
The shortage of pasture due to the drought is also causing problems and it is therefore necessary to authorise grazing on land banned under Community regulations, in order to reduce livestock deaths.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this week sees the third anniversary of Ingrid Betancourtâs abduction by Colombiaâs FARC guerrillas.
It was 23Â February 2002 when Ingrid Betancourt, mouthpiece for my Colombian sister party and a presidential candidate, was abducted while she was on the way to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict between the government and FARC.
The Colombian Government must stop having recourse to military means. It must instead sign a humanitarian agreement with FARC in line with the Geneva Convention so that Ingrid and 3Â 000 other prisoners can be released.
I should be very grateful if you could act on Parliamentâs behalf and convey our concern about the breaches of human rights in Colombia.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should have liked to have taken advantage of the presence of Commissioner Barroso, who will join us later, to question him about the recent statements to the press by the Commissioner for Regional Policy.
MrsÂ HÃŒbner stated, in fact, that, in her view, it was necessary to facilitate relocation within Europe so that European companies might reduce their costs.
At a time when we are in the middle of debating the EUâs political priorities for 2005, can MrÂ Barroso tell us whether he supports this approach?
According to the latest figures from Eurostat, the highest rates of unemployment in the EU are in the new Member States.
Seen in this light, of course, the strategy proposed by MrsÂ HÃŒbner is perfectly understandable.
What she said illustrates the reality of an enlargement that has taken place without any new budgetary resources.
What the Commissioner is proposing to us is that we rob Peter to pay Paul.
Might MrÂ Barroso be in favour of institutionalising social and fiscal dumping within the EU?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
In view of the forthcoming anniversary of the end of the Second World War, I should like to alert this House to fresh attempts that have been made to falsify and manipulate history for short-term political goals.
Evidence of this can be seen in recent statements made by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the infamous Yalta Conference.
The latter divided the European continent into two spheres of influence, in so doing subjecting many of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, whose representatives are sitting in this House today, to nearly half a centuryâs oppression under an inhuman totalitarian system.
The root cause of this was the German-Soviet Pact of August 1939, and responsibility for starting the Second World War rests not only with Germany, but also with Russia, as the heir to the Soviet Union.
Yet while Germany has demonstrated its desire to face up to its tragic past, Russia still lacks the courage to do so.
I hope the European Parliament will support this motion for a resolution, which, , condemns the Yalta Agreement.
This would be a symbolic gesture of reparation towards the nations from behind the former Iron Curtain.
Â Â  Mr President, Spain treated the referendum on the European Constitution with disdain, with the lowest turnout in our history.
This has been the case partly because there has not been a sufficiently pluralist debate in the media.
If we want passion, we need controversy.
And the future does not look promising.
The government of my country is promoting a law which will allow a friend of the Socialists, JesÃºs de Polanco, to control half of all radio in Spain.
Furthermore, this gentleman already has a monopoly of satellite television and now he is seeking a further slice of the analogue advertising cake.
Ladies and gentlemen of the left, Polanco makes Berlusconi look like a pauper.
If we do not defend plurality in the media, we will very soon find ourselves in a situation in which the European Unionâs information strategy is no longer debated in this Parliament: it will be decided on by four men in an expensive restaurant, with the capacity to impose uniform thinking on 450 million Europeans.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the case of MrsÂ AissataÂ Bint-Karamoko and, above all, request the European Parliamentâs support for her.
MrsÂ Karamoko applied for refugee status in France three years ago.
She is now seven months pregnant and suffering from hepatitis, and is at present in hospital here in this very city of Strasbourg.
Yet the French Government is behaving unacceptably by attempting to return MrsÂ Karamoko to her country of origin, Mauritania, in so doing violating her fundamental right to obtain treatment within the European Union.
In the name of respect for human rights and in accordance with our Charter of Fundamental Rights, I should like us to inform the French Government that it must respect human and fundamental rights by allowing MrsÂ Karamoko to obtain treatment here in France and, above all, to give birth in the best conditions.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I hope that this House has recovered from its infatuation with Ukraineâs âOrange Revolutionâ, and that the time has now come to look facts in the face.
Yushchenkoâs âOur Ukraineâ coalition has tabled a vetting bill, one of the provisions of which states that anyone who criticises the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or the UPA for short, will be prevented from holding a public position.
The UPA has become a symbol of patriotism, yet during the Second World War it gained notoriety for murdering Poles, Jews and Russians.
This vetting provision is an attack against national minorities in Ukraine, the majority of whom are Poles.
These Poles are critical of the UPA because they believe it to be a criminal organisation.
The proposal is supported, however, by the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists and its paramilitary wing, the UNA, some of the members of which fought as mercenaries in Chechnya.
The Nationalists have made contact with Germanyâs neo-fascist National Democratic Party, invoking their brotherhood in arms during the Second World War.
National minorities in Ukraine are in danger, they are afraid and they are calling for help.
Â Â  Mr President, when this Parliament last met it quite properly condemned the Nazi atrocities epitomised by Auschwitz.
Sadly and shamefully, the head of state of an EU member country â President McAleese of the Republic of Ireland â chose that 60th anniversary to launch a vicious and vindictive attack on the majority community in Northern Ireland when she shamefully equated Nazi hatred of Jews to the attitude of Protestants towards Roman Catholics.
Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust.
In the name of the peace-loving majority in Northern Ireland, I take this opportunity in this international forum to refute and reject that vile attack upon those I represent.
References to the struggle against fascism fall particularly ill from the lips of a President, one of whose predecessors expressed condolences upon the death of Hitler.
Â Â  Mr President, I was surprised by the comments of Mr Herrero-Tejedor.
He gives the impression of coming from a completely different country, since he appears to have forgotten that the Peopleâs Party government controlled the whole of the public and private media for eight years.
The Socialist government is currently trying to re-establish democracy, establishing plurality in the media which was not guaranteed by the last Peopleâs Party government.
Finally, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, does your comment imply that your colleague, Mr Berlusconi, is controlling the media in Italy?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Together with several other Members, MrÂ Cashman advised in a letter to Mr Barroso, and I quote: ââŠ that in Slovenia politicians are obviously publicly encouraging discrimination against minorities âŠâ, end of quote, and proposed that the Commission should launch an investigation into this together with the Slovenian Government.
As a liberal Member from Slovenia I wish to draw the attention of Parliament additionally to the fact that the current Slovenian government has also expressly refused to implement the decision of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia, whereby homes in Slovenia taken illegally from them in 1992 should be returned to 18 305 citizens of the former Yugoslavia.
This is not therefore simply a case of discrimination against minorities, but also a violation of the fundamental principles of a state ruled by law.
Â Â  Mr Herrero-Tejedor has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  For a personal statement, Mr President.
A remark has been made about me and I would like to exercise my right to reply, if only for thirty seconds.
Â Â  Which Rule of Procedure are you invoking?
Â Â  Rule 27 B.
Â Â  Did you say Rule 27 B?
Â Â  Mr President, I appreciate that you should know the Rules of Procedure better than I. Perhaps I have suffered a lapse of memory ...
Â Â  Mr Herrero, Rule 27 B relates to the work of delegations.
What does that have to do with personal statements?
Â Â  It is clearly not that Rule, Mr President, but ...
Â Â  Which Rule are you invoking?
Â Â  The Rule which establishes the right to respond to personal comments, Mr President, whichever Rule that is.
I have that right and I expect you to ensure that I can exercise it, Mr President.
Â Â  I simply asked you which Rule you are invoking and you mentioned a Rule that has nothing to do with the issue we are talking about.
Mr Herrero-Tejedor, I am not responsible for your words, you are.
I imagine you are referring to Rule 145.
Is that the case, Mr Tejedor?
Â Â  It is Rule 145, Mr Borrell Fontell.
Â Â  You have thirty seconds.
Â Â  I simply wished to say to Mr Medina that, in fact, Mr Berlusconi has a control over the media in Italy which my party and myself in particular have severely criticised.
And I would therefore ask that the same yardstick be used in relation to Spain.
With regard to the point about the Peopleâs Party controlling the whole of the private media, does that mean that it also controlled all of Mr Polancoâs media, Mr Medina?
Are you trying to make fools of the honourable Members?
Goodness gracious me!
Â Â  Mr Herrero-Tejedor, I have given you the floor in order to avoid pointless arguments, but I must tell you that Rule 145 relates to accusations made against a Member on a personal level.
That was not the case in any way, but despite that, the Presidency has given you the floor in order not to give you the impression that our interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is biased.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not have the rule book in front of me but I simply want to add a clarification to the statement on Northern Ireland made by Mr Allister who criticised President McAleese of the Irish Republic for remarks she made concerning the Protestant community in Northern Ireland.
I want to point out that President McAleese apologised fulsomely and without reservation within hours of making the remarks.
She had not intended the interpretation which has been made and I would appreciate it if this could be noted in the record of the House.
Â Â  Alright, Mr de Rossa, that is what we will do.
However, in the future, all the honourable Members should generally have sufficient knowledge of the Rules of Procedure to be aware that the Rule in question allows Members to speak in response to personal accusations, not to references to a Member within the context of a debate on issues relating to third parties.
Please take note of the fact that the Presidency will not give the floor in future unless a Member has been affected by an issue that relates to them personally.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commissionâs legislative and work programme (2005), a debate which began in Brussels on 26 January 2005.
Mr Barroso has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, eminent Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, before I address you on the Commissionâs legislative and work programme for 2005, I should like briefly to express my satisfaction with the results of yesterdayâs referendum on the European Constitution in Spain and I shall try to do this in Spanish.
The Spanish people have said yes to the European Constitution, a clear and resounding yes.
I would like to express to you the European Commissionâs satisfaction with this result.
Spain has said yes to a Europe united in its diversity.
I would like to thank everybody who has participated in the referendum process with such commitment, in particular all the Members of this Parliament who have contributed with their voices and opinions to achieving this significant result.
In this regard, I called the President of the Spanish Government, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, yesterday to congratulate him and thank him for the great commitment demonstrated by his government during the referendum campaign.
This âyesâ, expressed clearly and unreservedly, opens the way for the other European citizens who will also be called upon to express their opinions on the European Constitution over the coming months.
This has been a very important step in the process of ratifying the European Constitution, which the Commission believes to be the only instrument which will allow us Europeans to consolidate our ideas of peace, prosperity, solidarity and security in Europe.
Mr President, one month ago I presented the Commission's proposed strategic objectives, designed to guide European action until the end of the decade.
This is a political roadmap based on three pillars: prosperity, solidarity and security.
Being mutually reinforcing, they address the concrete and challenging concerns of European citizens.
I also presented the first delivery of the strategic objectives: the legislative work programme for this year.
Let me remind you of some of its most important elements.
First of all, the programme is more focused in political terms.
The proposed initiatives are structured around the three strategic objectives and their external dimension, and represent a first concrete translation of the balanced approach pursued by the Commission.
This applies to new initiatives as well as areas where we propose to reinforce an existing action.
Second, the Commission is fully committed to delivering its work programme.
For this purpose, the Commission intends to adopt a list of just over 100 priority initiatives by the end of the year.
Finally, we do not only want to deliver on time â we also want to deliver in a better way.
We want to be serious about the principles of better regulation. This means ensuring quality of legislation; respect for the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and added value; and widespread use of impact assessments.
In addition to this work programme, I announced that the Commission will regularly inform the Parliament about its planning agenda for legislative proposals in preparation.
I am happy to be able to say that this information channel is now operational.
In the meantime, the Commission has gone further in implementing its proposals.
On 2 February, I presented to you our proposals for a mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
By focusing on growth and jobs, it aims to create the conditions for proper living standards, social justice for all and environmental sustainability.
On 6Â January and 2 February we had an initial exchange of views.
I was pleased to hear that, broadly speaking, the Commission's proposals met many of the expectations and concerns of Members of this House.
I welcome the detailed motions for resolutions tabled today by the political groups on the work programme.
When we talk about partnership, dialogue and consultation, we know that we will not always agree on everything.
As in any partnership, the important thing is to have positions on the table clearly spelt out, and to work together to achieve common objectives.
I would like to comment briefly on some of the important issues raised in the comments and motions for resolutions.
First, actions count more than words.
The European Union has a responsibility to turn its aspirations into reality.
It must promote prosperity, cohesion and social justice, both at home and beyond our borders.
The Commission is fully committed to this task.
We have already started to work towards this goal by implementing our work programme for 2005: we are on track.
Second, competitiveness and social cohesion need to go hand in hand.
We all know that striking a balance is difficult.
I want the Commission to be helpful in this regard.
This requires listening carefully to your opinions and contributions.
Take the REACH initiative, for example.
Let me assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed.
We all agree on the need to protect the safety of individuals and the environment properly.
On the other hand, we should also address the fear that certain elements of the proposal would put a key European industry in serious difficulty without adding real value in the fields of health and the environment.
Throughout the legislative process, we will continue to look into further possibilities to refine and improve the balance between regulation and competitiveness.
With regard to the draft services directive, here too we are pursuing an aim which commands general support â the completion of the single market for services by 2010.
Again I can assure you that we have taken due note of the concerns expressed.
I am fully convinced that, via the legislative process, we will be able to settle upon an instrument which will tap the single market's hidden potential without jeopardising legitimate public interest objectives.
Let us do this on an informed basis and dispel the myths.
Our proposals do not call into question the responsibility of Member States when it comes to organising and financing key public services as required by their societal needs, nor do they undermine the rules on the posting of workers as laid down in the directive.
Finally, I shall mention the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Commission is committed to helping improve the pact and ensuring it fully complies with the Treaty.
The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation.
We want better incentives to foster 'good policies' in 'good times'.
We want a better definition of the medium-term objectives of fiscal policy by taking into account elements such as the debt level and the up-front costs of structural reforms.
We want to avoid undesirable fiscal restraint in a downturn, because, ultimately, we want our budgets to be in a position to enhance prosperity by focusing expenditure on growth-oriented sectors and by investing for the future.
These are not academic issues â this is about quality of life, people's opportunities to earn a living and reap the benefits of their savings and pensions.
This is about the chances of current and future generations to lead as full a life as they can legitimately expect to.
As part of this balanced approach, the Commission has made progress via its recently adopted proposal on the revised social agenda for the period up to 2010.
This shows the Commission's full commitment to modernising and developing European social systems, to tackling social exclusion and poverty, and to attaining the target of more and better jobs.
When liberalising markets, individuals must not be forgotten.
That is why last week we adopted two new proposals to strengthen passengers' rights.
This brings me to a key issue: the European Union needs to be given sufficient financial means to act.
Cohesion policy is and must remain central to the purpose of the Union.
Without solidarity, we can never be united.
It is an essential complement to competitiveness and the Lisbon Strategy â raising prosperity levels in the less-developed regions of the Union benefits the Union as a whole.
We should also bear in mind that there are now 25 Member States.
The new Member States are waiting for tangible proof of our solidarity.
This is why our proposals for a new generation of cohesion policies for the next Financial Perspective are of critical importance for the Union, both economically and politically.
We cannot afford to see our obligations in this area watered down.
In addition, the Commission is currently preparing its third package of proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which are based on a careful examination of their European added value with respect to providing citizens with opportunities that complement national approaches or fill existing gaps.
This set of instruments will include proposals on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development; consumer protection and public health; energy â including renewable energy sources; competitiveness and innovation in respect of freedom, security and justice.
The Commission is doing its work, but making these proposals a reality will very much depend on the terms of the agreement on the Financial Perspectives expected by June.
As I said before, I do not see how the Commission can contribute to a Europe which aims to do more, but with less resources.
Honourable Members, sustainable development and the issue of climate change are both firmly rooted in the Commissionâs agenda.
Although we are delighted that the Kyoto Protocol has come into force, we cannot however stop there.
On 9Â February, we adopted a communication on sustainable development and another entitled âWinning the battle against global climate changeâ.
These proposals supplement those relating to the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.
Alongside the economic pillar, the sustainable development strategy and the new social agenda constitute two other supplementary pillars upon which our strategy for the next five years will be based.
Naturally, we must also look beyond our borders.
We shall be able this year to take stock of the progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
The situation is clearly disappointing.
The European Union can and must make a larger contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Next month, we shall publish our contribution to the current review exercise.
We must be more dynamic and more imaginative in giving concrete expression to our Monterrey Commitments.
In doing so, our main priority will be Africa, and we intend to propose specific new initiatives for Africa.
Multilateralism and the reinforced Neighbourhood Policy are also priorities for the Commission.
Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives.
When we meet President Bush tomorrow, we shall share with him our wish for effective multilateralism and our commitment to work for peace and provide humanitarian aid wherever required.
We all share the belief that it is our action for the benefit of Europeans that is the source of legitimacy for our daily work.
Increasing public involvement is a priority for the Commission and, in order to fulfil this duty, we shall propose a specific programme within the framework of the Financial Perspective.
By providing people with simple and transparent information on the subject, they will be in a better position to understand what is at stake in Europe and to form opinions.
All the Commissioners â including, principally, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, whose particular area this is â have undertaken to exert themselves in this area.
Allow me, in conclusion, to explain how the Commission, of which I have the honour of being President, intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns.
The method we will use will be partnership, particularly between the European institutions.
I should like to repeat what I have already said on many occasions before this House, namely that I intend to develop a constructive rapport between the Commission and the European Parliament.
I was delighted to see, during the debate of 26Â January, that President Juncker and many Members of this House agree on the importance of working together on the strategic objectives proposed by the Commission.
This would be an unprecedented step towards greater coherence in the action taken by the EU.
Finally, the Commission wants to work very closely with Parliament in the spirit of the proposed partnership.
Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chairmen, and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us, from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities.
To summarise, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I want the Work Programme for 2005 to be the first achievement of the partnership I am proposing to you for the renewal of Europe.
I shall be happy to hear now your comments and suggestions regarding its content.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are very happy that President Barroso has been able to join us and that we are able to examine with him this 2005 programme, the presentation of which has been delayed, albeit for reasons of which we are aware.
MrÂ Barroso, we know that you will do everything to bring about even greater effectiveness.
Your programme is ambitious, and we have every confidence in you â confidence that we should very much like to re-affirm, as you have been an attentive listener, specifically to ourselves. Indeed, you took the initiative to review the Directive on Services in order to take account of our concerns.
The same applies to REACH, as you have just explained to us.
We must therefore concentrate on the key issues, namely growth and employment.
Fewer laws and better lawmaking will be the main thrust of our work.
I know that we are on the same wavelength as you on this subject.
You also spoke to us about actions to be taken.
Productivity in Europe is increasing half as fast as in the United States, where the average growth in investment is 5.4% per year, compared with 1.7% for European investments.
What our fellow citizens are waiting for are, in fact, practical changes that can be described in simple terms: seeing purchasing power increase and no longer needing to fear unemployment or relocation.
It is therefore with impatience that we await your framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, including precise objectives and pre-arranged meetings.
Increasing growth and employment means relying upon innovation and research and, above all, reconciling environmental and industrial policies.
These two policies are not contradictory, in fact quite the opposite is true; they are complementary.
Environmental considerations are not constraints or obstacles.
They are assets and present an opportunity for our economy.
Europe must therefore opt for eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies in order to meet a demand for high added value products that our competitors cannot satisfy.
Thanks to its high environmental standards, the European Union stimulates innovation and increases the competitive ability of European industry.
I have in mind the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, of biofuels and of clean forms of transport â all sectors that offer our industries a real opportunity in terms of employment and exports.
We note your proposals in this area with interest, particularly the regulation on the measures to be taken to combat forms of air pollution.
Viable economic development and renewed growth depend above all upon both the health of our companies and the health of the men and women who make our economy work.
We value that part of your programme concerning health and consumer policy.
Europe must also anticipate the possible threats from major scourges and combat the new epidemics and resistance to antibiotics.
It is therefore with great interest that we await the proposal for a directive aimed at putting Community measures in place to combat avian influenza.
We shall have to act quickly and effectively.
Regarding demographic development in Europe, the Green Paper must quickly be followed up by practical measures involving, for example, lifelong learning, health systems that can be relied upon over time and research into neurodegenerative diseases.
As far as solidarity policy is concerned, it is only right that the new Member States should benefit from these programmes, but do not forget that the funds in question also convey the image of the European Union across all the Member States.
It is therefore vital for all the countries to have access to these forms of structural aid.
We also call for greater efficiency in the way in which Member States follow up each otherâs judicial decisions, although, on this subject, we were still awaiting the results of the codecision provided for by the Constitution.
We know that all this should help improve Europeansâ mobility.
In particular, we must also improve young peopleâs mobility by facilitating university exchanges and having people benefit from the terrific experience constituted by career routes to the professions.
We are ambitious, and so are you.
We wish to develop and improve working conditions with a view to putting practical measures in place and improving work-life balance.
That is how we shall be able to fulfil the objective that the EU must pursue, so enhancing the whole of European society.
The European Commission must be visionary in its initiating role.
In the field of policy, we would emphasise Euro-Mediterranean relations.
Euro-Mediterranean policy must be much stronger and be accorded priority.
In the same way, we must turn our attention to our European borders.
In conclusion, I should like to say to you that political will must be reflected in a Financial Perspective that is evaluated for what it really is.
The Member States cannot ask more of Europe while giving less.
What, therefore, we now need is political energy for kick-starting the engine that drives our efforts â efforts that are the basis of our work.
You have that energy.
We shall be at your side in that spirit of constructive rapport you mentioned.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech we have just heard was not a speech from the European Peopleâs Party, but from the French Gaullists.
MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, given the substance of your speech, I cordially invite you to join us, and we shall quickly secure majorities for socially responsible policies in the European Union.
I saw the profound shock in the eyes of my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and it was a real treat to observe his reaction.
President Barroso, I am delighted that you have managed to be with us in spite of the present demands on your time.
I want to make that very clear.
We are all aware of the problems you experienced in London with your flight. Your presence here augurs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament.
Let me emphasise that.
But enough of these pleasantries, for I also have one or two remarks to make that I believe you will be less happy to hear.
I do not wish to return to the issue of whether it was right or wrong for you to appear in an advert for the PSD in Portugal.
That is in the past now.
I would like to make a serious proposal, however, with regard to the negotiations on the framework agreement.
We must make a decision.
There is a provision in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission which clearly states that Commissioners are not forbidden to engage in political activities in their home countries, provided they discuss the activity beforehand with the President of the Commission, who either gives his consent to whatever is necessary for the performance of the activity or expresses his misgivings.
There is no rule, however, for the President, although his conduct should, of course, be exemplary.
I personally have no problem whatsoever with the principle that the Commissioners, or you as President of the Commission, have a set of political views and can air those views in public.
I am well aware of where your political affiliation lies.
It goes without saying that you are not required to go around hypocritically pretending that your election to the presidency of the Commission has made you politically neutral.
I believe it is only right that you should continue to uphold your views, but the same rule must apply to the President and the Commissioners alike, whether it authorises or forbids all of you to engage in national politics.
Saying âyesâ to some and ânoâ to others is unacceptable.
This is why I suggest that we clarify this matter in the framework agreement.
A second remark, MrÂ President; in our most recent discussion of your work programme, I said on behalf of our group that we saw the glass as half full.
I said this because we had seen encouraging signs that you were heeding the appeals which we Socialists had been making to you and your Commission.
Then, a few days later, I found an interview with you in the in which you took a completely different line from the one you had presented when you addressed this Parliament.
âEconomy is in the front seatâ, you were now saying.
No!
Social coherence is in the front seat â at least for us Socialists, MrÂ President â and we shall not release you from your obligations on this score.
You presented a work programme with Socialist elements but then gave an interview in the which went in the very opposite direction.
Later, MrÂ Å pidla presented a paper to which we Socialists can heartily subscribe, but this was followed by comments in the press by MrsÂ HÃŒbner which we find absolutely impossible to accept.
You made it to the Berlaymont building, MrÂ President, but I have the impression that, whenever you arrive at the Schuman roundabout, you are no longer sure which exit to take.
For this reason, let me suggest that you follow our Socialist proposals, because the problem with the European Union is this: if we do not make it clear to the public that this Union of ours offers them social security, and allow them to carrying on thinking that Brussels is out to destroy their social security, the risks we incur will outweigh the opportunities we create.
Until we stop conveying that impression, citizens will continue to turn their backs on Europe.
This has to do with the fact that the neo-liberal approach is presented â perhaps not by you, MrÂ Barroso, but by many of your Commissioners and, what is far worse, by a great many of your officials within the Commission as a fact of everyday life; all will be well with Europe, so the theory goes, when it is deregulated, made more flexible, and locked into a downward social spiral.
As long as this is the main thrust of your Commissionâs policies, the climate will never change in favour of the EU.
We Socialists have not been elected to support the sort of neo-liberal policies that are enshrined in the Bolkestein directive, but to guarantee both sides of the coin on which our discussions have long been focused.
On the one hand, we need competition and flexibility, but this increase in competition and flexibility must serve to promote the achievement of the other goal, namely social stability.
For this reason, I ask you to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to us, together with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and MrÂ Verheugen, in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europeâs greatest achievement.
If you read our resolution, you will see that we are willing to engage in constructive cooperation with you, but only if you, along with your Commission, are willing to build a social Europe.
Then we shall gladly give you our backing.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is bizarre that socialists believe that there can be social progress without economic growth and structural reform.
It is also incredibly naive of Martin Schulz to criticise the President of the Commission for playing a part in domestic politics: we are not served by the â political people divorced from their political roots.
My only criticism of the article that I saw in the was President Barroso's swipe at 'naive federalists'.
I have no idea what he had in mind there.
My group welcomes the sharper focus of the work programme and its grounding within a clear political strategy.
However, I am also struck by the great size of the programme.
Clearly, a greater sense of priorities will be required.
For my own group, our priority is to complete the single market, especially in the area of financial services.
This will require a review and, perhaps, stronger scrutiny of the legacy of the Prodi Commission than the programme has presently enjoyed, certainly with respect to software patenting, but also access to port services.
We place great emphasis not only upon the improvement of the quality of drafting, but also upon reducing somewhat the quantity.
I finish with a plea for a focus upon a programme that has begun but is far from finished, especially as regards the financial and trade regulations concerning Northern Cyprus.
We have to bring the Turkish Cypriots in from the cold.
Â Â  . Madam President, President Barroso has just proposed complicity in a good cause between the Commission and Parliament.
On behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to refer to two possible areas of complicity in the light of current events.
You mentioned the most relevant event yourself, MrÂ Barroso, namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States.
I believe that, following Condoleezza Riceâs charm offensive in Europe, it must and it will emerge in the coming days and weeks â and the Iran issue will be the acid test â whether we have only one common goal and continue to go our own separate ways, or whether we manage to develop multilateral measures and avert the danger of unilateralism, which we saw during the preventive war against Iraq.
On behalf of my group, may I warmly encourage you and strongly urge the Commission to make every effort in the forthcoming talks to persuade the US Administration to lend its active support to the negotiating strategy of the three EU representatives.
Let me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States.
Our aim is complete consensus.
We must prevent the further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the wider Middle East.
We must press on with the development of a political strategy for the wider Middle East on the basis of the European security strategy.
We must succeed in enshrining a binding commitment by Iran to refrain from military use of the potential created by its nuclear programme, and we need unlimited access for the International Atomic Energy Agency to enable it to inspect all of Iranâs nuclear facilities.
These are the prerequisites for the creation of a ring of security around every country in the region, including Israel.
I am convinced that the European negotiations are the right way forward and are far more likely to succeed if we can persuade President Bush not merely to wait in the wings, not to engage in verbal sabre-rattling and not to keep open the option of a preventive attack, but to put on the agenda an active review of the current economic sanctions against Iran, as well as discussing security guarantees for Iran.
I believe we shall advance in this area if we also remain true to our principle of safeguarding human rights.
I appeal specifically to the Commission not to shelve the dialogue on human rights for the duration of the negotiations, but to intensify it.
I very much regret having to say this, but I have learned that the German Government, the selfsame Government which is actively supporting our negotiations on the EU side, has instituted deportation proceedings against a 26-year-old woman who obtained a divorce from her Iranian husband and converted to Christianity.
Deportation to Iran in these circumstances â and we have opposed it in two previous resolutions â exposes a woman to the danger of stoning, persecution or even death.
I believe that such a bipolar policy makes it difficult, but we must manage to rally a majority in Europe behind a coherent human rights policy.
That will establish our credibility on the Iran issue.
I have no wish to see Iran succeed in playing off the Europeans against the Americans, because we both have the same objectives.
I must re-emphasise that point.
Let me also refer at this juncture to another issue where my group is in agreement with the President of the United States, namely the continuation of the embargo against China.
If we say that the criterion of respect for human rights is fundamental to our European foreign policy, we must acknowledge that the human rights situation in China remains appalling, and it was for this reason that the House adopted a resolution only a few weeks ago in which it rejected the initiative launched by President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der.
We expect this embargo to be maintained and reaffirm that economic interests must not take precedence over human rights.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though the subject of this debate is the Commissionâs legislative and work programme for 2005, it must, of course, be seen in the wider strategic framework, which is strongly influenced by the Lisbon strategy and, regrettably, is designed primarily to intensify competition.
To make matters worse, I believe it is also using the wrong means to pursue that goal.
The operating profits of the large conglomerates in the European Union increased by 78% in 2004.
The ratio of profits to GDP is at what is nearly its highest level in the last 25 years.
Over the past 12Â months, another substantial surplus has been registered in the balance of trade and the balance of payments.
Even in the Federal Republic of Germany, where the large companies are constantly bleating about being shackled by an uncompetitive location, 46 of the 50 companies listed in the Dax index clocked up staggering increases in their profits over the first three quarters.
At the same time, unemployment is rising.
There are more and more debates on the introduction of longer working hours in various different forms.
Employees are expected to practise wage restraint, which effectively amounts to a drop in real incomes.
Welfare benefits are being cut or recipientsâ contributions drastically increased, and schemes based on solidarity are increasingly being shunted towards dependence on private funding.
These actions are weakening demand instead of strengthening it. We regard this as a pernicious trend.
Of course we need competition, but it must be compatible with the Gothenburg criteria, so as to minimise unemployment, maximise consumer protection and guarantee social security within a healthy environment, and so as to achieve social cohesion through solidarity and sustainable development.
Accordingly, we must make the following pleas to the Commission: abandon your neo-liberal economic policies and scrap your directives on service provision in the single market as well as the Working Time Directive and present replacements in the form of directives on improved health and safety at work or on the harmonisation of welfare standards.
Protect small and medium-sized enterprises by using the directives adopted by the last Parliament, such as the directive on software patents, as the basis for a new proposal.
Together with the Council, amend the Stability Pact to make expenditure on education and training count as investment, thereby eliminating it from the calculation of the debt ratio.
Strive for democratic and socially just world trade by trying to reform the WTO, and do not go to Hong Kong with the same ideas that the old Commission took to CancÃºn.
Do not argue for more effective military options, but only for peaceful solutions.
Campaign for better protection of the environment, and remember that there is certainly still work to be done here in the European Union in fields such as biodiversity, the avoidance and recycling of waste and the sustainable use of resources.
Exert more influence in the struggle to protect the global climate, because not only the United States but also China, India and Brazil must be motivated to commit themselves more firmly to this effort.
This would be the right course for the European Union; it would promote sustainable development and create jobs.
It is wrong to perpetuate and even intensify the pursuit of the old roads to nowhere that have long been discredited.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to bid Mr Barroso good evening, but oh dear, oh dear!
Here we go again!
This legislative programme has been shaped largely by the annual policy strategy, which was published by the last Commission in February 2004.
The European Commission is the unelected government of the EU, but what other government anywhere in the world would have its legislative programme set out by its predecessor?
The UK Independence Party has complained before that the Commission is unaccountable, but this demonstrates just how undemocratic things are.
We will be lumbered with policies framed by people who are not even in office any more!
On 26 January Mr Barroso spoke to Parliament in Brussels about this programme, but Mr Prodi and his team put it together.
The new Commission's central policy objective is economic growth.
This was also the central objective of the old Commission's document, drawn up last February.
Indeed, Mr Prodi made it one of his key objectives when he first came to office in 1999.
A fat lot of good it did, as EU growth is lower now than it was then.
Fortunately for Mr Prodi, he is safely back in Rome and is no longer answerable for his failures.
The document states that, due to the institutional changeover in 2004, a lighter procedure than usual was adopted for the European Parliament to consider the policy strategy.
That procedure was concluded last April â in other words, even before the election of the present European Parliament.
We all know this is a phoney parliament, but this demonstrates just how pointless it is.
Europhiles have been complaining that the British people will not be properly informed about the EU Constitution.
The Spaniards have just voted on the Constitution, but the fact is that 90% of Spaniards â whom the Europhiles think were well informed about the Constitution â told Spain's state polling organisation that they had little or no knowledge of it, and less than half of them bothered to vote.
What the citizens of Europe should be informed about is not the impenetrable Constitution, but the mountain of EU legislation which will pass through the EU's institutions this year â legislation dreamt up by a defunct Commission and approved by an expired Parliament, both of whom are no longer accountable to the people this programme will affect.
However, the citizens of Europe â especially those in Britain â are waking up to what is going on.
Soon, not only will the last Commission and the last Parliament be defunct and expired, but so will the whole EU project â and the sooner the better!
Â Â  . Madam President, the key challenge facing the European Union at this time is an economic one.
The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU governments are going to have to work together closely if the objectives of the Lisbon strategy are to be met.
This will not be an easy task â we must not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead of us.
One of the issues that must be looked at most carefully relates to the regulatory framework in Europe â we need less regulation in Europe, not more.
This was outlined very clearly in a report in today's on a study by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, which stated clearly that most people involved in banking and financial services believe that we have far too much regulation and that we need to tackle it so that business can become more competitive.
The key priorities for the European Union at this time include: the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU, which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector.
The European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry.
The European Union operates under a system known as IAS, which is the International Accountancy Standards system. Meanwhile, the American business community operates under the GAAP accountancy structure.
This year, 8Â 000 companies will be listed on European stock exchanges, operating under the IAS system.
It is simply wrong that America and Europe operate under two different accountancy models.
A greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues.
The European Union must implement the new Services Directive.
It must guarantee that the benefits of all technologies are available to communities in Europe, both urban and rural.
Mr Barroso, your recent statements on the Lisbon strategy and the economic way forward for Europe have been very positive, and I wish you well.
I hope that you are successful â Europe needs you to be successful.
Â Â  Mr President, this programme offers real hope for the revitalisation and refocusing of the Lisbon Agenda.
However, as we approach the Spring Council next month, it is vital that national governments get a grip and push ahead with the economic reforms that are vital to the future prosperity envisaged in the programme.
In recent weeks, I have been impressed by the statements by the President of the Commission and his clear aim of putting growth and prosperity at the heart of his strategy for the period ahead.
Similarly, I am unimpressed by the rantings of Socialists, like Mr Schulz, on refocusing priorities within the Lisbon process.
The left in Europe remain wedded to the old ways of inflexible labour markets, high non-wage labour costs and other barriers to growth.
Can they not see that it is precisely because of the old social model that Europe is today in relative economic decline?
Can they not understand that the high unemployment in so many parts of Europe is caused by the very outmoded proposals that they cling on to in economic terms?
Nothing Mr Schulz has just said would help any of the five million presently unemployed in his country.
Therefore we continue to urge the Commission President to keep up the pace on reform, and we urge the governments to take heed of the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Agenda in the first five years.
We want to see a renewed commitment to the completion of the single market.
Mr Barroso sensibly understands that many remedies for the lack of economic dynamism lie in the hands of Member States themselves.
However, in addition to the lead he has taken, I would encourage him to put real effort into reducing the legislative output from the Commission itself.
The Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be.
He rightly talks about better regulation, but the priority must be less regulation and, crucially, that legislation must be subject to full impact assessment.
British Conservative MEPs have been at the forefront of campaigning for less regulation and enforcing such impact assessments.
I look forward to, and am confident that I will see, some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive, which I am so pleased he supports.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that you in the Commission and we in Parliament â or at least the vast majority of Members of this House â want to win hearts and minds for the project of European integration.
If that is what we want, we must offer citizens real substance, and explain the importance of that substance.
In our view, a social Europe should be the priority. In order to achieve a social Europe, however, we need jobs.
For jobs we need growth, and for growth we need both investment and, first and foremost, education, training and lifelong learning, and â yes, MrÂ Kirkhope â we need greater flexibility too.
Anyone calling for flexibility, however, must know that flexibility and social security are not mutually exclusive; as the Nordic model has shown, the public is in fact willing to accept a greater degree of flexibility if a social safety net is in place and if there are also, for example, extensive opportunities for further training to enable people to cope with the implications of this flexibility, including its social implications.
We also need effective public services.
Your statement, MrÂ President, did not entirely satisfy me, because the question of services cannot be reduced to market economics.
Our public services are part of our own identity; whether they be postal services or local transport, they are part of the European identity, which the people of Europe rightly want to see defended.
This is therefore not a purely economic matter, but a profoundly emotive issue too.
One final point: what Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m did very recently with regard to the rights of air passengers was a very positive step, in my opinion.
The fact is that we must go public and tell people what we have achieved in this Parliament, including our responses to proposals from the Commission.
We must tell them that we are here for them, which is why I ask you not to approach legislative measures from an exclusively technical perspective as a means of creating better regulations, but always to think of the people for whom we make these laws and to whom we wish to communicate them.
If the Commission and the European Parliament can pursue this approach together in future, we shall win many, many hearts and minds for this European Union of ours.
Â Â  Madam President, I believe the President-in-Office of the Council has already made the point that this is a good day.
We have now seen the results from Spain, which put us all in a better position, not only as regards the referendum campaign but also by making it clear that a great nation has decided by a large majority in favour of this political project.
We also have something to show tomorrow, when you see President Bush.
It has become clear to all of us â and this must be reflected in our policies â that only joint action makes us a significant factor, and this action pays off, because I can find no other explanation for Condoleezza Riceâs comment that the European Constitution should be adopted.
US policy, indeed, is sounding an entirely new note here.
Allow me also to express my thanks to you, President Barroso, for your own particular role in enabling the President of this House to take part in tomorrowâs meeting.
I should like to refer to another related point, namely our neighbourhood policy.
I do not believe we have made enough progress in this direction, and President Yushchenko will be here in Parliament on Wednesday so that we can seek a new way to address the formidable challenge of cementing democracy in Eastern Europe, so that closer links can be forged between Eastern Europe and the European Union.
This implies an urgent need for something more than the neighbourhood policy, because the alternative is increased pressure to narrow the focus of discussions prematurely onto full membership, which we could not deliver immediately, because it would overstretch the integrative capacity of the European Union.
We must offer a vision to the people of these countries, and so it is certainly worth considering whether there should perhaps be another option besides full membership, an option that does not close the door on full membership but holds out that prospect as a long-term goal.
At the same time, such an option can bring immediate gains, as happened in the past with the European Economic Area, from which Austria, Finland and Sweden entered the European Union.
I ask the Commission to give this serious thought, because I fear that we shall otherwise become embroiled very soon in a difficult situation.
It has been made very clear this afternoon that we are providing these countries, which were victims not only of the Second World War but also of the dictatorship that followed it, with a prospect that enables them to build democracy while strengthening this European Union of ours without impairing its ability to act.
Â Â  MrÂ President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a few personal observations on the Commissionâs Work Programme.
This is a splendid inventory of the kind once drawn up by the poet Jacques PrÃ©vert, but it reminds one of what Wim Kok used to say about the Lisbon Process, âLisbon is about everything and thus about nothingâ.
The Commissionâs Work Programme is a rather similar case, where one cannot see the wood for the trees.
Each Commissioner has done his or her best to decorate their own Christmas tree by hanging a few bits of tinsel of their own upon it.
I am not criticising you, MrÂ President.
If you had confined yourself to what was essential, the Members of this House would have been the first to say that you had forgotten this or that issue they considered more important.
Nonetheless, I would ask you to devote your energies to what is essential.
Europe must defend its social and environmental models.
We all agree that Europe must carry out reforms and be more flexible in certain areas.
You will not, however, win the support of Europeans by voting in favour of what the right is preparing to vote in favour of tomorrow when I present my report, that is to say less tax for the rich and more labour for the workers.
That will not work.
In its 2005 annual report, the Economic Policy Committee said that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework supportive of stability and growth and that such a framework is indispensable, but that governments will reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of growth and employment only in an appropriate macroeconomic environment.
We have stability, MrÂ Barroso; what we now need is growth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr President of the Commission, as we know, it is the Commissionâs legislative programme that enables us to translate the Councilâs political priorities into practical actions.
We are therefore pleased to note that priority has been given to the implementation of European legislation, but we want firm commitments for future years.
The strengthening of security in Europe does indeed remain a priority, yet it must not on any account be strengthened at the expense of civil liberties.
The proposals that have been put forward on improving the exchange of information and strengthening operational cooperation are a step forward in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but Europeansâ feelings of insecurity, which we acknowledge, must above all be combated through an active policy of protecting and promoting fundamental rights.
That is how our democracies must defend themselves, and that is how they will win the day.
We want initiatives to be taken with a view to combating racism, xenophobia and forms of discrimination.
The strengthening of judicial cooperation remains one of the priority measures to be taken in order to ensure that Europeans have the same rights and the same access to justice everywhere in Europe.
We therefore welcome plans to extend judicial cooperation to include certain aspects of family law.
We call upon the Commission to maintain this commitment and to present proposals based on the principle of mutual recognition in the areas of the evaluation and use of evidence and procedural guarantees.
We wish to see a fairer approach adopted to asylum and immigration issues, namely one that will above all enable rights to be respected and burdens and responsibilities to be shared.
We want to see legal immigration channels opened whereby migrantsâ basic needs and rights are respected.
Finally, we ask that significant progress be made on the matter of defining minimum standards for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a brief comment on the political content of the speeches we have heard today, particularly that by MrÂ Schulz.
I believe â and our current debate on the Lisbon strategy bears this out â that the Lisbon strategy has several pillars.
There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are, in principle, equally important components of the strategy.
On the other hand, it is a truism that proper social and environmental policies cannot be pursued without a functioning economy.
The economy is, as it were, the key to the realisation of all our other good political intentions.
Priorities must therefore be set accordingly, although the pillar structure must not be forgotten.
I should perhaps mention in passing that there is no better social policy than the creation of jobs.
That may be another truism, but it still needs to be said.
Another gentle reminder might be in order, because the President of the Commission is constantly being taken to task over this matter.
Both of the competent Vice-Presidents of the European Commission â the one who signed the paper in Lisbon and the one who signed the programme we are discussing today â are Socialists.
It is perhaps appropriate to reiterate that in passing.
This should mean that the dossier is in the best hands within the Commission, and I fail to see the point of forever dredging up this discussion on alleged differences that do not even exist.
I also have a particular appeal to make in this matter, which is that the Commission must attach high priority in the framework of this legislative programme, as in other areas, to the implementation of its interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament.
This is vitally important.
Among the reasons why things have not worked as well as they should in the past have been the lack of impact assessments of legislative proposals and the inadequate way in which the consultation of stakeholders has been conducted.
I urge the President and Vice-President of the Commission, particularly in the course of their work over the coming months, to ensure that the interinstitutional agreement is consistently implemented in this context.
In many areas, this will be the key to the success to which they and all of us aspire.
Â Â  Madam President, may I say to Mr Barroso that he devoted his speech today to three splendid aims: prosperity, solidarity and security.
That naturally arouses great expectations among us Members, and I have to say, MrÂ Barroso, that my reaction was similar to that of MrÂ Swoboda, for what you went on to say about the directive on services under these headings actually turned out to be rather insubstantial.
If you really want us to achieve prosperity, solidarity and security for our citizens, you will have to deal a great deal more thoroughly with this directive on services than you seemed to indicate today.
If you are serious about your partnership with us, and indeed with all the institutions, you will have to go much further yet.
Moreover, we must not forget something that is even more important, MrÂ Barroso, and that is our partnership with the people of the European Union, with all of its 450 million inhabitants.
It is for them, and for no one else, that we make our policies.
Â Â  â In recent weeks, the Commission has taken decisions on two key themes: the strategic guidelines for its mandate and the reform of the Lisbon Strategy.
Both decisions emphasise the fact that the highest priorities for the EU, in the current circumstances, are reinvigorating economic growth and creating jobs.
Frankly, I do not understand the argument over which comes first, economic growth or jobs.
For me it is simple.
Jobs are created in companies.
Well, companies only grow and develop when there is a climate of confidence and a widespread desire to create an investment-friendly atmosphere.
This approach to life, this culture, will become a reality if the capacity is there to carry out the right economic policies.
The greater the commitment among the Member States to implement the necessary reforms, the more quickly such a culture can be introduced.
That is the only way in which we can maintain, and indeed develop, the European social model.
Economic dynamism must not be seen as the enemy of social protection; it is, in fact, its staunchest ally.
I have a different concern, however, which relates to the definition of priorities and the clear allocation of responsibilities.
It was precisely because of the absence of these elements that reform of the Lisbon Strategy was needed.
It is now the duty of the Member States to display the reforming spirit proposed by the Commission through practical political action.
There is a pressing need to carry out reforms, which, for the most part, are not popular with the public, but which Europe needs.
These reforms will only succeed if they are explained, exhaustively if necessary.
That is the only way in which they will be understood and accepted.
I shall finish by saying that, to my mind, it is worthwhile looking into the benefits of escaping from the office environment and going out onto the street, and, as Members of the European Parliament, we should be the first to do this.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we should welcome the fact that the European Commission intends to focus its efforts on three issues, namely economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection.
Only time will tell, however, whether and how these laudable plans will actually be put into practice.
Any kind of imbalance, in particular one favouring economic growth at the expense of social welfare and environmental protection, would pose a threat to Europe and its citizens, and in particular to the citizens of the new Member States.
Yet the European Commission is also the guardian of the Treaties, and as such it monitors the Member Statesâ application of legislation.
I would therefore call on the Commission to monitor such application on a regular basis, in particular with regard to compliance with the principle of non-discrimination.
This principle, the implementation of which is mandatory, has already given rise to concerns relating to the provisions of the REACH Regulation and the services directive.
Is the European Commission not worried that attempts to exclude building services from this directive will be viewed as discriminatory by the new Member States?
There are other examples of such practices, and I would therefore call on MrÂ Barroso to ensure that the Commission monitors the application of legislation very closely as far as the principle of non-discrimination is concerned.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to this debate, I cannot but repeat that we need to think more like Europeans and stop engaging in national and party politics.
We need more optimism and confidence, more serious intent, more clarity and scrutiny and the political will to honour the pledges we make from our soap boxes.
We need more leadership â more leadership from political circles, more leadership from those in government and more leadership from the Commission.
I should also like to appeal to everyone here to reflect a little.
All of us are here to make the four freedoms a reality in law and in fact, and everything that serves this purpose is good politics.
We must reflect on what we have enshrined in the Constitution.
I really do not understand why we are arguing about these things today.
In the Constitution, we proclaim the principle of a social market economy.
In so doing, we are clearly stating that the market is not an end in itself but a means to an end, that we need an efficient market which fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities.
We have set ourselves the aim of full employment, and we have set ourselves the aim of sustainability.
Why do we keep conveying the impression to the general public that we are playing off these aims against each other?
We do not need any more short-sighted populism; what we want is greater responsibility for the future.
May I therefore make this request to the President of the Commission: apply a subsidiarity test before the presentation of proposals.
Explain to the public what there is to be gained by legislating at EU level.
Define the benefits in terms of growth, competition and employment.
Define the target group.
Define clearly the motives, aims and effects and say who has to do what by when, so that we can exercise our parliamentary right of scrutiny.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
The Commission has drawn up an extensive and ambitious programme.
It has drawn up priority tasks which I agree with and support.
I am also pleased by the ambition, energy and of course the enthusiasm of the Commission President.
Yet if we want Europe to be effective, if we want Europe to be closer to its citizens and if we wish to achieve the objectives, then we must act much more effectively than hitherto ourselves.
An important part of the European Unionâs effectiveness is its administrative systems, its public administration.
You mention them in the strategic objectives on page four, Mr President.
This is very pleasing.
Yet at the same time I recall that the Prodi Commission began the reform of public administration in the European Union. Former Commissioner Kinnock was responsible for this.
While I am unaware of how the whole thing ended, if indeed it was ever started, the fact remains that the citizens of the European Union see this as a great bureaucratic apparatus, removed from the people, an apparatus which costs a great deal and which requires an extremely large amount of administration for every trifling thing, not to mention major projects.
So all of us together, not just those of us here in the European Parliament, but also our electorates, justifiably expect the new Commission to find, within the framework of the priority tasks you have set out, the energy, time and will to deal with its own administrative system, with its own bureaucracy.
In this regard I anticipate very clear answers.
And one more thing! Good legislation is fine, but what is more important is that we actually put good legislation into practice.
Thank you very much!
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my comments will be addressed primarily to MrÂ Schulz.
MrÂ Schulz, following our conversation about the resolution on Auschwitz, you have completely altered your views and have thereby won my utmost respect.
Thank you.
Now, however, I should like to respond to your critical comments regarding the Pope.
Â Ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the matter of the budget and the funding earmarked for the meeting of young people with the Pope in Cologne, I should like to make it clear that if anyone else managed to bring together so many young people for a good cause, I would certainly vote in favour of providing funding for the meeting.
I would do so whether the person in question was MrÂ Schulz or the chairman of any group or party, and I would do so regardless of whether that person was a Socialist, a Green, a Catholic or an adherent of any other political movement or religion.
If the event concerned promoted social and psychological unity and the creation of a common Europe, then it would deserve genuine respect.
I believe that MrÂ Schulz will acknowledge that this is the case, and indeed I can see him nodding in agreement.
I should like to thank him for that.
I should also like to remind Members from the ten new Member States, and not only those from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but also those who are Socialists, Greens, Communists or non-attached Members, that it is thanks to the Pope and his actions that we are able to discuss a common Europe together today.
If it were not for him, we would still be unable to hold such a meeting, and I should like to remind MrÂ Schulz that this was mainly the Popeâs doing, and that MrÂ KovÃ¡cs only played a small part at most.
If Members are not aware of this fact, or have forgotten it, I should like to remind them most strongly of it, and encourage them to vote in favour of this grant, which will allow the meeting to be held in an appropriate fashion and ensure it will be a great success.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to congratulate Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, on the legislative programme of the Commission and on the programme he has presented.
Europe today has grown to consist of 25 Member States, and I am one of those Members who come from one of the countries most recently added to it by enlargement.
Europe is what it rightly should be; a Europe with a significant voice in global decision-making processes, and we must maintain this role by continuing to reinforce the foundations once laid by Schuman, De Gasperi and Monnet, based on principles that have enabled the European Union to come as far as it has today.
The work that the European Union performs must constantly reflect the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity.
It is vitally important that economic growth be equally spread around all European regions.
Europe is obliged to help those who for some reason have lagged behind to catch up and expand their economies.
A strong economy can be created by closer cooperation between the Member States, and this is where I would like to congratulate the Commission on the implementation of a new economic strategy that aims to create over six million jobs.
The Lisbon Strategy must be an absolute priority for all of us who work in the European institutions.
We must be able to translate this strategy into work and prosperity, a goal that can be achieved only if we manage to eliminate excess bureaucracy and create a strong business environment.
We in this House must encourage initiatives that will create work across our continent.
Europeâs citizens expect us to improve Europeâs standard of living, and so we must do our best.
The legislative and work programme that was presented gives a clear indication of the Commissionâs vision for the coming years and, if it cooperates closely with Parliament, I think we can translate this new programme into benefits for all European citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I will try to reply to some specific questions and then I would like to deal with a more general issue of policy, which I believe to be important in terms of our future work.
With regard to the specific issues, first of all, MrÂ Duff, you told me that you had not properly understood, or not appreciated, a comment apparently attributed to me concerning naÃ¯ve federalism.
I would very much like to clarify what I said, because it may not have been clear in the context.
When I criticise naÃ¯ve federalism, it is not in fact federalism itself that I am criticising; quite the opposite.
I have great respect for all the federalists, all the men and women who founded our great European project.
I still believe, moreover, that the federal method is essential to this Europe of ours.
Furthermore, the community method, or at least the method we generally describe as such, is a kind of federal method.
So, in reality, I criticised naÃ¯ve federalism as contrasted with what I might consider to be a more sophisticated and more intelligent form of federalism, that is to say, an approach that does not seek to build our European Union â an increasingly close union between all Europeans, at the expense of the legitimacy of the democratic states.
Our countries are, in fact, democratic states with democratic governments and democratic parliaments.
I have had the honour of working in Geneva with a great federalist, Denis de Rougemont, who sometimes blamed the state for all evils, as if the state were not also a democratic institution.
I am in favour of an increasingly strong Union, but that strengthening should not jeopardise the legitimacy of the democratic states.
I very much wish to offer that clarification because I have heard criticisms of my comment, which gave a distorted view of my thoughts and feelings on the subject of Europe.
The second issue relates to security and justice.
We have talked a lot about the economy, but we must not forget that we have a programme â and a very ambitious one at that â in the field of security and justice â a programme that will be implemented by Vice-President Frattini.
That, specifically, was the subject of one of the questions raised.
Security, justice and the protection of fundamental rights will be one of the Commission's priorities.
We need to offer a practical response to peopleâs demands in terms of security.
That is why, in 2005, we are, in particular, going to present Parliament with the action plan aimed at implementing the strategy adopted in The Hague, in the form of proposals concerning the protection of the victims of organised crime, women and children in particular.
I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a new dimension to the action described in our programme: placing more emphasis on the protection of children.
We believe â and I also very much want to stress this â that this is a field in which it is possible to strengthen action at European level.
Proposals can thus be presented with a view to strengthening mutual recognition and trust between the judicial authorities, and a proposal concerning a European strategy in relation to legal immigration and to the fight against people traffickers can be drawn up.
Security, justice and the protection of human rights are a genuine priority, and I would like you to know that the Commission is going to do everything possible to respond to those demands.
Certain Members, including MrÂ Karas, MrÂ Kirkhope, and MrÂ Lehne, and also MrÂ Goebbels to a certain degree, have raised the issue of how to focus legislation and of whether it should be strengthened or restricted.
I am delighted, moreover, that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are fully aware of this concern.
When I talk about âbetter legislationâ, I do not always mean that we need less legislation.
In certain cases, precisely because we are a Union, we need a degree of harmonisation or more legislation, sometimes in order to harmonise or simplify the existing legislation.
I would, however, like to stress that we do share this concern about the quality of legislation, and we have introduced it into our programme.
Throughout all of the action we take, we shall, therefore, be weighing up the factors of cost, proportionality and subsidiarity that we shall be using for the purposes of impact assessment.
This is why â and I say this partly in response to MrÂ Goebbels â we have of course had to draw up a list of our main objectives.
This is an implementation programme for this year.
You would no doubt criticise us if I only presented four or five priorities.
The political line is one dimension and, in this regard, we are talking about very clear and well-focussed priorities, defined when we presented the strategic objectives.
The specific, legislative and implementation programme is another dimension, and one of which you should be aware so that you can monitor our activities, the Commission being answerable to this Parliament.
With regard to another specific question, namely climate change, I would like very much to say to Mrs Beer, who I am sure will put this question to President Bush tomorrow, that one of the subjects on our agenda is the possibility of cooperation with the Americans, partly in a post-Kyoto spirit.
That is a sensitive subject.
We are aware of the positions taken by the American administration to date, but I believe we should embark upon a dialogue on this issue with the United States of America.
I shall probably have the opportunity to raise this issue with the President of the United States.
With regard, now, to the issue of the Directive on Services, I would very much like to say, in response specifically to MrÂ Swoboda, that I agree with your concerns about services of general interest.
I have already said this on many occasions: services of general interest, or certain public services, are part of what might be called the tradition, or organisational culture, of certain states.
We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account, since we believe them to be legitimate.
That is why my Commission has taken the initiative to review certain aspects of the Directive on Services, and I was expecting a word of congratulation from yourselves.
It is exactly the opposite that I hear from you when you describe this Commission as neoliberal even though it was not this Commission that presented the directive in question.
In fact, we are seeking a balance while maintaining the objective, which is to create a genuine internal market in services, since that is essential to the creation of jobs in Europe.
This is an objective we cannot abandon and on which, furthermore, there is consensus until 2010, but it must be pursued in a balanced manner.
That is the fundamental political question I would like to put to our friends in the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, and in particular to MrÂ Schultz, who raised this question.
You must choose: either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it.
I have already said that the Commission wants to work in a spirit of cooperation and constructive rapport with Parliament and, in particular, with all those Members who truly want to move Europe forward. This is no neoliberal proposal on our part.
The proposals I have put forward in this House are the result of a consensus.
The Commission includes Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals.
The Lisbon Agenda was presented to the Commission by myself and Vice-President Verheugen, who is a member of your political grouping.
The programme I have just presented today has been presented by myself and Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, who is also a member of your political grouping.
We do not want to engage in dogmatism; we want to unite those Europeans who want reforms for Europe, but we do not want to abandon the reforms.
If it has been possible for the Commission to take all these decisions unanimously, although there may have been expressed differences; if Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Independents have reached a consensus, why might we not also achieve that here in the European Parliament and unite around an ambitious programme of reform for this Europe of ours, which takes account of social and environmental concerns?
Do not present a caricature of our Commission. That is not fair.
If you look at the list of our objectives, you will find that it contains a series of specific proposals in the social and environmental fields.
We are well aware that, today, it is impossible to create growth without an environmental dimension.
On the contrary, we believe that the environment contributes to growth and increased competitiveness in Europe.
We agree on this point, so please do not see obstacles where there are, in fact, none.
What we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today, that Europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model.
That is why the Commission has a President who wants reform, but also Socialist, Liberal, Christian Democrat and Independent members who all also want this reform to be carried out in a spirit of balance and proportion.
I would therefore like to ask the PSE Group not to set itself up in opposition to the Commission: on the contrary, I would ask it to cooperate, though not in an uncritical way, with us, just as all the other groups do.
Mrs GrossetÃªte, who is a member of the largest political grouping in the European Parliament, has also expressed to us certain demands and requirements, and I thank her for that.
I would now like to draw your attention, as fellow Europeans, to the fact that this is not just any moment in the history of Europe.
Yesterday, we learned the result of the referendum in Spain, and we are delighted about this, but we shall also have a referendum in France.
We shall have a referendum in the United Kingdom; I talked about it today with Prime Minister Blair in London.
What do you believe Europeans expect now?
They want the institutions to work together; they do not have a very good understanding of the fine details of the debate or of the policies of the political groups.
They want to know whether the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council are working along the same lines and whether or not they are genuinely concerned about their problems.
I believe it would be highly inappropriate, at a time like this when very important referendums are taking place, for people to look at Europe and see, on the one hand, the Commission and, on the other, a number of large groups such as your great European Socialist grouping, and thus to be presented with an image of division.
I have already addressed this very sincere appeal to some of you personally and I would like to repeat it.
We should not abandon our ideas, of course, since we are all very attached to them, but it is possible to look beyond these ideas and reach a dynamic consensus in favour of the reforms Europe needs.
I believe that this is genuinely possible.
The last issue relates to the criticism you expressed, MrÂ Schultz, of the statement I made about my country.
As, moreover, you acknowledged, I did not, where this matter was concerned, fail to honour any obligation, because the Commission's code of conduct clearly allows Commissioners to be active members of political parties and unions.
There was therefore no failure to honour obligations.
All I did was express my solidarity with the party of which I was President for several years.
What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet!
I would therefore thank you for not putting the question in the form of an attack against me personally for the position I took, because it was perfectly permissible for me to take that position.
You raised the possibility of the code of conductâs being revised in terms of the interinstitutional agreement.
I would very much like to say that I am completely opposed to this idea, since our code of conduct stipulates that the members of the Commission may participate in an election campaign if they request authorisation to do so from the President of the Commission.
The question you raised is therefore about what happens in the case of the President of the Commission.
I must state that if the President of the Commission has the power to decide whether or not Commissioners can participate, then he also has that power in relation to himself.
This is clearly laid down in the Treaty, Article 217 of which states, and I shall read it in English:
The members of the Commission shall carry out duties devolved upon them by the President under his authority.
The Treaty therefore clearly establishes the principle of the President's political leadership of the College and the principle of the President's authority.
So to accept, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a reduction in the authority of the President would be contrary to the Treaty as it stands, and to weaken the President of the Commission's authority would mean weakening the authority of the Commission itself.
We need a strong Commission.
That is why I believe that your proposal is not a good one.
I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, must strengthen each other on a mutual basis.
We are the European institutions . We can do extraordinary things together, and we must therefore enhance each otherâs status.
Personally, I try to enhance the status of the European Parliament in all my public statements, and not just in my statements.
I would expect you to do the same, since we have great challenges to face together, and together we can win the day.
However, we cannot do so by reducing the importance of the Commission and by asking the Commissioners to be civil servants. Instead, we must ask them to assume their political responsibilities, to exercise their citizenship and to express their preferences, always while working in a European spirit of course.
As a citizen, I have the right to express my point of view about my own country. I have the right, like all European citizens, to vote in accordance with my opinions.
As President of the Commission, I will not discriminate.
In fact, at your request, I received the leader of the opposition, who will become the Prime Minister of my country.
I received him a few days before the beginning of the election campaign, because, as President of the Commission, I do not use my post to oppose any particular government and I do not distinguish between governments of the left and of the right.
In fact, I believe that the Commission should represent the general European interest.
Having said that, the members of the Commission are political men and women.
Perhaps some Members of this House do not like that.
As citizens, we have rights, however. We have the right to express ourselves, and that is a fundamental right.
That is why I do not accept your criticism in this regard.
I would like to point out that we all need strong European institutions. This institution â the Commission â must be strong and must work with a strong Parliament, firmly committed to change and reforms and with the sense of balance that is at the heart of our Europe.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate pursuant to RuleÂ 103 of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum.
Â Â  . Mr President, perhaps I am breaching the working time directive this evening!
Over the coming years we will do much together that could help shape the world in which we live.
This is a unique chance to address a unique phenomenon.
Managing the impact of globalisation, both at home and across the world, represents an unprecedented challenge.
If we get it right, we can offer billions of people a decent chance in life, tackling extreme poverty, fighting disease and hunger, promoting good governance and supporting development and inclusion, with the structures and financial means to bring them about.
If we fail, we will sow the seeds of continuing injustice, division and instability.
That is why this Commission has proposed a programme which is as relevant to Europe as it is to our partners around the world.
It is designed to spread prosperity, strengthen solidarity and offer security.
We must offer an internal and an external response.
Inside the Union, we must boost cohesion and deliver the full potential of our recent and future enlargements.
Through our social agenda we must continue to fight exclusion and poverty; we must help more people find work in a dynamic and growing economy; and we must change attitudes and behaviour, supporting our goal of sustainable development by taking ambitious action.
Outside the Union, we must pursue the Millennium Development Goals with renewed energy and imagination.
Creating this fresh momentum is a key goal of our ongoing review of sustainable development, ensuring that our internal and external actions are better coordinated.
As Europeans, our shared values and experience can be a major force for improving the quality of life of billions of people around the globe.
Our unique model of cooperation is inspiring regional cooperation, for example the development of the African Union.
It ensures that our voice is listened to when it comes to reforming international institutions.
Last week, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force.
Kyoto is a good example of our ability to bring a European perspective to helping shape developments at a global level.
Kyoto and the Millennium Development Goals also highlight the dilemma we face.
We must deliver effective action at a global level, but we must also drum up wide support for our proposed action among countries and civil society.
That is the new reality of global governance that is taking shape.
It is defined as much by our formal gatherings in the WTO, the World Bank, the G8 as by the more informal settings provided by the World Social Forum or the World Economic Forum.
That is why I welcome our debate today.
Both Porto Alegre and Davos stand as symbols of one real benefit of globalisation: our ability to engage in continued dialogue at an international level with regard to the type of society we want.
This possibility is giving more people a voice in shaping our future.
While such meetings do not necessarily set a political agenda, they act as a sounding board for a broad spectrum of public opinion.
Let me elaborate on the events in Davos and Porto Alegre.
This year, I participated in the event at Davos; next year I hope the Commission will be able to join the 150Â 000 people attending the World Social Forum.
Fortunately, in Davos I was able to talk about PortoÂ Alegre in detail with President Lula of Brazil, a good friend of mine.
I have great respect for his vision and commitment to making globalisation work and reducing global disparities.
Our discussions gave me a sense of the mood in Porto Alegre.
One thing which struck me above all else is how the agenda of both gatherings are tending to converge.
Davos was not a hotbed of neo-liberalism, nor was Porto Alegre simply an anti-Davos demonstration.
Among other issues, the discussions focused on the fight against poverty, the situation in Africa, the role of trade and economic dynamism in spreading prosperity and opportunity, the need for a sustainable path for global development and the challenges of global security.
I could draw a number of lessons from what I heard.
First, we should not deny that, while the agenda are converging, the two audiences are looking at the issues involved from different angles.
Nevertheless, the representation of civil society is increasing in the World Economic Forum, and there is a broadening range of participants in the World Social Forum.
I took two key messages away with me from Davos.
First, we must act together to solve global problems ranging from poverty and development to climate change.
I was proud to see that European leaders such as Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard SchrÃ¶der were ready to set the pace.
They took the initiative to propose some important ideas.
Second, we need to light the flame of economic dynamism to stimulate reform around the world, not as a goal in itself, but as the best means of offering more people the chance of a decent life.
We can turn globalisation into an advantage.
European leadership is required to face the challenges arising from globalisation.
Finally, Europe can do a lot, but we can certainly achieve more if we are able to act together with other partners to address global challenges.
This is the message that I will pass on to President George Bush tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must find the means to ensure that the commitment of the participants in the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum bears fruit.
Europe must provide a link between the very different perceptions of the possible consequences of globalisation.
In this regard, I would like to respond in several ways.
First of all, the European Union is, and must remain, an ambitious player on the world stage.
It is the largest integrated market.
Its gross domestic product is the largest in the world and it is the world's top player in international trade.
We, the European Union, are the largest provider of international aid and, as the tsunami tragedy has demonstrated, we are prepared to show solidarity.
Thanks to the euro in particular, we are a key partner in the field of international financial relations.
We must use our network of bilateral relations to move things forward, to encourage change and to promote respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
Furthermore, if we acknowledge that we are a world player and that our ambition is to play a decisive role, we must champion an effective form of multilateralism.
We must continue to promote the development of a world order founded upon the rule of law, but that rule of law must not just serve the interests of the rich western countries.
We must demonstrate solidarity.
This is why we are expressing our commitment to the United Nations, our determination to seek creative international solutions in order to improve prospects in Africa âÂ as I have said, Africa will be our priorityÂ â and our desire to promote the quick completion of the Doha development round.
Finally, the European Union must mobilise a wide range of political instruments aimed at improving the fate of our neighbours in the world.
We must take the best advantage of the new possibilities offered to us by the Constitution thanks to the creation of the post of foreign affairs minister and of a European foreign action service.
We must, however, also focus our attention on the priorities and achieve concrete results.
These objectives will be reflected in the initiatives we take, such as reviewing the European Union's approaches to sustainable development and preparing the review of the Millennium development objectives.
They are objectives that already form an integral part of the European Union's partnership for growth and employment, which I launched at the beginning of this month.
I shall conclude now. The European Union is a world player.
We must accept that responsibility.
We must contribute actively to defining the new world order and enhance international governance founded upon the rule of law.
Europe has a very specific contribution to make.
We must strengthen the European Union as a civil power.
We must ensure that the ideas of peace and democracy and the principles of the market economy are disseminated throughout the world: the principles of open societies.
We have the instruments needed to make a real difference.
The European Union must, therefore, respond to the hopes placed in us both by our citizens and by our international partners, whether it be in Davos or in Porto Alegre.
Â Â  . Mr President, earlier we heard an excellent speech from the President of the Commission on how we need to work together and cooperate to make Europe the most competitive and economically prosperous entity on the globe.
We are facing challenges from China, India, Brazil and other countries.
We have heard a clarion call from the President asking us to throw out the old models and to create new ones in order to compete.
In that context I want to say that we agree that the World Economic Forum was a tremendous success, as global representatives from governments, businesses and civil society managed to agree on a coherent set of principles for action: matching global trade with sustainable development.
Many of these â such as concrete measures to liberalise trade and accelerate aid to the poorest countries â will be of great benefit in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in the World Economic Forum.
At this point, however, and less diplomatically than the President of the Commission, I must also make some remarks about the World Social Forum, which proved to be something of a disappointment by comparison.
Poverty reduction is the largest of the Millennium Development Goals and, as one main aim of the World Social Forum's participants, one would have expected the Forum to produce some concrete recommendations as to how this might be achieved.
Yet even journalists who were generally in favour of the World Social Forum had to admit that its basic objective was not to produce a unified document suggesting concrete ideas for fear of spoiling the diversity of opinions, and that the resulting proposals contain many contradictions.
We in the European Parliament respect diversity and want to hear the views of world social experts as part of our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
But, logically, we cannot do both simultaneously â one thing and its opposite.
I would, therefore, call for more unified proposals from the World Social Forum in the hope of achieving those goals more rapidly and without wasting further time.
In this regard I was also disappointed that, as the President of the Commission said, although we are the largest economy there were very few people from the European Parliament in the World Economic Forum.
Do the people who are arranging these matters consider that the elected representatives of the people of Europe are also important in the decision-making process of the World Economic Forum?
Â Â  Mr President, I would first of all like to say how delighted I am that a debate with the Commission, represented by yourself, Mr President of the Commission, can take place in this Parliament the day after the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum.
I believe that it is a sign of recognition by this House of the World Social Forum which, when it was created in 2001, was portrayed by many as an ineffective gathering for challenging globalisation.
In reality, social forums and the movements that promote them have revolutionised the debate on globalisation.
They have popularised many issues and positive proposals which are now debated in all international bodies including, increasingly, within the World Economic Forum in Davos.
When I say that, I am thinking about access to global public assets, the creation of global taxes, the cancellation of debt, the reform of the international financial institutions and the latterâs need for transparency.
I believe that one of the other important contributions of the social forums has been to root the challenge to liberal globalisation, to the economic and social injustices it creates and to its often destructive consequences for the ecological balance of the planet, not in the false belief that national or sovereigntist solutions had to be found, and not in a rejection of the very idea of globalisation, but in the view that globalisation and its rules and institutions must be transformed, in order to allow for a different kind of globalisation, a globalisation of solidarity, of democratic triumphs and of human rights, a globalisation that guarantees the right of all peoples to development, justice and peace.
For the European Union, this new world civil society is a source of support, because its aspirations coincide with objectives that the Union has established for itself at international level.
However, it is not enough to take pleasure in its emergence. Our policies and decisions should reflect its demands and its aspirations in practical ways.
So we must demonstrate that Europe can make a difference, as you have said.
We must demonstrate âÂ and we are doing so in certain fields, such as with the Kyoto Protocol, which you have mentionedÂ â that we really are able to transform international policies.
In the social field, as in other fields, such as those we have just been talking about, declarations of love are not enough; we also need demonstrations of love.
Today, 21 Member States have not yet fulfilled their promise to provide 0.7% of gross domestic product in development aid.
A global tax is today being discussed.
I am pleased about that, and many Member States have signed the New York declaration of SeptemberÂ 2004, but unfortunately the reticence of some nations is being used as an excuse not to take any decision.
I would, therefore, like to make the following proposal: that the Union, by means of the Commission, should help those Member States that wish to commit themselves by means, if necessary, of enhanced cooperation, so that they do not remain blocked by the reticence of some nations to implement, from now on, a tax dedicated to international development funding.
It could be used in the fight against AIDS, because a recent Council document indicates that, if nothing is done between now and 2010, a fifth of the active population in five of the developing countries most affected is going to disappear.
Take the initiative, Mr President of the Commission.
Show that Europe can indeed move on from statements to actions.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos was a resounding success.
The global elite from the business, political and academic communities made it clear that they are fully aware of their responsibility for the problems in the world and that they are willing to act.
Bono, the lead singer of the Irish band U2, summed this up very succinctly: if you want money and if you want help, he said, you must talk to those who can give money and provide help.
What makes the Davos meeting so important and so useful is that it brings these very people together.
The same cannot necessarily be said of the World Social Forum, and the outcome of the latter, I believe, is also far more open to criticism.
It may have surprised the critics to learn that the main topics in Davos were Africa, problems relating to the worldwide growth of poverty, how to shape the globalisation process in such a way that everyone derives some benefit from it and how to bring about fair world trade.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are convinced that free trade is the best development aid.
Free trade is what helps countries that want to develop, and free trade is also what motivates developing countries to become increasingly competitive.
The EU should lead the way here.
In particular, it should put free trade on the agenda, especially in areas where trade barriers still exist, namely areas covered by its agricultural policy.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are also vehemently opposed to the introduction of any global tax on financial transactions.
Making ourselves poorer in this way would not help the poor to become richer.
It is also illusory to believe that solidarity is fostered by introducing new taxes, in other words by imposing what is tantamount to a financial penalty on those who are actually supposed to help.
No, the real way to create solidarity is through a worldwide change in peopleâs perceptions and, quite simply, through willingness to adopt other measures of assistance.
We therefore support the priority given to the issue of debt cancellation and find it an eminently sensible course of action, and we believe that those countries which are moving towards democratisation and which are committed to the introduction of sustainable and free economies should be eligible for full debt cancellation.
Such forms of aid, however, will have no long-term impact if they are only one-off gestures.
For this reason, let me repeat that free trade is what both the developing and the developed countries need most and what will enable us to progress.
If we want world trade to be fairer, our foremost aim should be to make it freer.
Â Â  Mr President, it goes without saying that I agree with practically nothing the previous Member said and, like many Members of this House, I attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.
At this point, it is not a question of competing to see who is in the best position to combat poverty, but of seeing things as they are.
On the one hand, the World Social Forum was an enormous success this year â 155Â 000Â participants, 135Â countries; that is considerableÂ â and it has taken on a new tone since, on a certain number of issues â social, environmental, economic, financialÂ â many networks have continued to be put in place and have done extremely serious work, in an extremely concrete manner, in order, specifically, to produce a number of proposals which have yet to be developed, but which are very real.
On the other hand, the World Social Forum does not just consist of NGOs, it also includes parliamentarians â the Parliamentariansâ Forum â and local elected representatives, of which there were also many this year, who have discussed district and local authority policies in response to the challenges we are facing.
Very dynamic, enthusiastic and hard-working young people are also extremely well represented, and I do not believe we can casually sweep aside such dynamism and vitality.
In reality, the World Social Forum has two aims.
Firstly, to explain that free trade cannot provide a response to the increasing social inequalities.
They are not increasing because of a scourge which has merely come out of the blue, but rather because the policies being implemented over recent years in the fields of structural adjustment and of reducing public spending have led to increasing inequalities and poverty and to increased deterioration of the environment and of the planet as a whole.
The second aim is to propose an alternative to the current development model and reject the presentation of world free trade as a panacea and a miracle cure for everything.
It is clearly not these things.
All the bodies of the United Nations indicate that the situation is deteriorating today.
Finally, whether we are talking about Porto Alegre or Davos, what we need is practical action.
We must no longer be content with words, images and positions adopted.
We need very practical and precise commitments, a work plan.
Mr President of the Commission, that is something else we expect from you who are, together with the Commission â and with us all â in a position to take decisions: not just good intentions or Millennium objectives, but also extremely specific proposals.
Â Â  . I should like to start by saying that I am delighted that this debate is taking place, as it is one that I think is urgently needed.
Although there has been a great deal of empty talk â particularly on the part of MrÂ Barroso âit is fashionable nowadays to use impressive-sounding phrases while continuing to pursue the same policies as before.
This sort of behaviour is quite typical of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and, indeed, the phrase I would use to describe this Forum was coined by the well-known academic, Elmar Altvater; he described it as a big show, and, unfortunately, a rather unproductive one.
Yet it is interesting to note that there has been a change in the terminology used at the Forum and in the issues with which it deals.
It would be no exaggeration to say that it is increasingly the critics of the World Economic Forum who are setting its agenda; these critics met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, where 150Â 000 people held debates and protested against neo-liberal and neo-imperial policies.
The Social Forum movement is of crucial importance in terms of opposition to both globalisation and war.
The World Social Forum saw a large number of very pragmatic debates held on issues ranging from human rights for all â not only for people in Western countries â to the protection of public property, as well as debates held in protest at cuts in social services, in protest at the war, in protest at debt â with particular reference to the question of when the debts of the countries affected by the tsunami will finally be cancelled â and in protest at poverty.
Environmental issues also featured heavily on the agenda, and I took part in a forum on water, for example.
I should like to make it quite clear â and this is a point that must be stressed â that the participants of the World Social Forum levelled their criticism and protests not only at US policy, but also at the policies of the European Commission and the European Council.
By following a similar path to that of the United States â or in other words following in the wrong footsteps â the European Union is losing ever more credibility in these circles.
The participants of the World Social Forum did not wish to play the game that we see the European Council, the Commission and a great many Members of this House playing time and time again; looking askance at the USA whilst talking up their own policies.
Can something along the lines of the Bolkestein directive be a genuine alternative to US policies?
The answer to this must be ânoâ, as it is a neo-liberal programme.
Can it be a genuine alternative to enshrine, as has been done in the EU Constitutional Treaty, a commitment to armament or an open market economy with free competition?
The answer to this must also be ânoâ.
Mr Barroso, you said that the EU is a global player, but the key question that needs to be asked is what kind of a global player it is.
It must be made quite clear that free trade is not a foolproof way of reacting appropriately to the kind of policies that are currently being pursued.
Instead, real debt relief must be provided; there must be a move away from neo-liberal and economically liberal policies, and the whole process must not go hand in hand with the militarisation of the European Union.
I should like to close with a quote from a declaration adopted at the Forum, one that calls for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq and expresses support for all efforts to bring them home.
âWe support efforts to organise soldiers, conscientious objectors and military families against the war.
We support the counter-recruitment campaign and demand political asylum for deserters.â
The message could not be clearer.
Â Â  Mr President, globalisation would, in an ideal world, be the key to greater competitiveness, growth and improved living conditions.
It is not only in recent times, though, that reality has had a different tale to tell, and this makes it even more important that the World Economic Forum in Davos and the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre should examine, on a regular basis, the methods employed by globalisation and the effects resulting from it.
The recent World Social Forum drew up over 350 proposals on globalisation, although I hope that these will be pruned down so that we are left with fewer, but more meaningful recommendations.
If action is to be effective, principles must be thought through with crystalline clarity.
Three priorities were proposed by the World Economic Forum; the reduction of greenhouse gases, more money for the poorest countries and the abolition of trade barriers through the WTO.
What is missing from this list is corporate social responsibility, for which businesses themselves should be accountable.
It is not only the economic weight of businesses that matters, but also the extent of their social activities.
The turnover of the top multinational corporations is higher than the combined total of the budgets of the UN Member States.
It is safe to say that if Mr Ackermann of Deutsche Bank â a company that can certainly be considered a global player â had read this recommendation, he would not have announced a return on capital of 16% in the same breath as the loss of over 6Â 000 jobs.
Those affected by his âsmart sourcingâ method, view it as nothing but a combination of compulsive profit making and irresponsibility.
âSmart sourcingâ has every chance of becoming 2005âs least popular new phrase.
On a more positive note again, both the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum are important platforms for inspiring debates.
I therefore believe it to be necessary that both the President of the European Parliament and representatives from our specialist committees should participate in these forums in future.
More than ever before, global elites need representatives of the people.
Â Â  Mr President, I was dismayed by President Barroso's contribution at the end of the debate on the presidency's programme â particularly his defence of his intervention in Portuguese politics.
Mr Barroso, you are no longer a Portuguese politician: you are a European politician, selected by this Parliament and by the Council of all of the Member States to represent Europe.
You cannot intervene in domestic politics as a Portuguese politician; that is not acceptable.
Unless you understand that, you will weaken the Commission.
Criticism of that position will not weaken the Commission but your actions will.
That is not unrelated to the issue that we are currently discussing in connection with the World Social Forum.
An awful lot of people right round the world look to Europe as the only transnational, democratic institution that has the capacity to try to rein in the forces that they see destroying the world.
If you cannot see the role of the Commission as a body that can transcend national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum, then we are wasting our time here.
I appeal to you to bear in mind that you represent Europe, not Portugal.
To take the example of the Services Directive â you say that you are committed to the European social model.
We take your words at face value, but we will not accept them forever.
We need to have a concrete example of your commitment.
The only way, in my view, in which you can demonstrate your commitment is to extract the 'country of origin' principle, which directly attacks the European social model and which directly attacks the solidarity and approach to the development of a European single market.
I want a single market in services, but I will not accept the 'country of origin' principle, which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside Europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ Barroso for his speech before this House.
I do not want to go into detail, but I should like to focus on an issue that I believe to be of great significance, and perhaps even the greatest significance, in political terms.
Two fora have been held, an economic forum in the wealthy city of Davos, and a social forum in the poor city of Porto Alegre.
What is worrying is that not enough attention was paid to social issues at the economic forum, and that the âsocialâ forum is turning into a vehicle for questioning, and even challenging, the economic forum.
Two approaches are emerging in the search for solutions to modern-day problems.
The first of these involves looking for ways to develop the economy, whereas the second involves looking for ways to ensure social goals are attained, despite the fact that the two issues are intimately linked.
Discussing economic and social issues separately amounts to a grave misunderstanding.
I therefore believe that in future, instead of two global initiatives competing with each other, there should be a single economic and social world forum.
This is where the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament and the European Commission, can play a role by pushing for such a forum in the future.
I thank you for your attention.
Â Â  MrÂ President, President Barroso, if you have to contravene the Working Time Directives, you can comfort yourself with the thought that it is, in any case, with the best of intentions, namely that of discussing global justice and the role of civil society.
In Porto Alegre, I was one of 155Â 000 delegates from 135 countries.
At the same time, 20 Heads of State and 70 ministers met in Davos.
Was any listening done in Davos, however?
Perhaps from a theoretical European perspective it is possible to believe that free trade, capitalism and liberalisation constitute the solution to development problems.
The theory is not, however, consistent with the everyday lives of millions of people, and it is time that we began to adjust the theories to the reality, and not the other way around.
It is time that trade became a tool for human beings, and not vice versa.
We must stop demanding the liberalisation of water and other sensitive sectors in return for countriesâ being well treated.
President Barroso, when you meet President Bush and the EU Heads of Government, you can remind them of their 30 year-old promise to give 0.7% in aid.
That aid would not even be needed if more of the profits from production in the developing countries were to stay in those countries.
You are sincerely welcome to attend the next World Social Forum, to be held somewhere in Africa.
I can lend you a few fair-trade clothes made from environmentally friendly materials so that, one day, you can take part incognito, as an ordinary delegate, and genuinely experience the atmosphere there, without the interference of security guards.
It is precisely that joy and that spirit of cooperation, without hierarchical structures, which exist between everyone in the World Social Forum, that offer hope for the future.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an unfortunate fact that what both our first debate today and the one we are now holding have in common is that they appear to be dominated by confrontation rather than cooperation.
I would like to see the World Economic Forum and the World Social Forum merge, thus enabling us to talk to each other, rather than about each other.
Although you said, Mr President of the Commission, that the EU is a global player, I do believe that we have yet to become a global player rather than a global payer.
Tomorrow will be an important step in this process, and I wish you the best of luck in this respect.
The EU is needed, and it bears responsibility.
We share responsibility, while yet being reliant on others; we both shape events and are affected by them.
Our understanding of fundamental freedoms and human rights, our rejection of the death penalty, of child labour and of discrimination of any kind, our concept of what it means to be human; all these things know no borders, whether these be borders of countries or of continents, and it is in this sense that we also bear responsibility for what happens in the rest of the world.
The answer to globalisation must not come from Europe alone; what is needed is a debate on a model world order.
We need a global code of ethics and global principles of action, in spite of the fact that different cultures exist.
I therefore believe that we should speak up in favour of multilateralism, that we should support the initiative for a global Marshall Plan and that the EU should hold a UN conference, and that this House should call on churches throughout the world to convene an international ecumenical conference and to agree common principles of action.
I believe that the European model of an environmentally friendly social market economy could become a worldwide hallmark of the EU, and that this would allow us to help change the unfair rules that currently govern the global economy.
Â Â  Mr President, the World Social Forum was originally initiated as a counterpoint to the World Economic Forum in Davos with the intention of trying to force social issues onto the globalisation agenda.
At this, its fifth meeting, there are over 150 000 participants from 150 countries and, amongst the hundreds of meetings, representatives of the IMF and the World Bank face their critics for the first time.
These two institutions stand accused of imposing neo-conservative economic fundamentalism on the poorest countries in the world.
Aid carries with it the poison pill of conditionality that forces the opening of the markets to privatisation of state assets, and the straitjacket of monetarist policies.
This approach flies in the face of reality.
The challenge to them is to name a country with a weak economy that has opened up and succeeded in developing its economy.
The two latest much-lauded success stories are India and China, neither of which has followed their prescriptions.
Both protected their young, growing industries until they were capable of entering the global market.
But even India has its downside.
Its economy is booming but it is a pity about the poor.
In 2003, 11 000 new millionaires were created in India, while 8 million people were unemployed and 50 million lived on less than a dollar a day.
What is to be done?
In the next ten years 45 million children will die of poverty-related diseases, 12 million AIDS orphans will be produced in Africa, and 100 million children will remain totally illiterate.
The World Bank claims it is merely carrying out the wishes of the 147 states which own it â a verbal sleight of hand.
African countries do not impose conditionality on themselves, nor do the Latin-Americans.
It is the G8 industrialised countries that make decisions, often led by their own self-serving agenda.
Yet the fact that the IMF and the World Bank are now âtalking the talk, but not walking the walkâ suggests that pressure from civic society can have an impact.
The World Bank is including poverty reduction programmes in its plans, and is expressing concern about countries such as Tanzania which spend more on debt servicing than either health or education.
China and India can force these issues onto the agenda and the fact that the European Union has more votes in the IMF than the United States suggests that the World Social Forum slogan 'Another world is possible' is achievable: with sufficient willpower and political commitment.
It is for the NGOs and civic society to give Europe's politicians the necessary backbone.
Â Â  Mr President, whether gathered against the backdrop of the Swiss mountains or the Brazilian coast, I am convinced that all participants in the Davos and Porto Alegre conferences were united in the one goal of tackling poverty and economic development.
It is therefore particularly pleasing to see that in Davos and in Porto Alegre, the crucial importance of liberalising world trade was recognised.
Economic growth is the cornerstone of development in developing countries, whether we are dealing with climate change or guaranteeing good education.
It follows on from this that I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for the forthcoming Doha round to be a success, and the crucial role that the Commission and the Member States have to play in this.
Whoever is serious about aid to the developing countries should not be blind to what goes wrong at home.
Europeâs tariff barriers are, to my mind, an example of how things should not be done.
Alongside positive points, there are also a few negative points to be identified.
The pleas for extra tax on international financial transactions, the famous Tobin tax, strike me as eccentric, as does the extra tax for multinational companies.
I see no good in such measures.
They put the cart before the horse.
Those who strive towards freer world trade should not impose new rules at the same time.
Finally, I am surprised at those who promote unconditional debt cancellation for the developing countries.
My group finds it simply unacceptable that this should be done without conditions being imposed.
We believe that countries actively and successfully pursuing democracy and good governance should be able to count on support, but debt relief should not be granted without a commitment to that.
The liberal priorities are freer world trade and the emphasis on economic development.
That is the way to fight poverty and is, at the same time, the basis for an effective and affordable social safety net.
It also allows us to pursue a more environmentally-friendly policy as a result.
The question is: will we all go down together in apathetic solidarity, or will we opt for dynamism, innovation and progress?
I welcome the leadership of the Commission President to opt for the latter.
That, President Barroso, is a political role and we specifically want you to act politically.
I consider your position in the Portuguese elections to be very justifiable, and your absence would, moreover, have been construed as complete disloyalty to your Portuguese heritage.
I find your involvement very valid and I only regret that it did not benefit your Party more.
Â Â  Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I had the honour of participating in the meeting of the World Economic Forum as part of the Young Global Leaders programme.
I know that you, MrÂ Barroso, were âGlobal Leader of Tomorrowâ at one time, and now several Members of the European Parliament are involved in this programme for the young.
The Economic Forum was an excellent indication that world business wants to take responsibility for the global challenges facing us.
On the opening day of the Forum, an interactive Global Town Hall discussion was held.
This was a seminar in which 700 decision-makers at Davos set priorities for the worldâs problems using Gallup polls, and discussed the challenges they presented.
When we consider the age, sex, places of residence and range of occupations of the participants, the results are quite astonishing.
What, for example, would we imagine that men between the ages of 40 and 60, mainly from the EU or North America, and half of whom are business executives, think are the greatest challenges posed by globalisation?
Would they be profitability in business, flexibility in employment, increased turnover, or the China phenomenon?
Not at all.
The greatest challenges, as proposed by this group, were the elimination of poverty, the establishment of equitable globalisation and the management of climate change.
Global responsibility has progressed a great deal when leading businessmen say that to eliminate poverty people have to go beyond their normal way of thinking, extend the benefits of globalisation to the poorest regions and create global leadership to combat climate change.
It is also worth noting that there is genuine convergence between the views expressed in Europe and North America.
Globalisation does not appear in the end to be the sort of divisive factor that the left-hand side of this Chamber believes it to be.
These issues would be at the top of the agenda if the Friends of the Earth organised a similar meeting.
The World Economic Forum has also proposed concrete action and a timetable to respond to the challenges.
I am certain that there are also initiatives connected with the World Social Forum on which we have the same views.
As the objectives are common to both, it would be more sensible to aspire to them together rather than separately.
We give you in the Commission our full support in this.
Â Â  Mr President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, some of us were in Porto Alegre a few days ago, either as part of our national responsibilities or, in my opinion more importantly, as part of the World Parliamentary Forum.
I would therefore firstly like to thank my fellow Members who were in Porto Alegre, and in particular my colleague Harlem DÃ©sir, for the work they have done over many years to enable Europe to take part in this large-scale civic meeting.
Many commentators and participants shared the fear that this movement would run out of steam, but that has not been the case.
The anti-globalisation movement has been able to redirect its activities and to define a new organisational method that has resulted in the World Social Forum being no longer just a platform for demands but also a platform for proposals.
