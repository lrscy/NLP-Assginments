This element is an instrument to increase the level of knowledge and transparency of the market and furthermore the proposal insists that there must be no discrimination against producers of energy by means of cogeneration with regard to the conditions for connection to the network, nor with regard to the purchase and sale of electricity.
Furthermore, the States will have the right to prioritise electricity produced by means of cogeneration.
The sector - as the honourable Members know - has expressed on repeated occasions the need for these measures if this type of production is really to be properly developed.
The definitions of cogeneration, and in particular high-efficiency cogeneration, may appear very technical, but to adopt a common methodology is an important step forward, which offers the sector undeniable legal certainty with regard to efficiency requirements.
It offers the States an instrument for creating support programmes capable of promoting cogeneration and at the same time to prevent distortions in the internal energy market, and also distortions in the field of competition, in a more extensive manner.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have explained the Commission's objective in relation to this proposal, and I await the debate which is now going to take place.
I trust that, together with the rapporteur, we will be able during this legislature to approve this text at second reading, since I believe it is extremely important in order to complete all the actions we are implementing in the aim of increasing energy efficiency and energy savings and promoting renewable energy sources, as we have been doing over recent years.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive which has involved complicated, extensive and heated debates within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in particular.
We have tried to stress that cogeneration is not an end in itself but an energy efficiency measure and that this proposal, which pursues the Commission's strategy of increasing energy efficiency in the European Union, was well received but at the same time presented a series of problems, as the rapporteur, Mr Glante, pointed out at the outset.
Then, by means of close dialogue and debate between various members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we presented a balanced proposal which was genuinely significant from the point of view of energy savings.
As I said before, cogeneration based on heat demand will therefore allow us to optimise the situation in terms of greenhouse gases and balance the functioning of the electrical system.
However, this whole building could have fallen down upon us if we had promoted an unnecessary demand for heat.
Too simplistic an approach - such as the one I believe was proposed initially - would have led us to promote the construction of cogeneration plants without there being any real heat demand. And this would have been contrary to what we believed the objective of this proposal to be.
I would like to congratulate Mr Glante and everybody who has participated in the various meetings which have taken place on this issue, because it was not an easy issue to understand.
They include my colleague, Mr Vidal-Quadras, who has worked courageously on this directive.
We have been through numbers, formulae, variables and subscripts and I believe we have finally managed to bring our points of view closer together.
The compromise amendments represent good progress in terms of reaching a final agreement and it is significant that the existence of different technologies throughout the length and breadth of the European Union has been recognised.
It is the case that the more heat a plant produces, the greater the global efficiency of the cogeneration process.
But to reduce the whole directive to this statement is simplistic and unrealistic.
A plant for the exclusive production of heat with an efficiency of 80% is entirely inefficient - I would even go as far as to say obsolete - but a plant for the production of electricity with an efficiency of 50% may be very efficient.
And why is all of this the case?
For the simple reason that electricity is a more elaborate form of energy which is obtained from heat.
Once it is made clear that the global efficiency of the plant is not an appropriate or absolute parameter for determining the value of cogeneration, what are we left with?
We are left - as I believe Mr Vidal-Quadras will also point out - with primary energy savings and consequently gas emissions savings.
This is the most appropriate parameter for measuring the benefits derived from cogeneration, when compared to the separate production of heat and electricity.
We must not forget an important point: that cogeneration has been developed in the different Member States according to cultural traditions.
In the countries of the Centre and the North of Europe heat for municipal uses predominates, and it is obvious that heating and hot water needs are enormous during much of the year; in other latitudes a form of cogeneration in which the proportion of heat is lower has developed for obvious reasons, and therefore electricity for industrial uses predominates.
The remainder is sold on the network.
Mr Glante has been able to see that this proposal required a profound analysis before reaching definitive conclusions.
However, as draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I must say that this was not the case in this committee and that the opinion it approved, in the light of what is being proposed today, following the debates and meetings which have taken place, lacks realism and rigour.
The complexity of this issue was demonstrated a moment ago and I, as rapporteur supported by my group, requested a more flexible timetable.
In other words, I asked that this proposal be debated seriously and that there might be more time to compare our differing opinions with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
This request was denied and the proposal was voted on in a hurried fashion with the result that I am now describing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, amongst all of us, we must try to prevent situations such as this.
An opinion cannot be drawn up in the way it has been drawn up in the case of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on cogeneration, which I fear is not an isolated case since it happens relatively often in Parliament.
Finally, I believe we have produced a rigorous, proportionate and necessary proposal.
I would therefore congratulate the rapporteur once again, and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, on their excellent work, and particularly on not accepting the first proposal and fighting to reach agreements on a proposal which satisfies everybody.
Congratulations, Commissioner.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for his excellent cooperation.
It was clear to me from my first reading of the report that it would need more than one debate in this House, but I do believe that we in this House agree on what the directive is intended to do.
Its objective is, quite simply, to give priority to the saving of energy and to its efficient use.
I believe that our long debates have led us to a high degree of consensus on the subject.
At the very outset, Mr Glante put forward some forty amendments, which formed the basis for excellent discussions.
I have to say that he not only handled the technical aspects very well, but also - and this is most important - the human dimension, involving bringing people together and striving for compromises.
We ended up with 240 amendments, which, of course, we all worked through together.
We eventually succeeded in finding the compromise we sought.
What is now before us is very much a consolidated version, one that I think we can all live with, and the fact that it has developed along the right lines is demonstrated by the way the Industry Committee voted.
We have, of course, prepared minor amendments for this reading, but I think that the basic principle we hammered out together for sustainability in the area of energy supply will have very far-reaching effects.
What was of primary importance for us was finding a harmonised system for the calculation method.
This itself was not the focus of attention, as there were so many different options and possible approaches to it; what was, though, more important to us was finding a basis for the whole of Europe, enabling the harmonised system to be universally applicable, whether in the North/South sphere or elsewhere.
We know that there are countries in Europe where it gets very hot, and others that need a lot of heat, some needing cooling down and others needing warming up, so that there are very different interests at play here.
At this point, I would like to thank those who are called lobbyists, who have done truly outstanding work, teaching us a great deal about the options available.
The final result has been that we have learned a very great deal from the many debates, discussions and evening events, when we often stayed for a very long time discussing these things.
Our aim is of course a future increase in the share of cogenerated energy from 9% to 18%.
It should be clear that what we are after is for the figure to be doubled.
When it comes to working out the formulas, we would very much like the CEN Workshop to be involved, together with the Commission, and all parties involved to again get to grips with standardisation, so that, in the event of a second reading - which I expect we will have - there will be another variant to be debated.
So we are, de facto, hiding behind the CEN Workshop as regards a final solution as to how we take this forward.
It is my belief that, in principle, cogeneration can spark a completely new debate on the supply of electricity and energy, especially when we consider the micro-cogeneration plants.
It is the very safety of the small circuit systems that makes them a very interesting concept for the future.
We are all well aware from the renewable energy and the various central heating plants that we already have in the rural fabric and in small villages, that cogeneration has made its presence very much felt in these places, and that, moreover, the market of course functions in a completely different way.
If, then, in future, we consider not only the large installations, which were our primary focus of attention here, but also the many small regional ones, perhaps even the domestic units that may one day be possible, we can accordingly achieve something on the market.
In Wels, the city from which I come, they are planning a project called 'EnergyLand'.
In fact, Europe ought to be an 'EnergyLand'.
We are endeavouring to put research and development centre-stage in this 'EnergyLand' and, in the area of education and training, to make these new methods and new funding possibilities known to the wider public and, especially, to the business world.
In future, of course, we should give closer attention to energy and to the infrastructure in the energy sector, for a secure energy supply and efficient energy should certainly be among the primary objectives of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no doubt that the promotion of electrical energy production by means of cogeneration is an objective which we should all share, and for various reasons.
We are therefore going to support the Commission's initiative, which deserves all our respect, and we congratulate the Commissioner on it.
Production by means of cogeneration allows, firstly, energy savings and, as a consequence, achieves an environmental protection objective, since it reduces CO2 production.
There are other reasons why this method deserves our support.
Firstly, by producing heat and electricity in a combined fashion, costs can be reduced, and also, if required, users can be offered an alternative supply, which, in some cases, is a way of introducing competition, particularly in those markets - as is the case in the electricity market in my country - where there is a strong oligopolistic component.
Support for the promotion of cogeneration has been ratified by this Parliament in its Resolution of 25 September and we will therefore be acting coherently by supporting this initiative.
But the problem is that, when we talk about the concept of cogeneration, there are in fact very differing realities between cogeneration in the countries of the North of Europe and that in the South.
It was therefore very difficult to combine such different realities in a single proposal.
In the countries of the North cogeneration is essentially used to produce heating, while in the South, cogeneration is a system used by certain industrial sectors which require the production of intensive heat and also reduces the cost of electrical energy.
Examples of this are the paper industry and the ceramics industry.
It can be deduced from this that the cogeneration plants used in different countries differ radically.
While in the plants dedicated to heating steam turbines are used, and it is only necessary to generate heat during the cold months of the year, in those intended for cogeneration production for industrial purposes the heat required is of greater intensity and is used throughout the year.
This means that there are differing sizes and systems, and to encompass everything within a single directive has been difficult.
I believe that the efforts made by the rapporteur to encompass and include such differing realities in the text of the directive have been remarkable to say the least, and I would therefore like to congratulate him warmly.
I would like to say that, in general terms, we will support the text of the report with the amendments proposed.
Mr President, I am sure I speak on behalf of other colleagues when I say that this has been one of the most intriguing and perplexing issues I have ever had to follow.
For non-specialists like myself it became at times an impenetrable mass of acronyms and technical details, and Mr Glante and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca at times seemed to be speaking a language that sane, normal human beings could not possibly follow.
I never knew, for instance, that something called the Protermo method could produce as much heat and fury as it did in the debate in our committee.
It is a pity we did not combine that heat in our committee with some power while we were at it.
Still, even for those such as myself who were not able to follow every twist and turn, my group is certainly extremely pleased with the outcome and looks forward to supporting the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow.
We are particularly pleased that the two approaches represented by the differing sides of the debate in our committee - on the one hand wishing to retain a methodology to distinguish cogeneration from other forms of generation, and on the other hand wishing to maintain an accent on energy saving - have been retained in the famous Annexes two and three, and that some accommodation between those two perspectives has been reached.
We are also extremely pleased to support the measures in this directive which protect and promote micro-cogeneration, which we feel to be an essential component in the development of CHP and also of course - I speak on behalf of my group and that of others - we are very keen to try to use tomorrow's vote as a starting point to have a serious though no doubt tough debate with the Council on maintaining and pursuing real rather than just symbolic targets.
My final note is one of caution.
There are a number of amendments tabled.
I would urge colleagues from other groups to refrain from supporting amendments which disturb this very delicately constructed compromise.
It would seem, at least to us in my group, to be a shame to jeopardise a compromise which took so long and was frankly so painful in its birth.
Mr President, it is astonishing that market forces have been incapable on their own of boosting the energy efficiency of the fuels they use through the generation of combined heat and power.
As the heat generated in the production of electricity can be used for both heating and cooling, it is an economic resource, the utilisation of which (one would think) served the interests of the production plants themselves.
The directive is not needed just because it will help to protect the single energy market.
It is also needed to compel the Member States to channel resources for the effective use of fuels in the name of efficiency and environmental protection.
Common objectives are set very carelessly in the EU.
An objective is set, but neither the resources nor the sanctions to achieve these objectives are created.
An example of setting objectives based on wishful thinking is the promotion of cogeneration now being discussed.
The aim to increase cogeneration to account for 18% of electricity generation by 2010 or 2012 is a pious hope.
The market will engage in cogeneration if it is financially worthwhile.
The directive will not mean the market's unseen hand will lose the power of its grip.
Small production units are often innovative: they make good use of margins that do not interest the big producers.
For that reason, in many of the amendments one feels there is concern regarding the equal treatment of small producers in a liberalised market dominated by the large producers.
It is only reasonable to insist that the small producers should be certain of having access to the network, and they should get a fair price for electricity from cogeneration.
In this connection I would furthermore like to draw attention to the problems that arise if there is no coordination between different directives.
For example, the directive on a system for greenhouse gas emission rights trading should not be inconsistent with this directive.
The former is a synthetic market directive, whilst this directive on cogeneration is financial/technical.
The directive on emission rights trading is not in the interests of European business, whilst this directive is.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should regard this directive as a contribution to a coherent and holistic energy policy in Europe.
What this means is that it is concerned with better protection for the environment, with greater security of supply and also with coherence in the internal market in energy.
I want, briefly, to highlight the point about security of supply.
We are too dependent upon oil imports, and cogeneration makes it a very simple matter, in a very short space of time, to do without oil for domestic heating, and is much simpler than the electricity market as a way of becoming independent of oil.
The market, the internal market, is blind if we do not give it something to aim for, if we do not install guard rails.
What we did for renewable energies, we must also do for cogeneration.
It is in this respect that I regard the Commission proposal as somewhat feeble, and I am glad that tomorrow, there will, I think, be a majority in this House for reiterating the 18% objective and underlining the contribution cogeneration can make to our entering the hydrogen era.
We cannot have President Prodi gathering together a high-level group of experts and then fail to incorporate into law the first regulatory framework that really enables us to create a market for fuel cells, with a growing European demand for them as its result.
I am glad that Mr RÃŒbig and other Members see this point so clearly.
Let me turn to the definitions. Definitions might be thought to be technical in nature, but, in fact, politics lurks behind the technology.
Annex II is about determining which current in a cogeneration plant is actually cogenerated electricity.
This definition is independent of climate zones.
There can be only one definition, and it must apply throughout Europe.
If such is not the case, we are opening the way to distortions of competition in the European internal market.
The amendments that Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca intends to bring in tomorrow do not help in this respect and should be voted out.
Annex III defines the energy efficiency of cogeneration plants.
This is where there is a clear difference between, for example, Greece and the Netherlands, because many Greeks still heat their homes inefficiently with coal, whilst the Dutch have highly efficient gas heating.
Such differences of climate can be compensated for only after an indefinite period of time and with a fully-functioning internal market, so we should allow ourselves some time for this.
In any case, Annex III has to build on Annex II.
The only electricity that this directive must consider is that which has undoubtedly been derived from cogeneration.
If it fails to do so, the result will be legal uncertainty and an open door for subsidies, some of which are inefficient, while others amount to something like fraud.
If we fail to lay down unambiguous definitions, we will be helping those who are in fact less well-disposed to cogeneration in Europe.
I believe that what we all want this directive to do is to get cogeneration taken more seriously in future, and to get people investing in this technology, especially in Eastern Europe.
Mr President, the drawing up of this Directive and Parliament's report on this legislative instrument has been very laborious, but I would not say that there has been confrontation, but rather a progressive and patient convergence towards rigour and the service of the European general interest by bringing together arguments and points of view.
The three central points we have achieved, Mr President, by means of this long discussion, have been, firstly, to place primary energy saving at the heart of the Directive as an essential defining parameter; secondly, to calculate the percentage energy saving in relation to the electricity produced and not in relation to the total of heat plus electricity, in order to emphasise where the energy saving is achieved; and finally we have distinguished clearly between two situations: that of those installations which work permanently producing heat and electricity simultaneously and that of those which, because of the way they operate and the purposes they serve, produce electricity and heat simultaneously only for part of the year, and the rest of the year work exclusively in condensation mode.
Mr President, these three points were essential to achieving the aim of this Directive, which was a good definition of cogeneration, and which will allow us to define a good system for stimulating this form of energy production, leading to what we are all seeking: savings of primary energy, reduction of CO2 emissions and increasing the Union's independence with regard to the external supply of energy sources.
Unfortunately, this discussion, which we have all participated in with great enthusiasm, dedication and goodwill, has not been enough for the whole of the House - Mr Turmes for example - but neither can we expect everybody to understand everything straightaway.
I am sure that Mr Turmes, who is very knowledgeable in this field, will continue considering it, and that what he cannot see today he will soon see clearly.
I am happy to continue explaining the same things both to him and his collaborators, as I have done up till now - although having heard his speech I see that I have not been successful - because talking to him is always a pleasure, in political and human terms.
Mr Glante, please allow me to address an observation expressly to you, and I would like to thank you warmly for your receptiveness and cooperation throughout the work we have done together: when a sculpture is finished and is almost perfect, there are always certain final touches which make it absolutely perfect.
I would draw your attention to Amendments Nos 75 and 81, which correspond to the agreement we reached after the meeting in committee and which our group considers to be essential: Amendment No 75, which removes the threshold of 80%, which no longer makes sense, and Amendment No 81, which clearly distinguishes between each type of installation.
Commissioner, General de Gaulle said that policy is action at the service of a strong, simple and clear idea.
If this is the case, Commissioner, you have a European energy policy in mind and, as long as you continue to develop it, this Parliament will support you, because it fulfils objectives which we all wish to achieve: increasing our competitiveness, guaranteeing the well-being of all Europeans and greater economic growth.
Mr President, I too wish first of all to thank Mr Glante for producing an excellent report.
The proposal for a directive on the promotion of cogeneration is an important part of the EU's strategy for energy efficiency and energy savings.
Cogeneration will also contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases, as has been said here.
The short-term aim must be to develop the present cogeneration plants and, where possible, to encourage the establishment of high-efficiency plants.
The longer-term objective must be to create a framework for ensuring that high-efficiency cogeneration has a key role to play in increasing energy efficiency and savings.
The amendments relating to micro-generation, renewable energy sources and district cooling are important in terms of technological development.
It is possible to store heat in all size categories for a day or a year, as opposed to what is stated in the Commission proposal and in certain committee opinions.
Financial support should not be restricted just to CHP technology based on a useful heat demand.
Flexibility in the use of CHP plants must be permitted, as dictated by the time of year, the working day and random variables.
Waste heat produced at a cogeneration plant has a potentially wider use than is the case at present. It may also be used, for example, for cooling, water purification and air conditioning.
This report is very technical, and the Finnish word 'suuritehoinen' ('powerful') often mistakenly appears in the Finnish language version.
The correct translation is 'korkean hyÃ¶tysuhteen' ('high-efficiency').
The word 'suuritehoinen' would lead the reader to understand that the directive only applied to large installations.
The important thing is that the will is there to support high-efficiency technology regardless of size.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have reached an extremely important juncture.
The report on cogeneration that we have here is enormously important in terms of a sustainable energy policy in Europe.
I should first of all like to join my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for his extremely amiable, pleasant, very constructive cooperation.
I should like to call upon him to continue this cooperation until the end, to ensure that we achieve a good result tomorrow.
It has been rightly pointed out that the emphasis has come to be placed much more on the conservation of energy.
The important thing, of course, is seeing to it that we arrive at a situation in which we in Europe are able to achieve our CO2 targets.
Cogeneration plays a very important role in this.
What is also particularly important, however, is of course that we aspire to have high-quality installations in Europe, that we do not become lazy about cogeneration, but instead set our sights as high as possible in order to achieve the maximum possible savings.
I think that that is the message that should also be sent out by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
I actually liked the picture painted by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca very much. It is almost complete, but something still remains to be done: we need to add further - but minor - refinements to Annexes II and III.
The subdivision of fuel consumption not related to cogeneration is now, therefore, being moved to Annex III, so we have to tidy up Annex II a little, simplifying it slightly, more in the direction of Annex III.
That, Mr Glante, is also the reason why we tabled both Amendment No 175 and Amendment No 176.
This has turned out to be a very technical report, but it ultimately revolves around the fact that we are in need of a common, precise calculation method and harmonisation of the support schemes applied by the European Union.
Amendment No 42 is essential.
It is essential that this harmonised reference value for determining primary energy savings by cogeneration is brought in as soon as possible, namely within two years.
It is also essential that the calculation method be precise and harmonised throughout the EU.
The report now contains that whole package, and for this reason I think that it deserves our support.
I hope, therefore, that Mr Glante will also be able to secure the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his proposal tomorrow.
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has already indicated how essential Amendments Nos 75, 76 and 81 are to us.
It all depends on him, therefore - on his support for our amendments - whether the PPE-DE Group is able to follow him. I hope that it can.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as I do today on Mr Glante's highly technical dossier, I give an opinion on it in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Our position, too, is characterised by the environmental aspects.
The Committee on the Environment agreed on that unanimously, after the vote had, indeed, been deferred twice by reason of the somewhat laborious discussion.
The significance of a safe, economical, and environmentally friendly supply of energy is not a matter of dispute.
The production of energy to a high standard could also be guaranteed by building power plants based on a system of cogeneration, which, when compared with separate generation, has the advantage that it makes the most efficient use of fuels, whether from fossil or renewable sources.
Moreover, the process of cogeneration can avoid the emission of carbon dioxide, which means that stepping up the promotion of cogeneration plants is an essential instrument in the package of measures required to comply with the Kyoto protocol on global climate change.
In the European Union at present, however, cogeneration is not yet being used to its full potential as a means of saving energy. A substantial extension of its use is indispensable when it comes to dealing with climate change and saving resources.
Along with securing the energy supply, another fundamental objective of the draft directive submitted by the Commission is to create a framework capable of promoting the building and proper operation of cogeneration plants.
We believe that the draft put forward by the Commission is right in principle, but in need of improvements at various points, a view taken also by the members of the leading Committee and expressed by their rapporteur.
Whatever happens, we want to see the ambitious objective laid down that the proportion of the total electricity generated in the European Union by cogeneration plants should be doubled, rising from 9%, as it was in 1994, to 18% in 2012.
We need transparent rules on what can be promoted as a cogeneration plant, rules that must be applicable throughout the European Union.
The two-stage procedure proposed by the Commission, with its classification of energy for agriculture, industry and heating, does not provide that transparency; instead, it simply demands an excessive burden of administration.
It is for that reason that we want to impose as standard an index figure for electricity and 80% efficiency.
That, at any rate, is what the Environment Committee has decided.
In addition, cogeneration plants with an output of over 50 megawatts should also fall within the maximum aid envisaged by the EU.
There is no doubt that the limit proposed by the Commission is set too low. Even small cogeneration plants can produce 100 megawatts, or even more.
Small and medium-sized plants ensure decentralised implementation, which can certainly make for effectiveness in terms of protection of the environment.
We must do more to counteract increasing global warming, and a cleverly conceived directive on cogeneration plants can certainly help to do that.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and my colleagues on working together to achieve the compromise formula and definitions, which have covered a very complicated and technical set of issues.
I particularly wish to support the importance of aiming at energy savings over efficiency: we want to use less fuel.
I welcome the linkage of support with the environmental benefits that will flow from it.
I would like to refer to some concerns expressed by a company in my former constituency and now the south-west region that I represent.
They tell me they have supplied co-generation plant over the past 20 years, which has contributed to an estimated annual saving of 700 000 tonnes of carbon, which is a significant saving.
They are concerned about this 50-megawatt threshold for eligibility.
They want it to be removed as a distortion or potential distortion to investment decisions.
They are very keen on the test of eligibility for support to be based on primary energy savings and - a point which has not yet been mentioned - they want the directive to recognise and reward the benefits of utilising waste heat and fuels.
That can come from a variety of sources.
I wish to raise two concerns of my own.
Firstly, we must beware of losing sight of the objectives of this directive beneath this welter of technical detail.
Colleagues have referred to the complexities that we have been addressing in committee and sometimes it has been a little obscure what the outcome would be.
We must remember that we are looking for primary energy savings.
I am concerned about the potential for over-elaborate administrative requirements: too many people being involved in the certification and eligibility procedures.
There is always a risk that one can stifle an initiative by too much bureaucracy.
However, I would like to broadly commend and support this proposal.
We look forward to achieving a good result in the vote tomorrow with the cooperation that we have seen up to now.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their contributions and say to them that I agree with all of them.
Our task over all these recent years has been to propose greater energy efficiency, greater savings and use of energy, all for the sake of sustainable development, which means not just guaranteeing competitiveness and quality of service for users, but also respecting the environment.
But I believe that all the honourable Members will agree that what we cannot do, under the banner of 'cogeneration', is to ultimately create a system in which more energy is consumed than would be consumed in a separated fashion throughout the process and which furthermore benefits from subsidies which, at the end of the day, are paid for by users, the taxpayer - there are various possibilities - or simply network clients, leading not just to inefficient use of energy and greater energy consumption, but also distortions of competition and a lack of competitiveness throughout the system, which I believe would benefit nobody.
The intention is to support real cogeneration and to prevent subterfuge, which, on the pretext of carrying out cogeneration activity, really involves other types of activity.
I would once again like to thank the rapporteur.
Several of you have referred to the complex and difficult discussions.
I understand that many aspects are highly complex from a technical point of view and I would therefore like once again to thank you for the effort and quality you have put into your work, despite the fact that the Commission cannot accept some of the elements proposed.
Of the 85 amendments remaining, the great majority are acceptable either totally, partially or following some modification.
Nevertheless, there are 28 which we reject entirely.
I will provide the honourable Members with a complete copy, Mr President, so that there are no doubts
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0129/2003) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators.
Mr President, I should firstly like to express my thanks for the cooperation I received in the preparation of this report, not only from the Commission but also from colleagues on the committee, where we were involved in extremely good cooperation in bringing forward compromise amendments.
These have strengthened the report to the best interests of the industry and those involved in it.
We should all be aware that this report came about, to a large extent, as a result of the aeroplanes flying into the Twin Towers in New York in September 2001.
It is an attempt, to some extent, to restore confidence in the insurance market in the European Union.
Hopefully that confidence will return.
I have to say at the outset that this is not necessarily a major problem for what we would term the 'major airlines', that is, airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways and the other big boys.
They do not have a problem with this.
It is the small, regional airlines that will be most affected - indeed not only small, regional airlines, but aircraft training schools and people who fly their own small planes, etc. They are the people who, to a large extent, could feel they face the greatest problem.
There could be an added cost to them.
That is something we want to try to avoid.
As I said, I tried to achieve a consensus with the compromise amendments that we came forward with in committee.
I feel we have achieved this.
We have introduced three extra categories.
These categories allow for greater flexibility and stability in the smaller aircraft area.
We also have to be aware of the substantial support given to the industry in the United States.
The US Government has been a very strong supporter of its industry, especially since 11 September, and continues to be so.
We must not allow our industry in the European Union to place its operators at any further disadvantage.
By sticking to the Montreal Convention and the ECAC figures I hope we have been able to find and bring forward a balanced report that will hopefully find a way forward.
There are still some areas of concern.
We debated them in committee.
Mrs Foster brought forward a couple of amendments.
She has concerns about the overflying of European Union airspace.
That is something that she is right to continue to develop.
We have to understand what this means and how it is going to be controlled.
The other question is one we really must address between first and second readings - and I ask the Commission to take this on board - is that of an impact assessment, another issue raised in committee.
We should return to that at a later stage.
We have to know what the cost and effect, the damage or the benefit will be to those who fly, be it as a hobby, on business or for any other reason.
We should be prepared to take time to make that assessment.
It is not in the interests of the European Union to bring in legislation that will put people at a disadvantage and make the European Union look like kill-joys.
That certainly is not my intention.
I will continue to defend the most vulnerable in this field - the small operators and those who enjoy flying as a sport.
In committee I met with many interests in the industry.
I also met with the insurers.
It is amazing that in the European Union we only have two or three companies or people providing insurance for aircraft.
There is very little competition in this field.
It is right for us to encourage competition but the timing, elements and basics have to be right.
We have to ensure that we have a proposal that will encourage others into this industry and bring greater competition.
It is right to encourage and prepare for those conditions.
Hopefully, very soon, we will be able to return to a more stable market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say very briefly that the Community regulations in force simply require air companies to be insured, but they do not set any criterion, condition or sum to be respected by the authorising authorities of the Member States of the Union.
It therefore became necessary to clarify the situation, particularly following the events of 11 September 2001.
As the rapporteur has quite rightly said, it is a question of restoring confidence and of providing the possibility of sufficient insurance cover, for small companies as well.
The Commission's objective is therefore to ensure that all aircraft flying to European destinations are always insured against various risks, including war and terrorism.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Nicholson, for his constructive work, into which he has incorporated a more balanced approach, particularly with regard to third-party insurance.
The Commission is very concerned that this proposal should be adopted rapidly and will continue to observe the air insurance market in order to ensure that the current situation excludes any risk of aircraft lacking sufficient cover.
But I would like to say to the honourable Member that, with regard to the impact assessment, the reality is that before preparing this proposal, the Commission gathered diverse information on the issue of the insurance conditions applicable in the different States of the Union by means of the European Civil Aviation Conference and third countries, including also all aspects relating to insurance associated with leasing contracts, the Commission has been actively monitoring the development of the insurance market, both at European level and at international level.
Firstly at European level in order to ultimately put an end to the special conditions which allowed the cover of certain types of risk by the public sector, but also by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is where we believe this type of issue should essentially be dealt with.
The proposal which the honourable Members are discussing today also stems from the various discussions which took place in a special group created precisely in order to discuss the problems relating to insurance following the tragic events of September.
That special group included representatives of the insurance industries and the air industries.
Finally, I would like to say to you that, following the introduction of special conditions which have been in operation for some time following 11 September (until we believed that the market had recovered sufficient capacity to cover all the risks at reasonable prices), the Commission has monitored the support measures and tariffs applied in the different States of the Union, which has given us firsthand and direct knowledge of the true situation of air insurance in the different countries of the Union.
Therefore, in this regard, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, Mr Nicholson, we believed that more extensive impact studies were not necessary, since we had more than sufficient information to produce this proposal.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for this report, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for having accepted the majority of the amendments which this Committee has proposed in its opinion.
I would also like to thank all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for having accepted a series of points of view which the Committee on Legal Affairs believed were important because they would improve the report being produced by Parliament.
Secondly, Madam Vice-President, please allow me to congratulate you as we have done on other occasions and on other diverse and varied reports, since, once again, you have dealt with a complicated and controversial issue, which may annoy certain sectors and groups affected, and have made a courageous proposal which, in certain cases, as you can see, we have reduced to a certain extent, although on other aspects we have proposed, if you like, some further detail and a degree of toughening of the proposal.
We must acknowledge your work and your will to resolve issues so that the European citizens are much better covered and so that they gain confidence in air transport.
Furthermore, this confidence, security and responsibility in the rules on air transport should also be extended to other areas of transport on which you have also made proposals and in which we have not reached the same level in terms of the internal market and liberalisation.
We are dealing with a courageous proposal, from the Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport, which provides for a qualitative leap in the field of insurance.
As both you and the rapporteur have indicated quite correctly, we are trying to give the citizens and users confidence and we are making our air transport competitive, and at the same time establishing a series of rules which indicate the route to be taken by air companies as well as the route to be taken by other States.
None of these concepts should make us nervous.
I believe we are taking the right approach and we must maintain it.
We must improve the texts, we must propose innovative ideas such as this and you will always have our support, Madam Vice-President.
I hope that Parliament will vote to ratify the proposal of the Committee on Transport, which I believe the Commission can accept, and I believe the Council will be capable of following us and that we will not find, as on other occasions, that in the end certain issues have been rather left behind and then we have all regretted it and have been obliged to resolve them hurriedly.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Nicholson on his work as rapporteur.
I think that the report is acceptable to the large majority of the Members of the European Parliament and we must, of course, also thank Mr Ripoll for his work as draftsman.
Obviously, the directive before us is useful, especially after everything that has happened in the wake of the terrorist attack on the United States on 11 September 2001 and the upheavals on the insurance market.
I also think it is obvious that there needs to be full and fundamental cover for all categories, so that the citizens of the European Union feel that the Union is a body that cares about each and every one of them, does not take a narrow, short-sighted view of certain business interests and is concerned that everyone who has an insurance claim following an aviation accident should be compensated.
I think that this particular proposal for a directive makes some headway here.
As far as our committee is concerned, you know that we approved various amendments which harmonise insurance requirements with the arrangements introduced by the ECAC.
I think we need to stay at these levels, so that there is harmonisation between the European Union and the other European countries that are not yet members of the Union and so that there are basically unified regulations at European level.
However, we must not go beyond that, because there needs to be a sense of security among our citizens.
There are, as Mr Nicholson said, areas of concern and I think that some Members are even concerned about evaluating the impact on airlines.
The Commissioner made a reference and I think that her reference was clear.
I hope, Commissioner, that your information is correct, so that there are no repercussions of the sort feared by Mrs Foster on airlines and, to finish, I should like to clarify on behalf of my group that we, the European People's Party and European Democrats, shall stand by the amendments approved in committee.
We shall not accept the other amendments, because we believe that the text approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is exceptionally well balanced.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Nicholson, on his report.
Members have highlighted the reasons why this regulation is required in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States, so I will not go any further on that point.
I should just like to say that we believe it is a necessary regulation because it creates legal certainty and because it establishes minimum insurance requirements for liability in respect of passengers, luggage, cargo, mail and third parties.
On the whole, we believe that the Commission did a reasonable job.
However, we also believe our committee has improved the text by bringing it closer to reality and by clarifying certain aspects of it.
I support the call from the rapporteur with regard to an economic impact assessment of this legislation before the second reading.
The main points I would like to raise on behalf of the PSE Group are as follows:
The Commission's categories regarding the minimum insurance requirements cover too wide a spectrum of aircraft and would have constituted a burden which is too high or even unbearable for smaller aircraft in general aviation.
I believe we have found a good compromise in the committee by lowering and changing the categories and by using more or less the categories of resolution ECAC/25-1.
My group has tabled two amendments again for plenary.
The first is to ensure that the person of the party liable in respect of an aircraft is identical to the person required to take out the insurance.
This amendment is necessary in order to avoid duplication of insurance, gaps in the insurance cover, or insurance without liability.
The second amendment is about the consequences if the conditions of this regulation are not met, in particular as it applies to an air carrier or aircraft operators from third countries, who must be refused access to routes to or within the Community or the right to overfly the territory if they fail to comply.
We must remember that Community air carriers and keepers of aircraft registered in the Community shall forfeit their operating license where the prescribed insurance cover is not maintained.
Therefore we must make this distinction between third country and Community carriers or operators.
We believe that refusal or access to routes is the appropriate sanction for non-EU air carriers and aircraft operators, and that the only sanction we can impose is the denial of access to routes.
These two amendments are reasonable and I hope colleagues will support them .
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Nicholson, ladies and gentlemen.
First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his good work, which has resulted in a balanced report.
I had therefore hoped that the Commissioner would arrive in Strasbourg by aeroplane today, but I believe that she just came by car.
That is a shame.
One could ask oneself whether that is because she considers that the level we are now proposing as a Parliament is too low.
I realise that it has turned out much lower than she proposed.
Nevertheless, I believe strongly in the compromise that our rapporteur has achieved and give it my wholehearted support.
I should like, however, to send a general signal to the Commission regarding the tendency I perceive in its rules of late with regard to aviation.
I wonder aloud whether the Commission shares my concern that things are not going well for the European aviation sector.
I broadly support the Commission's initiatives.
However, that institution's timing and the 'open skies' authority yet to be further developed have meant that the sector is having to deal with a large number of changes simultaneously at a very difficult time.
It is overstretched.
I would not wish you to misunderstand me: I am in favour of opening up markets to more competition and of reducing intervention by the authorities, but we must be clear and realistic, with transitional rules.
We have a variety of regimes: national, European and international, and they are intertwined.
I think, therefore, that we have to take care not to start the race too fast.
I should like to ask that, at second reading, the economic impact be presented, so that we know what it really involves and that we really are going to make the Community finishing line.
I fully support the compromise that Mr Nicholson has presented.
I really find and this is the main reason we have to do it that a cup of coffee at home or here in Strasbourg is much more enjoyable than on the road in Luxembourg if one does happen to go by car.
In a real, insured aeroplane.
This is what is important.
We want to have a consumer-friendly product, a safe product, in the air, and I hope that we can decide on that together tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are establishing the minimum insurance requirements to be fulfilled by air companies and operators flying through our airspace or providing services destined for or departing from the European Union, in order to guarantee their liability for possible damage which may be caused to passengers, luggage, cargo, mail or third parties.
In order to successfully achieve such a laudable objective, we must not allow the Regulation we are approving to contain imprecise definitions or confused concepts, since that could lead to situations in which there is no cover or protection, either for the consumer using the air service or for third parties suffering damage in the event of incidents.
We therefore propose several amendments, with a view to better defining in the regulatory text the terms 'passenger', 'insurance' and 'flight', compensation to third parties, where appropriate, and we also advocate the inclusion amongst the risks insured of other contingencies, accidents and fortuitous incidents, as well as the risks caused by acts of war, terrorism, kidnap, sabotage, hijack and social or industrial disturbances.
Furthermore, we propose that companies and operators registered in a third country, that is, outside the European Union, can be considered as conforming to the requirements of this regulation we are discussing, provided that they produce an insurance certificate, issued under appropriate regulatory conditions by any insurer authorised to operate legally in accordance with Community law.
We also propose that, in all cases of aircraft operated under a leasing system, with or without crews, for whatever time period, it should always be the companies or operators carrying out flights who should fulfil the minimum insurance requirements.
Finally, we ask the Commission to take the initiative to harmonise legislation on insurance against risks in all the Union's air terminals, so that we do not end up in a situation where only possible damage suffered during flights is covered, but also any damage during the rest of the time that users remain within the air transport service chain.
Mr President, Commissioner, serious accidents in the recent past, and their aftermath, have shown us that the legislation on the liability of carriers in respect of third parties is not satisfactory.
For that reason, I certainly do not wish to deny the necessity of this proposal for a regulation.
It is indeed important when introducing this kind of measure that all airlines, both EU and non-EU carriers, are subject to the same requirements.
After all, the measure would be severely restricted in its effectiveness if this regulation only related to EU carriers.
It would, moreover, have a disruptive effect on the already delicate relations in the aviation sector.
Another aspect for which the international context is of great importance is the amount of the sums insured.
It would cloud relations in the sector if we were to lay down considerably higher sums than have been agreed in the international aviation community.
Without detracting from my support for this proposal, I should like to make an appeal to the Council and to the Commission.
Given the malaise in the aviation sector, I would call on the Council and the Commission to adopt a constructive attitude towards the aviation sector.
As a result of a number of crises, a kind of yo-yo situation seems to have arisen there, in which the viability of the airlines - not only from Europe, but also from elsewhere - is seriously under threat.
Given the contribution that this sector makes to the development of the Community, a support strategy is the least it can expect.
This means that I can give the report my support - and the rapporteur my gratitude.
I should like to note, however, that the circumstances require that it be introduced with care.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as all those who have spoken before me have already said, Mr Nicholson really has done an excellent job, succeeding in convincing a large part - if not all - of the Commission of the validity of the proposals for compromise amendments he has put forward, which are very appropriate and necessary.
Commissioner, we fully agree with the Commission that the measure is appropriate and necessary; previous speakers have already explained why.
We need to give consumers and air transport users increasing guarantees, and we need, as has been said, gradually to achieve a situation where the sector is regulated and rights are protected in this field, in order to provide the same possibility of development and to restore consumer confidence.
It is, however, true, Commissioner - and I regret to say that this does not appear to be a new scenario - that, although you followed a sound, effective line with regard to air transport, the competent services of the Commission then took - and not for the first time - a rather too rigid approach when it came to specifics.
As you are quite aware, I am the rapporteur for the measure on overbooking, with regard to which we encountered the same rigidity as we are experiencing today in the field of insurance.
What do I mean by rigidity?
I mean an approach that is a little oversimplistic, which does not, indeed, take into account the two fundamental factors already mentioned.
Firstly, there are different kinds of air transport: the major airlines are one thing but the regional airlines are another, and private operators - as in this case - are quite another. The second factor which is being overlooked is that this is a difficult time for the sector, not so much because of economic trends - September 11, the Middle East, the war in Iraq and now SARS which, as you know, Commissioner, has already done twice as much damage to the air traffic sector as Iraq - as the fact that, in the face of these economic difficulties, while US airlines are receiving what is practically full, total support from the US Government, we, on the other hand, are leaving most of our airlines on their own to cope with the demands we are making of them and the changes we are asking them to make, however necessary these requests may be.
To sum up, then, it was necessary for a good measure to be proposed, but I believe that, on this occasion too, without Parliament's astute contribution, the good end result we can adopt and endorse today might not have been achieved.
Mr President, I am glad that the rapporteur has consulted the stakeholders on this matter, although I note he does not specify who they are!
In my own fevered imagination, I have always equated stakeholders with Count Dracula.
However, in this context I consider that my own stakeholders are my electorate.
I was sent to this Parliament to use my best endeavours to arrest the march of EU regulations or mitigate their effect.
In respect of this legislation, I note that the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Montreal and Warsaw Conventions.
However, the signatories to the Conventions are the Member States, not the European Union!
Thus, while I would obviously support the idea of rationalising aviation insurance, I cannot accept Commission attempts to superimpose a European dimension on what should be a matter for nation states.
To the extent that I am also a stakeholder, I will therefore do the only thing I can in this House: thrust my own stake through the heart of this proposal and vote against it.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank my colleague Mr Nicholson for all his hard work, and to say that I would fully support his and other Members' requests that a thorough financial business impact assessment be carried out by the Commission before the second reading.
I would also echo remarks by Mr Lisi and others on the state of the industry at this moment.
It goes without saying that none of us here would expect airlines to be operating without the proper levels of insurance cover and there is no evidence to suggest that the airlines have ever done so.
However, the draft proposal took no account of the financial impact on the European aviation industry.
Airlines have already endured an increase of 300% for their insurance premiums post September 11.
In particular the proposal paid no regard to the financial effects on regional airlines, the general aviation sector and flying schools.
In addition the UK Government has already estimated extra costs to the UK sector of Â£50 million, a fact that the Commission is determined to ignore.
My second point concerns the proposed levels of insurance cover and I fully supported the cross-party compromise that was voted on overwhelmingly at committee stage and which was more in line with the ECAC specifications.
Thirdly we have still not received a satisfactory answer regarding the practical application of this legislation on the issue of overflying.
Comprehensive transit agreements have been in place worldwide for the last 60 years and it is therefore vital that any additional information required would have to be processed in a straightforward manner.
The suggestion that this information could be filed with the flight plan seems totally impractical to me and does not answer the important question regarding an aircraft diverting into European airspace in unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances.
My final point concerns third party liability cover for war and terrorism.
The Commission strongly suggests that this legislation will open up the insurance market which is currently a virtual monopoly supplier.
However, we have heard no detailed evidence to support this, contrary to what the Commissioner has said.
According to the experts there are no products of this nature available to international airlines and none are ever likely to emerge.
In conclusion, I would request that the Commission not only informs our committee of the results of the business impact assessment but also answers satisfactorily the two additional points I have raised on overflying and insurance cover before the second reading.
Too often the Commission ignores such requests from our committee members for information and we will no longer be ignored.
Finally, I would stress that this House should not pass legislation that cannot be complied with.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Commission statement on the ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency on 27 May 2003.
. (ES) Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to take the floor today on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Busquin, and on behalf of the Commission.
I would like to begin by congratulating the European Parliament on its initiatives aimed at drawing the attention of the States of the Union - which we should not forget are the European protagonists in the space sector - but drawing the attention of those States to the need to take courageous and significant decisions in a sector in crisis, as the space sector currently is.
The broad debate arising from the Commission's Green Paper on European space policy highlights several points.
Firstly, I would mention the need to go ahead with a restructuring of the launcher sector in order to guarantee Europe access to space.
Secondly, I would like, together with the whole of the Commission, to re-affirm how urgent it is to reach an agreement within the European Space Agency on Galileo.
I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that I believe it essential that there be an agreement within the European Space Agency since we have been waiting too long.
First it was certain countries, and now it is others.
In any event, at Community level, we reached an agreement a whole year ago during the Spanish Presidency.
Unfortunately, an agreement is still to be reached within the Space Agency where I would remind the honourable Members that the intergovernmental system operates.
With regard to the Galileo issue, I would like to point out that this is one of the great essential projects if we are to maintain our space sector, and that, furthermore, if we do not establish the joint undertaking very quickly, which must move this project ahead, we risk facing difficulties when it comes to continuing to maintain the adjudication of frequencies which we achieved having overcome every type of obstacle in 2000.
I would therefore like once again to insist on the European interest, on the need for an agreement to be reached on this point as soon as possible and that national differences be resolved.
Finally, the Commission supports the work of the Convention aimed at including space as a shared competence in the Union Treaty in the future.
The initial approaches emerging from the process of consultation on the Green Paper are converging in favour of the definition of a space policy for the European Union, as well as its application by means of an ambitious space programme.
Before I finish, however, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the existence of a common policy in the defence sector at least, in the arms sector, would also assist enormously the work and activity of the space sector.
We know, ladies and gentlemen, that, for our most direct competitors, the most significant support for this sector comes from precisely that source of funding.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner both for the time she has devoted to this initiative and for her comments on the matter, which confirm the Commission's intention to develop a strategy consistent with that already presented in the Green Paper on Space Policy and with the initiatives on the Galileo joint undertaking.
The motion for a resolution is a response to a growing concern: when we discuss the Green Paper with a view to the drawing up of a White Paper - in other words, of a more organic Commission proposal - we would not want to find ourselves in a situation where our goals are jeopardised by the severe crisis affecting the entire European space industry and, in particular, the new version of Ariane; nor would we want - and I believe this is one of the Commission's concerns - the impasse in connection with the Galileo project ultimately to jeopardise a highly ambitious project which has required extraordinary cooperation from the whole of European industry.
We are convinced that space is a key sector for Europe and that this decision, formalised by the establishment of the European Space Agency, must be confirmed and consolidated.
The Space Agency is an asset which we must not waste, and it is no coincidence that it is cited, not least in the recent action plan to increase research, as one of the major technological platforms to be considered if we are to respond to the need to make the European economy competitive.
The space industry is currently experiencing a period of crisis.
However, we must remember that, although the resources which have been available to it are infinitely inferior to those at the disposal of the parallel United States industry, it has succeeded in winning a sizeable share of the market and has managed to compete in those fields in which it was operating in parallel with the US initiative too, reducing Europe's dependency on US technology in industry sectors where both were active and, not least, finding the means to cooperate positively with North American industry.
We feel that this presence, this initiative must be confirmed, and it would appear from the Commission's response - although expressed in what, as I have said, is an unplanned debate arising from the concern not to find ourselves in a situation where our plans are jeopardised and pending a more organic, comprehensive assessment - that it agrees with us.
We must acknowledge that the development of the space sector is extremely important in terms of making the knowledge-based economy a practical reality, that public funding and coordination of defence policies is essential and that it can be supplemented by private investment but only in some links in the space industry value chain.
We hope that these observations, which express our agreement with the Commission, will be heeded by the Council when it meets on 27 May to take decisions.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her speech this Monday night at the beginning of the Parliamentary session on a matter that is highly topical, since, in fact, our speeches are not so much addressed to Commissioner Busquin or to Mrs de Palacio herself as to the ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, which is due to take place in a few days' time. We have high expectations of its outcome.
I think it is worth saying that this is a topical initiative. It is not intended to replace reports or the debate on the Green Paper, or the Galileo debate.
It has simply become clear at various meetings that this is a critical time for the European space sector - perhaps more critical than we realise - due to the problems of Arianespace, which affect not only launchers but the entire satellite industry as well.
A question mark is therefore now hanging over the skills and expertise we have acquired, which are extremely valuable at a time when new space powers are emerging all over the world, at a time when we can see that the market studies carried out in the 1990s are no longer being acted on, in particular in the field of satellite constellations.
We therefore need to examine the question of what Europe is doing, given that this is a European project.
Of course, the French are particularly concerned, since they instigated the conquest of space a few years ago, but, today, it is no longer possible for one isolated country to maintain its space capacity at world level.
Today, therefore, I am not speaking as a Frenchman, Commissioner, but as a European who would like us to consider Airbus and what that remarkable achievement involved.
We should make that clear to those who might say that if the European space sector does not measure up they will buy elsewhere.
We could also have purchased planes elsewhere.
Sadly, however, this would compromise European skills, technology and expertise, and, in particular, civil applications in all fields, including medicine, information technology and aeronautics.
This is therefore a strategic project, not just in the military sense, but also quite simply in terms of what is Europe's most valuable asset, in other words its technological progress.
As far as you can, we would like you to convey to the Member States, who are also members of the ESA, our desire to see an emergency plan implemented to restructure the launcher sector, and also our desire to see the Galileo crisis resolved.
You have certainly done more than your duty in this field.
For the first time, Europe is sending out a strong signal, it possesses a space programme, and we know that programmes are essential, but we can see that the ESA is suffering one crisis after another.
Commissioner, we believe it is very important, on the one hand, to succeed in overcoming this crisis at the next ministerial meeting of the ESA, and, on the other, if we do not succeed, to ask the Commission to take matters firmly in hand.
I know this is difficult, I know that Germany and France in particular are not necessarily cooperative with regard to establishing an executive director.
I would like to see an end to minor skirmishes in this field.
What we are asking, however, is that the Commission compensate for the failings of the ESA, if failings it must have.
Lastly, we would like to send a message to the Convention on the future of the Union, calling for space to be an area of shared competence in future, since, once again, we believe this would be in keeping with its strategic nature.
Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Ms de Palacio for her excellent introduction.
The European Union's common space policy is important.
The European Space Agency is an essential part of European integration.
Most of the members of the European Space Agency are members of the EU, and most of the members of the EU are also members of the European Space Agency.
Space technology is a very important area for policy on research and industry.
At present more than 40 000 people work in the space industry and the sector indirectly creates employment for as many as 250 000.
Space research is traditionally at the forefront of all research.
Many of the discoveries made there are later on applied in the circumstances of everyday life, to become of service to the whole public.
By far the largest and most important of the projects jointly engaged in by the European Union and the ESA is the Galileo Satellite Navigation Programme.
It is a system based on satellites and ground stations, which is intended to be introduced in 2008.
It will enable receivers to locate their whereabouts and determine what time it is, with extreme accuracy, anywhere on earth.
The European system differs from the American GPS and the Russian Glonas systems in that it is the most modern system, and its operation would not be adversely affected in times of crisis.
The last war in Iraq showed just how important this is.
The Galileo system would secure the non-dependence of the EU and the ESA on the other systems, whose management would be none of their business.
The EU's involvement is mainly restricted to developing the Galileo system, which should be completed in 2005.
This phase will cost at least EUR 1.1 billion, of which the EU has undertaken to pay half and the ESA the other half.
In addition, the private sector should be involved in the project, contributing around EUR 200 million.
The Galileo system is vital for the development of European research and technology.
The EU and the ESA countries should be at the global forefront of space technology.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my responsibility, on behalf of the competent committee in this area, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to draw up the report on the state of progress of the Galileo programme and the integration of the EGNOS programme into the Galileo programme.
The first discussion within the competent committee, the ITRE committee, will take place on 21 May and the report will be discussed in plenary in November.
Given the problems you have highlighted, Commissioner, I would like, if I may, to speak on behalf of the ITRE Committee and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to remind us all of the timetable for implementing Galileo: autumn 2002, the Galileo Joint Undertaking becomes operative; end of 2002, Commission report to the Council on the integration of the EGNOS programme into the Galileo programme and the concession model; December 2002, Council decision on the services provided by Galileo and the frequency service plan; July 2003, World Radiocommunications Conference; summer 2003, Commission proposal to the Council on the creation of the future security body; autumn 2003, Commission report to the Council on the preselection of the future concessionaire; end of 2004, launch of the first experimental satellite.
If we want to adhere to this timetable, we now urgently need to overcome the impasse that has arisen within the ESA, where the Member States are divided over the importance each has in the programme.
It is understandable that the Member States concerned want to have their say, but it is rather a nuisance, since, for the sake of 1% or 2% of their participation, we are in danger of considerably delaying the implementation of this project, which genuinely has a European dimension.
We are aware of the need for technology that is equivalent to or better than GPS.
As we saw with Commissioner Busquin, substantial research has been carried out with a view to achieving extraordinary technology, which will be even better than GPS technology.
It will comprise environmental applications, which will also be essential.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance feel strongly that the project should be transparent, and we do not want it to be carried out in haste because of a delay.
We are extremely concerned that the Galileo project should have civil, rather than military, applications.
We therefore consider that it should be implemented swiftly.
More than 200 Members of Parliament signed a motion in April against a delay and in favour of speeding up the implementation of the project.
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you could do all you can to ensure that progress is made in this direction and to overcome the impasse as swiftly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, good evening.
Mr PiÃ©trasanta, I am glad that you have referred to the amendment that we all joined in signing, for that really does show our relative helplessness.
On the other hand, though, we also want discussion of these topics to continue.
I was pleased, Mr Savary, when you said that you were speaking as a European, as that means that you were not doing so as an expert or as a Frenchman.
Here too, what is really at stake is again becoming apparent.
The fact is that what we are discussing this evening is nothing less than one of the key issues for twenty-first century Europe.
Faced with the crisis in the European economy as a whole, and in particular in the sector we are discussing this evening, a self-supporting and independent Europe must want to energetically promote branches of business, and that will involve reflection on its original strengths.
Not merely is it no help, it is also an enormous waste of public funds if, over a period of decades, all the Member States pursue an expenditure policy that, rather than introducing new angles, aims to maintain things they acquired long ago, so that their eyes remain closed to the economic realities.
As everyone has stressed this evening, what we quite simply need is modern approaches to Europe's future, in both the economy and technology.
Today, therefore, I would like to go in to bat for a Europe that is more involved in space.
The fact is that Europe must not miss the boat in a forward-looking high technology sector in which important jobs can be created, and already have been.
So what we need, quite simply, is greater commitment and more support for a policy on space travel.
What is called for here is strategic thinking over and above national frontiers, rather than the short-term and short-sighted activity for its own sake that we unfortunately see at present, not least in my homeland.
Why space, one might ask.
Why should Europe get involved in the far reaches of outer space?
Would it not make more sense to invest money on earth?
Do we have the money in the first place?
My answer is that mastery and exploitation of outer space is the key to success in the world of modern technology.
Let me show this by way of some examples.
Whether the systems we are working with have to do with communications, navigation or surveillance, satellites have a crucial part to play in it.
As we have just heard, entire sectors depend, even today, on the use of satellite technology, and we are already so accustomed to this that we give it no further thought.
Money, when invested in such areas of science as meteorology, cartography, transport, medicine, and so on, gives much more by way of a return - something of which Galileo is another example.
If, though, there is not constant updating, if we do not do research, if innovations are not constantly being introduced, if financial support is not also made available, the European space sector will languish or disappear altogether.
What we need, then, is a new chapter in European space policy, and I very much welcome the positive approaches contained in the Green Paper on the subject.
A coherent space policy strategy and precise action lines are indispensable if Europe's efforts in space are to gain new impetus rather than disappear into a black hole.
That, though, is why we decided that now was the time to formulate today's resolution by Parliament.
We must not wait until Europe's last rocket has had lift-off.
If we do, we will no longer be able to keep up with the competition from third countries, and that would be the worst thing that could happen to us.
This is a challenge for the ESA Member States; Galileo is on the testbed, and we must get this topic actually incorporated into the treaty that the Convention is working on.
That is the greatest and most important challenge.
In that sense, I hope that we will, tomorrow, come up with a joint resolution and a joint text that will then, on Thursday, be supported by Parliament as a whole.
Mr President, if the speeches are becoming repetitive, that is a very good thing.
It shows the widespread support.
We want a consolidated European space policy.
We do not want continuous, ad hoc structures.
We need a permanent solution.
This must be made clear at the ESA ministerial meeting.
The reasons are obvious.
There is considerable European added value in working together.
There is an existing acquis which must be built upon.
We must have independence within this part of the world in this very important sector.
It allows us to have links with third countries such as the United States - why not - and also Russia and countries further afield such as South Africa and some of the applicant countries.
It allows us to retain our scientists and our technologists.
Otherwise we will lose them.
It allows us to recruit the new generation of scientists and technologists.
We cannot do that unless there are projects that capture the imagination of our talented young people.
It allows us, of course, to have spin-offs in a variety of sectors which have already been mentioned and which will enhance the SME sector.
It allows us to be much more efficient in carrying out our EU objectives and policies on climate change, agriculture, security and development in the developing countries.
We are playing uphill on a very sloping playing field against the United States.
They use cross-subsidy to the tune of 31.8 billion of public money - and rising fast - compared to our EUR 6 billion - and falling.
They use public procurement, without blushing, to encourage their space sector.
They use R&D. They use a monopoly on certain electronic equipment to keep us from exploiting the high-tech space sector.
We have already heard about launchers and satellites.
Clearly the problems of the telecoms sector have been difficult for satellites in the European Union.
But there is no reason, with an up-turn, that we should not, with public procurement and public funds, be launching far more satellites in the future for public, citizen benefit.
As far as Galileo is concerned, Mr President, you know more than anyone else in this House what is needed.
I am delighted that Mr Prodi is prepared to be proactive.
He will have the support of many people in this Chamber.
Finally, let us not forget astronomy and space exploration.
I would like to hear a bit more about the European southern laboratory.
Let us have space policy in the Convention.
It is an ideal area for the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, may there one day be a satellite passing overhead that bears your name.
Now that would be a nice contribution from the Commission.
The discussions surrounding the financing of Galileo are starting - within the European Space Agency, at any rate - to resemble a bad soap opera.
At every turn, another Member State emerges from the wings to block this agreement.
Now it seems that Spain is the culprit once more.
This is hard to understand, since, after all, Galileo is important to maritime safety.
The Prestige environmental disaster is evidently not a sufficiently convincing argument for Mr Aznar's government.
It is time that our Parliament blew the whistle to bring an end to this little game.
It is a very great commitment, and it is perhaps precisely for that reason that some countries are under pressure to shelve this strategic project.
That is why I am one of the co-signatories to this resolution.
Galileo is of strategic importance to the Union, because - whatever happens - we have to keep pace with technology.
We want independence when it comes to information on positioning, and we do not want a 'brain drain' or 'job drain' to the United States.
The decision to proceed with Galileo was not taken lightly.
After all, there are many arguments for and against it.
I support the arguments in favour of Galileo.
Here in this Chamber, I want to lend my support to the realisation of this network.
We must not dawdle on this, however.
The scenario is simple: if Galileo is not realised as soon as possible, the transport sector will delve deeper and deeper into GPS applications, and Galileo will remain unused.
In the short term, therefore, Galileo has to constitute a valuable alternative to GPS for the European transport sector.
This sector needs a strong signal from the Commission, the ESA and the Galileo Consortium, and quickly, otherwise future users will not put their trust in the applications; and Galileo is too expensive to remain unused.
I should just like to go on to emphasise its civilian nature.
That is something that is very important to us.
Only Galileo can offer users a guarantee that the plug will not be pulled when the United States once more feels compelled to take unilateral action somewhere.
Incidentally, the Commission itself, in its communication, speaks about the consequences of the war in Iraq for the energy and transport sector.
We must not, therefore, lose this project; national interests must defer to the interests of the Union in this respect.
In my country there is a pop song about Satellite Suzy.
I hope that Satellite Suzy, too, passes overhead one day.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot cover in a few minutes all the problems affecting European space policy.
Today, I shall merely raise the problems relating to the Galileo programme.
More than a year has passed since the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this European satellite navigation programme in March 2002, and it has so far proved impossible to reach an agreement within the European Space Agency with regard to funding this programme.
Galileo came into existence after marked opposition from certain countries.
Today, it cannot be implemented, first of all, because of the strong competition between those who would like to lead the project, and, secondly, for reasons concerning levels of funding.
The European space industry, as we have all said, is currently undergoing a considerable crisis.
It employs 30 000 highly-skilled workers in Europe and we must do all we can to protect the extraordinary technological and human potential represented by this industry.
Galileo is one of the programmes that will be able to make the greatest contribution. It will also, moreover, provide the European Union with strategic independence.
The European Parliament wanted companies to participate financially in the joint undertaking.
These companies have taken the appropriate action and we now need to support the swift implementation of the project.
Our credibility is at stake.
There is another key element in favour of implementing the programme as a matter of urgency.
As you said, Commissioner, unless we send a signal at the appropriate time, we shall not be able to use the frequencies reserved for Galileo and the related functions.
The European Space Agency must take a decision rapidly and this concern is shared by many of us, both as Members of the European and national parliaments, who drew up and disseminated the document 'Galileo: il est temps d'agir' ['Galileo: time to act!'], addressed to the Heads of State and Government of the Member States.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Galileo programme shows us the limits of the current European space policy.
We must learn lessons from this concerning the discussions held which will lead to the adoption, between now and the end of the year, of a White Paper on the subject.
The Galileo programme must be successful and send out a positive signal from Europe concerning an ambitious space policy.
This House must provide its full support so that the joint undertaking can be implemented rapidly and so that the European Commission, as represented by you, Commissioner, shares this concern of our 'Sky and Space' intergroup in the European Parliament.
Furthermore, in his letter of 30 April last, President Prodi informed the members of this intergroup, through the intermediary of its chair, Mr Savary, of the possibility considered by the Commission of implementing the joint undertaking unilaterally, should an agreement from the ESA not be forthcoming in the next few days.
We would also call on all the Member States to put an end to their differences concerning funding for the programme at the meeting of the European Space Agency on 27 May next, so that we can, at last, move forward.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree on the strategic importance of the space sector for Europe.
It is the only technology capable of ensuring the emergence of new worldwide rules to genuinely allow the European industry to access new markets and new technological developments.
The space sector to a large extent represents one of the frontiers of pioneering technology.
Europe must not therefore fail to be involved in this extremely important sector.
We must implement a new policy which integrates all European actions.
A moment ago, Mrs McNally spoke of the importance and European added value of the space sector.
And in this regard I proposed earlier the inclusion of space policy within the field of Community competences within the context of the review of the Treaties which is currently taking place in the Convention and therefore the drawing up of a future constitutional Treaty.
The second aspect: space at the service of Community policies, a key objective in relation to the White Paper; it should therefore be included in applications such as agriculture, fisheries, education, the environment, which several speakers have mentioned.
The European Space Agency will be able to act to stimulate programmes if the view is taken that space is currently of strategic importance; and the Agency can take an approach which overcomes the current restrictions of the intergovernmental approach.
With regard to the launcher sector, the Commission is preparing a report for September on this strategic sector, which is unquestionably one of the sectors with the greatest difficulties at this time.
Finally, I will comment on the Galileo programme, which, like all these issues - I would repeat - are the responsibility of my colleague Mr Busquin, who is doing tremendous work together with the whole team in the Directorate-General for Research and Technological Development.
Ladies and gentlemen, since I took on my responsibilities as Commissioner, I have dedicated every effort to Galileo, and not only effort, but also political impetus, in accordance with my capacities and very willingly.
It was a project which was far from being able to be realised when I arrived here.
Such a significant project was being dealt with by just two officials for the whole project (one of them is here today - no longer in the Directorate-General Transport - and I would like to congratulate Mr Tytgat on his will, because at the end of the day, we are often able to build Europe thanks to specific people who have the courage to move forward promoting their ideas), a project which was very far from maturity.
I have given my personal impetus to this project since I began to work here.
And I am going to say one thing to you: it has been paralysed for more than a year.
The agreement within the Community was reached more than a year ago during the Spanish Presidency, which dedicated much effort to this project.
I would like to say to the honourable Members that the Community aspect has worked, though more slowly than I would have liked.
What has failed has been the intergovernmental aspect which takes the form of the European Space Agency.
On occasions, in the course of one year, two countries have blocked the decisions of the European Space Agency.
And I understand that over the last month another two have caused problems - in particular one which I know very well.
I have always called upon all of them to resolve these differences as soon as possible and not to block the project.
I have heard ministers in the Council of Ministers haggling over the project, saying that it could not be done by means of an agency, as was proposed at the outset, because we wanted a fully commercial project, with commercial criteria, approached purely from the point of view of economics and economic efficiency, and now I cannot believe that the haggling within the European Space Agency relates to whether the headquarters is in one country or another or whether the Presidency is of one nationality or another.
This entirely contradicts what I have heard, not from these ministers but from their transport colleagues, during a series of Councils in which we have had very tough debates.
In accordance with my responsibilities, I have proposed to the monitoring committee, in which all the States are represented, the name of a director for the joint undertaking, to implement the joint undertaking solely with Community funds, without making use of the funds of the European Space Agency.
It is the Member States who have blocked the proposal I have made in this field.
So let me make it very clear, ladies and gentlemen: within the Community field, the problems have been resolved.
It is within the European Space Agency that the problems are still to be resolved and that some Member States - sometimes certain Member States and sometimes others, it does not matter - are blocking a project which is absolutely strategic for the development not just of the space sector, but for the technological development of Europe, and so that it does not get left behind in relation to a series of essential and key applications.
I would like to clearly express my great concern at the repeated delays - I said this a year and a half ago, in December 2001 - of the project in the Council of Ministers, which jeopardises any real possibility of its being implemented, particularly if we are saying that we want the whole system to operate according to strict market rules.
We must choose.
If we want hard and fast market rules, it makes no sense that we have been wasting our time for more than a year in the European Space Agency arguing about which country or city the headquarters will be in, whether the President of Galileo Industries is to be this person or that person, or whether they come from this or that country of the European Union.
What we need to do is seek the best options.
We must seek the most efficient location and headquarters.
That is what we must seek.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with what has just been said here, but I would like to say to you that there are limits, and the limits are that there is an intergovernmental part which is unfortunately deadlocked.
Mr President, of course I will continue to make every possible effort and apply all the pressure I can in order to move this project ahead since, as the honourable Members know, I have invested a lot in it for many years and I believe it is essential to European technological development.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your frank words, which I can assure you were much appreciated.
Mr President, I believe that I speak on behalf of all present when I say that we are more than grateful to Commissioner de Palacio.
We need flair like this, and we need willingness from within.
The signal we are putting out is not merely to the outside world; it must also be backed up from within, and I would just like to assure you that we will continue to rely on the closest cooperation with you.
We want to do our part, but we will have to think up some way of influencing the Member States. At any rate, we will make the attempt.
Thank you for that clarification.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(The sitting was suspended at 9 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
Ladies and gentlemen, before we debate Mr Manders' report, we have to vote on the request to apply the urgent procedure to the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an agreement in the form of a letter between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia on the ecopoint system applicable to Croatian transit traffic through Austria.
I shall now give the floor to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which is the competent committee for this matter.
Mr President, I wanted, first of all, on a brief point of order, to comment on the application of Rule 112, reminding Parliament that this is a procedure which is to be applied strictly in exceptional circumstances.
Quite frankly, I am amazed that the Council should invoke Rule 112 for a matter of this nature, which we would have been able to address in a few week's time anyway without it making any difference to the measure, which, as you are aware, has already been in force since 1 January.
In this regard, I would point out to the House that, irrespective of the position it expresses, last night, at an extraordinary meeting held at the request of the Council, the competent committee did not reach the quorum necessary to vote.
The coordinators present were, in fact, surprised at the application of Rule 112 precisely because - as I said before, Mr President - it is, in my opinion, an instrument which is to be used in exceptional circumstances.
We are therefore stunned that the urgent procedure has been employed for what is, I reiterate, a measure whose content is of very minor import.
Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism himself has already stressed that this is of course an unusual procedure.
On the other hand, the deadlines are very tight, making the urgent procedure necessary.
I would therefore propose that we accept the request for urgent procedure.
The next item is the report (A5-0145/2003) by Mr Manders, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage [COM(2002) 17 - C5-0088/2002 - 2002/0021(COD)].
Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from the new Member States.
It is a real pleasure to see them in the European Parliament and I welcome them to the EU family.
Firstly, let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, for his report concerning the Commission's proposal on environmental liability.
Environmental liability is an important subject that has received well-deserved attention and caused intensive discussion for many years.
The Commission has been working on this issue for a long time, in close contact with the parties concerned and civil society.
This process has re-emphasised the strategic importance of the underlying principles, whilst also pointing to a great diversity of opinions on the details of implementation.
One is tempted to say that there are almost as many different views on the main issues as there are parties involved.
I am thus well aware that this proposal is a complex and sensitive one.
Difficult choices had to be made on many of its aspects and the appropriate balance had to be found among competing interests.
We believe that the Commission succeeded in reaching this balance when it adopted the proposal in January 2002.
It is with the aim of maintaining, if not further improving, this balance that it will consider the amendments adopted by Parliament.
Let me briefly present to you the main features of the Commission's proposal.
The proposal aims to establish a Community framework whereby environmental damage - which is defined in the proposal as biodiversity damage, water damage and land damage - would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability.
Whenever possible the operator who has caused the environmental damage - or provoked an imminent threat of such damage occurring - must, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, bear the costs associated with the implementation of the necessary preventive or restorative measures.
In certain cases, in which no operator can be held liable or a liable operator is unable to pay, Member States must assume the responsibility for finding an alternative source of financing the measures in question.
There are several key issues that deserve special attention.
These issues certainly invite more detailed comments, but today I will be as concise as possible.
Firstly, the scope of the proposal in terms of the activities and biodiversity to be covered: in the Commission's view, strict liability should apply to the activities listed in Annex I to the proposal, and also to occupational activities other than those listed in Annex I, it being understood that this second tier of liability is fault-based.
The Commission considers that suppressing this part of the liability regime is unacceptable since this would weaken the proposal.
Conversely, the Commission does not believe it either justifiable or workable to expand strict liability to all occupational activities in the EU.
Having commented on the scope, let me just finish by saying that the debate on the amendments will be an extremely important one, during which I am sure we will hear some new arguments.
Mr President, I would also like to welcome all our new colleagues, and I hope that they will also become involved in this complex report.
I would like to thank all my colleagues who have been involved in this subject and who will be involved in it in the future.
Particularly everyone who took part in the working party in order to find a compromise.
I would in particular like to thank Mr Papayannakis for his excellent co-operation, and I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the abundant information they have provided and the considerable co-operation they have offered.
This is perhaps the most complex subject, both from a legal and a political point of view, with a total of almost 900 amendments - if I include all the committees' amendments - which were then reduced to about 75 in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
We have voted on these.
There are once again 108 amendments before us in the plenary session now, with the necessary split votes.
This will mean that we will have a long hard session in front of us this afternoon, but I think that it will be worthwhile.
I would just like to briefly outline the background.
I think that this report has prestige written all over it.
First we had the Exxon Valdez and the Erika and then the Prestige, but the report also has political prestige written all over it, and has had since 1976.
If you go faster than you are actually able to, you will not achieve anything.
That is my position.
So you have to try and make rules that are workable and realistic.
The conflict in competence between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was the starting point of political sentiment in particular.
I believe that if liability regimes were not even to be dealt with in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market any longer, we might as well abolish it and set up one committee, the Committee for 'All Affairs'.
It could have 626 members, and possibly even 735 after next year, and then I know for sure that we would never get out of it.
Because of the conflict in competences, the subject has become controversial and heavily charged, one in which everyone wanted to stake their own political claim with a view to political profiling.
That was a pity, because it has meant that up to now it has been virtually impossible to arrive at compromises and to create broader support.
I ultimately decided on an approach that was considered on the basis of all the amendments submitted and that does not specifically favour industry and does not specifically favour the environment.
I have tried to find a balance that will make a new piece of legislation - because that is after all what we are talking about - workable and implementable, one that will ultimately be able to develop into a piece of workable legislation that will result in a preventative approach to the environment and will ultimately protect the environment.
I also think that it is important to create a level playing field, because I believe that environmental legislation is part of our economy.
The first compromises I suggested were based on this.
For example, I said that the legal basis should be Article 175.
Every Member State is developing its own system, and based on the best examples in the market, the Commission will be issuing harmonised draft legislation on environmental protection throughout Europe in five years' time.
In this way we will get a level playing field, we will avoid environmental dumping and we will avoid a situation in which there will ultimately be 25 different legal systems which will definitely do nothing to promote the internal market nor protect the environment.
I understand that there are a number of countries, including my own country, the Netherlands, that will always want to go a little bit further.
That is fine, and I think that that should be allowed.
On the other hand, I think that it is better that those countries that do not go as far should be brought up to a higher level, which will be ultimately better for the environment in absolute terms.
If we apply Article 95, therefore, it will be easier for the European Commission, as the watchdog of the Treaty, to bring those parties who do not comply with the rules before the European Court of Justice, thus ensuring that the environment actually benefits from this legislation.
In my initial proposals I opted for mitigating factors instead of exemptions, and I think that that was a good thing.
I linked liability for risk with state-of-the-art defence as a mitigating factor; 100 % mitigation would mean that the judge could decide not to hold somebody liable.
Unfortunately we were not able to achieve that.
The scope: I mentioned sites, habitat and species protected under Community legislation, and sites protected under national legislation.
I said that this should be complementary to all international conventions so as to ensure that there would be a level playing field and a comparable liability regime in that area too.
Unfortunately we were not able to achieve this.
I was isolated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Nobody, neither on the left nor on the right, would support me.
In order to ensure that we could deal with this here today, I looked for and found support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That means that I had to tone down my original suggestions somewhat, but ultimately I am particularly happy with what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted, and I will support that.
I therefore also support the amendments that were submitted and that were based on my initial compromise amendments.
I hope that we will have a favourable vote, and I welcome the challenge of being able to continue to play a prominent role in this difficult matter at second reading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a draft directive which we have been waiting 20 years for.
The practical application of the polluter pays principle appears to be more complicated than we imagined, which is only reasonable because, of course, we need both to establish liability for restoring environmental damage and to find a way so that the taxpayer does not bear the liability and the cost and pollution is prevented, not just suppressed.
Consequently, we are talking about the objective liability of polluters and about a set of arrangements to influence the behaviour of operators.
This draft directive gives rise to conflicting emotions in me: both satisfaction, because it may pave the way for reform, but merely pave the way, and reservations, because the steps proposed are timid, Commissioner.
For example, biodiversity, as defined in the draft, is restricted to habitats and species covered by the Habitats and Birds Directives, in other words only 13% of the EU's territory.
Secondly, the definition of environmental damage needs to be broader and should also include radiation, damage to air quality and damage to biodiversity caused by genetically modified organisms.
Thirdly, oil pollution and nuclear damage are not covered with the argument that they are covered by international conventions.
However, these generally cover traditional damage and not environmental damage.
In addition, several Member States of the European Union have not signed them.
Furthermore, they contain clauses expressly prohibiting the introduction of provisions governing wider environmental liability.
The directive must therefore be clear and must expressly state what the current liability regime is. There must also be a provision allowing these international conventions to be amended and we must wait for the relevant proposals from the Commission.
In addition, provision is made for exceptions from environmental liability for emissions or activities for which a permit has been issued or which were not considered harmful when the permit was issued.
These are the so-called 'permit and state of the art defences'.
I think that these exceptions undermine the reliability of the objectives of the directive, limit the scope of the liability regime and undermine the polluter pays principle.
There is a study which was carried out by the Commission itself, Commissioner, and which shows that 10 of the 15 Member States of the Union do not make provision for this sort of exception.
Why, therefore, should the new directive encourage numerous Member States to back off when it comes to the severity of their environmental legislation?
Furthermore, the proposal for a directive establishes a public law regime, with the competent authority responsible for determining and securing the appropriate prevention or remediation measures.
However, this may risk putting the burden on the taxpayer.
Thus, initial liability for taking preventive and remediation measures should lie with the operator.
The competent public authority must comply with the procedure for ascertaining and restoring the damage.
Then there is the question of citizens' only having indirect access to justice.
The proposal does not foresee the possibility of citizens' taking direct recourse to justice.
I think that this violates the Aarhus Convention.
I also believe there must be a mandatory operator insurance system with common rules for financial guarantees.
If there is, there will be no distortion of competition. However, if there is not, it may be distorted and, moreover, the prevention system will be weak and I think we shall not see the beneficial impact on the economy that we hope for.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I have the honour of acting as draftsman, approved an opinion in the spirit of these comments.
We are now submitting to the House, together with numerous other honourable Members from numerous political groups, a series of proposals which are less ambitious but which represent a compromise of several views.
We are trying to achieve a rapprochement with the Council's positions so that we can see the Greek Presidency achieve political agreement in the Environment Council on 13 June.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ecosystem and the flow of matter and energy follow a predictable, quantifiable course to which human activity must be adapted.
We do not protect nature just by putting a fence round it.
In order for us to protect the viability of Europe, we need industry and the economy as a whole to turn green.
We cannot say that we are neither with one nor the other.
I trust that the outcome of our vote will send a clear political message to the whole of Europe: that we are determined to lay down a substantial policy which will guarantee better environmental protection, in keeping with the economic and social objectives of the Union.
Our vote will not bring about immediate change.
If we vote in favour of the amendments which we have the honour of presenting to you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we can start paving the way for the gradual introduction of a model of sustainability and responsibility in Europe and beyond.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting here in Parliament on the environmental liability directive, thus bringing to an end what has been a long and, as you know, very controversial debate.
Allow me first to express very special thanks to our rapporteur, Toine Manders, who has worked tirelessly for many months to produce his report.
He really has endeavoured to take account of the views of all of those concerned and has constantly sought to compromise.
Once again I would express my sincere thanks for the constructive dialogue that we have enjoyed.
Before I go any further, allow me also to say very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports both this directive and the Commission proposal.
We want stricter rules on environmental liability.
Those who cause environmental damage in the course of their occupational activities must also be answerable for that.
Compensation should also be paid for damage caused to biological diversity, that is, for what is termed ecological damage.
As such provisions do not yet exist in the Member States, we are entering new territory here.
But I think that it is good that we are entering new territory and my group supports liability for ecological damage, even though we are all aware that it will be difficult to put actual figures on this in practice.
I do understand that it is not always possible to reach a broad consensus where environmental liability is concerned.
However, that is precisely why I am particularly advocating the adoption of the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market today, because the Legal Affairs Committee has issued a clear, moderate and practicable opinion.
The report represents a major step forward towards improved environmental protection and therefore also deserves to receive strong support in tomorrow's vote in the plenary.
It begins, ladies and gentlemen, even with the numerous definitions that are placed at the start of the directive and delineate its scope, for example the definition of biological diversity.
Here, as I have already said, we are entering new territory.
It makes sense, in my opinion, to base the rules on habitats and species that are already protected by European law.
Furthermore, the Member States should be free to designate additional national protection areas, but it would breach the boundaries of the directive in every respect if we went any further than this.
A further example is the directive's scope.
I think that here too we found a compromise in the Legal Affairs Committee that refers to the system of international conventions and makes the relationship with them clear.
The idea is that for those areas in which international systems of establishing liability are effectively in force the environmental liability directive should not apply in the first instance.
I believe that the compromise that has been found here is a sensible one.
Finally, my group also firmly supports the exemptions from liability that are named in the Commission draft.
There are two points at issue here: firstly, permit defence and secondly 'state of the art' defence.
We think it is right for these liability privileges to be listed in the directive.
We also think it is right that those who work their land in accordance with good farming practice should receive a liability privilege.
May I say in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, that we reached a good compromise in the Legal Affairs Committee and I would ask that this compromise also be supported here tomorrow by a majority of this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we expect a great deal of our environment, often too much.
That is why it is high time for us in the European Union to create strict rules on protecting the environment, such as the uniform provisions on environmental liability that we are finally able to deal with today in plenary after lengthy preliminary wrangling in the committees responsible.
Environmental liability is not about punishing old ladies who when out walking their dogs are not conscientious about clearing up after their little darlings.
We need liability provisions that place obligations on all those who cause environmental damage, without exception.
If the money is coming out of their own pocket, those who end up paying for rectifying the damage will soon think twice about how they treat our environment and be more careful.
That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists is in favour of a series of amendments to the Commission text.
There is absolutely no reason why the polluter pays principle should not also apply to pollution caused by the oil industry or the nuclear industry or why it should not apply to the release of genetically modified organisms.
Are not the names Erika and Prestige synonymous with absolutely enormous environmental problems, which still have not been overcome?
Can we see why the State and therefore the community of taxpayers should have to pay for the mistakes of others, simply because the risks appear to be hard to assess or difficult to insure against?
Must we virtually invite people to be careless with the environment because certain polluters are beyond the reach of the law on damages?
No, most certainly not!
It is therefore only logical that our Parliament should ensure that managers of companies that put the environment at risk have insurance or other precautionary financial measures in place so that they can pay for repair and restoration of the environment.
Finally, I should like to address one further point that is of particular importance to us Social Democrats.
The State and therefore the people should not be landed with the responsibility or the bill for rectifying the damage and restoring the environment by the back door either.
Under no circumstances!
The polluter pays principle should apply always and to everyone.
That is why we have tabled an amendment to Articles 4 and 5 in the form of an additional clarificatory paragraph.
The purpose of this amendment is to enable the authorities responsible to set out the steps that need to be taken without having to take action themselves or incur costs in advance, which may be considerable and difficult to recover afterwards.
If the plenary goes along with the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and others in preference to those of the Legal Affairs Committee, we will have environmental liability legislation that assigns the costs fairly and at the same time acts preventively.
In these amendments we demand a minimum of what the people of Europe rightly expect from environmental liability legislation at European level.
This minimum must be reached.
If the results of the individual votes mean that it is not, then to my great regret we will have to reject this important directive as a whole.
Mr President, this proposal by the European Commission is the first attempt to adopt a comprehensive system in the European Union with a view to preventing and repairing environmental damage.
I am sure everyone agrees that we are in urgent need of such a scheme.
However much we agree on the principle, however, the more divided Parliament seems to be on its scope.
How far should we go in protecting the environment and the obligation to repair the damage?
There are numerous specific points of conflict: the precise description of environmental damage, the exclusion of certain industrial sectors, the extent of the polluter pays principle, the fixing of financial guarantees, the insurability of risks and the fixing of maximum amounts for repairing damage.
Our rapporteur, Mr Manders, whom I heartily congratulate, has attempted to reconcile what are often highly diverse standpoints, and I believe the result is a well-balanced report and a well-balanced result which takes account of the many interests and economic sectors involved in this subject.
That is ultimately what we all want: a good, well-defined, uniform European framework which provides a comprehensive approach to environmental damage with specific European standards and the same rules for the whole of the European Union; one in which everybody knows exactly what they must comply with.
I have no doubt that many people, including our green fundamentalists, would like to go much further.
The question is, however, not whether this is necessary or useful, but whether this is achievable at the moment.
After all, the question then arises as to whether this is affordable or insurable for the economic sectors or whether it will remain incalculable for them.
Those parties who would like to go much further must realise that they may be striving for the unachievable and that we may end up empty-handed at the final vote.
We must not allow this to happen.
The most important thing at the moment is to achieve a good general scheme for the immediate future in which we tackle the real responsibilities.
We cannot afford to waste any more time.
Mr President, in January 2002, the Commission finally reached, with this proposal for a directive, the end of a process which had lasted for ten years.
In 1993, in fact, there was already a Green Paper on environmental liability.
The European Parliament, via the ENVI, subsequently urged the Commission, on several occasions, to take rapid action on this subject.
We have waited, therefore, a very long time for the day when there would be a sound proposal on the table.
What, then, does this Commission proposal achieve?
Obviously it does not live up to its stated ambitions.
I believe that the Commission's original ambitions were on a grand scale, but that the final product is disappointing. I also believe that we should draw attention to the factors which are the cause of this disappointment.
The first of these factors is that the definition of the environment is too restricted.
In the case of biodiversity, for example, a proportion estimated to be equivalent to only 20% of biodiversity would be protected, and only 13% of European territory would be covered.
The second factor is the scope of the proposals.
Annex I lists the various economic activities which are covered by the principle of liability without fault.
This list of activities is very restrictive.
In particular, it excludes anything concerning nuclear activities or the transporting of hydrocarbons, without any real justification.
Reference is made to international conventions, which certainly exist but which do not cover the remedying of environmental damage.
I would remind the House of what was said here yesterday by one of our PPE members, Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar, when he complained - quite rightly - about the low level of compensation envisaged by the IOPCF for the victims of the Prestige accident.
We must, therefore, be consistent, and adopt a very firm amendment requiring that, in the case of accidents of this type, what is not covered by the international convention should be covered by our directive.
However, the Commission's proposal does not do this.
The third factor which has to be taken into consideration is the exemptions laid down on the basis of the existence of an operating permit or the existence of scientific knowledge which, at the time of the accident, would not have been sufficiently relevant to justify the liability of the economic activity in question.
For example, in the case of GMOs or of pesticides which are, amongst other things, endocrine disrupters, if one follows this principle then practically all related activities would escape the application of the directive.
This is not acceptable.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that our group supports a series of amendments which are in line with the proposals of Mr Papayannakis to the ENVI, and which have been taken up by Mrs Gebhardt.
I believe that these important changes are essential in order to give this directive real substance.
Mr President, as we know, the environment is 'out'.
It seems to be difficult to arouse any sympathy for environmental standpoints.
This proposal is also suffering from this.
We have been dealing with it for many years, and we always seem to lack the conviction to actually do something about it.
Now there is once again great disagreement about the way in which we should tackle liability.
Industry has been lobbying hard, with arguments which are understandable but which I believe cannot be honoured.
Insurance aspects are in particular being raised.
Yet this has not convinced me to vote in favour of toning down the present proposal.
On the contrary.
I believe that strong environmental liability legislation will have a preventative effect with regard to environmental damage and will encourage the repair of the damage.
'The polluter pays' should be the logical adage.
There has been a limited form of environmental liability based on that principle in the Netherlands for some time now.
It works well, and it saves money.
I believe that the Commission's proposal has already bowed to pressure from industry to too great an extent.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has made this even worse.
I hope that by adopting the amendments submitted by myself and others, we can change the effect of the directive in a positive way.
Over the next few years we will see in practice whether this directive is workable in the European Union.
We do not have to bring things down to the lowest common denominator right from the start.
If it does not work, we can always amend the directive.
It would show real guts if we, as the legislative organ, were to take this risk now in order to avoid the risk of environmental damage.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive on environmental liability which has been presented to us today is a big disappointment to us.
Certainly we want to see European harmonisation in the area of damage caused to the environment, which is often cross-border in nature, but it is also necessary that the directive should represent serious progress.
It features an impressive number of omissions, exemptions, exclusions and limitations of liability, however, which would turn the new rules into an illusion, and often even an opportunity for confusion and for backing away from the objective of protecting the public, unless the taxpayer is called on to make good the deficits.
I can give you two examples to illustrate this point.
The first example is that, in Article 3, we discover that the directive would not apply to the carriage by sea of hazardous substances, to the damage caused by oil pollution and to the damage caused by nuclear activities.
The grounds for this omission are that there already exist international conventions which deal with civil liability in all these areas.
However, these conventions are limited in scope, give insufficient protection or are totally inadequate, as we have seen recently in the case of the derisory compensation awarded by the IOPCF following the Prestige disaster.
Consequently we are demanding that this directive should not shy away from the problem, but that it should deal with it, and provide real protection.
The second example is that of GMOs.
When the directive on the deliberate release of GMOs was being discussed, the Commission promised us that the issues of liability and insurance would be dealt with in the general directive on environmental liability, in other words the directive that we are discussing here today.
However, we have been deceived.
GMOs are certainly covered by this proposal in theory, but under Article 9, which exempts those activities which have been given official authorisation, a category which includes GMOs, they fall within the scope of the directive on deliberate release.
All this is quite intolerable, particularly at a time when the Commission is seeking to unload onto Member States the problem of the co-existence of GMO and non-GMO crops, which is something that it wants to authorise.
In these conditions, we are asking the Council not to remove the moratorium until the issues of liability and insurance in the case of GMOs are clearly resolved in a way that gives optimum protection to the public and to the environment.
Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt thanks - not just a routine thank-you - to Mr Manders, the rapporteur, and to Mrs Niebler for the enormous amount of work they have done.
I would then like to make two points: one specific and the other general.
The specific point is also a response to some of the previous speeches.
If I am not mistaken, the farming world welcomed the proposal for a directive on environmental liability, particularly because the Commission had opted for a horizontal approach.
During the work in Parliament other viewpoints emerged in committee and, as a result, it is now very difficult to accept the idea of farmers being liable for environmental damage the causes of which are beyond their control.
In this regard, any extension of the directive's scope - a compulsory financial guarantee, reversing the burden of proof and, most importantly, excluding some means of exemption - would make it extremely difficult for farmers to manage their activities.
In practical terms, a farmer might be forced to pay compensation for environmental damage caused by an activity, even though he has been issued with a permit to perform that activity and has observed all the relevant legal provisions.
I am sure that farmers are willing to shoulder their responsibilities, but not when they have no control over the cause of the damage.
This is the reasoning underlying our work in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and we have adopted this approach, developing a line which will not have serious consequences for the farming world or for the rural environment in general.
I hope that the rapporteur will agree with this position and that the European Parliament will endorse it.
As regards the general point, it too reflects a fear.
Extending the directive's scope beyond that of the Commission's original proposal would, as I see it, be likely to jeopardise the certainty of the legal framework proposed and the resulting insurance guarantees, thus making it difficult to enforce a principle useful to European society in general.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive presented by the Commission is a timid proposal.
It is timid at a time when there is continuous environmental damage - the most recent example being the 'Prestige' - which is causing indignation amongst all our peoples, with mass demonstrations - in my country, for example, where the people are calling for this type of damage never to happen again.
And faced with this timid directive, the Group of the European Peoples' Party, taking advantage of their current majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has established even more restrictions, making it practically impossible to demand that the people causing the damage should meet their environmental responsibilities.
The polluter pays principle would be entirely jeopardised if the amendments approved on the proposal of the European Peoples' Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs were adopted.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists presented a series of amendments intended to reinforce the content of this directive.
As I said previously, those amendments were rejected in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market by that mechanical majority of the right, but, taking advantage of the fact that such a majority does not exist in the plenary, the Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party has reintroduced that group of amendments - from No 98 to the end - which are aimed at re-establishing the polluter pays principle, at establishing the general principle of responsibility and establishing the possibility of any person affected being able to demand the relevant compensation.
We hope that, in plenary, these amendments presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which are aimed, as I said earlier, at re-establishing, on the one hand, the whole of the directive and, on the other, at reinforcing the directive as a whole so that the damage caused, for example, by maritime goods transport, by nuclear accidents, by the damage caused by the spread of genetically modified organisms or even by biotechnology, can be effectively repaired.
I hope that the plenary of the European Parliament will approve this group of amendments and thereby rectify the text adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as a result of this unilateral approach favouring the people causing the damage.
I believe this is a justified aspiration, which the citizens of the European Union expect from us, and I therefore hope that the modified text will be accepted.
And specifically, I imagine that the Commission will have to provide a little more detail in relation to the statements by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, since we would like to know a little more precisely what the Commission's attitude is to both the amendments which have been approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the amendments which we hope will be approved once the plenary gives its opinion on the group of amendments we have now presented.
Mr President, like other Members here today, I have been lobbied extensively about this directive and I have been impressed by the degree of support - or at least the support in principle - for it.
Environmentalists regard it as a holy grail, the means by which the polluter pays principle can be put into concrete form.
Industry representatives have told me that they too agree with the principle and the insurance industry has said that it can make it work, so long as it is introduced gradually and they have time to cost it properly.
So why does this House, and my group too, find itself so very divided over an issue about which everyone seems to agree?
It seems that the principle is fine so long as it is never turned into practice.
In this instance I regard myself as a pragmatist, I want to ensure that the legislation is workable and does not impose crippling burdens on industry or on agricultural producers.
That is one reason why I oppose the introduction of joint and several liability.
If there is a danger to the environment, then someone has to pay and when the polluters can be clearly identified, then they should be first in line.
All organisations should, above all, be very conscious of the need to take measures to prevent damage in the first place.
I believe the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not done this House justice.
It has taken positions which are not only minimalist but actually retrograde, and which weaken the Commission's proposals.
This House must make changes.
I do not agree with altering the legal base.
We should extend the definition of environmental damage to safeguard special habitats and species.
We should take the chance to put pressure on Member States that have failed to ratify the international marine conventions.
We should give citizens the right to go to court directly to prevent environmental damage or to seek redress.
None of this is very radical.
We have all expressed concern about the damage done to our environment by human activity.
This measure is one way in which we can start to do something practical to protect it and to put all our fine words into real effect.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, like all my group I essentially welcome this proposal and the opportunity to speak on its behalf.
As my friend Mr Lannoye said, it is, if not 'too little, too late', at any rate 'not very much and rather late'.
But it is a step in the right direction and it is very important to establish the polluter pays principle.
After all, most human activities have some impact on the environment.
The issue is who tidies up afterwards - the person who causes it or somebody else?
Like many members of this House I have received powerful representations from local authorities in my own constituency in Scotland, saying that if this directive is not carried local authorities and other public bodies will continue to have to deal, out of general tax revenues, with the problems which other people ought either to have prevented in the first place or be dealing with at present.
It is worth reminding ourselves that the polluter pays principle is only half the story.
The fact of the matter is that those who pollute are engaged in economic activities producing goods or services which other people want to buy, presumably at the price at which they are offered.
If the polluter does not pay, the problem is that the price is too low and consumers get a kind of a free lunch for which they then have to pay afterwards in their capacity as taxpayers.
We must try to ensure, therefore, that we have a regime which is genuinely directed at those producers and activities which can take better precautions and adequately insure against liability so that the pressure of insurance premium liabilities and the cost of insurance premiums reward those who are most careful and push up prices for those who are least careful, thereby creating a virtuous circle.
With regard to that issue, I have had much doubt throughout the debates about the so-called state-of-the-art and permit defences, as there is a rationale which says that people should be able to work closely to the terms of, for example, a carefully designed permit and thereby guarantee themselves against liability.
On the whole though, I have come to the view expressed in Amendment No 104 that these matters should be treated as matters of litigation rather than matters of exemption, which is a reasonable compromise to reach, so we very strongly support the directive on condition that the relevant amendments are carried.
Mr President, drafting legislation on environmental liability is like opening Pandora's box, because environmental damage is so badly defined by the directive, and the scope of the directive is so vague, particularly with regard to biodiversity, which is already governed by the international Berne and Bonn Conventions.
The 'remedying' aspect would be limited to Natura 2000 areas and would exclude non-profit-making activities such as leisure activities, which the directive treats as equivalent to occupational activities.
Nor does the directive cover either the transporting of hydrocarbons or GMOs.
Remedying should be based on objective and quantifiable criteria, on the nature of the damage and its impact, on the state of the environment where the damage occurs, and on local circumstances.
The state-of-the-art and permit concepts should be retained so that the polluter pays principle can be effectively applied, and so as not to allow that principle to be replaced by the 'taxpayer pays' principle.
Liability must include GMOs, particularly at a time when the United States is putting pressure on to try to get the moratorium on imports lifted in the context of the WTO negotiations.
More generally, what is the point of transferring the liability arrangements to Community level, when the Danish initiative for a Council framework decision on the combating of serious environmental crime falls within the scope of legal cooperation, particularly when there are other legal instruments that could be used, such as the Lugano Convention?
Mr President, Commissioner, we have waited a long time for a system of environmental liability, a system which would be sufficiently stringent but at the same time objective and workable, so as to protect the environment without harming either the industrial or the agricultural economy.
Moreover, it is essential that the application of such liability should not cause any distortion in competition.
However, I have to say that this proposal seems to me to be disappointing and rather ineffectual, and it does not completely satisfy our expectations.
The polluter pays principle is a fundamental principle, but it must be accompanied by financial guarantees.
This proposal does not talk about the marine transport of hydrocarbons, and this is something that I deplore.
For example, when we see the example set by the IOPCF in the sad affair of the Prestige, when we observe the constant stream of incidents of fuel dumping at sea, we might think that there was still a lot to be done in order to make certain occupations aware of their liability.
On this point, our anger is in direct proportion to the extent of the damage done to biodiversity.
The proposals on this subject are inadequate, and I should also be interested to hear what the Commissioner thinks about the decision by the IOPCF.
Finally, this liability must be in proportion to the acknowledged fault.
We must avoid any question of joint and several liability, which would shift part of the liability onto other people.
The taxpayer should not have to support financially the damage caused by others.
In conclusion, I should like to say that remedying does not appear to me to be the only solution.
There should be more prevention.
Moreover, I welcome any efforts that businesses can make in this direction by means of voluntary agreements - something that we shall be talking about shortly - but at the same time I am most anxious to ensure that an effective system of financial guarantees should be put in place.
That is all I wanted to say to you.
I am convinced that it will certainly be necessary to talk about this system of environmental liability again.
Mr President, the directive we are about to vote on can and must be clearly perceived as a turning point by the European citizens.
Seveso, the disasters, with which we are sadly, all familiar, in the Natural Park of DoÃ±ana and the sinking of the oil tanker, the Prestige, and, last but not least, the confirmation of the devastating future health implications of the environmental degradation caused by the Priolo chemical plant, are all incidents which call for the establishment of a European system of civil liability for environmental damage.
We need to send out a strong political signal, which will help, not least, to stop some regressive tendencies which are emerging here and there.
As Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, for example, is quite aware, the Italian Government is about to undertake a revision of the penal code, planning, inter alia, to remove the penalties for crimes against the environment.
Therefore, there is all the more need for a system rigorously applying the polluter pays principle and thus creating powerful incentives for preventing and avoiding the repetition of such situations in the future.
Indeed, the ultimate goal is prevention, not the provision of compensation for damage.
To this end, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have endeavoured to achieve the removal of some of the dangerous exemptions which allow wide-ranging, general means of protection and which, in actual fact, turn the environmental authorisations into a sort of licence to pollute, with the serious danger that the effectiveness of the proposed legislative system will be nullified.
We have tried to ensure that it is the operator responsible, not the taxpayer, who bears the costs of remedying the environmental damage.
It is, moreover, necessary for all the economic activities which could result in environmental damage to be taken into consideration and provided for in the liability system.
This system should lay down, as a general rule, specific liability for environmental damage, irrespective of whether the activity causing the damage is deemed to be dangerous or not.
This directive is vitally important.
Now long-awaited, it will be a fundamental element of European environmental legislation, provided, however, that the changes which we have worked on with the 16 compromise amendments to reinforce the text are adopted.
I strongly urge you to adopt the compromise amendments, which repropose the substance of the text that was adopted in the Committee on the Environment and then nullified by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; if the amendments are not adopted, as Mrs Gebhardt has already said, particularly if Amendments Nos 99, 103 and 107 are not adopted, our group will not be able to vote for the Manders report.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Davies has been talking about an environmental Holy Grail.
I must say that I am also pleased that a level playing field is being created for all parties involved in creating environmental damage.
This means that it will be easier for the business community to comply with this directive.
There are, however, two things that I would like to point out.
The first is the question of nuclear energy and non-regulated businesses.
The second question is that of maritime transport.
I live near two nuclear power stations, namely the only commercial nuclear power station in my country and also the Doel in Belgium.
How is this regulated at the moment?
The owners of the nuclear power stations only have limited liability, and the State absorbs that.
In Belgium, for example, that amounts to EUR 300 million per power station, and in my country the figure is EUR 2.26 billion.
This seems a lot of money, but it is in fact very little if you consider that these power stations are located in an industrial area.
I find it inexplicable that the public and businesses will be held liable and that businesses allied to the state will be exempted from this kind of liability.
I find the amendment that asks for this to be reviewed in 5 years' time very flexible, and I think that the Commission must adopt it and that we must also vote on it.
The same applies to liability for maritime transport.
I asked about liability relating to the Tricolor disaster two months ago, and I have not yet had any replies to my questions.
We are asking for this to also be included in the directive and the international conventions reviewed and for the loopholes to be closed.
Finally, I would like to come back to nuclear energy.
Nuclear energy is always regarded as a cheap kind of energy, but if all the costs were to be charged on, including the costs relating to environmental damage, the question is whether wind energy and other environmentally-friendly forms of energy would not be equally competitive.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to create a level playing field for this issue as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, numerous speakers have stressed the importance of this environment directive.
We actually ought to have been ambitious enough to make it the centrepiece of our environmental legislation.
It is all the more regrettable that industry has managed to insert a series of exemptions in these provisions.
Polluters actually ought to be answerable for the damage that they have caused and ought also to be obliged to take preventive measures.
Given that there are so many exemptions and that only a very small number of accidents are covered by this directive, I fear that we will not achieve what we originally set out to do.
As you know, accidents only qualify as such if those causing them are negligent or otherwise at fault, which means that damage to biodiversity caused by the use of licensed genetically modified seed is not covered at all.
This is very regrettable.
Furthermore, the fact that the notion of strict liability is linked to the list of dangerous activities in this way means that entire areas that pose a potential risk, such as mining and drilling for oil and gas, are also excluded, as is a large proportion of the consumer goods industry.
The fact that there is no obligation to introduce general insurance for environmental damage is also a mistake in my view, because we have to ensure that when damage is caused to property and health, liability is not only restricted to Natura 2000 areas, but also applies further afield. Nevertheless, provided that the Commission sees reason, I hope that we will succeed in making this environmental liability directive the centrepiece of our legislation.
I also hope that it will not remain full of holes like a Swiss cheese which would mean that it only applied in a very few cases, because if so we would not achieve our aims, which are to give industry incentives to take preventive measures and really to make the polluter pays principle the focus of our action.
Mr President, it emerged in Denmark at the weekend that glyphosate has penetrated into the upper groundwater reservoirs.
That is very significant in a country like Denmark where we drink water directly from the tap.
The crop spray is called Roundup and is manufactured by Monsanto.
Roundup is approved and used extensively in the rest of the EU.
For me, it is no surprise that poison, when systematically dispersed, ends up in our precious groundwater.
It has to be possible, in a case like this, to hold Monsanto clearly liable for what has happened to Danish groundwater.
Monsanto is also behind the large-scale genetic modification of plants.
Plants are genetically modified so that they become resistant to, for example, Roundup, with the result that weeds can be sprayed more vigorously without the crop being damaged.
It should therefore also be possible to hold Monsanto liable for the disease and permanent damage that will be caused by the use of genetically modified crops.
In Denmark, we have banned a large proportion of the pesticides on the market in the rest of the EU.
The EU is now in the process of forcing Denmark to lift the ban on a number of these pesticides.
It has compelled Denmark to use the genetically modified plants without making anyone liable for the pollution of the countryside that this involves.
It is completely unacceptable.
Mr President, for as long as mankind has been here on earth, he has been polluting.
The more people there are, the more sophisticated they become, the worse that pollution potentially gets.
Some damage, given human nature and the fallen world we live in, is inevitable.
Self-evidently, prevention is the first priority and in any event, pollution should be kept to a minimum.
But where it does occur, those responsible should make amends.
What we must recognise, however, is that much of what creates a threat to our environment may not only be helping mankind in other ways but may actually be helping the environment itself.
This legislation is a piece of civil, not criminal, law.
It is not about punishing wrongdoers but apportioning and allocating responsibility for environmental damage.
Punishment should be meted out by criminal sanctions not civil liability.
There are others who see this as a skirmish in some kind of Manichean struggle between the public sector, which is good, and the private sector, which is bad.
Such 20th-century class warfare has no place today.
The two are complementary.
They are interdependent and responsibility for the consequences of pollution should be shared and allocated between them.
The private sector cannot and should not walk away from the consequences of its actions, and the public sector, and indeed society and the public at large cannot wash their hands and privatise the responsibilities incurred in regulating the private sector while enjoying the benefits which accrue from their actions.
Further, since pollution is a practical problem, remedial actions must be practical too.
Fantasy solutions are as detrimental as pollution itself.
