Let us, in short, put all or most anxieties to one side.
I want to ask two questions.
First, will the peace that breaks out drive Palestinians and Israelis into an historic reconciliation?
The state of the Palestinians was described last week by Peter Hansen, Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency, and one of the finest international public servants in the world.
'The stark fact is', he wrote, 'that almost a quarter of Palestinian children are suffering from acute or chronic malnutrition for purely man-made reasons.
No drought has hit Gaza and the West Bank, no crops have failed and the shops are often full of food.
But the failure of the peace process and the destruction of the economy by Israel's closure policy have had the effect of a terrible natural disaster'.
Second, in the aftermath of a war, will America - the leader of a UN-backed operation or of a more limited coalition - take a much more proactive role in forging an Israeli-Palestinian peace?
We have been told that will happen.
European leaders have been told that will happen.
We have been told that the road map will see the light of day before we all run out of road.
I sincerely hope that is so.
I genuinely fear the outcome if war in Iraq is followed by another year or more of violence in Palestine and Israel. That would further inflame opinion in the Islamic world.
Some say that to defeat terrorism it is necessary to defeat Saddam Hussein.
That may or may not be true - some of us are at the very least agnostic on that point.
But what I am absolutely sure about is that to invade Iraq, while failing to bring peace to the Middle East, would create exactly the sort of conditions in which terrorism would be likely to thrive.
(Applause from the centre and the left)
And the truth is - and we should face this fact - that none of us would be immune from the consequences of that.
(Applause)
Mr President, we rejoice at the presence among us today of the President-in-Office of the Council, and hope that we will be able to rejoice in welcoming him here on many more occasions during the Greek Presidency.
Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, when issues of war and peace are at stake, we conduct our debates not only with our minds, but also, self-evidently, with all the passion we have, and must work on the assumption that we will, eventually, avert the threat and, it is to be hoped, secure peace at the same time.
We must introduce our analysis of the situation by describing the actual facts in clear terms.
We would not be having this debate, and the Security Council would not be giving its attention to the same issue that we are discussing, were it not for Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad.
We have to declare in explicit language that Saddam Hussein's regime depends for its existence upon a secret service, upon violence, murder and terror.
I am very much in agreement with the President-in-Office of the Council when he says that our goal must be Iraq's complete disarmament.
My dear friends, before we fix our gaze on America - about which I will be saying something in a moment - and before we criticise the Americans, the first point we have to make is that Saddam Hussein must disarm completely.
That is at the heart of the problem.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us now take a look at America.
It is with great disquiet that I see America put in the dock - around the world, not just in Europe - and so what I ask of us all is that we discuss these things in a right and proper way with our American partners and friends.
I remember very well our debate in Brussels on the day after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.
Let us remind ourselves of those hours on 11 September 2001, those few hours in which it seemed as if the nerve centre of the USA - not only the Pentagon, but also the White House and the Capitol - might be hit, in which event the United States would have been incapacitated.
It is because such a thing would have been a vision of horror that we say that it is a good thing that the United States of America exists.
We are America's friends and partners.
That is true of our group.
(Applause)
It is because of this as much as because we acknowledge America's great historic achievements - in the face of the twentieth century's National Socialism and Communism - that I ask that, when talking about America today, we be constantly aware that America is a democracy, and that the Americans have always resolved difficult situations by their own democratic means.
The same will be true now.
Let us also remind ourselves that, although Saddam Hussein is now starting to disarm, to start ridding himself of weapons he has always maintained he did not even possess, such as the El-Samud 2 rockets, perhaps the nerve gas and the anthrax pathogens, he is willing to progressively dispose of these weapons only because there are 260 000 American soldiers in the region.
It would be a great achievement for President George W. Bush if the presence of these troops were to succeed - by peaceful means - in bringing about Iraq's total disarmament.
(Applause)
This is something we have to make utterly clear.
Whilst there will of course be differences of opinion on an issue as important as this one, I speak for the whole of my group when I say that we are united in the belief that our moral strength lies in the respect we accord to the law.
So, just as Commissioner Patten and Mr Papandreou have done, we declare that any eventual action against Iraq must be taken by the international community and under international law.
It is for that reason that we hope that the United Nations will succeed in using peaceful means to steer Iraq towards disarmament.
Now it is time for us Europeans to look at ourselves.
We always make a big thing of criticising America, but it is not that there is too much of America - there is not enough of Europe.
Where Iraq is the issue, it is not a good sign when one government after the other goes its own way without consulting with the others beforehand.
(Applause)
Right now, I do not want to criticise individual governments, but Europe's underlying bane is that everyone thinks they have to go their own way in isolation from everyone else.
If we carry on like that, we will not get anywhere in the world, nor will we be able to influence our American friends, but will have to ask ourselves how we Europeans can become capable of contending for our values on the world stage, as the President-in-Office of the Council very rightly said.
Let me just make two additional observations.
We must endeavour by all peaceful means to prevent this confrontation with Iraq's criminal regime from becoming a confrontation with the Arab world.
Mr President, I would be very much in favour of an invitation to President Bouteflika of Algeria or to President Mubarak of Egypt to address plenary being sent out as soon as possible, for this would enable us to express our desire for partnership and - if at all possible - friendship with the Islamic and Arab world.
We welcome the visit to Algeria by the French President, which has met with great success.
He has stated that we have to step up the Mediterranean dialogue, and I hope for all our sakes that we can ensure that these words are not only that, but that they will be followed up by actions - actions not only in terms of political cooperation, but also in the sense of helping the countries of North Africa to help themselves, thus giving their people a future and preventing them from being led astray into violence of whatever kind.
Partnership and friendship with the Arab world!
Let me conclude by saying that Israel has a new government.
What we ask of Prime Minister Sharon is that he should now use his power to draw one step closer to the Palestinians in order to achieve a genuine peace settlement, with the State of Israel within secure borders, as well as a Palestinian state in which Palestinians can live with dignity.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if we redouble our efforts towards this end - which will involve common action rather than each country of the European Union going its own way - we will be able, on the global stage, to achieve something for our values of freedom, democracy, and peace.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to convey a message to the Spring Summit on the basis of the resolution that we adopted in January in Parliament and which remains fully in force.
We said 'no' three times: 'no' to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 'no' to tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and 'no' to unilateralism.
We also said 'yes' three times: 'yes' to the UN and multilateralism, 'yes' to disarmament and 'yes' to democracy.
On the basis of these observations, we feel that politics and diplomacy must continue to be given precedence over the use of preventive violence, which will only lead to more fanaticism and polarisation.
Last Friday, in the Security Council, Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei presented an account of the progress made on the inspections and on the efforts to disarm Iraq.
Their report confirmed that progress has been made, including, where ballistic weapons are concerned, the gradual destruction of Al-Samoud missiles and others.
Although he has done so reluctantly - 'Ã  contre-coeur', as the French say - Saddam Hussein must allow the inspection work to go ahead.
We also say that we must pursue a clear policy of inspection backed up by pressure, as stated in Security Council Resolution 1441.
We must continue working on this basis, because war can be avoided and a peaceful solution is still possible.
Jimmy Carter, winner of the Nobel Peace prize, has written that, where Iraq is concerned, alternatives to war clearly exist and that a war would be unwarranted.
The authoritative voice of the former US President joins the multitude of voices that, in a way that is unprecedented in history, continue to call throughout the world for a massive unilateral attack on Iraq to be totally rejected.
We are entitled to ask ourselves what we would gain from waging a preventive war, especially given the US war plan to drop, as they have said they would, around 3 000 bombs, including 'the mother of all bombs'.
At the outset of a potential invasion, however precise the operation is, massive collateral damage will ensue.
This means that the Iraqi people will be punished twice; first there is the punishment of living in a dictatorship and then there would be the punishment of the massive destruction of the civilian population, unleashing a torrent of death and destruction on a population half of which is under fifteen years old and which has a per capita income similar to that of the Palestinians.
Incidentally, Mr President, it is extremely important that the European Union does not allow the roadmap for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to be put on hold: we must hope that this process is reopened.
Our group feels that the approach we should adopt is to continue applying Resolution 1441, within the framework of the law and of international law.
In our view, a preventive war neither guarantees world security nor complies with international law.
In fact, it will put us into the hands of those who truly advocate the clash of civilisations and an attack on this basis would give an excellent boost to international terrorism.
Preventive war as an instrument of defence policy does not fit in with our community of shared values, which is founded on mutual respect between nations and peoples, and such a war unequivocally breaches the principle of multilateralism and current international law, as upheld by the United Nations, which was created in San Francisco in 1945 - fundamentally due to the efforts of the United States, it should be remembered.
Like Kofi Annan, we reiterate that any unilateral action would breach the United Nations Charter.
The international community's ambition to ensure world security must be based on preventive policies, not on preventive attacks.
We must be more ambitious and more decisive if we are to resolve the causes of inequality, violence and poverty.
I wonder, as we all do, what the consequences of a rapid military victory would be.
What plan is proposed for addressing the extremely complex problems faced by the region?
Are we attempting to achieve the fast-track democratisation of a nation - mapped out on the drawing board after the First World War, composed of Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and Turkmen - or are we attempting to establish a neo-colonial proconsulship, which can only be sustained by the force of these weapons?
I recommend that the White House reads the observations of the British General Maude, who entered Baghdad in 1918, and read to the Iraqis a letter in the style of the Three Kings, who also apparently - according to the Gospels - came from Babylon. This letter promised peace, happiness and democracy in six months.
Six months later, there was war in Baghdad.
We must bear this in mind and learn the lessons of history.
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, especially for Europe, to transcend our divisions. This is our message, which I repeat on behalf of my group.
We must be guided by solidarity and by our commitments to one another, as laid down in the Treaties.
These are obligations that are binding on all our States and on all our citizens.
We therefore require the Spring Summit, to be held next week, to make all necessary efforts to create a united European voice, as the Treaties stipulate.
Once they have signed a joint communiquÃ©, each country cannot then pursue its own approach and there can be no repetition of the farce witnessed in the Security Council.
All we need to do is take a blackboard to the summit, of the type used in schools, and explain that, if we had four votes plus one, the Europeans would have a decision.
Why?
Because we cannot, as a result of our division - and I am referring now to countries on both sides - be putting terrible pressure on Latin-Americans or Africans to get us out of the mess, because they too have their dignity and it is unacceptable to wring votes out of people under duress, with an attitude that is interpreted in those countries as totally neo-colonialist.
We therefore need, and this is a very basic equation that all Heads of Government could understand ?
(Applause)
? we need our votes, plus that of Bulgaria.
This would change matters, and, furthermore, Mr President - and with this I shall conclude - would make the Security Council even more relevant, and not irrelevant as the US Secretary of State for Defence, or for War, Mr Rumsfeld, claims.
What makes the UN irrelevant is saying that we will be going to war whatever happens.
We must state, and this is one of the European Union's major responsibilities, that in the face of preventive and unilateral action, international law must be made to prevail.
(Applause)
Mr President, an eminent and noble friend of mine recounts how he became convinced of the need for regime change in Iraq when during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Iraqi soldiers put Kuwaiti prisoners of war into manholes, closed the covers, poured petrol through the air vents and set them alight.
Few can be unaware of the barbarity of Saddam Hussein's regime, either towards his own citizens or towards others, and for that reason I applaud the initiative of my friend and colleague, Mr Rutelli, in seeking to establish an international criminal tribunal for Iraq.
Iraq has been under notice from the international community for over a decade and our patience on the issue of disarmament is running very thin.
For Liberals in this House good relations between Europe and the United States of America are of huge importance.
Our commitment to shared values, our commitment to economic and cultural ties reflected in our military alliance are things that we hold dear.
We share America's pain about the attacks of 11 September, and not just because European citizens were among those so brutally murdered.
But we do not share the US President's view that war against Iraq is justified at this stage.
The report presented by Hans Blix to the UN Security Council last Friday does not make a case for immediate military action.
On the contrary, he reported substantial disarmament and, while he recognised that cooperation was by no means immediate, he welcomed it as active, even proactive.
His report showed that inspections are delivering tangible results for the weapons inspectors, sufficient to be given the additional months needed to complete Iraqi disarmament.
To pull the rug from under Hans Blix's feet and resort to war now, would be incomprehensible to moderate opinion around the world.
I would ask our American friends to pause and reflect, if only for a few minutes, on some fundamental questions.
Will a regime change in Iraq help bring to justice Al-Qaeda terrorists?
Will upheaval in a secular Arab state advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine?
And would not the cost of continued vigilance, resilience and patience be lower than the cost of war and reconstruction?
We must not underestimate the casualties of war, and not only the human casualties, though they would be many and costly, but the diplomatic casualties of which the collapse of the reconciliation talks in Cyprus is perhaps the first.
As the crisis unfolds we are also approaching a critical moment for the future credibility of the United Nations and a world order based on the rule of law.
The remarkable unity displayed by the international community last November in agreeing unanimously to Resolution 1441 is in danger of falling apart.
We are witnessing the unedifying sight of the pro- and anti-war factions in the Security Council seeking to win over the undecided countries through bullying, bribery and even blackmail.
The dignity and integrity of the United Nations is at stake.
Having gone down the UN route to achieve Iraqi disarmament, a decision which my group warmly welcomed at the time, the United States must stick with the multilateral route.
For the US to disregard a UN decision against early military action would deal a potentially fatal blow to the United Nations.
It does not matter whether this decision is reached because of the failure to muster the required nine votes or because of a French or Russian veto.
A veto one opposes will always be less reasonable than a veto one imposes.
Yet rules are rules, and UN backing for military action must not be circumvented on the grounds that a veto is 'unreasonable'.
It would be far better for any vote on a new resolution to be postponed until a consensual outcome can be achieved. The elements of a consensus can be readily identified, if only the artificial demands of a pre-determined military timetable could be set aside.
Mr President-in-Office, you have told us that war can still be avoided.
The gates of the Temple of Janus have been unlocked, if not yet opened.
Hans Blix has set out the disarmament tasks which remain to be achieved and these tasks could be set out in a new resolution as clearly defined benchmarks to be met by Iraq in the coming months.
Recognising that Iraq has only moved as far as it has because of the threat of military force, why not keep up the pressure until the process is completed?
If Saddam Hussein fails to meet the benchmarks in the resolution, then the diplomatic and inspections options will have been exhausted and the international community would have the moral authority and legitimacy to resort to war.
In conclusion, it is claimed in London, Washington and Madrid that war could be short, swift and successful.
With UN support this could indeed be the case, but without it, in a conflict which divides the international community, we could be on the brink of another Hundred Years War which could bring down regimes well beyond Iraq.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, even though the vote in the Security Council has not yet, as we speak, taken place, we already know that, whatever happens, it will leave only one legal option open, namely the peaceful option of disarming Iraq via the inspections.
Anyone who took it upon themselves to go beyond that mandate and to start a war unilaterally would be defying the whole of the international community.
I hope that they would be calling upon themselves exemplary political penalties exacted by their own peoples.
As for their credibility in the eyes of the world, it would no doubt be adversely affected for a long time.
To show too much of one's 'hard power' is to run the risk of ruining one's 'soft power'.
Unfortunately, it is the whole of international society that would run the risk of being destabilised by this material breach of the rules which democracies laid down for themselves after the Second World War.
Yet this is precisely what the President of the United States is envisaging quite shamelessly.
It is not only the war on Iraq that should spur us into action, but also the unilateralist - and in our view imperialist - policy that surrounds that war.
When it comes to taking action, we are short of neither trump cards nor allies.
Never, since the end of the cold war, has there been, on a world-wide scale, such a powerful camp clearly in favour of peace and promoting the law and multilateral cooperation.
It is within that camp that the voice of Europe promoting world solidarity must and will have to make itself heard.
Our allies are, first of all, the people of the entire world, starting with those of the European Union, not just the 15 current Member States, but the 25 present and future Member States.
This makes even more legitimate our demand for in-depth discussion between Member States and with our partners, before the ratification of the accession treaties and the vote on the future constitution and on the vision of Europe which we intend to promote together in order to respond to the will expressed by our fellow citizens.
This unprecedented explosion of public opinion has, no doubt, made it easier for a large majority of the governments of the world to take a stand against the war, starting with the governments of the countries of the South, and, in particular, the Non-Aligned Movement, which alone represents two thirds of the United Nations General Assembly.
That is our second trump card.
In that respect, how despicable and crass is the blackmail used by Colin Powell on the most dependent of those countries in order to try to extract from them a vote without any popular support!
We are also supported by all of what the world regards as great moral authorities, such as Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela, former President Carter and the Secretary General of the United Nations in person, Kofi Annan, all of whom have committed themselves with passion and dignity to the cause of peace and respect for the United Nations Charter.
Let us also pay homage to all those authorities on international law who teach at Oxford, Cambridge or the London School of Economics and those three hundred eminent Spanish legal authors, who all deny that there is any legal justification for the use of military force against Iraq even before the event.
Another important dimension is the contribution of the weapons inspectors, who have shown great firmness towards Baghdad while, at the same time, standing up to Washington and London, which they have not been slow to accuse of having given them false information.
I should also like to make special mention of those men and women working for the UN agencies, who are often, along with certain European representatives in the region, the only ones to think first and foremost of the people of that region, and of the torment that is being imposed on them in Iraq, in Palestine, and in the Arab world in general.
Thanks are also due to Mr Patten for some of the strong and just words that he spoke on the subject this morning.
Another influential player on the scene today is the Franco-German alliance, which will have held good, even though it means paying the price of political courage in the face of a greater power.
As for other allies, it was on the other side of the Atlantic that we found them.
We, that is to say the diverse delegation of Members of the European Parliament who had already visited Baghdad last month, have just established, at the US Congress, long-term cooperation links with the elected representatives of Washington, Ohio, California and even Texas.
There, you have a United States which does not despise Europe, but which places its hopes in Europe and welcomes its representatives with open arms.
What, then, did our US friends tell us?
They told us that 126 elected representatives voted against war, notably two thirds of the Democrat representatives; that 130 US cities, including Washington, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, have adopted resolutions opposing military action, that AFL-CIO, the major group of affiliated trade unions, has declared itself to be of the same opinion, and that the anti-war movement (United for Peace and Justice, Women for Peace, etc.) is receiving unprecedented support prior to the start of the conflict.
The New York Times, too, has chosen to say no to war.
This is a far cry from the sacred union that some people have been telling us about.
Congressman Dennis Kucinich, the spokesman for the coalition for peace, echoed these sentiments when he told us, 'George W. Bush has threatened to isolate those Europeans who are resisting his claim to supremacy; this is a perfect moment to take one another by the hand'.
Finally, Mr President, may we each have the US friends that we deserve.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are some things that I just cannot understand.
For example, we always defend the Treaties.
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union says one very simple thing, namely that all the governments represented within the Security Council must uphold the position defined by the European Union.
Spain, the UK, France and Germany must therefore uphold a common position.
The common position defined by the leaders of the European Union, whether we like it or not, does not talk about ultimatums or about the consequences of war. It says that the work of the inspectors should be continued.
This is precisely the memorandum proposed by France and Germany.
I do not, therefore, see how, in the name of the Treaty, Spain and the UK can fail to uphold that position.
In the final analysis, we must have a decision, within Europe, on the real nature of our Treaties.
Mrs de Palacio del Valle-Lersundi, who has always plagued us with her explanations of the Treaties here in Parliament, should remember that she used to defend the Treaties which she herself is now flouting in her role as Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Frankly, I do not understand why it is necessary to make war when we have won the war already.
Why take military action when we have won without it?
We have to admit that, without the US, there would not be any inspectors now.
There would be no inspection and no disarmament.
However, since there is disarmament and since there are inspections, it is not necessary to go to war.
Why, therefore, should we shoot and kill, when we can have everything without shooting and killing?
I do not understand it.
We are criticising ourselves by saying that the situation is as it is thanks to a certain amount of determination, whether we like that determination or not.
We are now being told, and I still do not understand it, that we shall be bringing democracy to Iraq. That is very good, that is excellent.
What, then, are we doing with Turkey?
The Turkish parliament is elected. Fine.
It is a democracy. Whether or not we like the people who are elected, that is not our problem.
Then, however, an agreement is concluded with the military, over the heads of the parliament, which consists of democratic representatives, in order to obtain what could not be obtained through democracy, and the Turkish people are told, 'This is how the democracy that we are going to bring you works'.
I simply do not understand it.
For example, we continue to explain that we are going to liberate the people of Iraq.
We tell the Iraqi Kurds that this will be fantastic, that we are going to liberate them using the Turkish army.
That is precisely the sort of liberation that the Kurds have been dreaming of for a hundred years: finally they will be under the domination of the Turkish army!
Obviously, they will find it fantastic!
Yet there is one key to democracy in the region, and that key lies in Teheran.
There is no question of making war on Iran, and yet the people in Iran are fighting for democracy.
The Iranians are the only people who, at the present time, are rising up against their totalitarian regime. They are the only people who are staging massive demonstrations, who are voting in favour of democracy.
Yet we are leaving them to fight alone. We are not helping them, but we then go on to claim that we have brought democracy to other regions.
I believe that we should be doing exactly the opposite.
By helping the Iranian people to liberate themselves, we would be providing the region with two lessons.
The first lesson is that emancipation and democracy are achieved not by the intervention of soldiers from who knows where, but by the will and the determination of the people themselves.
Secondly, if these people manage to emancipate themselves with our help, they will be able to say to all the fundamentalists, to all the terrorists and to all those who are fascinated by totalitarian fundamentalism, 'We know what fundamentalism is; we have suffered its consequences and we have fought it, and we have emancipated ourselves'.
That would be an extraordinary lesson for the region, and far more meaningful than the occupation of Iraq by some US general.
Finally, therefore, let us all stop being blind.
Yes, it is necessary to change the regime in Baghdad, just as it is necessary to change the regime in Saudi Arabia, in Tunisia, and in this or that African country, but that cannot be done by means of a military invasion, of whatever kind.
Let us therefore shoulder responsibility for some of the democracies in the world, and let us not say that peace will reign if there is no military intervention in Iraq.
It is not peace, but then war is not the best way of ensuring that the Iraqi people are finally allowed to live in peace.
They have the right to live in peace, without any US general, but also without Saddam Hussein.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America is a great democracy.
It has contributed much, and if we look at the last 50 years, no one can forget the crucial role that it has played in defending freedom.
This is why I and my group refuse to place ourselves in the awkward position of saying that we are for the US or against the US.
That would be a stupid position.
Having said that, and because we have great esteem and consideration for the United States, we also have the right to tell them that they are wrong, and that the action that they are now taking can only have very serious consequences in the future.
We cannot have it both ways. Either international rules exist and each nation has to obey them, or we believe that we have taken a great step backwards and that, from now on, power takes precedence over law and, as soon as one has power, one is the strongest and has the right to intervene.
In that case, I propose that the United Nations Charter should be amended to the effect that, from now on, the right to interfere should include, for the strongest powers, the right to intervene whenever it seems to them necessary in order to defend their general interests, their vital interests.
The United States has been the victim of a terrible attack.
Thousands of its people have been killed.
No one can forget that.
It therefore has the right to defend itself; it has the right to respond.
Who, though, was responsible for those attacks?
It was the Al Qaeda organisation.
Is there any proof of links between Al Qaeda and Iraq?
The answer is no, there is no proof.
Consequently, the United States, before engaging in this military operation, should tell us what its real reasons are, the deep-seated reasons why it wants to intervene.
If it is a question of changing the map of this part of the world, I can say immediately that this would have immeasurable consequences and would pave the way for the emergence of a new generation of terrorists and for a lasting gulf between the Muslim world and the rest of the world.
That is extremely worrying.
That is why we in our group are agreed that every effort must be made to achieve a solution to this problem by means of disarmament.
From then on, once this principle has been established, the decisions will not be taken in this House.
There is something nice and surreal about our debates.
Nevertheless, we have the right to say what we think and I would say that, as far as the French delegation is concerned including, in particular, myself, although in no way am I dependent on the French Government, it supports the position adopted by the President of the French Republic, namely to oppose, by all possible means, the launching of a military operation.
Mr President, there is a bizarre contradiction in this Iraq debate.
Reports are reaching me from Iraq about contacts between leading representatives of the Ba'ath regime and the Iraqi opposition.
Saddam's immediate entourage is evidently preparing itself for the fall of the 'Republic of Fear'.
As a last resort it is trying to save its own skin by announcing an uprising now in the event of an American military intervention.
What, though, do I perceive within the European Union?
A number of large Member States are working hard for the political status quo in Iraq.
UN weapons inspections with no clear time limit are supposed to be sufficient to rein in the regime in Baghdad.
On what is this great political credit that they are granting the merciless tyrant Saddam Hussein based?
This irresponsible attitude taken by a number of European countries is met with manifest and widespread incomprehension on the part of the suffering Iraqi population .
Equally negative is the political cost, for the time being, of the Western conflict with Iraq: serious undermining of transatlantic relations, serious division within the European Union itself and growing discord within the international community in the context of the United Nations.
All because of a murderous megalomaniac who for years has simply been refusing to comply fully with UN resolutions.
Such a scenario must encourage similar dictatorships to go their own way where weapons are concerned.
Is there anything that the Member States of the European Union can still salvage from this divisive conflict over Iraq?
I believe that there is.
Firstly, they should very soon make out a case for a clear time limit on the UN inspections in Iraq, a limit that takes sufficient account of the option of armed intervention.
When all is said and done, only the present increase in military power in the Gulf region is going to force Saddam Hussein into any kind of cooperation with the UN inspectors.
At the same time the Member States of the European Union should finally show some concern for Iraq's political and socio-economic future, because there really are alternatives to Saddam's 'Republic of Fear'.
I am looking forward to initiatives from the Greek Presidency on both these issues.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the camp of those who are opposed to the unjust pre-emptive war that the UK and the US intends to launch in Iraq is growing in strength from day to day, both in national public opinions, as demonstrated by surveys and demonstrations, and in the United Nations Security Council.
The diplomatic resolve of France, Germany and Russia may give the politicians of the United Kingdom, and even those of the United States, pause for thought.
War is war, but the prelude to war is not war.
At a time when world peace is on the edge of a precipice, it would not be dishonourable - quite the contrary - to refrain, despite the Homeric speeches and the money that has been spent, from an act which is so unjust, so contrary to human rights, and so dangerous.
Should the US not go to war, it would not be unthinkable for the united European Parliament - why not? - to propose to the parliamentary committee in Oslo that the Nobel Peace Prize be awarded to George W. Bush for having helped to achieve, in Iraq, the objectives set by the United Nations, without shedding blood or tears, that he be credited, on his own account and on behalf of his people, with having gained this great peaceful victory.
If things turn out differently, however, and if the unfortunate people of Iraq, especially the children, are sacrificed to the demons of war, the consequences will be disastrous.
The resulting shake-up of the world would release the forces of evil everywhere.
Then again, what would be the next stage in the promised reshaping of the Middle East?
Would the next target of the super-power's army be Iran, Syria, or other countries, for there would then be no limit to the law that the strongest power prevails?
Mr President, this is a very special day for me in the European Parliament.
I have heard speeches from Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Le Pen which I consider to be indistinguishable.
(Mixed reactions)
Since we last debated the Iraq crisis the stakes have increased.
The clear issue remains that Saddam is still playing for time.
The United Nations call for disarmament, as set out very clearly and unanimously by Resolution 1441, today continues to be unfulfilled.
That is the truth of the situation we face.
We recognise that this situation is dangerous and volatile, but let us be clear that it remains dangerous and volatile thanks to the continuing evasion of the Iraqi regime and, sadly, also the gamesmanship of some European governments.
These governments appear to have lost sight of the fundamental issue that is at stake here, which is the very real threat that the regime in Baghdad poses to the peace and security of the Middle East and indeed to the wider world.
Even at this late stage let us not forget that Saddam refuses to explain what has happened to the stockpile of chemical weapons, biological weapons and nerve agents that were detected by the UN inspectors in 1998.
Unless the democracies of the world are prepared to speak out with a united voice on the need for immediate and unconditional disarmament, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein will continue on his current road of playing cat and mouse with the United Nations on an indefinite basis.
I must say that the events of recent months have also demonstrated two important truths for us here in the European Parliament and for Europe more generally.
Firstly, we undermine the unity of NATO at our peril.
Some anti-American voices in Europe have been playing out their contempt for all things American, and we may hear more of that in this debate.
We have also seen some politicians in Europe who are prepared to weaken NATO and the transatlantic alliance in their aim of developing Europe as some sort of antagonist or counter-weight, rather than as an ally of the United States.
Let me make it clear beyond any doubt, on behalf of the British Conservatives, that we stand resolutely behind NATO as the bedrock of our security and defence.
I make no apology for repeating our belief in NATO and the value that we attach to our partnership with the United States.
I believe that the actions of France, Germany and Belgium in fomenting division within the Alliance over the crucial issue of Turkey's security are nothing short of deplorable.
The coming days will be a test of the will of the international community and of the credibility of the United Nations.
But let there be no doubt about this: the responsibility for avoiding war remains squarely with Saddam Hussein and it is up to him to choose peace.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I am sure no one disagrees with the comments made by the President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, Mr Papandreou, and by Commissioner Patten.
I just wanted to add that, in this particular instance, the rallying of public opinion and the demonstrations by citizens in Europe and elsewhere are additional political elements which need to be taken into account.
On 11 September 2001, every nation and government in Europe without exception rallied round the United States of America when it came under terrorist attack.
Today every nation in Europe, although not every government, is against this fruitless, futile war.
To borrow from the ancient description of the crisis in Mesopotamia, a Babel-type policy is being created and it would be a good thing if this Babel-type policy were to end.
The lack of unity between the Fifteen is having a knock-on effect when it comes to dealing with the crisis.
At the same time, as regards the candidate countries, which are somewhat differentiated when it comes to the possibility of a unified stance, Europe needs to take care as it builds its future within the Convention, which is laying down new ground rules in the form of a constitution, that it does not cause internal rifts which do not then close.
We want to unite the Twenty-Five, the Twenty-Eight or however many we are, in a new strategy for a Europe of peace and cooperation, a Europe working for democratic progress throughout the world, the so-called crisis prevention and management policy; we do not, once the crisis is over, want to have to decide how to deal with the problem of refugees, casualties and so on.
I should like to remind you, and all the pundits agree here, that there are two conflicting strategies in America: there is one strategy for how America lives with the rest of the world and there is another strategy with a theocratic slant, with America trying to determine the course of history on the basis of a subjective evaluation of international interests.
May I remind everyone - and they are many - whose theory is that the UN has pretty much run its course, that the UN reflected the state of play at the end of the Second World War and that new configurations are needed which reflect the new state of play.
We have to realise that international conventions need to reflect the new state of play in a considered manner, using procedures which do not cause rifts.
It is also worth reiterating a few matters of concern to us, the European Union.
We spoke with one voice on the Palestinian problem.
And yet, our united voice went unheeded.
We spoke with one voice on Iraq, on the embargo against the Iraqi people.
And again, our united voice went unheeded.
We therefore have to realise that persistence is needed at times when our policies may be able to bring about practical results which do not in turn foster new crises.
Ladies and gentlemen, we really are at a crucial stage, but I think that every crisis contains in it the germ of a new standard.
We need to tell our American friends that their perception leads to trouble, trouble which is not even in America's interest.
The sort of approach taken by Donald Rumsfeld, who from what I heard this morning, started to tear the British Prime Minister off a strip for asking for a few more days for the inspectors, is a dangerous approach.
Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's message should be that it wants to take a peaceful approach to international problems, that it wants to resolve problems peacefully using procedures that pave the way for democracy throughout the world.
Mr President, in my own country, Sweden, a priest proposed yesterday that, in order to avoid war, someone should be paid to kill Saddam Hussein.
That is perhaps a rather bizarre message, coming from a representative of the Church of Sweden, but the idea of a regicide in the service of the people is otherwise quite an old one.
Certainly, some of us have had these thoughts in secret, but this type of murder cannot of course be committed.
It would be contrary to international law.
The war could nonetheless perhaps be stopped if Saddam Hussein were to resign or go into exile.
The discussions now being conducted within the Arab world to induce Saddam Hussein to resign are extremely interesting.
We hope, of course, that an international court will be able to hold Saddam accountable for his crimes.
If the clock could be turned back, there is a lot in the Iraqi conflict that could have been done differently.
The Arab world should have been involved much earlier in the discussion of the future of the whole of the Middle East.
The United States, the EU and the UN Security Council ought to have shown greater commitment to solving the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
The peace talks must begin again. Otherwise, we shall never win the fight against terrorism.
Now, the drumbeats of war can be heard.
The view of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is still that the weapons inspectors must be allowed to continue with their work for as long as their efforts are meaningful and for as long as they are making progress.
The progress that has been made has been due not to Saddam Hussein's having become willing to cooperate but to the resolutions and the threat of military force.
We must never forget that it is Saddam Hussein who must prove that he does not have weapons, not the UN which must find them.
Hopefully, war can still be averted.
It is our view that if, in fact, any military decisions are to be taken, they must be taken by the UN Security Council.
The UN is, however, seriously wounded at present.
The horse trading that is going on in order to convince countries to vote yes or no in the Security Council is pathetic and damages the entire international community.
When the permanent members quarrel, these difficult decisions are left to countries such as Ghana, Cameroon and Angola.
This is unreasonable and frightening, and it undermines the UN's credibility.
Substantial reform is becoming a matter of ever greater urgency.
The UN is divided, as are NATO and the EU, and transatlantic relations are damaged.
The only person to delight in the fact is the dictator in Baghdad.
Mr President, what is this war about?
Knowing the answer to that question is of course the prior condition of being able to prevent it.
As the weapons inspectors become more successful in their work, the purpose of the war is, however, changing.
I now also hear from my esteemed fellow MEP, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, that what is at issue is removing the dictator in Baghdad.
Excuse me, but I thought the idea was to disarm Iraq and destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
The picture I now have is of the UN's far exceeding the limits of its powers and replacing regimes we do not like.
We do not like Saddam Hussein. Being opposed to the war is not the same as being friends with Saddam Hussein; or with Mr Le Pen for that matter; or, indeed, with President Chirac.
I am not friendly with any of them, but that only shows of course how broad the anti-war movement is, and how narrow the movement in favour of war is gradually becoming.
If what we are concerned with is a change of regime, may I ask where the EU is when it is a question of receiving refugees from the dictatorship we wish to bring to an end.
Where is the EU when people take flight from the abominable dictator described by my fellow MEP, Mr Evans?
Why do we throw those refugees back into the hands of the regime we want to change?
Why, just as my fellow MEP Mr Cohn-Bendit said, do we not support democratic movements in Iran?
I shall stop there, for I have no more speaking time left.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, over the last ten years, since the Gulf War, the United States has been developing a 'mother of all bombs'.
Europe in that time has been putting patience and diplomacy to use in an attempt to enlarge the Union.
That is a symbolic and clear difference.
If Parliament and the Commission were to accept ultimate responsibility, the EU could act with authority for the benefit of world peace and an international legal order.
That is unfortunately not the case.
It is not only the values of democracy and human rights that unite the EU, but also the will to guarantee peace and to establish an international order through cooperation.
Has the war against Iraq already started, or not?
Or has the war against Iraq never really stopped since the first Gulf War and the struggle for hegemony in the Middle East simply entered a new phase?
History will be the judge.
Following the military defeat of Saddam by the international coalition the regime remained in place, but it was kept in check by a merciless embargo that left the population starving, but the power of the regime over them intact.
The weapons inspectors of the first four years were not effective in disarming Iraq, but acted as an intelligence service for those states that sent and paid their experts and spies.
The United States and Great Britain were subsequently able to bomb in Iraq with greater success.
The new weapons inspections under the direction of Hans Blix and the United Nations, and accompanied by military threats, have however been successful.
We must therefore pursue this path and we must unite the European countries around this position. Thank you.
Mr President, the last thing we would wish to see in these troubled times is the Iraqi regime being able to rejoice in the almost unimaginable disunity in the United Nations, the almost insurmountable difficulties facing NATO, or the absence of any possibility of agreement within the Fifteen on this crisis.
The fact is that after more than ten years and 17 UN resolutions, the Iraqi regime is still delaying destroying its illegal weapons.
This time, however, Saddam Hussein will not be able to continue to defy international law.
I am not being naÃ¯ve in saying this - I hope that we will still be able to obtain a decision within the UN which, when confronted with the facts, leads Iraq to disarm voluntarily.
I also wish to make it clear, however, that we will not remain neutral in the event of a conflict.
We will always be on the side of democracy and not of tyranny.
We are also on the side of international law, because we want to see immediate and unconditional compliance with the 17 UN resolutions on Iraq's disarmament.
We are on the side of those who know that collective security comes at a price and that we must not confine ourselves to antagonising those who are paying this price by applying the only weapon of deterrence that Saddam Hussein acknowledges and fears - the more than 200 000 soldiers on the ground.
Lastly, Mr President, and in addition to all of these reasons, we are not remaining neutral because we take the view that it is our duty always to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, in good times and bad.
Why?
It is simple, Mr President. To ensure that, if we face a direct threat in future, we can count on their solidarity too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the prospect of a new disaster, so costly in terms of human life, were not haunting our minds today, we would say that this crisis has served in a remarkable way to reveal the world as it is now.
It brings to light those truths that the advocates of sovereign states - albeit crying in the wilderness - have been declaring for so long, truths that are suddenly starting to be regarded as self-evident.
The first of these self-evident truths is that the actors in international affairs are not blocs, or particular sets of civilisations hastily divided up in order to comply with an imperial and vaguely racial interpretation of the world.
The real actors are still the nation states.
There is no longer any united international community, there is no united West, any more than there is a united Europe.
The West, the so-called international community, and Europe, have been completely shattered. So, incidentally, has the East, the region that poor Samuel Huntington so foolishly referred to as 'the Moslem world', but which includes both nations which are in favour of the war, such as Kuwait, and nations which are against it, such as many Arab countries, and even countries which have abstained from deciding one way or the other, such as Pakistan.
Europe, of course, is no more united than any of the others, because it is here, within this poor assembly, supposedly committed to a laughable common foreign and security policy, that we find the fiercest defenders of the US line, together with its most determined opponents.
In short, in both the North and in the South, each nation decides for itself, regardless of any illusion of solidarity, and the lone Anglo-Saxon knight is not the only one to have struck a fatal blow to the old multilateralism that was so much in vogue in the twentieth century.
No, the nation states are the only ones left, and we are happy that proof of this has been provided in such a glaringly obvious way.
What a revelation this is, too, of the real nature of America, or rather, I should say of the United States, since it has no authority to claim to speak on behalf of a whole continent, as brave Chile has just demonstrated.
In reality, the United States is doing nothing more than defending its interests at the most trivial level, and even that is not so certain, because what we are seeing is a small clique, obsessed by power, sliding towards war, something that forms part of the very nature of empire. That is also something that we have always claimed, namely that empire equals war.
The nation state, on the other hand, is the only possible way to bring about the non-totalitarian unification of the world.
As for France, the crisis has revealed her as she is, and as she always will be, the only real rampart, defending against empires the freedom of the people, which is another name for the freedom ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the apparently inevitable choice in this House, as indeed in the United Nations, is between war, with or without the backing of the Security Council, and the weak yet appealing position of those who are asking for more time for the inspections; those in favour of the latter alternative are relying, it must be said, on the Anglo-American military pressure on Saddam's regime and are, in fact, making the inspections an end in themselves, although they are well aware that Hans Blix and his men are unlikely to be able to get Saddam to disarm by themselves.
All the same, this very morning, many Members have execrated Saddam's regime and called for democracy and freedom for the Iraqi people.
We Radicals, together with hundreds of other public figures and members of parliament from very many countries, are convinced that there is still time and space for another scenario: the exile of the dictator of Baghdad as the only real way to avert war.
It is a scenario that a number of Arab governments in the region have been working on for some time and which could be taken up by the European Union in view of the forthcoming Security Council resolution.
Then there is post-Saddam Iraq, which nobody has mentioned today: we are convinced that this scenario should be accompanied by the United Nations taking over provisional administration of Iraq for at least two years.
Only a UN administration can be accepted and help get the country back on the right rails, for it has been under one of the most savage dictatorships ever known.
I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Europe may once again speak with one and the same voice on this basis.
Mr President, it has been said here that some progress towards disarmament has been made, although the scale of this progress is hard to measure in relative terms, because the obligation to prove that weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed has not been fulfilled.
We must remember that the inspectors are not private investigators - they are not budding Sherlock Holmes - they are simply information gatherers.
We accept, however, that they have made progress.
They have been able to do so simply because of international pressure, the last resort of which is the use of force.
Let us recall that the inspectors did not leave the country in 1998 of their own free will, but were expelled because the regime thought that the danger had passed.
We must also remember the victims, the thousands of people who perished in the rubble of the twin towers, the tens of thousands who have been eliminated in Iraq because they dissent or simply because they belong to a different minority, the hundreds of thousands who have had to go into exile in order to survive.
I assume we all agree that we must do whatever we can to ensure that international terrorist organisations do not gain access to these weapons of mass destruction.
I assume, Commissioner, that there are no doubts about this.
I also wish to point out that, for the moment, everyone, except for Saddam Hussein, has acted with the utmost respect for international law.
If decisions and votes are being postponed in the United Nations Security Council, it is precisely in order to reach an agreement that will enable us to continue to act within international law, laying down concrete conditions for disarmament and precise dates by which this is to be achieved because, as the European Council stated, inspections cannot go on indefinitely.
In this context, unfortunately, the unity of action of the European Union's Member States remains in disarray and I must ask Mr Papandreou and Commissioner Patten - and I know that this is not an easy task - to continue to seek agreement.
And this agreement, Mr President, must be founded on the Member States' will to achieve consensus, on respect for the opinions of others, on not attempting to impose on others policies based on faits accomplis and on abandoning strident attitudes.
Simply saying 'never again' will not get us anywhere.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first may I thank the Greek Presidency for all its efforts and its successful actions, which had two objectives: to avoid war and to present the European Union with a united front and a united policy.
My sincere congratulations to you, Mr President-in-Office, on your success, your major success in leading the European Union to agreement on a common position in Brussels on 17 February.
It is not the presidency's fault that, five days later, the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar or Anzar, as his friend Mr Bush likes to call him, broke this agreement and moved away from the common position of the European Union in order to go off to the American president's ranch and help prepare the proposal for a Security Council resolution to declare war on Iraq.
You will forgive me, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if I continue in German.
Mr President, the threat of a punishment must always be so credible that the punishment does not need to be carried out.
The massive military presence around Iraq, and Bush's rhetoric, have finally had their effect on Saddam.
Suddenly he is cooperating with the inspections and destroying weapons he said he did not have.
It is therefore naive to think that Saddam could have been called to order with diplomatic pleas alone.
Apart from Saddam, Bush himself has unfortunately begun to believe in the military threat to such a degree that he feels he can no longer find a way out of it.
Withdrawing a quarter of a million servicemen from the Iraq region while Saddam is still in charge is a disgrace for the American president that he wants to prevent in whatever way he can.
To this end he is even trying to bribe members of the Security Council, in particular to make possible an attack in the near future.
Bush and Blair have now become the prisoners of their own rhetoric and their diplomatic inability to mobilise sufficient support.
With no green light from the Security Council, all that remains for them is the choice between two evils: to do nothing and consequently lose face or to take military action outside the UN with all the negative consequences that entails.
A unilateral military intervention will lead to unprecedented instability and seriously impede the reconstruction of Iraq.
While Saddam was himself destroying the rockets in Iraq, he was placing a bomb under the UN, NATO and the EU, enabled to do so by Western leaders acting irresponsibly.
Since the fall of the Wall, the EU Member States have above all been pursuing their own interests and prestige and very little has come of a common foreign policy.
European policy must consist of maintaining the pressure on Saddam and certainly there must be no headlong rush to war.
We must be specific about what compliance we are expecting of the tyrant within a timeframe that the inspectors consider reasonable.
Only the UN can ensure that Saddam obeys, and that the punishment does not need to be carried out.
Mr President, Commissioner, the United States thought it could manipulate the United Nations in order to obtain legal cover for its predatory war in Iraq, but the UN stood its ground.
The UN and public opinion worldwide want nothing to do with this war.
Reason and justice refuse to submit to the fanatical fundamentalism which has been holding sway for some time now in Washington.
The Iraqi people are innocent.
Why, when they have been suffering for so long under such a cruel embargo, is it necessary to bomb them as well?
This war will precipitate a conflict between civilisations.
This time, it is not the Islamic fundamentalists who are pushing for war, but the US administration.
The reactions will be terrible.
They have already begun. Yesterday the Al-Hasar mosque, the Moslem Vatican, called for a holy war against the United States.
In the Security Council, France will use its veto to oppose the war, and so will Russia.
We must preserve peace.
Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank Commissioner Patten for the high quality of his speech, and also those Members who have argued unambiguously in favour of disarming Iraq by means of inspections and peaceful avenues.
Barbarity cannot be combated with barbarity, and war, whether we like it or not, is a form of barbarity.
It is also an old-fashioned way of settling conflicts.
Over a year ago, the President of the United States described as rogue states a certain number of countries suspected of having at their disposal, for the purposes of conquest, weapons of mass destruction which threatened world peace.
Eliminating weapons of mass destruction is certainly a desirable objective that we should all try to achieve in the context of the United Nations and, in particular, in the context of the non-proliferation treaty.
Yet how can we explain to the people of the countries described as rogue states that weapons of mass destruction are bad when they belong to those countries but that they are good when they belong to so-called 'virtuous' states?
These virtuous states lie, in particular, in Europe, but there is also the United States, whose army is ready to use such weapons of mass destruction, in other words tactical nuclear weapons, in the war that they want to launch in Iraq.
This is a complete contradiction and, in terms of international law, it is a further black mark against the US Government.
If I wanted to sustain Mr Bush's metaphor, I would say that the US State is a super-rogue.
However, I shall not do so, because that would be to insult the American people, and I do not want us to end up insulting one another.
Last week, in fact, we had an opportunity to meet US elected representatives who are openly opposed to the use of force.
They are demonstrating against the war alongside their fellow citizens and they constitute, in my opinion, the great majority of public opinion.
Mr President, all the fine words about Saddam Hussein's having to be disarmed and about the Iraqi people's being entitled to freedom ring remarkably hollow in a situation in which we all know that Saddam Hussein has not the slightest intention of disarming or going into exile, let alone of giving the oppressed Iraqi people their freedom.
European history from 1930 to 1939 is the history of a Europe that, step by step, gave in to Hitler's expansion and aggression.
'There will be peace in our time', said Chamberlain when he returned from his meeting with Hitler in Munich in 1938.
Today, the Chamberlains of our own time say that Saddam Hussein can be disarmed by the weapons inspectors.
If that is the case, why was this not done long ago?
We also forget that the weapons that threaten the world outside Iraq, and that we wish to remove, are not the same weapons used to oppress the Iraqi people. That is something that is easily achieved using conventional small arms.
The war against Saddam Hussein must be a war of liberation.
It is a question of democratising the Arab countries.
Democracy and economic development are the only protection against terrorists but, in the twelve years since the weapons inspections began, the EU's efforts have been designed to secure our peaceful coexistence with the dictator.
The EU must think again and be much more active in promoting the freedoms and social development of the Arab peoples.
As long as we only have words to offer, we are powerless.
Mr President, in 1950 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 377, entitled 'Uniting for Peace', which established that when certain conditions are met - for instance failure of the Security Council to discharge its functions - 'the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures'.
I would very much like the Greek Presidency to facilitate the urgent convoking of such a special session of the General Assembly by one or more European countries, pursuant to Article 20 of the Charter, in order to make recommendations with respect to maintenance of international peace and security.
If the United States is allowed a unilateral war, we may soon see China invade Taiwan or Russia trying to create another Soviet Union.
Therefore, I ask the Greek Presidency to convoke a General Assembly meeting.
Mr President, the worldwide confrontation on the subject of Iraq between two concepts of international relations is splitting Europe in two.
The crisis is dispelling our illusions and bringing us face to face with reality again.
It is reminding those who had forgotten it that the nation states are still the actors in diplomatic and strategic affairs, that they can, of course, when their interpretations coincide, act effectively together on an inter-governmental basis, and that the European Union is not a political entity.
If Europe has a real presence in this crisis, it is not thanks to the mechanisms of the CFSP, but to the political will of a certain number of European states.
The most determined supporters of the US vision are European, as are its most articulate opponents.
The Convention will therefore have to learn certain lessons from this return to reality.
No-one should continue to imagine that an all-purpose common foreign policy can be imposed by means of majority constraints. That would be to opt for the alignment of Europe rather than for its independence.
The CFSP must adjust its ambitions to fit the reality. It should assist in harmonising national diplomacies where they are in agreement, and it should let them act separately when that is not the case, and it should never again seek to replace them with artificial and unworkable pseudo-consensus, because that would be acting against the interests of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the present time makes it possible for us to observe what a misjudgment it is for European states, with their present dimensions, to define their interests solely in national terms, and how impossible it is to get national interests to prevail in global disputes such as these.
We now see this demonstrated by the tragic situation in which the British prime minister finds himself, having been so faithful in his support for the Americans; his inability to produce the right results means that he may well now be at a disadvantage.
One can also look at this with a certain amount of cynicism, for the one thing that is abundantly clear is that those who act against the interests of the European Union, by failing to seek common positions in accordance with Article 11 of the Treaty of Nice, will not be among the winners in this dispute or in any other, whether they wanted to join in no matter what happened and under any circumstances, or, like the German Federal Chancellor, wanted no part in it whatever.
This is why it is the larger countries that have to understand the fact - of which this crisis is for this reason a helpful demonstration - that the self-interest of a country's own citizens can be made to prevail only if we find something where all the European states' interests converge and, together, use that to carry some weight.
It is for this reason that I hope that this crisis, rather than damaging the development of a European foreign and security policy, will serve as a catalyst that will enable us to make the necessary progress on this issue.
If the United States of America declares war unilaterally, we will have great problems persuading our people of that war's legitimacy.
It will be extremely difficult to restart the transatlantic dialogue, and, above all, to gain our citizens' support for it.
I believe that it is very much in our common interest that this situation should not be detrimental to transatlantic relations in the long term, and that we must, for this reason, become strong enough to make our visions real and effective in the immediate aftermath of any war in Iraq, - visions that will enable us, quite independently of the security alliance that is NATO, to put transatlantic relations on a new footing in order to make them sustainable in the long term and thereby to gain public support for this relationship on both sides of the Atlantic.
Our plans for the future simply cannot involve the formation of axes with Moscow and Peking, and our choice of role models alienating us from the United States of America, a country with which we have values in common.
I do think, though, that this means that we as the European Union - if we speak with one voice - have to make it clear that, in the fight against dictators like Saddam Hussein and against international terrorism, military action may well be important, but that this war can be won on the global stage only if we possess the capacity for prevention and cultural dialogue, are aware of the concept of social justice, and can work on a large scale in dealing with this subject matter as a whole.
I believe that we have to gain the insight that peace can be brought to the world only if the use of military force does not exclude the use of other means.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the applause that greeted your speech simply acknowledged the fact that you have demonstrated, this morning, that a European Commissioner can embody the voice of Europeans and that there is indeed a European line in this crisis.
Thank you.
We are told that a blitzkrieg would make it possible first of all to establish democracy in Iraq and then to dry up the springs of terrorism.
Yet what are we being told about the situation in Afghanistan, where a blitzkrieg has already taken place and where, day after day, in silence, we witness the plight of Afghan women?
What are we being told about the mobilisation of public opinion, the new super-power?
Why can we not understand that the public's determination to take to the streets was based on the conviction that not only would war not dry up the springs of terrorism but also that a unilateral pre-emptive war would give rise to new terrorism?
It is on the basis of what the demonstrating people of Europe are telling us that we should be acting in the Security Council, and it is unacceptable that, within the United Nations, after we had committed ourselves to disarmament by means of international pressure and after we had found that the process works under the constraints we established together, we should then, in midstream, change the rules and set an ultimatum.
Our hope is that there will be a majority against an ultimatum within the Security Council.
We believe that there will be one.
We believe that war is avoidable.
That will depend to a large extent on Europe.
It will depend to a large extent on you, President-in-Office of the Council, if Mr Blix is to be given the time he tells us he needs in order to finish the job, and he says that that means not weeks or years, but rather months.
It is in this spirit that we believe that the right of veto of certain permanent members of the Security Council should be used if it is not possible to achieve a majority.
However, first of all, let us hope that there will be a majority in the Security Council.
We wanted to have inspections and international legality, and all Europeans agree on that.
The inspectors have carried out their work, and we acknowledge that they have made progress.
The inspectors are asking us for more time, and we must give it to them.
Basically, we know that a new world order is emerging, the one that began, not on 11 September 2001, but with the fall of the Berlin Wall, which left only one super-power in the world.
In view of this situation, we do not believe that any European country, by itself, can in the long term hold its own against what would effectively be the pax americana.
We are Europeans, in other words we believe in the virtues of debate and conviction, in the uselessness of humiliation and in the need to allow everyone their place on the international scene, and we believe, above all, in international law.
What can Europe do when it is time to make decisions on the Iraqi crisis?
I say Europe, Mr President, rather than Parliament or the Council or the Commission, and I am thinking of the European people, who are overwhelmingly against a war to disarm Iraq, let alone a war to change the Iraqi regime.
The European Council of 17 February took a stand: war should only be a very last resort and, anyway, there should be no war without a specific United Nations mandate.
Let us remember: Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Security Council to act against Saddam Hussein because of the terrible crimes he has committed against humanity.
We strongly reaffirm this, because that dictatorship has left an appalling trail of blood in its wake.
That is why Iraq must be disarmed, but only through the UN; the democratisation of Iraq must be supported, but only through the UN.
Unilateral war will split the UN; it will split the Atlantic Alliance; and it will throw Europe into crisis.
We say to some of our European brothers that a vote in the Security Council contrary to the Brussels document, contrary to the will of Parliament and contrary to the Commission's opinion would strike at the heart of Europe.
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union lays down that the Member States that are also permanent members of the Security Council should ensure that the positions and interests of the Union are upheld.
What happened in the case of the former Yugoslavia?
The Security Council could not decide on intervention in Kosovo, but NATO carried it out with the agreement of the European Council.
Also in question are the authority and prestige of our friend and ally, the United States, and also the brotherhood between our peoples, never so close as after 11 September, but today never so threatened on the eve of an unnecessary, unjust and unlawful war.
The United States should realise that the people's elected representatives meeting here are fighting against anti-Americanism and therefore ask the United States to show more respect for Europe's ideas and convictions.
Mr President, if Iraq is disarmed without war, it will be a victory for reason, a victory for the UN, and also a victory for the military pressure of the United States and the UK and for the endeavour to oppose unilateralism by France, Germany and Europe.
If there is war, it will be a disaster.
Let us unite, therefore, against the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and for the freedom of the Iraqi people; let us keep war away from the young ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, we are on the verge of a disaster announced and desired by the US Government.
It is obvious now that the values upheld by President Bush have nothing to do with democracy, but are values quoted on the stock exchange and values that smell of oil.
Iraq has not yet been crushed under a hail of bombs, yet already the Wall Street Journal of 10 March has announced a USD 900 million invitation to tender by the US Government to five US groups, for the reconstruction of the country.
What an admission that is!
Iraq is only the first country which will be the victim of an offensive to allow US capitalism to globalise its economic, and therefore its military, supremacy, converting people into goods and cannon fodder.
Afghanistan, Colombia, the Philippines, Venezuela, Palestine - no one is to be spared.
Yet, on 15 February, another upheaval occurred. Thousands of people invaded the streets of our capital cities to say no to war, and they will do so again on 15 March.
Democracy means taking up this challenge, and not a single elected representative or government can escape that fact.
The veto is now on the streets.
Here and in the USA, we all have to decide which side we are on.
Mr President, every day, the advocates of a war in the Middle East resort to ever weaker and ever less credible arguments.
We are obliged to watch as undisguised attempts are made in the Security Council to use economic aid as a bribe to induce African states to consent to war.
Since this House's last debate on war in Iraq, though, encouraging things have happened.
For the time being, at least, the Turkish parliament has refused to allow the deployment of troops on Turkish territory.
In Great Britain, over two hundred Labour Members of Parliament have expressed their opposition to a war.
They deserve our respect.
Those who oppose the war in Iraq that is being planned are no foes of the United States, but rather defenders of civilisation.
Mr President, will we have to resort to arms in order to make Saddam Hussein give up his programmes for the development, manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction once and for all and prove that he has done so?
I am one of those who still hope that we can avoid doing so and, like Mr Pasqua, I should like to say here and now that I applaud the efforts that France and its government are making to this end.
I also share the opinion of those who maintain that, if we had to envisage this last resort, it could only be with a mandate from the United Nations, the only organisation which is entitled to legitimise such action, and that, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, would betoken a radical change in the behaviour of the international community, which until now has always supported the idea that the use of armed force can only be envisaged in the case of legitimate defence, and therefore in response to an actual attack ?
Ladies and gentlemen, we initiated the reflection on this subject in our previous debates.
Obviously, we have not found a final answer to this question.
However, I should like to remind you that it was on this subject, namely the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any preventive or pre-emptive military action, that our group was unwilling to support the majority position expressed by this House in its last resolution.
In other words, President-in-Office of the Council, how can we stand up to the new challenge posed by international terrorism except by applying, in this field as in any other, the precautionary principle which is now unanimously recognised?
Personally, I believe that any Head of State or Government who is warned of a serious threat to the lives of thousands of his fellow citizens, and who does not take all measures necessary to protect them from it, will be held guilty in their eyes.
Weapons of mass destruction constitute a real threat to the survival and health of populations.
Every time that the existence of such a threat is confirmed, I believe that it will be the duty of the authorities to remove it, without waiting for it to be implemented, by preventive, diplomatic, economic and political measures and, if those measures are not enough, by the ultimate recourse to the use of military power.
This is what we are all, together, trying to achieve in Iraq, and what it will probably be necessary for us to do tomorrow in North Korea, and it is with that conviction in mind that I would like to repeat, here and now, that our current differences are much more apparent than real.
Mr President, the role of the inspectors appears to be crucial to this debate so perhaps I should spend some time looking at their activities.
Many people have claimed that they have been successful so far; I have to say that is not my view.
Yes, there has been some success but it really is the tip of the iceberg.
On 7 March UNMOVIC published a document entitled 'Unresolved disarmament issues: Iraq's proscribed weapons programme'.
That document is 173 pages long and it lists 29 separate sets of unresolved issues; these include the strong presumption that 10 000 litres of anthrax still exist.
We also know that a drone has been discovered which is capable of spreading biological and chemical weapons, and we know the cluster bombs have also been discovered.
That is not a success.
The report is a clear indication that Iraq is in breach of Resolution 1441, it is not fully cooperating with the inspectors, nor is it coming clean.
Indeed on 7 March the Iraqi permanent representative to the UN yet again, despite this evidence, claimed Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction.
Yet despite this evidence, many people here have said the inspections should continue.
But for how long?
At what point do we say enough is enough?
Let us remember that 12 years ago Iraq was given 15 days to disarm.
We know the inspectors have only been allowed in because of military pressure, we know that Saddam Hussein is making concessions in order to drag the process out until the summer when war is impossible.
We know that it will be impossible to maintain the military pressure in those circumstances indefinitely, and we know therefore that once the threat diminishes Saddam Hussein will be back to his old tricks of obstructing the inspectors.
Indeed, only yesterday the U2 spy planes that he gave concessions for were grounded.
Is that not a sign of what is to come?
Yet we still ask for indefinite inspections, surely that is simply because we do not want to have to make a decision.
Commissioner Patten made a very cogent case setting out the dangers of unilateral action; there is very little I can disagree with.
What he did not talk about is the future of the UN if we do not take effective action to enforce 12 years of resolutions that have not been followed.
If we cannot take effective action to disarm Iraq then the UN is finished as an effective force and the big countries will be acting unilaterally to the detriment of world peace and stability.
The future of the world is at stake.
We have heard much about ex-presidents, the Pope, academics; they all have one thing in common, they are totally powerless.
At this time when the future of the world is at stake, we need honesty, courage, determination and nerve to enable the international community to act together.
We must have a second UN resolution, we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further.
When that happens, then we must prepare to go to war.
If we do not we are lost.
I am particularly proud of the courage, nerve and clear-sighted vision that have been shown by my party leader and I wish a few more party leaders would do the same.
Mr President, we all know that disarmament, which is making progress, and the removal of Saddam Hussein are merely a pretext.
The real motive, of this there can be no doubt, is the quest of the USA and its allies to control Iraq's oil fields and geo-strategic position.
It is also a fact that the war, with or without a UN resolution, will have terrible consequences not just for the Iraqi people, but for the region, Europe and the world as a whole.
The question is, will the Greek Presidency and the European Union respond to the massive opposition being voiced by our and the American people and prevent this senseless crime?
Will they use their 4 votes in the Security Council to do this?
Will the Greek and other governments stop helping to prepare for war by giving the aggressors every possible assistance?
At this crucial stage, when the Soviet Union is highly conspicuous by its absence, I make a last appeal to you and all my honourable friends; we must prevent this war, which will serve as a precedent for more war.
We must bar the road to ruin!
At the same time, let us express our solidarity with the Iraqi people in their fight to overturn this tyrannical regime.
Mr President, however right and proper it is to discuss how we go about disarming the Iraqi dictator, I would like to thank the few Members present in the Chamber, and most of all Mr Poettering and Mr Watson, for reminding us who is our friend in this dispute and who our foe.
Looking at all the banners here in the Chamber I see, over and over again, the faces of the representatives of democratic states, but never the face of Saddam Hussein.
Hatred of the USA may well make temporary allies of groups with extremely divergent political views, but it will never be able to be the basis for a common European foreign policy.
On the contrary, it will only be an obstacle to it.
For the benefit of those who come to this House with good advice on how to deal with dictatorships, let me just read out what was said this week by President Kagame of Rwanda: 'I hope that the Security Council and the UN act decisively in Iraq, and not in the way they did in Rwanda, for the Council can reach the wrong decisions.
It did that in Rwanda, and it lost us a million people.'
Mr President, the news arriving this morning from New York that they are thinking of extending the ultimatum makes us continue to hope that the Iraqi crisis may be resolved without taking up arms.
The willingness of the United States and the United Kingdom to extend the ultimatum to Saddam Hussein opens up a new glimmer of hope for peace.
These are still the days of politics and diplomacy, and every attempt must be made to avert war: a goal that it is not impossible to achieve.
Above all - and here I agree with Mr Poettering - it is up to Saddam Hussein to destroy the banned weapons without hesitation and without pretence; it is up to Saddam Hussein to collaborate with the UN inspectors without wasting time; and the Iraqi dictator still has the option of leaving his country, to release it from an illiberal regime and restore it to democracy: a choice invoked by many of the Members sitting in this House too.
Europe must also make its loud voice heard, however, by avoiding divisions and conflict.
The document adopted on 17 February must be the starting point for action by the Council and the Commission, and it is the primary duty of all the political groups represented in Parliament to act to prevent the credibility of the United Nations being eroded away.
European politics and diplomacy must move to prevent that institution, with which we all identify, from emerging from the international crisis deprived of its role as the protector of the international rule of law, and we must also act to prevent another multilateral body, the Atlantic Alliance, from losing its credibility.
We therefore have the duty, Mr President, of working to preserve the unity of Europe; there must be a huge effort from everybody to overcome the divisions that have been revealed this week: a weak and divided Europe does not serve the cause of peace.
We must learn from these difficulties so that Europe can, once again, play a leading role on the international stage.
We must not, however, Mr President, forget the relationship and shared values that link us to the United States of America - a country deeply scarred by the attacks of 11 September, attacks that also scarred every one of us, every European - and we must not allow Washington to be left alone.
This is because every act of international diplomacy these days can only be aimed at building a solution to the Iraqi crisis.
The European Union and the United States must find joint initiatives within the framework of the international order.
Mr President, history has taught us that it is almost impossible to work together with dictators, because they do not care if their own people suffer.
That is also the case with the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
The Iraqi people have had to pay dearly for their leader's unyielding attitude.
Iraq's leadership has not even wanted to fully exploit the 'oil for food' programme, but has preferred to allow its citizens to suffer from a lack of adequate nourishment and medicine.
For us Europeans, who work on the assumption that there should be compliance with international agreements and a policy of cooperation, it has been a difficult experience to find that only military pressure has persuaded Saddam Hussein to allow the work of the weapons inspectors to be carried out.
Prior to that the Iraqi leadership had defied the decisions of the UN and not agreed to give up its weapons of mass destruction and weapons programmes.
Although there has been progress with the weapons inspections there are still more than a hundred unanswered questions in the weapons inspectors' reports.
They concern such matters as unmanned fighter aircraft and the fate of scud missiles and the anthrax solutions.
My country, Finland, strongly emphasises the importance of the UN's role in finding a solution to the Iraq crisis.
President Halonen said yesterday that Finland will support the Security Council and its decisions and that force without its authorisation was unacceptable.
Halonen also said that Finland supports the continuation of the work of the weapons inspectors as long as it is meaningful and useful.
The Security Council must consider how much time it has got left on the basis of the weapons inspectors' report.
It is extremely important that the Security Council members use all their skill to achieve unanimity.
The aim should obviously be for Iraq to be disarmed without the use of force.
If this calls for military action it must have the approval of the Security Council.
Purposeful diplomacy must come before public appearances by the Security Council members.
The weapons inspectors must be given enough time to do their work, but that must not mean that Saddam Hussein can play endless games with the international community.
Throngs of people throughout the world have gone onto the streets to demonstrate in favour of a peaceful solution to the Iraq dispute.
There must be a genuine chance for peace, but the precondition for a peaceful solution is that the international community must be certain that Iraq does not have dangerous weapons of mass destruction in its possession or any programmes to develop them.
The role of the UN and its Security Council must come first in resolving the Iraq crisis.
If the UN cannot now act we are in danger of losing the most essential global instrument we have in safeguarding world peace.
The European Union must now take a united stand and use all its powers to shore up the viability of the UN.
Mr President, it has fallen to my country's government to drink of this bitter cup.
These are difficult times, but we have ability and experience on our side; the experience of previous Greek presidencies and of the administration of the late Andreas Papandreou, who was firmly in favour of peace and the autonomy of Europe.
We can maintain our alliances, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, including with the USA, but - to quote an historic precedent - it was not America's friends who told them to drop napalm on Vietnam; America's friends told them to stop the war.
We can fight for the unity of the European Union - which has become a laughing stock, with United Kingdom officials running around Cameroon, Angola and Guinea in a bid to drag them into the war - by supporting the principles of the Treaties of the European Union on peace, the founding Charter of the UN and boxing Blair's and Aznar's ears.
We can forge a massive alliance with the people of Europe.
No presidency has been in the privileged position of having the people of Europe take to the streets and standing united.
They need a common reference point, not just Mr Schroeder or Mr Chirac; they also need Mr Simitis, the head of the Greek Presidency.
These are hard times and, like Belgium, we are a small country.
Your heart is in the right place, but we want results.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nobody is left unaffected by the danger of war in Iraq.
I know nobody who would not rather see a peaceful solution in Iraq.
Among democrats, such a thing should be self-evident.
Our own willingness to seek peace will not, though, on its own be sufficient; we also have to do something about it.
This is where Europe has become less important.
Over the past weeks and months, we have failed to maintain and build on the crucial role we once had as the USA's partner.
It is unfortunate that my government - the government of the Federal Republic of Germany - has played a substantial part in bringing this about.
The prospect of an election victory led Germany's Federal Chancellor, Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, to whip up fear of war, and for the sake of that victory he has ended up dividing Europe, NATO, and - it almost seems - the United Nations.
He has done nothing to get Saddam Hussein to take seriously the pressure from the United Nations, and that means that we now have to make it clear that what interests us is a real peace, leaving no room - and let me say this loud and clear - for despots who enslave their own people, destabilise a whole region, and who both possess and manufacture dangerous weapons of mass destruction.
Europe still does not speak with one voice in matters of foreign policy - indeed, it does so less now than ever before.
We are further away than ever from having a common foreign and security policy.
That is why Europe needs the United States of America as a guarantor of peace and freedom in the world.
It was not Europe that put an end to genocide in the Balkans; were it not for the USA, the war criminal Slobodan Milosevic would not be in the dock in The Hague.
It is not Europe that is in a position to contain the conflict between India and Pakistan.
It is not Europe that is able to take up positions in North Korea in defence of our security.
On its own, Europe does not have the capacity to combat international terrorism.
To be sure, the US administration is not always convincing in its presentation of American policy, and the exclusive concentration on weapons of mass destruction was certainly ill-advised, in that it shifts the burden of proof, leaves the initiative to the weapons inspectors and - in the final analysis - to Saddam Hussein, and puts the USA and its supporters in a defensive position.
What is a fact, though, is that Saddam Hussein is a threat to the peace of the world.
On this continent of ours, we have often had to deal with despots whose intentions were apparent from the outset, as are those of Saddam Hussein.
It is a lamentable fact that, in Iraq, terror, torture and murder are arbitrary and a part of daily life.
It is a fact that many questions have still not yet been answered.
Does Iraq possess the smallpox virus?
What was done with the mustard gas grenades?
Where are the highly dangerous VX nerve gas, the large quantities of anthrax, the 6 500 bombs carrying chemical weapons, and the mobile weapons laboratories?
No less important than getting answers to these questions is the need to give some thought to the region's future.
Here lies Europe's great mission.
I call on the foreign ministers to join with the Commissioner in developing models for dealing with this region's future and for relations with it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the issue with which we are concerned is not the odious regime in Iraq but the way in which that country can best and most effectively be disarmed.
The regime is clearly detestable - there is probably no one in this Chamber who has any time for Saddam Hussein - but the issue is one of how his weapons of mass destruction are to be got rid of.
Is such disarmament best achieved through military intervention or through continued work on the part of the weapons inspectors?
For my part, I am convinced that, in the present situation, the best way is that of continued work by the weapons inspectors, quite simply because military intervention is always the last resort.
It may be appropriate once all the other options have been tried.
Such intervention would have very grave consequences, not only for the population of Iraq and all the innocent people who would be affected but also, I believe, for continued relations with the Arab world.
What is more, I believe that the weapons inspections are working.
One might perhaps wish that they were working still better, but progress is at present being made.
We must bear in mind that the inspections are working because of the pressure on Saddam Hussein and the threat of armed intervention.
It is therefore important for this pressure to be maintained.
This situation cannot go on forever, but the time limits that have up until now been proposed by the United States and others have been quite unrealistic.
That is why the weapons inspections must continue.
To launch an attack without a decision by the UN Security Council would be utterly reprehensible and a violation of international law.
It would have far-reaching consequences for the UN's future legitimacy.
The UN system has its faults, but we have no other such system on a global basis.
We must therefore join together in helping to maintain this system.
The EU's role in this conflict is a sorry chapter.
The proud declarations concerning the common foreign and security policy that are usually made on solemn occasions have of course proved brittle when they have been put to the test.
It is mainly the large countries that are at fault, go their own ways and pursue their own national interests instead of waiting, sitting down together, engaging in discussion and finding a common approach.
If the EU is in future to play a role in the area of foreign policy, we must learn from what has happened.
If we are to be able to play a role in Iraq, in the Middle East, in the Korean peninsula and in other places, common policy must take precedence over national interests.
Otherwise, the EU will not be able to play an important role in the future.
Commissioner Patten, thank you and congratulations on your speech.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is only 18 months since the tragic events of 11 September and Mr Bush and his chiefs of staff have managed to achieve what one would have thought impossible, even for the frequently clumsy diplomacy of the Americans: they have alienated almost unanimous and unreserved support for the USA and its efforts to combat terrorism and have replaced it with an equally universal and unanimous coalition against the American Government and its war and strategy plans.
This is not due to differences over the depressing, dictatorial regime in Iraq or even the dangers inherent in Saddam Hussein's possessing weapons of mass destruction, dangers which were confirmed and agreed in Resolution 1441, which must be applied fully, no one doubts that; an overwhelming majority of people and governments throughout the world have realised that this crisis goes far beyond Iraq and its leadership and basically has to do with the future order of the world, a world being called on to choose between high-handed unilateralism on the one hand and legitimate collective management of international problems on the other.
In other words, it is being called on to choose between the principles and rules set out in the UN Charter and the material components of Washington's new strategic dogma, which favours a Weltanschauung of pre-emptive strikes, unilateral violent intervention, undermining of the UN and expedient, supposedly voluntary alliances determined by the military operation of the day, rather than fundamental, procedural privileges in keeping with the international legal order which has applied in the past.
It is precisely against these prospects that we need a firm stand by the European Union and the European Parliament, as the elected representative of its people, who have joined with the American people in a common fight to defend the rule of law which the current American administration seems determined to flout.
Mr President, Commissioner, perhaps we shall succeed in saving Europe, and that would, at least, be something.
It is true that, after a year of uncertainty, of contradiction and of conflict, there are positive signs.
The disarmament of Iraq is underway.
The voice of the people is making itself heard on the streets and it is doing so, as I would remind Mr Titley, along with not only the Pope and the universities, but also with millions of other people.
We have seen, in effect, that even with massive propaganda, neither sarcasm, nor threats, nor portfolio policy have succeeded in stopping the protests.
Moreover, remarkable and intense diplomatic efforts are being made within the UN, and there is also, thank goodness, the work of the Greek Presidency.
The paradox, however, is that war has never been so close, and that, if disarmament is the objective of this war, disarmament is, in fact, taking place.
If the objective is democracy in Iraq, there are ways, other than war, of creating it.
Let us talk about removing the embargo, the International Criminal Court, the civil society which exists in Iraq and which deserves encouragement, but let us not talk about war.
Then again, if the problem is geopolitical and economic, if it is power versus law, then no, no, and no again, and we must oppose it.
Tzvetan Todorov, who studied the totalitarian systems of the twentieth century, had an excellent way of describing this.
He said that democracy is not immunised against the temptation of the good, which may lead it to the worst, in other words the dropping of humanitarian bombs.
Let us not, tomorrow, drop humanitarian bombs on Iraq, on an Iraq which we shall have succeeded in disarming, but not succeeded in protecting.
Mr President, military intervention should only be used as a last resort and to use it now in Iraq would be premature and unjustified, with far-reaching consequences beyond its immediate target.
Furthermore, trading insults across the Atlantic serves no purpose, and only makes matters worse.
It is hurtful to be accused of being anti-American simply because one is opposed to the policy of the current US Administration.
It adds further insult to injury when one is accused of forgetting the US contribution to two world wars.
The reason why the European Union displayed such strong unity and solidarity in the wake of 11 September is because we appreciated that contribution, and value the strong transatlantic alliance.
That does not mean that we should not be able to disagree on occasions, especially when we believe the strategy to be wrong.
Foreign policy hawks in the US Administration would do well to remember that the roots of current world crises relating to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden are a product of past dubious US foreign policy decisions.
It was the US that provided resources and support to these unsavoury individuals when they were their allies.
Now the whole world - not simply America - is paying the price of these errors of judgement.
The UK and the US should pause and reflect before they embark on a course of action without UN authority.
The UN is the accepted custodian of international law, with unique structures and processes to uphold it.
This means that anyone supporting this principle must abide by its decisions, including the use of veto.
One simply cannot adopt an Ã  la carte approach.
Military action without UN approval will increase antagonisms between the West and the Muslim world; it will inflame the Middle East and it will deal a devastating blow, not only to the credibility of the UN, but also to the future potential of the European Union Common and Foreign Security Policy.
Mr President, many claim the split over Iraq is between Europe and the USA.
However, in reality it is between France and Germany and 19 other pro-US new European governments.
France and Germany have alienated America, undermined the UN and NATO and exposed the difficulties of achieving the CFSP.
France and Russia will be judged harshly for using their UN veto for cynical, commercial interests in a second resolution, sending all the wrong signals to Baghdad.
There are legitimate differences over the immediacy of the military threat posed by Iraq, but Saddam Hussein continues to defy the credibility of the UN in its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.
Interestingly, Iraq and North Korea are the only two cases in the world of non-compliance with NPT safeguard agreements and I would not wish to see Iraq in the position that North Korea is in now, possessing nuclear weapons and immune from assault.
Personally, I am convinced of the need for regime change, ideally via Saddam's exile or, failing that, by military intervention, as the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq.
The allies must install a democratic government to prevent refugee flows or instability in the region, allowing the 200 000 in my constituency, London, to return and guarantee that Iraq's oil wealth be used for its people and not for arms purchases.
The alternative is to contain Saddam for a while until the world's attention is focused elsewhere and he can once again rearm.
The Clinton administration appeased North Korea for years, bankrolling the regime while it starved its own people and secretly carried on developing nuclear weapons, contrary to the 1994 agreement.
Perhaps the appeasers in this House could also explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threat to other states without any UN authority and now find it so difficult to take action against an evil, genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost one million people and who has gassed more people in a single day than died in the whole of the Kosovo conflict.
Certainly, once the almost inevitable war is over, the US, through the Quartet, must show resolve for a road map solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and ensure a viable two-state solution.
In the meantime, let us not be deterred from confronting a dangerous menace when we can.
Mr President, what has happened to the EU's common foreign and security policy?
When, the day before yesterday, President Chirac announced the French approach within the UN, cooperation with Russia appeared to be more important than talks and deliberations with EU colleagues in the Security Council, such as Great Britain, Germany, Spain and the candidate country, Bulgaria.
A month ago, the French president wagged his finger at the candidate countries and demanded a declaration of solidarity with the EU.
Is there, then, not good reason now for demanding a declaration of solidarity by the French president in respect of the EU's common foreign and security policy?
Those who demand that the weapons inspectors should be given more time to enable them to find Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction lack support under UN Resolution 1441 for their declared position.
On the contrary, it is Saddam Hussein's task to produce his weapons of mass destruction and destroy them under the weapons inspectors' supervision.
If Saddam Hussein has already destroyed the weapons of mass destruction he possessed, then he must supply the weapons inspectors with documents to that effect.
UN Resolution 1441 leaves no room for a game of hide and seek.
Personally, I have no confidence in Saddam Hussein's goodwill.
He has repeatedly defied the UN, and he has never in actual fact complied with UN demands.
There is no difficulty in diagnosing Saddam Hussein as having a severe personality disorder or being seriously disturbed psychologically.
He boasts of having murdered someone for the first time when he was eleven years old.
He went on to murder one of his ministers in the course of a government meeting.
He has murdered those closest to him in his own family, and he has employed gas grenades to kill his own people.
He suffers from megalomania comparable with that of Hitler and Stalin.
The people of Iraq need alternative political leadership. Allow me to express the hope that this can be brought about without the need for recourse to war.
Mr President, in recent weeks we have witnessed dangerous rifts in the United Nations and in the international institutions of the democracies.
The future European Union is already split between 18 countries which have declared one view and three or four which have declared the opposite.
NATO effectiveness may have been fatally undermined.
Instead of joining America, Britain, Spain, Bulgaria and so many other countries in a display of solidarity and determination, the government of one particular EU Member State has gone to quite extraordinary lengths to protect Saddam Hussein's regime from the consequences of its activities and to derail the efforts of the international coalition against Saddam.
What possible motive could there be for this?
Much nonsense is talked about who armed Saddam.
We should be clear that it is Russia and France that armed him.
I am not talking about the Osirak nuclear reactors supplied 30 years ago, which provided the basis for Saddam's original nuclear weapons programme I am merely making the observation that there are no American F-16s or British Tornadoes in the Iraqi air force, but there is a solid inventory of MiGs, Sukhois and Mirage F1s, as well as the Roland Air Defence System, Pannard armoured personnel carriers, Milan Anti-Tank Guided Weapons Systems and Exocet missiles.
Much nonsense has also been talked about control of Iraqi oil.
We should be aware that Iraq's policy is to award gas and oil concessions to countries supporting the easing or lifting of UN sanctions.
For example, last October the Deutsche Bank estimated that contracts concerning new oil fields in Iraq, worth USD 38 billion, were signed with oil companies mainly from China, France and Russia.
It is right also not to allow the idea to persist that two or three countries speak for Europe, define its policies and drive them forward, while the views of the rest, many of which attach great importance to the transatlantic alliance, are portrayed as some sort of aberration.
Mr President, this is the second time that I have spoken in a legislative assembly in support of a British Prime Minister contemplating sending British troops into action in Iraq.
I did so 12 years ago when the then Conservative Prime Minister, the then Conservative Government, of which Commissioner Patten was a distinguished Member, committed British troops to repel the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
I find myself in the extraordinary position today of supporting a Labour Government, a Labour Prime Minister and a Labour leader of the delegation here in this Parliament in the words that they say and in the actions that they propose.
Twelve years ago we stopped at the gates of Baghdad.
We did so on a commitment by Saddam Hussein that the weapons of mass destruction would be dismantled.
Twelve years later, countless resolutions later, countless promises later, countless inspections later, that commitment has still not been fulfilled.
We are where we are today because of that.
We have a simple choice: either we believe what Saddam Hussein says and believe that he will still go on to disarm in a voluntary way, or we take the hard, difficult decision to commit the lives of our young men and women to enforce the will of the international community.
We may have to do that because, if we do not, we send a message to those who would follow Saddam Hussein that they can get away with it, and we send an even worse message to the great nation of the United States which has stood by this continent in good times and in bad that it is on its own.
As Winston Churchill said 60 years ago: 'We are either with the American people, we are part of them, or we are not'.
That remains as true today as when it was first said.
Mr President, I speak as the PPE-DE Group spokesman on Islamic affairs and as a longstanding member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Let us look at the politics.
The failure of the CFSP is our fault.
The Bush administration has never hidden its determination to remove Saddam Hussein by force if necessary.
Congress approved this and Europe largely ignored it.
Instead of seeking common ground and leading the debate, France and Britain - the two countries most responsible for the mess in the Middle East after the First World War - have fallen out again.
I have an interest here, as my kinsman T. E. Lawrence sought and expected Arab autonomy.
Meanwhile, in speech after speech, Washington, with the security of a President in mid-term, has placed a vast army in the region and has explicitly talked about wider regime change.
Indeed, the road map for peace between Israel and Palestine is published - it is on the Palestinian Authority's website.
We all know that in the democracies public opinion is opposed to conflict.
Who knows, however, what real public opinion is in the Arab countries?
We can learn something from the comprehensive UNDP report written last year by Arabs, which states: 'Political participation in Arab countries remains weak, as manifested in the lack of genuine representative democracy and restrictions on liberties'.
At the same time, people's aspirations for more freedom and greater participation in decision-making, have grown, fuelled by rising incomes, education and information flows.
So speaks the United Nations.
It should be observed that there is nothing inherently intolerant and oppressive in the letter of the Islamic faith and in earlier centuries Islam exercised a culturally progressive and civilising influence.
Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights in the world are founded in the framework of the Democracy and Human Rights Programme.
The core principles of the CFSP - promotion of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms - are absolutely crucial here.
Mr President, Saddam Hussein is the root cause of the Iraqi crisis.
Without the military pressure imposed by the United States and its allies - mainly Great Britain - upon the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, the UN weapons inspectors would not have been allowed into the country.
We must not forget that Saddam Hussein threw out the previous weapons inspectors in 1998.
That gave him four years in which to develop biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction and long-distance missiles of the Al-Samoud 2 type.
The existence of these self-propelled missiles was long denied by the Iraqi regime.
Now, they are being destroyed under the supervision of the weapons inspectors.
Ever since its defeat in the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq has systematically sabotaged the possibility of the UN weapons inspectors' investigating the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the country.
The then American defence minister, William Cohen, warned Iraq when the UN weapons inspectors were thrown out in November 1998 with the words: the tug-of-war cannot go on for ever.
Saddam Hussein is a dictator and tyrant, prepared to embrace any methods whatsoever to fight his enemies, including that of murdering his sons-in-law.
He did not hesitate to employ chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and gassed 5 000 Kurds to death in the city of Halabja in 1988 during the final phase of the war.
It is just such weapons of mass destruction that the UN inspectors have not been allowed to search for.
For twelve years, Saddam Hussein has attempted to mock the surrounding world by playing a cat and mouse game with the UN weapons inspectors.
He must be got rid off, partly in order to create peace and stability in the region but, in the first place, in the interests of freedom and democracy for Iraq's oppressed population.
The EU's common foreign and security policy has foundered when it has been most needed.
Difficult situations put our trust in each other to the test.
Obviously, there is now a lack of such trust in each other within the EU.
A European Union in which we do not have confidence in each other is an unstable structure.
Mr President, I too should like to thank everyone for their comments, views and positions, which send out a number of important messages, not just to the Council but to the general public and international players.
As the President said, this is a very interesting debate and I should like to try and respond to 3 or 4 basic questions which all of you have raised in one way or another.
First of all, is there any possibility of resolving the crisis diplomatically in the short time left.
It seems to me that all of you, like the Council of the European Union and the unanimous Security Council, take the same position on disarming Iraq and the need for immediate and unrestricted cooperation with the Security Council on the part of Saddam Hussein.
I think it is important - after all we are a democratic society; here we are in the European Parliament and we live in a democratic European Union - not to interpret our differences as sending out the wrong message to Saddam Hussein, a message that we are divided on the final objective.
The final objective is quite specific and we are all agreed on it.
The second point is that the summit Council basically instructed the Greek Presidency to take initiatives.
First of all we have to exhaust and make every effort to exhaust diplomatic channels to resolve the Iraqi crisis.
We have, of course, emphasised that Saddam Hussein himself is responsible for any consequences.
However, and this is a personal opinion based on my own experience, after monitoring the Security Council and the General Affairs Council very closely over recent weeks, I believe, as Kofi Annan said, that we too bear a considerable responsibility.
Our responsibility is to remain united, so that we can formulate a common position and speak with one voice here; our responsibility is to empower the UN with the authority and the resources at our disposal.
That is what will make us more efficient, especially when it comes to resolving the problem peacefully.
The European Union did not discount the possibility of using military force at the summit Council but, as Mr Anderson and Mr Cushnahan and many other members pointed out, this should be the last resort.
We know what the consequences of war are; they are manifold and unpleasant and the Council has naturally insisted that every initiative should be exhausted.
That is why we took the initiative of ongoing cooperation, conferences and meetings with the Arab world, that is why the Arab League will be making representations to Saddam Hussein over the next few days, in order to send out an important, clear message.
However, the question posed by Mr Watson and, even more insistently by Mr Cohn-Bendit is, I think, a reasonable question.
Mr Cohn-Bendit asked why the United States or the international community could not say that we have succeeded.
Indeed, we did succeed in putting inspectors into Iraq, in getting inspections under way and in making progress with disarmament; but certain Member States of the European Union take a different view. And this is one of the problems we face.
Whether the glass is half full or half empty. And when the Arabs ask for clarification as to what message they should send Baghdad, the current discussion in the Security Council about so-called benchmarks is extremely important.
Are there specific targets which would allow us to assess whether Saddam Hussein has taken the strategic decision to disarm at the insistence of the Americans and the British?
And if there are, how long should this assessment take?
As Mr Titley pointed out, there comes a point at which enough is enough.
The summit Council has already agreed that there has to be a cut-off point.
Even in the Security Council, the two sides to the debate have already agreed that there has to be a cut-off point, but of course they differ as to where that cut-off point is.
However, that proves that there is room for the two sides to meet half way, if they can agree on the cut-off point and the benchmarks for assessing Saddam Hussein's credibility.
So I believe that we should not see war as a foregone conclusion.
I would again point out that the European Council's position is that war is not inevitable and I would emphasise again today that, until the first bomb is dropped, war is not inevitable.
We need to continue in our diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully.
I also believe that a diplomatic solution is not only feasible, but that, even if we cannot find a diplomatic solution, we still do not need to take unilateral action, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo quite rightly said, and I think the European Union has an important role to play here.
That brings me to the second point I wished to make about a European voice, about a European presence, to quote Mr Poettering, about European unity.
Of course, as Mr Alavanos quite rightly pointed out, the presidency can only act within the framework of the decisions, the unanimous decisions taken by the Council.
However, we do have a common position.
We have common conclusions although we differ in our practical approach.
What happens next?
In my view, and again it is a personal view based on my own experience over recent weeks, there is the will for rapprochement and unity within the Council and we should build on this momentum over the next few days in order to see if we can find a common stand, including on specific action.
Of course, the final decision as to what we are going to do about Iraq does not rest with the European Union.
It rests with the Security Council.
I should also like to comment on something Chris Patten quite rightly said about the unity of the European Union.
My feeling is that often the larger Member States do not realise that in these times, in the present era of globalisation, even they do not have the weight needed to make a difference on the international political stage on their own.
We can play a part on the political stage if we work hard - large, small and medium-sized countries together, with a strong, united, European voice.
That brings me to the question of Europe's presence.
I think that the crisis in Iraq has highlighted important questions about what happens the day after the crisis, whenever that may be.
First, in the Convention on the future of Europe, questions such as stepping up the debate about defence and our foreign policy and even, I think, the power of the European institutions, the authority of the European institutions and the democratic credentials of the European institutions, so that they can stand united and with an authority that truly represents the citizens of Europe.
Secondly, the question of our basic decision to develop our defence capabilities, the technological and industrial resources at our disposal and, more importantly, the question of Europe's credibility, so that it can submit its own proposals for dealing with major issues, such as the issue of weapons of mass destruction, the issue of terrorism and so on.
We have demonstrated our skills over recent years in foreign policy, witness the Balkans.
We have a unified, cohesive, substantive policy which has an influence in the area.
I think that we should take this as an example when deciding what to do next.
Finally, as far as a European voice is concerned, I have a couple of comments to make about enlargement.
It is vital for enlargement to proceed and not to be affected by the present climate and for us to learn from the lessons this experience has taught us.
First of all, we are a community of values which respects differences of opinion - and there are differences - and we want the new countries joining us to join a democratic society.
That is, if you like, the meaning of enlargement.
It means integrating them into a democratic society of values; at the same time, the message to them is that democracy also means being able to combine these views into a common strategy on numerous issues.
My third point, and this was a question raised by a number of members, concerns the crisis in the United States.
I agree with the numerous speakers who say that 'anti-Americanism' versus 'pro-American policy' is a false dilemma.
It would be a big mistake to get tied up in conventions and stereotypes: new Europe versus old Europe, America as the baddies, Europe as the goodies or Europe as the baddies, weak Europe versus strong America.
This would only obscure the real dialogue and the real debate needed.
It is high time we held a detailed debate about practicalities here on earth, about the real problems, as Mr Patten and Mr Pasqua and numerous other speakers said.
What are the threats today?
How are we going to deal with these issues?
How are we going to deal with terrorism?
We understand the scar left by September 11.
But at the same time, as Mr Patten said, what is the reason for terrorism in Palestine?
Is a strategic, policing approach the only way to wipe out terrorism?
Or do we in fact need to win the hearts and minds of the people in the regions in which violence and conflict often foster terrorism?
This is where Europe has an important part to play.
As Mr Patten said, we invest in humanitarian aid and development aid and we open our markets to regions throughout the world in order to boost their economies.
We deal with problems such as poverty, the environment, equality, ethnic crises and fundamentalism.
These are the issues we should be discussing with the United States, so that we can work out a new policy for dealing with these problems in a new era.
And this is not a weak Europe talking. It is a Europe of values and experience.
I should like to say here that you, the European Parliament, have a very important part to play.
It is not enough for the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the presidency or Mr Solana or Mr Patten to meet Colin Powell or whoever happens to be the US Secretary of State at the time.
We need to actively involve American society and talk to it and the European Parliament can play a very important role in this dialogue with American society, especially with the American Congress.
I have spoken with the President of Parliament about his initiatives and I think he is in full agreement with this prospect.
Fourthly, I should like to say something about the Arab world.
Many of you emphasised that this crisis must not be a clash of cultures or religions and highlighted a real fear that such might be the outcome of this crisis.
I can tell you from my own experience and from my discussions with the Arab world that the action, role and voice of Europe have helped not only to prevent this but to strengthen our cooperation with the Arab world.
Our partnership with them is very important.
We share a common fate in our region when it comes to security in the region and numerous other issues, such as the economy and political cooperation and, as we have announced repeatedly, we are committed to resolving the Middle East conflict.
We want to put relations between Israel and the European Union on a new footing, we too want to help bring about security in the region, but we feel that there will be a more basic, if you like permanent, guarantee of the security of Israel if the Middle East question is resolved, if a credible, organised, democratic Palestinian state is created and, of course, if the entire region then works with Israel, in accordance with the Arab League initiatives, recognising it and helping to guarantee its security.
So I think our position is very important and the Arabs certainly approve of it.
However, as Mr Brok said, cultural dialogue is the top priority.
The Arab League asked us to set up a cultural dialogue, we accepted this proposal, it is already under way and I personally mentioned to the Arab summit that we need to discuss issues such as terrorism, security, human rights, the involvement of civil society and democracy, the role of women in society and the UNDP report, which is highly instructive on the reforms needed in the Arab world.
Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke about democracy in the Arab world.
We do not disagree; I agree entirely and have emphasised the fact that democracy, the notion of democracy cannot be imposed.
The word itself tells us that it originates in the public, the people, the citizenry, that it comes from the bottom up.
We therefore have to cultivate democratic institutions.
And here again the European Union has a very important part to play in the Arab world, in a dialogue to assist these very reforms, with respect for the Arab world and with respect for its understandable sensitivities.
We have already decided to start the cultural dialogue at the political level, as well as with religious leaders and other intellectuals, to start a Euro-Arab dialogue and to start a debate on the role of women within the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
I should like to thank Mrs Diamantopoulou, who will make a special contribution to the forthcoming debate on the role of women with her report on the role of women to the meeting of Euro-Mediterranean partners.
Finally, here too Parliament has a very important role to play, especially the European Parliament, where we want to formalise the meeting of parliamentarians within the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
Before I finish, I should like to comment briefly on a matter which was raised.
Turkey. Both Mr Watson and Mr Cohn-Bendit asked whether Cyprus and democratic developments in Turkey will be the first victims.
There may indeed be a great deal of fallout from the crisis and we shall have to deal with it, regardless of whether or not there is a war.
We are deeply concerned about Turkey, it is a candidate country and, as the European Union, we have a special responsibility for it because it is a candidate country, we have a responsibility because in 2004 we have an important decision to take about Turkey's progress towards Europe, a decision about its progress towards integration which, as I said earlier, means integration into a community of values.
And it would, of course, be a double whammy if this very progress towards change and reform in Turkey were to fall foul of the crisis.
I think that the Turkish parliament really is acquiring democratic momentum which we must respect and build on.
Here again the European Parliament has an important role to play.
I think we all need to keep up our efforts to bring about democratic change in Turkey.
We also need to understand why Turkey has a number of serious fears about Iraq, especially the integrity of Iraq.
If Iraq's integrity cannot be safeguarded, the Kurdish question will blow up in our faces.
The European Union is committed to protecting the democratic and minority rights of the Kurds.
Iraq may perhaps become a federation at a later date.
However, the European Union is against any thought of changing the borders and threatening the territorial integrity of Iraq.
I think this is an important message that needs to be underlined.
(Applause)
This crisis is also causing Turkey serious economic problems, which will be even worse if there is a war and we in the European Union must understand that.
At the same time, Turkey's progress towards the European Union calls for a solution to the Cyprus question.
On behalf of the presidency, I should like to express our appreciation of all Kofi Annan's efforts to resolve this problem.
However, these efforts are not finished.
This chapter has not closed and, of course, the Cyprus question will not be sacrificed to Iraq.
I think there is still a great deal of momentum and there will be increasing momentum as Cyprus integrates into the European Union.
We want the Turkish Cypriots with us.
We want them here in this Chamber.
We want them in the Council, we want them in the European institutions.
(Applause)
That means, however, the Cyprus question needs to be resolved.
We want to see the Turkish Cypriot community with us. That means we also want Turkey's help to ensure that the Turkish Cypriots do not remain excluded from this big family, this community of values.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken for longer than the Rules of Procedure allow.
My thanks to you and the President for your forbearance but, as I am sure you understand, this is a very important debate.
I just want to finish with a couple of comments.
We are indeed in the middle of a crisis but, as the Chinese say, a crisis is both a threat and an opportunity.
The main opportunity here is to reform our own institutions and operations so that we have a more important voice on the international stage, a united voice.
In turn, unity must be based on the democratic credentials of any new institutions we set up and on our addressing the democratic deficit, because our citizens want this common voice and have already said as much by taking to the streets of the European Union.
Secondly, it is an opportunity to restate our relations with the Arab world, as I said, through cultural dialogue.
It is an opportunity for new relations with the United States, articulated around the issues of security, democracy and multilateral diplomacy.
As Mrs BerÃšs and several other members said about the UN, it is an opportunity to empower this organisation, because the interdependency of developments on the international stage, technological, economic, political and environmental developments, which give rise to interdependent interests, raises the problem of global intergovernmentalism.
And the question of global intergovernmentalism raises the basic issue of what principles this global intergovernmentalism is to be based on, so that we live in a world which will have many problems, but which will resolve its problems peacefully, in a spirit of justice and respect for human beings and our environment.
Europe is a prototype for multilateral cooperation, the like of which the world has never seen.
This teaching power is a decisive factor.
And what we teach is the strength of law, not the law of the strong.
This moral authority must be safeguarded if we want to live in a world of security and freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen, the presidency will make every effort to respond to the demands of the citizens of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Member States.
At the same time, whatever the outcome of the crisis, I should like to call on you to work with us and use this opportunity to ensure that a stronger Europe emerges from this crisis and the voice of our values is heard loud and clear on the international stage, calling for greater democracy and security on our continent.
(Applause)
You said very clearly that Parliament had an important role to play.
At this crucial time I am sure that every colleague here would wish you and Commissioner Patten every success in looking after the interests of the peoples of Europe.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
At his press conference the day before yesterday, the President of the French Republic rightly emphasised the fact that the deployment of UK and US forces on the borders of Iraq was the real cause of the resumption of the inspections and the obtaining of the first tangible results.
It is no paradox to maintain that this deployment has enabled us, so far, to make a little progress, peacefully, towards our common objective, that is to say the disarmament of Iraq.
In today's debate, however, we have clearly felt, among certain speakers, the beginnings of a slide towards a sort of anti-American exaltation.
The chairman of the Communist Group, for example, was pleased to see the coming together of what he called the largest peace camp seen since the end of the cold war.
This argument reminded us of the old dialectic which we used to hear too much of precisely during the cold war.
Thanks to that argument, the objective of disarming Saddam Hussein, and even sometimes of condemning him, has gradually disappeared behind anti-American jubilation.
For my part, I should like to avoid such distractions, and return to the main question which we are beginning to forget: namely, how to disarm Saddam Hussein without waiting ten years to do it.
The next item is the vote
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for that welcome.
This draft regulation on the legal framework within which Eurostat operates is intended to improve comparisons of Member States' gross domestic products by making them more complete and more reliable. As such it is one that we can all support.
There are, though, two aspects of it to which I would now like to draw attention.
The first thing is that the Council and the Commission are still in dispute about the deadline by which data on aggregate gross national income - please take note that it is no longer called the gross domestic product - has to be forwarded to Eurostat in Luxembourg.
This used to be 30 September; the Commission proposed that it should be 15 September, and a majority on the Council had already decided in favour of 22 September.
That seems rather like haggling.
As rapporteur, I asked myself whether we should go along with this game, but we decided to leave well alone.
To add to that, the Commission has attempted, by way of comitology - something that certain Members find intensely fascinating - to change the character of the former committee.
We are not joining in this charade either.
There is, though, another peculiarity to which I would like to draw your attention. One of the recitals states that the GNI data have to be complete, that is to say, they must include not only the data held by the tax authorities or other official bodies, but also those on undeclared activities.
I was then curious enough to ask how the Member States measure such undeclared activities as prostitution, for example.
It appears that there is a rule of thumb for this purpose.
In some Member States, it comes to 1%, equal to agriculture's contribution to the GNI; in the candidate Member States, it is estimated at 2%.
Work that out if you can.
It also appears that various Member States are very wary about estimating such illegal activities as, for example, the trade in drugs, when returns have to be made to Eurostat.
Why is this so?
It is known that an ever-increasing share of the EU's own resources is dependent on the gross domestic product.
It therefore follows that some Member States do not give the full figures, as then they would have to pay more.
On the other hand, they then also have to pay in dribs and drabs, that is to say, by underestimating their GNI. Then, of course, they would have problems complying with the Maastricht criteria.
I know that the President-in-Office of the Council has spoken for too long, but I wanted to keep you informed, just so that you know what you are about to vote on.
Mr President, the Karas report was discussed yesterday evening from 11 p.m. until midnight, with low attendance and no journalists.
This is scandalous since this is a very important report, and I believe Parliament is doing itself a disservice by systematically relegating legislative reports to the small hours of the morning.
How can you expect our legislative work to be respected if we do not respect the work of Mr Karas and others, who have put a lot of work into this extremely important directive?
The group leaders will have noted your comments.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, at the eleventh hour the rapporteur, Mr Thomas Mann, has made some further effort to move some way towards my group's position.
We very much appreciate this effort.
Nevertheless, the result does not yet entirely meet our expectations.
This is because there are a number of passages concerning SME policy and concerning tax reduction that we cannot wholeheartedly support.
I would therefore like to call on my group to refrain from voting on this report.
.
(PT) I broadly share the rapporteur's concerns about the need to adapt companies' obligations to file information to the digital age.
I believe that the greater speed and transparency resulting from these measures will provide greater certainty and security for companies' corporate life and for commercial practices, benefiting all those involved, the interested parties in general and, ultimately, end consumers themselves.
In fact, there is an entire range of documents and information detailing the true corporate situation of companies that is not always made available in time either to their shareholders or to their trading partners.
This could lead to clearly unnecessary damage, arising solely from an ignorance of the facts which, in addition to the requirement formally to publish such information, would require genuine and effective publicity. In a borderless area, this will only be possible by using the most up-to-date techniques and information technologies and the voluntary publishing of information in other languages.
The provision that companies' websites should also contain the minimum particulars laid down in Article 4 of Directive 68/151/EEC is also important.
This directive would also need to be updated with regard to the types of company it covers and with regard to its references to accounting requirements.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of this report because I attach enormous importance to adopting better and swifter measures for dispute resolution in civil and commercial matters.
Establishing such measures is an essential prerequisite for making recourse to the courts and to traditional arbitration mechanisms less frequent, sparing these institutions from having to rule on matters which, being less complex, could be resolved by alternative dispute resolution models.
I am pleased to note and endorse the rapporteur's recommendation that the Commission should 'be cautious and undertake in-depth studies and wide-ranging consultations before considering proposing any legislative initiatives'.
Such measures are required by the particular sensitivity of litigious situations and the principle of subsidiarity, which can never be undermined in justice-related issues, particularly in terms of compliance with national legal systems and extra-judicial dispute resolution mechanisms already existing in them.
I also agree with the rapporteur on the need to reduce formalities to a minimum and to eschew legal jargon, whilst not, of course, affecting the right to justice or to legal security and quality, and without undermining parties' rights to take decisions reached outside the judicial system through the courts.
Mr President, when I voted in favour of the Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez report, I did so as a matter of firm conviction, and in doing so I am in agreement with the overwhelming majority in this House, for the fact that only five Members did not vote in favour of it should be a signal to those elements in the Council who have hitherto sought to prevent or delay favourable treatment for biofuels.
All the arguments speak in favour of biofuels: abandoning excessive dependence, greater benefits for the environment, and an increase in the sources of income available to rural firms.
This makes it incomprehensible that there should be so little awareness on the part of certain elements in the Council, comparable to their ignorance of the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources.
I hope that this solidly united vote by Parliament will, as it is intended to do, stir up the Council to demonstrate some awareness and enable us to benefit the environment, to strengthen agriculture and, above all, to be less dependent on others for energy.
. (FR) At first reading, Parliament presented a series of amendments aimed at quite rightly recognising pure plant oil (PPO) as a biofuel.
These various amendments have not been taken up in the common position adopted by the Council, and this is why I am voting in favour of Amendment No 7 tabled by the competent committee.
In fact, there is good reason to recognise pure plant oil as a biofuel given its many environmental advantages, but also because the decentralised production of oil in farms would allow the farmers in question to gain added value from their production.
The main criticism made in relation to the use of PPO relates to the need to adapt diesel engines.
However, this need could work in favour of PPO, since an entire economic sector could thereby be established, with all the economic and social benefits that would bring.
Furthermore, adaptations of engines are also necessary for other alternative fuels which do benefit from tax exemption: hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, electricity, etc.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez on the document on which we have voted today in plenary and which I fully support.
I am of the same mind as the rapporteur on the need to establish a legal framework that will enable the use of alternative fuels for road transport to be promoted and developed, not only because of the security that this guarantees for investors but also because of what it represents for the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the framework of the commitments given in Kyoto.
In this context, I wish to highlight the potential importance of tax incentives for promoting the development of biofuels in contributing, through appropriate tax schemes, to reducing differences in the production costs of fossil fuels.
.
(PT) Given the forecast of a 50% increase in greenhouse gases in the transport sector by 2010, we must make provision for a legal framework that involves promoting public passenger transport, a commitment to the transport of goods by sea and rail, promoting the development of new engines, the introduction of new fuels and taxes on energy and on carbon dioxide emissions.
Promoting biofuels forms part of this framework and is extremely important for the following reasons: it reduces our dependence on oil; it is good for the environment and offers new income opportunities for farmers.
I am sorry that the Council has removed the mandatory nature of targets for bringing biofuels onto the market and has even allowed Member States to set targets lower than those proposed in the directive.
