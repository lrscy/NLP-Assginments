In this particular case, we have in a way been a guinea pig.
The version of the Commission document on which Parliament voted was not the same as that adopted by the Council, apparently because the lawyer-linguists got involved after Parliamentâs vote.
Thanks to what was described as a technical intervention, policy directions were obviously taken that were contrary to how Parliament had voted.
In the previous Parliament, our colleague Richard Corbett was presented with an own-initiative report to establish the proper way of proceeding on such occasions.
I hope that Parliament will be able to adopt a report on this very quickly because we need additional weapons to stand up to the Council and Commission in such cases of agreement on first reading.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to say that there are some translation problems with certain languages.
Accordingly, I ask the Bureau to use the French version on point 5, and the Portuguese version on point 8 and on Recital M.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
As the author of this amendment, I should like to propose a minor correction, namely that the word âlarge-scaleâ be deleted from the phrase âchannel investment into large-scale infrastructureâ.
The amendment would then read âchannel investment into infrastructureâ.
There is probably no need for me to explain the reasons for this change.
The aim is to avoid limiting ourselves only to large-scale infrastructure measures, and instead to include all major infrastructure investments.
I thank you.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The June List supports the creation of a properly functioning internal market for natural gas that facilitates market access for new players.
As long as incentives for investing in infrastructure and taking commercial risks are maintained through guaranteeing reasonable levels of compensation for those accessing the market, it is a good thing that basic principles and provisions should be established, governing the conditions of access to the gas networks â access that will lead to increased competition in the EU and, in the longer term, to lower gas prices.
Â Â  . An open economy requires clearly defined regulations that are possible to comply with and are properly thought through, in such a way that compliance can be verified and enforced.
As regards the issue before us â conditions for access to natural gas networks â it is important to guarantee non-discrimination, in order to ensure that the internal market can function properly.
Given that the report before us meets these concerns, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The internal natural gas market can only function efficiently if conditions for access to the network throughout the single market meet certain minimum standards regarding fundamental aspects of third party access.
These standards are essential if we are to ensure fair and balanced conditions and to allow opportunities for newcomers, particularly small businesses, to enter the market.
Conditions of access to the network must not distinguish between network users of different sizes, given that this could lead to unfair competition and would in any case prevent gas consumers from deriving equitable benefit from the internal natural gas market.
With the measures that have been adopted, users requesting access to the network enjoy enough transparency to be able to carry out their business, given that, otherwise, business opportunities arising from the development of the internal market in the short or long term could not be exploited.
The amendments to the legislation further promote non-discrimination and competition and clarify basic principles.
Accordingly, I voted in favour of the compromise amendments (block 1) and I am delighted that the regulation can now be adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, in this commotion, it is difficult to explain in a few words that in the proposal which I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to reject the De Rossa report does nevertheless recognise that the Commission proposal contains a number of positive elements, which it has never been my intention to do away with.
The request should rather be seen as a message to the Council of Ministers, in which 22 countries adhere to the rules as enshrined in Regulation 1408/71, and there are three Member States, namely the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, that have been unable to support them.
This message had to be sent at some stage, and I hope that due consideration will be given to ensuring the highest standard of mobility for workers in Europe; if not, we can forget about the Lisbon objectives.
I think that this message has been received if more than 200 people have approved a proposal as rigid as the one I have tabled.
Â Â  Free movement of persons in the internal market is one of the EUâs greatest successes and advantages, and this naturally presupposes a properly functioning common labour market.
At the same time, the right of the Member States to choose their own welfare models must, however, be respected.
Certain Member States select a combination of high taxes, comprehensive public services and generous subsidies, while others go for low taxes and a more rudimentary welfare model.
It is not possible, then, to allow Europeans to opt for low taxes in one country and, at the same time, claim the right to generous subsidies and support from another country.
If that is allowed, the Member States will be forced to introduce the same welfare model.
The European peoplesâ ability to determine their own future will be undermined in a further area.
The June List wants to see a proper review of the growing influence of EU rules within social and labour market policy.
We therefore choose to vote against the report, which calls for further limitation upon the Member Statesâ room for manoeuvre in some of the most central areas of democratic economic policy.
Â Â  . The EU must not only be an area of free movement of capital, products and services.
Europe must also provide the opportunity for its citizens to live, work and move freely, without prejudice to their rights.
Regulation 1408/71 plays an important role in meeting this objective.
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation for a second reading on the Council common position.
Regulation 1408/71, which entered into force over thirty years ago, defines the basis on which benefits are to be provided to citizens who move from one Member State to another.
The revision of the current regulation contains several new provisions aimed at enhancing social security rights and makes it possible to ascertain whether the citizen remains entitled to specific benefits provided for by their Member State of origin, and which are therefore exportable, or whether an equivalent benefit is available in the citizen's new Member State of residence.
I regret, however, that the Council did not accept the inclusion of five benefits for people with disabilities and their families, which should be taken into account at the next revision of the regulation.
Â Â  . Although this is a second reading and as such there is no final vote, I still feel it would be useful to explain why I voted against the proposal to reject the common position.
As Portugal has been advocating, and bearing in mind the European Courtâs position, it is crucial that Annex IIA of Regulation 1408/71 should be deleted, in order to ensure the exportability of certain benefits.
This is of particular relevance to Portuguese people living abroad, because if those special non-contributory benefits were included, they could not be exported, and that would have serious consequences for those people.
Â Â  . The free movement of workers in the EU area is hampered somewhat by the fact that the Member States have different approaches to their social security regimes, which is natural in a Community that sees itself as plural and not centralised.
Nevertheless, I recognise the need to establish bases whereby citizens of one Member State can move to another without losing all of the guarantees and social benefits to which they were previously entitled.
Unfortunately the âexportabilityâ of five non-contributory benefits â namely, child care allowance, disability allowance and care allowance for disabled children, disability living allowance, attendance allowance and carerâs allowance â remains controversial.
The notion is disgracefully rejected by certain countries, namely Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which object to the principle of paying benefits outside their territories (Article 42 of the Treaty) to the detriment of workers who return to their countries of origin.
The Court of Justice must therefore issue a ruling on this matter, in accordance with the Commissionâs statement.
In line with the Portuguese Governmentâs position, I voted against Amendment 2, which would lead to the common position being rejected, and in favour of Amendment 1, which takes note of the Commissionâs statement on possible recourse to the Court of Justice for a ruling.
Â Â  . In light of Parliamentâs proposals for amendments to the Commissionâs proposal and subsequent to the opinions issued by those working in the sector, it is important to highlight, :
- Criticism of the intention to give air traffic controllers extra responsibilities, relating to âunexpected crisis situations (for example, aircraft hijackings, bomb threats)â, which go beyond their normal duties.
- Criticism of the possibility that has now arisen that controllers âexercising their activity under the responsibility of air navigation service providersâ will not be employed by them.
Will they be insecure employees?
Will they be workers from one company working for another?
Under what conditions will they be working?
Can a controller work without being employed by an air navigation service provider?
What would be the consequences of that?
Lastly, although it is mentioned only obliquely, openness to previous and current projects relating to the âSingle European Skyâ â in other words, the liberalisation and subsequent privatisation of air traffic management â is certainly implicit in some of Parliamentâs proposals.
Â Â  . As a measure to complement the âsingle European skyâ I welcome this proposal.
It is obviously imperative that we take this opportunity to retain the ability to revise and reinforce safety aspects of air traffic management, to facilitate the establishment of cross-border functional airspace blocks and to create a level playing field for training services across the European Union.
In addition to this, I support the Linguistic requirement that Member States must ensure that air traffic controllers can demonstrate the ability to speak and understand English to a satisfactory standard as a means to the ends above.
I also welcome the mutual recognition of air traffic controller licences contained within this proposal, confirming the principles established by the case law of the European Court of Justice.
Â Â  . The report before us, which I voted for, incorporated the proposal for an amendment that I tabled, the purpose of which is to safeguard the rights acquired by current air traffic controllers â rights that were acquired under valid, stringent legislation and that have clearly had positive results â without in any way undermining the ultimate aim of ensuring air transport safety.
Given that these prerequisites have been met and their compatibility confirmed, and in view of the adoption of the amendment mentioned, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . As a follow-up to the legislative package on the Single European Sky, the purpose of this proposal for a directive is to harmonise the legal provisions of Member States relating to the training and professional activities of air traffic controllers, a matter of pressing importance at the present time.
Once the common standards of skills and training, based on international criteria, have been adopted, these professionals will be able to move around the European market, the recruitment pool available to employers will expand and identical safety standards across the EU area can be achieved.
The fact that the report before us received a clearly favourable vote in the parliamentary committee demonstrates both the highly technical nature of the proposal and the adoption of most of its provisions.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  .â The directive on the Community Air Traffic Controller Licence completes the 'puzzle' of capitalist restructurings in air transport in order to apply the 'Single European Sky', within the framework of the more general anti-grass roots policy of the European Union, by attacking the wage and social rights of the workers and guaranteeing huge profits for capital and painful repercussions on flight safety and countries' sovereign rights.
This directive promotes the separation of 'flight safety service providers' from 'national government supervisory authorities' and transfers control of the single European area to the Euro-unifying monopolies which rule in the air transport sector.
Accident investigations, airworthiness controls of aircraft and companies and the issuing of air traffic control diplomas and licences have already been transferred to monopoly groups.
The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece is voting against the directive on the Community Air Traffic Controller Licence.
At the same time, we support the workers' fight for nationalised air transport alone, with better and cheaper flights to serve grass-roots requirements, stable employment and satisfaction of the contemporary needs of the workers.
Â Â  . The European Investment Bank (EIB) is, and must be, one of the EUâs development policy instruments.
The work that it does, the credit that it grants and the terms in which it does this, the technical support that it provides â all of these elements contribute to the Bankâs work being geared towards development, which is something that we endorse.
It is also true that the highly political nature of the Bankâs activities and the way in which it addresses the planned objectives, justify its presentation to Parliament.
For both of these reasons, and given that voting this way will not compromise a single one of the EIBâs activities, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a privileged instrument of the EU and its economy.
Both the investments that it has made and the investments for which it has been the catalyst reaffirm its key role in turning Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
The dynamism that the Bank puts into its activities, particularly as regards the private sector, has enabled new sources of funding to be raised, by means of capital risk instruments and the granting of guarantees, for example.
This approach provides us with the necessary guarantee that, within the EUâs institutional structure, the EIB will continue to play a crucial role in financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), thereby contributing to an economy that is sound, that creates more and better jobs and that is a catalyst for sustainable growth.
Accordingly, the EIB should place emphasis on increasing the granting of credits to small businesses, on defining precise rules as regards assessing its projects, on improving SME access to risk capital and on encouraging access to its activities on the part of local and regional financial partners.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  We support the report on the social situation in the European Union.
However, we voted against the demand for the Commission to withdraw its proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, partly because the demand is unrealistic and partly because we believe that we can influence the content of the directive in the European Parliament.
When it comes to harmonising the status of paid work, involving corresponding rights and guarantees â especially where social protection and lifelong learning are concerned - we assume that such harmonisation is about minimum levels.
When it comes to introducing measures such as the âminimum wageâ, we interpret this as referring to what, in Sweden, we call social allowances and not to the introduction of a minimum wage system.
Â Â  I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on her report on the social situation in Europe.
The report makes a critical diagnosis, supported by figures that amply demonstrate the social inequalities that still exist in Europe, which have been exacerbated by the recent enlargement.
I endorse the need, flagged up in the report, to:
- âprioritise tackling the issues of unemployment, poverty and social exclusionâ and to create âlong-term quality jobs backed up by workers' rightsâ;
- keep this situation in mind when the broad guidelines for economic policies are set out, namely the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the revision of the Lisbon Strategy and the decisions on the Financial Perspectives and the Structural Funds for 2007-2013; and
- support the structural development of the least-favoured regions, in particular the outermost regions.
Of the measures put forward, I should like to highlight the particular significance of those aimed at fostering equality and combating discrimination in the area of womenâs rights, as today we celebrate International Womenâs Day; and those such as the âliving wageâ in the fight against poverty, in light of Portugalâs pioneering and clearly successful experiment with the âMinimum Guaranteed Wageâ under the previous socialist government.
Â Â  . We regret that this report was rejected by the right-wing majority in Parliament, which is uncomfortable debating social problems, which does not accept the causes of those problems being highlighted and which rejects any attempt at changing neoliberal policies.
From the outset, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, along with the liberals at various points, attempted to water down some of the key elements of the report.
As it did not manage this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it did so in plenary.
The elements in question were as follows:
- Removing criticism of the Lisbon Strategyâs contribution towards accelerating liberalisations/privatisations, the flexibility of labour and job insecurity;
- Emphasising that, despite current problems of unemployment and social exclusion, the Lisbon Strategy, without any revision, is important to the future;
- Removing references to the need to review current economic and financial policies, in particular those of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market and competition policy, and the emphasis on achieving a high employment rate and long-term quality jobs backed up by workersâ rights;
- Rejecting, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, our request to the Commission to remove the proposal for a directive on completing the internal market for services ...
Â Â  Relocations, unemployment, social decline.
The picture MrsÂ Figueiredo paints of the social situation in Europe is a true one.
She fails to condemn the causes of the problem, however, and therefore offers no solution.
This disaster is the outcome of the Europe of Brussels and Maastricht, which, if you remember the promises of 1992, was supposed to bring prosperity, growth and employment.
The worst is to come, however, with the European Constitution institutionalising the principles of world free trade.
The Bolkestein directive obliging our service companies either to relocate or to shut up shop prefigures what that Europe will be: anti-social because it is anti-national.
What should we do?
Build another Europe, based on commonsense principles: Community preference and the restoration of our customs protections, an answer to the problem of immigration, respect for national sovereignty and therefore in Franceâs case the preservation of its system of social protection and of its public services, a refusal to accept non-European countries like Turkey.
Before that, however, the French people will have to give a vote of social self-defence on 29 May and say no in Chiracâs referendum.
Â Â  .
I welcome this action as many of us spend a large part of our lives in working environments so they should be made as safe and as pleasant as possible.
While there is an appearance that currently the United States economy is doing better than the Continental European economy, it would be far too simplistic to attribute this to higher working standards in the European Union; I remain convinced that higher social standards will lead to better productivity in the long run.
Â Â  . Although the rapporteur is from Portugal, and the report addresses the issue of the social situation in Europe, I am still unable to vote in favour.
Rather than a national or a social emphasis, the report before us contains a heavy ideological slant, something that, with all due respect, I have for many years considered deeply flawed.
There are those who believe more that the State is the most effective factor in creating social equality, yet there are others who believe that the right model to follow is one of freedom regulated by a State that interferes less, but is more rigorous in enforcing the law.
I belong to the latter group.
The crux of the matter is the economy.
I believe that a productive economy generates more wealth, more jobs, more opportunities and encourages better distribution.
The idea that a country full of subsidies and public jobs is sustainable is a mirage and a sure-fire guarantee of greater social injustice.
Â Â  . In seeking to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic economy, we must not turn our backs on social concerns, and growth must be backed up by policies promoting greater social cohesion.
I therefore endorse the adoption of measures aimed at supporting the family, reducing inequalities between countries, resolving the birth rate problem, analysing the impact of the directive on services in the labour market, encouraging vocational training and setting up small and medium-sized businesses.
Unlike the rapporteur, I do not believe that social problems in Europe can be solved without taking into account price stability, cost reduction and budget deficit reduction.
I also do not agree that the fight against poverty and social exclusion can be pursued solely in the social economy.
Rather, I feel that encouraging private initiative should be the driving force behind any economy and behind solutions to a countryâs social problems.
Lastly, I feel that Europeâs demographic problem is better solved by boosting the birth rate, rather than by emigration.
Unfortunately, the rapporteurâs maximalist positions, and those of her group, led to the rejection of this report.
This is a pity because the issue is a serious one that deserved more suitable recommendations, in other words more realistic, objective and balanced recommendations.
Â Â  .â The explanatory statement on the social situation in the ÎU records, with substantiating evidence, the results of the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU and of free competition, with the increase in poverty, unemployment and insecurity and the maximisation of the profitability of big business.
The measures proposed on a 'minimum survival income', 'state protection systems', 'lifelong learning', extending part-time employment at a time of capitalist restructurings, stepping up competition and the commercialisation of health and welfare services, within the framework of the Lisbon strategy, aim to check extreme expressions of the impoverishment of the workers and are intended to be used to step up the degree of exploitation of working and grass-roots classes.
The strengthening of this report with anti-labour and reactionary amendments by the majority of the conservative forces in plenary of the European Parliament shows the negative correlation of power which exists in the European Community when it comes to grass-roots rights and demands.
The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece, in the face of these developments, is helping to escalate the workers' fight to overturn the anti-grass roots policy of the EU and its institutions, so that the contemporary needs of working, grass-roots families can be satisfied.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the review of the Non-proliferation Treaty and nuclear arms in North Korea and Iran.
Â Â  Mr President, the Non-proliferation Treaty is, in fact, still the cornerstone of the world non-proliferation system.
It is therefore important for the European Union to preserve the integrity of every aspect of that treaty and to see to it that the treaty review conference planned for 2005 is crowned with success.
The NPT review conference will have to strike a balance between the three pillars: non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
At the same time, it will have to take due account of the main issues concerning nuclear non-proliferation, in particular the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea, Iran and the so-called Khan network.
The Council is currently working on a common position that will make a positive contribution to the review conference.
So far as the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea is concerned, the European Union presidency has expressed its deep concern at the countryâs announcement on 10 February 2005 that it possessed nuclear weapons.
It noted with regret the DPRKâs announcement that it was suspending its participation in the multilateral talks on its nuclear programme indefinitely.
We will therefore have to bring strong pressure to bear on the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea to persuade it to go back as soon as possible on its decision to withdraw from the six-party talks so that negotiations can be resumed and a peaceful, negotiated solution found to the crisis affecting the Korean peninsula.
We reaffirm that the European Union is resolutely in favour of the six-party talks process as a way of finding a solution to this crisis.
We must insist that the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea complies with the nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty.
Respect for international obligations, both on nuclear issues and in the field of human rights, is vital if the European Union is to develop bilateral relations with that country.
We are also strongly encouraging the DPRK authorities to step up their dialogue and intensify their contacts with the Republic of Korea.
So far as Iran is concerned, the Paris Agreement is now being strictly applied, with the total suspension of all enrichment-related activities and all reprocessing activities without exception; this has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Negotiations on long-term arrangements began in December in the three working groups concerned with political and security questions, nuclear questions and issues of economic cooperation and technology, as well as the steering committee.
The first important series of working group meetings took place in January 2005.
Obviously, obtaining objective guarantees of the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme will continue to be of prime importance.
Reports are being drawn up for the steering committee meeting in March, which will be an important occasion for taking stock of the issue.
I would like to add that, at the same time, negotiations on the trade and cooperation agreement and on a political agreement resumed in January 2005.
Both parties are negotiating seriously, and so long as the Iranians continue to take part in the talks there will be a chance of success.
However, it is important to remain vigilant so as to ensure that, under IAEA supervision, Iran maintains a total suspension of its activities, without exception, for as long as the negotiations on long-term arrangements continue, total suspension being the condition for their continuance and completion.
We also informed US President Bush and Condoleezza Rice of these considerations when we held talks with them in Brussels a few days ago.
Â Â  Mr President, I am obviously speaking here on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who is unfortunately on an assignment.
The Commission agrees with the Council that the Non-proliferation Treaty must be preserved by every means and even strengthened if possible.
This point is made in the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Council in December 2003 and which the Commission, in close cooperation with the Council, is helping to implement.
The strategy recognises in particular the need to guarantee adequate financial resources from the budget and Community powers.
In support of this, the Commission presented its proposals for the next financial instruments to Parliament and the Council in October 2004.
So far as the instrument for stability in external relations is concerned, specific reference was made to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The Commissionâs proposal is currently being examined by the budgetary authority.
We hope it will result in more resources for promoting the European Unionâs activities in the field of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the period 2007-2013.
More specifically, so far as the NPT is concerned, these financial resources should support actions to strengthen the treatyâs three pillars: non-proliferation, disarmament and cooperation in the safe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
In the context of world partnership, the Commission believes that the commitment it gave at the Kananaskis G8 summit in July 2002 against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related matters is particularly important.
That involves implementing projects that will really enable us to help third countries to collect nuclear or radioactive material and make it secure and/or eliminate it, effectively controlling exports or preventing illegal trafficking in materials and equipment that might be used to manufacture nuclear devices, ensuring that specialists and scientists who were previously engaged in arms-related activities are retrained and, finally, contributing to the risk-free development of nuclear applications.
All these initiatives would help us reach the ultimate objective of the Non-proliferation Treaty.
During the current year, the Commission has been engaged in a pilot scheme decided by Parliament at the end of 2003.
This pilot scheme currently serves to finance an exploratory study under the direction of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (Unidir) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI); it will help the Commission, in cooperation with Parliament and the Council, to press ahead with the programming of new financing instruments.
The Commission expects to present the results of the study in November at a conference of parliamentarians and Member State delegations made up of representatives of the national parliaments and governments, to be held at the European Parliament.
Concerning Iran, as you know the European Union has just resumed talks with that country based on, and following on from, the Paris Agreement between Iran, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, with the support of the European Unionâs high representative.
That agreement and the subsequent monitoring of the implementation of Iranâs voluntary decision to suspend all enrichment and reprocessing-related activities led the European Union to resume its policy of differentiated and progressive engagement with Iran.
We have therefore resumed negotiations on an agreement covering such sensitive political issues as, on the one hand, the promotion of human rights, fighting terrorism, the Middle East peace process, weapons of mass destruction and, on the other hand, trade and cooperation.
The Commission is negotiating on the trade and cooperation-related aspects in good faith, fully taking into account the global context of the nuclear talks and the progress made in that field.
We think that should make a decisive contribution to our collective effort by opening up the way to sustainable relations and long-term cooperation between the European Union and Iran.
We are in fact convinced that this agreement and the prospects of joining the World Trade Organisation could bolster the necessary economic and social reforms in Iran, thus paving the way for the countryâs full reintegration into the international community.
I come now to North Korea.
That countryâs announcement on 10 February that it was withdrawing from the six-party talks and that it had developed nuclear weapons was clearly not very astute, despite Kim JongÂ IIâs conciliatory words as few days later, when he proposed resuming talks if conditions changed.
It has made an already difficult process even more complicated.
The recent visit to Pyongyang by a Chinese envoy gives us hope that talks may resume; Chinaâs diplomatic efforts deserve our full support.
Internal developments in North Korea, especially the provisional measures taken towards reform and the resulting social tensions, have recently given rise to a strengthening of control by the authorities.
This is having repercussions on North Koreaâs foreign policy.
We witnessed similar scenarios in Europeâs former socialist countries.
The position adopted by the European Union is not to over react to virulent statements from Pyongyang.
We will continue to make clear to the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea that the nuclear problem must be resolved and that the six-party talks are the best way of dealing with this question.
We will continue to insist that the DPRK must fully comply with all its international non-proliferation commitments, in particular the Non-proliferation Treaty and the IAEA guarantee agreement, and that it must abandon any nuclear weapons programme completely.
At the same time, the European Union thinks it is important to encourage more contacts between North Korea and the outside world and to support economic reform and change in that country.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty is of fundamental importance in terms of the European Unionâs security and defence policy.
There will, in May, be a conference to examine compliance with the Treaty, and we think it necessary and proper that an official delegation from this House should participate in it.
It will, at this conference, be of the utmost importance that the Member States of the European Union should actually put together a common position on this matter and be united in putting it forward.
The conference will also, though, be an opportunity for us to consider where we stand on compliance with the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and this is where a number of developments give cause for concern.
For a start, there is North Korea, which, as we have heard, has both opted out of the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty and announced that it has nuclear weapons at its disposal.
Although we, in the European Union, possess no powers or means whereby we might in any way enforce the reversal of this decision, we do expect North Korea to resume dialogue with its partners, China in particular, which may, in the medium or long term, make a peaceful resolution of this conflict possible.
At the same time, we are deeply concerned about what is happening in Iran, where, although the temporary suspension of its enrichment programme that has occurred is a positive development, we do expect it to become permanent in character.
The three-way talks between foreign ministers â a means of diplomatic conflict resolution in which we expect our partners, including the United States, to play an active part â are intended to help us reach a common solution to the Iran problem, one that will do justice to its interests and to those of the European Community.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven its worth.
States have decided against the acquisition of nuclear arms in return for the possibility of using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and the pledge by the nuclear arms states to engage in gradual disarmament.
It should be said that the Treaty was a huge success in the context of the Cold War, when it helped to control the arms race; now, it offers the framework within which those who were enemies then have considerably reduced their arsenals.
Recent developments have already alluded to this and have illustrated the continuing need for an international treaty to combat the spread of nuclear arms technology.
Investing in the Non-Proliferation Treaty is still a priority.
Unfortunately, we cannot fail to note that the Treaty has come under pressure.
A recent UN report alerted to the possibility of the Treatyâs irreversible erosion, with a cascade of proliferation as a result.
Consequently, the Review Conference scheduled this spring should mainly be seized as an opportunity to reconfirm the Non-Proliferation Treatyâs crucial role, including the objective of ultimate general nuclear disarmament.
As a champion of the international legal order, the European Union has the special responsibility of ensuring that the Treaty is observed, which means that a tougher line must be taken towards those states that evade it.
Naturally, the developments in Iran and North Korea are crucial in this connection.
This also means that the EU must commit itself to closing the existing loopholes in the Treaty.
The test ban, the ban on nuclear tests, has still not been signed by all parties; the United States, in particular, has not done so, and is also continuing to develop nuclear weapons for battlefield use.
Needless to say, these are all issues which undermine the credibility of this important Treaty.
Developments since the previous Review Conference have also shown that the Treaty must face up to new challenges.
There is a major risk of the development of regional arms races in countries attempting to obtain nuclear arms technology.
We cannot, therefore, see the Non-Proliferation Treaty in isolation from improving regional security structures in the Middle East and in South and East Asia.
Finally, there is the risk â and that is a new threat â of nuclear technology, or even nuclear material, ending up in the hands of what we refer to as non-state actors, in other words terrorist organisations, which could, for example, by means of a âdirtyâ bomb, do an awful lot of damage.
We have to conclude that the existing agreements to prevent nuclear material from being mislaid or misappropriated do not offer adequate guarantees.
That is why in the resolution we will be adopting tomorrow, we are asking the European Union to pay special attention to this issue.
We cannot leave this matter to the United States alone.

Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, the holding of the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in a few weeksâ time is very timely, for the emphasis over the past few months has been on real, and sometimes supposed, weapons of mass destruction, so much so that the attention for nuclear proliferation would have slackened had it not been for the developments in North Korea and Iran which have come as a wake-up call.
There is a real risk of the non-proliferation scheme being eroded to such an extent that it loses all meaning, with all the risks of a renewed, unbridled arms race that this entails, in a world made far more chaotic and far more dangerous by international terrorism.
As I said, this debate and the joint resolution that is before us are very timely.
My group is urging both the EU institutions and the Member States to show a united front during the Review Conference, and argue forcefully in favour of new initiatives in terms of disarmament, in general, and nuclear disarmament, in particular.
Since the Member States are made up of both nuclear and non-nuclear powers, this may not be so obvious.
Precisely for that reason, I am pleased with the Councilâs communication that hard work is going into a common position with a view to that conference.
We would also like to urge all third member states and all European Union Member States that have not done so, to ratify the additional protocols to the International Atomic Energy Agency as a matter of urgency.
In the same vein, it is of the utmost importance that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should enter into effect as quickly as possible.
If this is to happen, a number of states, including not least the US, still need to ratify it.
As for the United States, we do not quite understand why they constantly â and, in fact, with good reasonâ warn of the dangers of weapons of mass destruction while at the same time, working on a new generation of so-called âlightâ nuclear weapons.
Surely, it is beyond any doubt that such a development will once again herald an arms race, one that would, this time, involve a type of weapon that could even more easily end up in the wrong hands.
We would therefore call on the US to abandon those plans and join us in investing all energy in reviving the efforts towards non-proliferation and disarmament.

Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 is going to be a decisive year in terms of whether nuclear disarmament is going to be achieved as a policy for peace; this primarily has to do with Iran and North Korea, but also with Pakistan, India, Israel, Europe and the USA.
It will also be decisive as regards the thinking underpinning Europeâs security strategy.
Let us establish security through effective multilateralism, that is, through international conventions such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the reinforcement of such international organisations as the IAEA or the UN.
The May conference on review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty has to face up to extremely pressing issues of global security, such as the states in crisis regions seeking to acquire atomic weapons, the black market in nuclear materials and the terrorist groups that are trying to get their hands on them.
It also has to be clear to us, though, that the commitments to disarm set down in this treaty have to be implemented, once and for all, by the states that possess nuclear weapons, for if they are not, these cannot claim with any credibility that they really do want to put a stop to proliferation.
I appeal to the European Union to assume an active role as a stakeholder, not only in the run-up to the conference, but also in its negotiations.
This is a year in which we succeed or are lost.
I appeal to the Council and the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take a progressive line.
We should be trying to put the El Baradei seven-point plan into practice.
On issues such as the enrichment of uranium, there is a need for renewal.
Signature of the supplementary protocol must become the norm.
Secondly, violations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty must be seen as endangering world peace and the sanctions imposed should reflect that.
I would like to say something about Iran, and the way the situation in the Middle East is developing.
Europe cannot accept the prospect of Iran, one day, being in possession of nuclear weapons; what we expect of it is absolute transparency and cooperation with the EU, and with the IAEA as a guarantee of its renunciation of nuclear weapons.
The Bush administration must be pro-active in supporting this, for only the Americans can make promises or carry out checks on whether economic sanctions should be relaxed.
It should also be possible to discuss security issues with Iranâs interests in mind, and I urge the Council and the Commission to do so.
Where Iran is concerned, I also urge that we have to take care not to dishonour or deny our values during these negotiations; human rights can never be negotiable.
As regards North Korea, at this point I would simply appeal to them to return to the negotiating table, and the Commission should examine whether Europe should take on an active role in this respect.
It is precisely because our credibility is at stake that we need to ascertain whether it is indeed the case that the Americans have more atomic weapons based in Europe than they have stated.
If they have, then that is a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we demand their removal.
Finally, and very briefly, let me say something about âmini-nukesâ.
In historic terms, these are something quite different; they represent the abandonment of Cold War-style deterrence in favour of the active waging of war â a disaster waiting to happen.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, crucially important though it is, is also in peril.
It is endangered on the one hand by the nuclear superpowers, and, on the other, by a number of countries on the threshold of acquiring nuclear capacity, as well as by EU Member States and the European Union itself.
âThe EU?â some might ask in astonishment.
Indeed so, for we read in the , compiled by the European Institute for Strategic Studies, that Lothar RÃŒhl, former secretary of state in the German Ministry of Defence and the paperâs joint author, has summed the matter up in the following words: âWe have not avoided the presentation of scenarios in which the European Member Statesâ nuclear forces can influence planning.â
This makes it a scandal, plain and simple, that the Socialist Group in this House should have refused to incorporate, in the resolution on which we are to vote, an appeal for a nuclear weapons-free Europe.
It really is a bit rich to urge others to dispose of their nuclear arms, while keeping quiet about oneâs own deployment plans and the modernisation of oneâs own nuclear arsenal!
Senator Roche from the Parliamentary Network for Nuclear Disarmament, pressed the point home in Brussels last week, saying â and I quote: âWe cannot constantly be calling on others to refrain from acquiring more nuclear weapons if we are not ourselves willing to disarm and scrap the EU Member Statesâ highly dangerous potential for mass destructionâ.
Let us rid Europe of nuclear weapons!
Â Â  . â Mr President, the three absolutely identical resolutions from three totally different ideological groups are evidence of the common concern on the problem of nuclear weapons and, at the same time, conceal a curious, hypocritical undercurrent.
Must Iran and North Korea be persuaded by force to stop research into the production of nuclear weapons?
Yes, they must.
Is it, however, right for us not to concern ourselves with the nuclear weapons in Israel, Pakistan, India or even in permanent members of the Security Council?
Are there, in other words, good and bad nuclear weapons?
Is it democratic and fair for us to accept that countries in the first category can possess nuclear weapons but for us to control countries in the second category that wish to acquire them?
Is it, I wonder, a coincidence that the countries that are doing their utmost for nuclear weapons, starting with the United States, are the very countries that do not participate in the Criminal Court in the Hague, the very countries that are 'snubbing' the Kyoto agreements on the environment?
These are the countries that feel they are the leaders of everyone else and are trying to impose their interests by force rather than by logic.
Is it right that 25 countries with a joint resolution, joint central bank and joint agricultural policy should not have the same right to nuclear weapons and that only two of the 25 should have the right to nuclear weapons?
Nuclear weapons are a problem in both Iran and North Korea, but this new cold war being waged between Russia and the United States, in which we are participating, is a bigger problem.
Do we dare to send inspectors to the stockrooms of Israel and China?
We do not dare to because we cannot impose it.
Consequently, we tear up our own credentials as an agency of independence and justice.
Perhaps someone can tell us where Iraq's nuclear weapons are.
They could not be found and they did not exist.
It was, however, the alibi for a brutish invasion ....
Â Â  Mr President, the worrying developments in Iran and North Korea compel us, in the European Union, to speak with one voice.
They also oblige us to work closely in tandem with the United States and all other countries that actually support the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
While it is, of course, important that negotiations are being held with North Korea and Iran, and that dialogue is still possible, other means might have to be deployed if it transpired that the dialogue were not to yield any concrete or satisfactory results, for states such as North Korea and Iran which are in possession of nuclear weapons, form a threat to world peace.
In the case of Iran, we must also ask ourselves why that country really needs nuclear energy, even for peaceful purposes.
Moreover, it is politically worrying that an infringement of the Non-Proliferation Treaty can, in practice, be used inappropriately to demand all kinds of favourable conditions.
The Treaty should be reinterpreted in such a way as to ensure that high-risk states can no longer indulge in any nuclear enrichment and processing whatever.
Â Â  Mr President, the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iraq and North Korea is a threat not just to the regions in which those States are located, but also to the whole of the planet, in particular when we are talking about developing countries which could be using their resources for other purposes.
Furthermore, if they take this course, they may be emulated by other countries of the region, by neighbouring countries, and this would therefore reverse the tendency towards non-proliferation adopted by some 20 countries over recent years.
Mr President, one worrying fact is that the International Atomic Energy Agency has detected more than a dozen cases of disappearances of nuclear material, which means that there is currently a danger of these weapons being used.
As Mr Wiersma pointed out in his speech, if terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda were to acquire nuclear weapons or if totalitarian states such as those I have mentioned were to gain access to such weapons, it would be very difficult to control their use.

Pursuing the course of dialogue, as Mr Schmit pointed out, is a good idea, and I believe that is the course we should take, but we must not forget that, in the case of Iran, on 1 March, the inspectors of the IAEA were denied access to the Parchin military complex and that, at the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is building underground tunnels for storing atomic material and equipment, nor that, for its part, North Korea has between 20 and 30 kilos of plutonium at the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, as well as one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world.
I therefore believe that we must accept the President-in-Office of the Council's recommendation that we should be attentive and vigilant, and at the same time we must try to pursue, as the President said, the course of dialogue in order to put a stop to this proliferation of nuclear weapons which, of course, is a threat, as I said at the beginning, not just to the region, but to the whole of the planet.
Â Â  â Nuclear weapons are illegal and immoral.
Five years ago, the world was celebrating the historic consensus reached with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a significant landmark for world peace, as Kofi Annan put it.
Five years on, ahead of the Treaty Review Conference, the outlook is starkly different.
The United States has shifted its position away from the commitments it made and the current administration has even announced that it will develop new nuclear weapons technology, costing astronomical amounts of money.
The United States and other nuclear weapon states that are signatories to the Treaty have, thus far, failed to honour their commitments to disarm, nor have they given any signs that they intend to reduce their nuclear arsenals.
At this very moment, the United States has 480 nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and has yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.
The upshot of which is that other states party to the Treaty do not feel they have a binding commitment to comply with the NPT following the invasion of Iraq on the false pretext of the existence of weapons of mass destruction.
Possessing â or pretending to possess â nuclear weapons has come to have a certain status, and has in fact come to be perceived as a deterrent or a means of self-defence.
Countries such as Israel, India and Pakistan, which also have nuclear weapons, remain outside the Treaty and feel neither encouraged, nor under any pressure whatsoever, to sign up to it.
More worryingly still, North Korea is trying to withdraw from the Treaty and is blackmailing the international community.
We have reached the point where applicants to join the permanent Security Council cite this status to support their candidature.
The United Nationsâ High Level Panel on dangers, threats and challenges says that the stage has been reached where the process of eroding the non-proliferation regime could have passed the point of no return and could result in galloping proliferation.
Additionally, we know that there is a high risk of nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists, often completely out of state control.
Such galloping proliferation can only be prevented if the international community channels all its efforts into effective multilateral solutions.
The forthcoming NPT review is an opportunity that must not be wasted.
The EU must play a key role in making the Treaty work as a permanent bureau, which would entail coordination with EU nuclear weapon states if there is to be genuinely coordinated action within the terms of the foreign and security policy and the security and defence policy.
Given the urgency of the situation, Parliament should send a mission to the conference to monitor European intervention, to monitor what the Member States do and to encourage action on the Treaty, in line âŠ
Â Â  The long-term goal of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty is the complete decommissioning of atomic weapons.
Today we are further from this goal than we were at the time of the signing of the treaty.
The inspections conference is unlikely to bring a breakthrough.
Despite this it could be useful if we could move forward in at least three areas.
Firstly: the additional protocols must be elevated to the status of rulings.
Secondly: the manufacture and use of nuclear fuels must be brought under international supervision.
Thirdly: violations of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty must be met with sanctions, to be decided by the UN Security Council.
Furthermore, on this topic we definitely must say: Iran must show it has honest and sincere intentions to negotiate.
Today it has clearly misled world opinion, making contradictory statements.
It is only worthwhile negotiating with them if they are honest during the talks, otherwise the whole exercise is pure theatre.
Â Â  Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the Commission and Council and find it extraordinary that neither has mentioned the fact that two EU Member States possess nuclear arsenals, and that this undermines the moral authority of the of the EU in the debate on nuclear disarmament.
The overwhelming hypocrisy of the government of my own country, the UK, and of the US, in demanding that others disarm while they simultaneously upgrade their own nuclear capacity, is completely unacceptable.
The NPT Treaty is a bargain, with non-nuclear states agreeing not to acquire nuclear weapons and existing nuclear states agreeing in return to begin a process of disarmament.
Since we have failed to keep our side of the bargain, we cannot be surprised if other countries ignore our pleas for their disarmament.
At the same time, we are running enormous risks of nuclear materials falling into the hands of non-state actors.
The position of the UK Government is sadly both reckless and irresponsible, and it is also illegal.
We have heard a lot about international law recently, so I would remind both Britain and France that, according to the ICJ in The Hague, nuclear weapons are not only immoral but also illegal.
Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their illegal nuclear warheads, and the EU and its Member States must present an action plan and timetable for achieving a nuclear-free Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear proliferation in North Korea is a source of great concern.
We are dealing with a country which has concealed its production of nuclear weapons from the international community.
These arsenals therefore have to be dismantled and North Korea must sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at once and allow IAEA inspectors from Vienna to carry out the appropriate inspections.
However, we believe that the diplomatic route is the only viable one in that region.
North Korea must return to the negotiating table for the six-party talks with the USA, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China.
Against this backdrop, aggressive statements from Washington are not helpful.
Instead of the Bush administrationâs recent sabre-rattling, I believe North Korea should be offered a political and diplomatic agreement as a for monitoring of its nuclear arsenal.
Moreover, I believe that when debating nuclear weapons, we cannot avoid the issue of who should cast the first stone.
For example, we cannot avoid emphasising the recent revelation in Italy that, in certain NATO bases on Italian soil, nuclear weapons belonging to the US are being stockpiled, unknown to residents in the vicinity.
In my view, therefore, the issue of nuclear disarmament is everyoneâs business and does not merely concern the two countries now under discussion.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Next May in New York, at the conference on the non-proliferation treaty, no further concessions or compromises can or should be made.
In particular, the possibility of reactionary and in many ways obscurantist regimes, such as those of Iran and North Korea, coming into possession of nuclear weapons must be prevented.
This concern is only heightened by the risk of plutonium being stolen by terrorist groups which, alas, are increasingly active.
In 1945 in Japan, the atomic bomb wiped out two cities, with consequences which even today are having an impact on the lives of millions of citizens and the surrounding environment.
In 2005, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two cities destroyed 60 years ago, are launching an international campaign for nuclear disarmament via their programme, which calls for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within 15 years.
Europe, which has every interest in promoting international security and strategic stability, must ensure its voice is heard in the international community, setting out in clear terms the way ahead towards a gradual reduction in nuclear arms deployment and a consequent progressive disarmament.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it was once said by the former NATO Secretary-General Manfred WÃ¶rner â whom we lost far too early â that once technical know-how in matters concerning such things as the manufacture of atom bombs was in the world, there would never be any getting rid of it.
This analysis may be very pessimistic, but it would appear to be accurate, and, as we draw near to this yearâs review conference, one begins to feel that things are at bursting point.
A cursory look at the map reveals that, in one region, and linked to one another by land, Pakistan, India and China are in possession of nuclear weapons, and soon Korea and Iran will be too.
There are land links between all these countries and their interests collide with one another, with all the resultant potential for blockades and dangerous situations.
In a region such as that, can countries such as Indonesia or the Philippines, in the long term, refrain from doing likewise?
If Korea and Iran get their way, then it seems to me quite clear that there will be no stopping them, and that leads me to conclude that we have to endorse the line that has been advanced here with regard to Iran.
We should give the three foreign ministers and the European Union a chance.
I am glad that the United States has come round to this strategy of achieving something by way of negotiation.
In this instance, because of the way things are developing and because there are evidently already underground facilities that cannot be shifted by these means, pre-emptive strikes would probably do more harm than good.
Others may know more about this than I do, but I do believe that we have to be aware of the consequences resulting from geography and the structure of these countries.
Iran cannot blackmail us â that, I believe, is important â but, on the other hand, we should â as the President-in-Office of the Council has said â do everything possible to get it to defer any further developments until such time as negotiations have produced other possibilities.
It has to be clear â to this House as much as to anyone else â that improved relations with Iran will be possible only if solutions are found to the nuclear issue and to the issues of human rights.
So, for example, there should be no chance of this House ratifying a cooperation agreement with Iran â assuming there were even to be negotiations concerning such a thing, which, reasonably enough, there are not under the present Luxembourg Presidency â unless Iran were to take a more reasonable line.
I might add that it is quite plain that this has to include such things as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA, and the UN.
The same applies, and in the same way, to North Korea, for I too believe that it is necessary to make clear our willingness to help that country in which people are suffering such enormities, our willingness to improve their situation, and that this might well cost us more than we were formerly prepared to spend.
We should, of course, also consider â and I expect Mr Ford will come back to this later on â whether the European Union should not take part in the current six-party talks, seeing as we are already involved in funding.
I think thought should be given to what shape our political involvement might take.
In any case, I do believe that countering these countriesâ nuclear capacities is of crucial importance in the overall framework and in terms of anti-terrorism, for it also enables us to forestall mini-nukes and dirty bombs, among other things.
We have to discern the connection here, for it is with these capabilities that we are dealing here, and not just with traditional nuclear strike capability.
For that reason, we cannot take this task too seriously.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, this debate is proof that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is all bark and no bite.
We can make use of this Treaty to threaten people and bark at them, but there is no question of us being able to bite anyone who fails to comply with it.
Any important developments there have been have occurred outside the framework of the Treaty, or even in spite of it.
India and Pakistan have acquired nuclear weapons and the secret blueprints for such weapons have been stolen from Pakistan, yet sanctions have not been imposed on either of these countries.
Libya has abandoned its nuclear programme, yet the Treaty played no part in this.
Iran and North Korea are not only building atomic bombs, they are now also developing means of delivering them, and there appears to be no chance of putting an effective stop to these programmes.
Countries like these are engaging in negotiations under false pretences, in order to gain time and develop their nuclear programmes.
What action should therefore be taken?
Unless new and stricter control mechanisms are put in place, there is absolutely no point in continuing to talk in twentieth century terms, as though the countries that have the capacity to build nuclear weapons were still parties to the Treaty.
There can be little hope of enforcing the Treaty without effective controls, and the requirement to abandon nuclear weapons must form part of the overall policy adopted towards a given country.
On its own, the Treaty will get us nowhere.
My final point relates to something that should be stated quite plainly. Unless we cooperate with the United States and engage in serious dialogue with our American partners, adopting a policy of coercion will be equally futile, whether in the case of Korea or Iran.
This is because such countries are expert at playing the âgood cop, bad copâ game, whereby they hold talks with one party and are afraid of the other.
There is little chance of the party they hold talks with, and of whom they are not afraid, being able to persuade them to make any real changes.
I thank you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, after the end of the cold war, the problem of nuclear proliferation seemed to have receded, but today it is once again reverting to centre stage.
The North Korean Governmentâs declaration that it possesses nuclear weapons has rightly aroused great concern for a region with the worldâs greatest nuclear concentration.
At the same time, a nuclear Iran would destabilise the Middle East, creating huge security problems in Europeâs own backyard.
The European security strategy is right to consider the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the second most serious global threat after international terrorism.
Moreover, everyone knows that where rogue or bankrupt states are involved, or where monitoring is inadequate, the two problems are closely connected.
We cannot face this challenge alone.
International coordination is needed to combat nuclear arms proliferation, and to increase police control and legal methods for monitoring, based on Dr ElBaradeiâs seven steps, among which I would mention the five-year moratorium on new facilities, the unequivocal commitment to disarm by the five officially-recognised nuclear states, and the objective of making the Middle East a nuclear-free zone.
The relationship between the European Union and the United States is crucial for the effective combating of nuclear proliferation.
Europe and the United States are complementary.
In the immediate future, the joint transatlantic goal must be to halt Iranian activity and ensure the success of the annual NPT review conference.
Â Â  Mr President, on Sunday, Iran admitted that it had achieved proficiency in the full range of activities for enriching uranium.
Several top Iranian nuclear negotiators had previously admitted that the clerical regime was not at such a point in October 2003 when a nuclear agreement was signed with Europeâs big three.
The loophole-laden agreement has left lots of wiggle room for Tehran, effectively providing perfect diplomatic cover for the mullahs to gain the most precious thing they needed to advance their weapons programme: time.
When it comes to ideologically-driven regimes, the bitter truth is that appeasement is an exercise in futility.
We should be thankful to the National Council of Resistance of Iran for blowing the cover off Iranâs clandestine nuclear programme.
Were it not for them, Iran would have acquired the A-bomb by now.
In this light, serious consideration must be given to the notion that Iranâs nuclear threat and its sponsorship of terror can only be halted through the toppling of this regime by Iranians and democratic opposition groups such as the National Council of Resistance of Iran.
Â Â  Mr President, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, associated therewith, the prevention of their getting into the hands of terrorist groups, is without a doubt one of the main concerns of the international community of states.
For this reason, we need to give special attention to what is going on in North Korea and in Iran, and I welcome the line taken by this House and my own group on the need to make it plain to Iran that negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement cannot be concluded until such time as there is conclusive evidence that its nuclear programme is peaceful.
It was on this point that the IAEA talks in Vienna made no satisfactory progress.
It is also clear that we have to express our concern at the supply by Russia of nuclear fuel rods to Iran.
That the situation in North Korea is equally disturbing, as a danger to the region as a whole, is something of which I have become aware in my capacity as chairman of the joint delegation to both Koreas.
I therefore call on the EU, represented in this instance by the Commission and the Council, to do everything possible to facilitate the resumption of the six-party talks, a process that is still open despite North Koreaâs most recent statement.
We call on North Korea to come back to the negotiating table.
All diplomatic channels must be used to this end.
Although the European Union is not party to the six-party talks â something that may well change â it is in our interests that the crisis should de-escalate and that nuclear weapons should not become more widespread.
Evidence of this is our humanitarian aid and agricultural aid programme for North Korea.
The World Food Organisation has drawn attention to the desperate state of the people as they attempt to get food.
In humanitarian terms too, it should be in North Koreaâs interests to concentrate its resources on improving the supply of food to its people, rather than on disproportionate rearmament, not to mention on becoming a nuclear threat.
Â Â  Mr President, that the non-proliferation policy is in crisis is not a matter of doubt, and of disarmament policy scarcely anything is now to be heard.
The review conference in May offers an opportunity to achieve a breakthrough, one that will demand a constructive approach on the part of all, including the âpermanent fiveâ and hence also of China, which increasingly presents itself as the hegemonic power in its region.
China is resurgent, and only one country â North Korea â ignores it and its goal of a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
North Korea is working on warheads and rockets to carry them, it is hampering the six-party talks and destabilising the entire region.
The reason for this is that North Korea is a dictatorship desperately hanging on to power.
This is a threat to our democratic friends in the region, to South Korea and Taiwan, particularly also to Japan and the USA, which together guarantee these countriesâ security.
The efforts on our part that they deserve must have three objectives: we must strengthen the non-proliferation treaty; the European Union must take part in the six-party talks; the arms embargo on China must remain in place; and we must promote democracy throughout the world.
I also take the view that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, I was in agreement with what the previous speaker said â until he got to his last sentence.
If, after discussions, it is agreed that our plenary sittings are held in Strasbourg, then that is where they are held, and I love this city; it is a beautiful place.
One day, perhaps, we will come to an agreement with the French Government enabling us to have all our plenary sittings in Brussels, but as long as the treaty stands as it is, the present situation is not up for discussion.
We should spell it out to the North Koreans that their activities are a menace to the whole security setting in the Far East.
South Korea feels itself under threat, and so do Japan and Taiwan, and it is this whole regional security aspect that I think we have to focus on.
We must make the attempt to persuade our Chinese friends to use their influence.
They may well constantly maintain that they have none, but I believe that to be a diplomatic ploy.
Quite apart from any talk about stopping building programmes, the reality is that the only country that can get the North Korean Government to return to the six-party talks is the Peopleâs Republic of China, with the Chinese Communist Party.
We have to make it plain to the Chinese that it is in their own interests that the security setting in the Far East should not be disrupted.
We also have to bring it home to China that, although we do accept its role in Asia, we do so only if it discharges its responsibilities in a constructive way.
Let us then try to get our Chinese friends to make a to North Korea.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism, organised crime and the unpredictable behaviour of a few states mean that the risk of a nuclear conflict is still considerable.
The control capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency should therefore be stepped up as a matter of urgency.
The European Union should have the courage to take political and economic action against countries which flout the rules and which try to circumvent inspections.
Particularly during the forthcoming Review Conference, it should muster the necessary ambition and commit itself to the Treatyâs complete implementation.
I also hope that by means of dialogue and consultation, the EU can play an important role in convincing North Korea to return to the negotiating table.
The US, Russia and France have started developing a new generation of nuclear weapons.
True commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament, however, means that everyone, and thus not only the so-called rogue states, curtail research into, and the development of, weapons of mass destruction.
If not, all declarations in this respect will remain hollow rhetoric.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
While we are debating problems relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the Non-Proliferation Treaty, I think it would not be out of place to alert this House to the existence of new military technologies that render the situation even more complex.
It is already possible to manufacture what are known as suitcase bombs.
These bombs are light and easily transportable, and could therefore easily fall into the wrong hands, for example those of terrorist groups.
Very low-intensity bombs are a further example of a new military technology, and their existence completely blurs the clear distinction previously made between traditional weapons and nuclear weapons.
The emergence of such weapons, the purpose of which would appear to be to allow attacks on heavily defended and fortified locations, could result in their use in countries that are not signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
This would then trigger, or rather it might and should trigger, corresponding reactions from the international community, as every country that has signed the Treaty has the assurance of other countries that nuclear weapons will not be used on its territory.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, the only thing I actually want to say about North Korea is that I think China is the only country that stands any chance of persuading it to change direction, for China has consigned to the past its own form of Communism, at least in the economic sphere, by becoming able to create prosperity.
The primitive communism to which North Korea is still politically and economically subject can be overcome only by Chinese pressure or persuasion to that end.
Moving on to Iran, on which I was rapporteur in the previous legislative period, I would like to make it clear that we certainly do have a combination of interests that we can reduce to a common denominator.
While Iran aspires to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union, we, who are the European Union, want to see Iran acting within the parameters set by the International Atomic Energy Agency and complying with its requirements.
Regarding as I do the peaceful use of atomic energy as a good thing, I am not fundamentally opposed to a country using it, provided that it is ensured that the highest possible safety standards are in force and that the cycle facilitating the enrichment of uranium and the manufacture of weapons is subject to international control, which, in Iranâs case, means that it is not operational.
If we can actually manage to get it across to Iran that there is a package formed by a partnership and cooperation agreement on the one hand and compliance with the international communityâs requirements in respect of the peaceful use of nuclear energy on the other, and that this package is indivisible, then we can get a result.
There is something else that I regard as important: in balancing interests against each other, the issue of human rights must not be disregarded.
We cannot sacrifice human rights for the sake of an agreement, even if Iranâs is compliance with nuclear requirements.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to talk about one or two aspects with respect to North Korea.
This is a country that over the last 12 to 18 months has engaged in massive and irreversible steps on the road to economic reform, in particular in industry and agriculture.
However, the nuclear crisis is still hanging over us.
Over the last five years, the European Union has put half a billion euros into North Korea in humanitarian and development aid, yet we have not been included in the six-party talks.
Several weeks ago, the North Korean Ambassador to Berlin spoke to Parliament's new delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula and indicated that North Korea would welcome our participation, as would the Chinese and the South Koreans.
In our joint resolution we are asking the Commission and the Council to investigate the possibility of the European Union being part of that programme.
That may help to break the logjam we are facing there.
The European Parliament would not like a situation in which it has no say in the onward negotiations but, like last time round with the framework agreement, is left with the bill!
My second point is not on the plutonium programme â North Korea has stated that it now has nuclear weapons â but on one of the causes of the crisis, which was the claim by the United States that North Korea had a highly enriched uranium programme.
It looks as though North Korea got the blueprints from Pakistan, but the Americans have produced no evidence that it has an ongoing programme.
Neither has it the necessary materials to produce the gas centrifuges, or the quality or quantity of electricity â which would have to be enough to power a medium-sized city in Europe â to undertake that programme.
My last point concerns the Korean Energy Development Organisation.
The Council has chosen not to pay the EUR 4 million to South Korea as suspension costs for that programme, which therefore threatens its future.
I know some in this House would not like to see it refined into a nuclear programme, but it could well serve as a very useful channel for non-nuclear conventional or renewable energies.
We ask the Council to look again at whether this small contribution, which would buy a couple of flats in London, should not be made to enable us to have that political impact.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is no doubt that a world without nuclear weapons is an ideal vision that some people have demanded but all of us sympathise with.
Unfortunately, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction.
As MrÂ Wiersma and MrÂ Brok commented, there is a danger that we are entering a new era of nuclear arms proliferation â a fresh nuclear arms race in very sensitive regions where the ultimate consequence of proliferation could be actual use.
This makes it all the more important now to ensure that the European Union and all its partners should bring the necessary pressure to bear on those who believe that nuclear weapons give them greater power.
We need to give a clear signal both to North Korea and Iran that developing nuclear weapons will not pay, and that the international community will not tolerate such a development.
I agree with those who say that in the case of Iran we need to pursue the negotiations already in progress vigorously, in order to convince the Iranians that there is an alternative to developing nuclear arms, and that the prospect of a partnership with Europe and of an economic cooperation agreement is more valuable than any development of nuclear weapons, both in terms of Iranâs security and of its economic development.
I also agree that human rights should not be ignored in those negotiations, and that respect for those rights is essential.
North Korea is of course even more complicated, as that country has to some extent already been ostracised by the international community.
Yet taking sanctions against this country, whose population is already suffering enormous deprivation, would not achieve very much.
The European Union should not just limit itself to providing humanitarian aid here; we should also play a more significant political role.
I totally agree with those who have said, as Mr Ford has just done, that it would also be wrong for the European Union to act as a provider of funds without a political role.
Our relations with China which, as MrÂ Jarzembowski said, are important, will certainly help us to bring pressure to bear on North Korea.
China is perhaps the only country to have any real leverage over the North Korean regime.
In any case, it is crucial that the discussions concerning the Non-Proliferation Treaty should not essentially end in failure, in a kind of half-hearted status quo.
The NPT is even more important now than it was in the past.
There are now other, even more appalling risks, with proliferation to all sorts of non-State entities and terrorists.
I believe that this is another area where the European Union must be very vigilant.
The European Union must, therefore, speak loud and clear at the NPT conference, and act, both in its negotiations with Iran and in the discussions with Korea, to which we must be a party, to make our voice heard.
A world without nuclear arms may not yet be within our grasp, but we should at least halt their dangerous proliferation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, all the speeches we have heard obviously point in the same direction, without exception, and they of course support the Commissionâs position and beliefs.
They are also an indication of the importance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and, above all, the need to maintain it and even to reinforce it.
The Commission supports and will continue to support these efforts to encourage both disarmament, particularly in Russia, and non-proliferation.
We are at present working with the Council to secure the necessary funding to implement the Unionâs policies in the areas of non-proliferation and disarmament.
As an indication of the Commissionâs commitment in this respect, I would like to refer to an agreement recently concluded during the Cotonou review, which now incorporates, as a vital element, a non-proliferation clause, intended to strengthen multilateral agreements and export controls.
Â Â  I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next items are the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Lebanon.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Council is following the grave political crisis in Lebanon closely and with great concern.
This crisis, which was triggered by the three-year extension of President Lahoudâs term of office imposed by Syria, culminated in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and ten other innocent civilians.
The European Union has firmly condemned this barbaric act and this House debated it at length just a few days ago.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was a man of peace who believed in dialogue, and was a friend of Europe.
The challenge that Lebanon is facing needs to be met with unity and calm, and respect for the two principles for which MrÂ Hariri fought throughout his life: Lebanonâs independence and sovereignty.
The resignation of the Karami government in the face of popular pressure has created a new situation of which we need to take advantage.
The Presidency wishes to congratulate the Lebanese people on their courage and determination to regain full sovereignty and to live in freedom in a democratic country.
The Council bodies held an initial exchange of views on the Lebanese crisis on 4Â March, and revisited this issue this morning in the presence of MrÂ Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy responsible for the implementation of ResolutionÂ 1559.
For his part, the High Representative, JavierÂ Solana, will tomorrow be meeting a delegation of representatives of the Lebanese opposition.
The main thrust of the European Unionâs action should be as follows.
First of all, we need to support the formation of a new transitional government acceptable to the key players in Lebanese politics and respecting Lebanonâs constitutional framework.
Secondly, if political life in Lebanon is to return to normal, the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Rafik Hariri and those responsible for it need to be carefully scrutinised.
The Union therefore supports the United Nations commission of inquiry and intends to keep up pressure on the Lebanese authorities to carry out a thorough investigation.
Furthermore, it is important to support the holding of free and fair elections.
The European Union will be willing to provide assistance in this respect, in particular by sending a team of election observers if the new Lebanese Government so wishes.
For its part, the Commission is about to carry out an exercise on the ground to assess the need and scope for electoral assistance.
The Commission will be able to give fuller details of this in its own presentation.
Lastly, we have to keep up pressure on all concerned to achieve full and immediate implementation of Resolution 1559, which calls for complete and immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
The Council assures the European Parliament that it will spare no effort to achieve a political solution to the Lebanese question, in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the Lebanese people.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak to you about the situation in Lebanon on behalf of my colleague MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner responsible for External Relations and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
We were shocked and saddened by the appalling terrorist attack perpetrated in Beirut on 14Â February, which took the lives of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and of many other victims, while over a hundred people were seriously injured.
It was the most devastating attack in Lebanon since the 1975-1990 civil war.
MrÂ Hariri was one of the main architects of the 1989 Taif Agreement, which marked the end of the civil war in Lebanon.
He was responsible for promoting the rebuilding of his country after it had been torn apart by war, and his name became synonymous with peace and reconciliation based on a delicate balance between the 18 religious communities that make up the country.
We worked closely with MrÂ Hariri and his government.
Negotiations on an association agreement were concluded during his term of office, and an interim trade agreement came into force in March 2003.
MrÂ Hariri also fully supported the dialogue on the European Neighbourhood Policy, which also covered Lebanon.
Over the last few weeks, following the death of MrÂ Hariri, thousands of demonstrators have protested against Syriaâs military presence in their country, in defiance of a government ban.
In the face of the unrelenting pressure following the assassination of MrÂ Hariri, the Lebanese Prime Minister OmarÂ Karami and his government resigned on 28Â February after an extraordinary parliamentary debate on the political situation following MrÂ Haririâs death.
The forthcoming weeks will clearly be decisive for the country and it is vital that the parliamentary elections in Lebanon should be held on schedule in May.
The Commission hopes that calm will prevail during this period and that channels of communication between the various political groups will be kept open.
The elections must be held in accordance with a free and fair electoral process, without any foreign interference or influence, and under the sovereign control of the Lebanese authorities.
These elections could mark a turning point in the return of Lebanon to full independence and sovereignty.
Along with its other partners, the European Union must remain vigilant as regards the conditions under which these elections are held and we should make our position known to the Lebanese.
The Commission is considering how it can help to ensure that these elections are held in appropriate conditions.
We are examining the possibility of sending an election observation team.
We also envisage, should it be necessary, other means of providing support to guarantee an open and free electoral process.
We have in mind, in particular, the training of local observers.
At present, we are making preparations for an exploratory technical mission to Lebanon.
We wish to evaluate what we can do to ensure that the elections are held in optimal conditions, and we do not rule out the possibility of sending EU observers if the Lebanese Government invites us to do so.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union attaches the greatest importance to the full implementation by all parties concerned of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, whose objectives we firmly support: free and fair elections without foreign interference, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the control of the government over all Lebanese territory.
Some of these demands have been conveyed to Lebanon over the years in key European Union messages.
The European Union fully supports the work of the UN Secretary-General.
We await with interest his report, due at the beginning of April, on the progress made in achieving the objectives of Resolution 1559.
At the same time, the Commission is in the process of forging ever closer links with Lebanon under the European Neighbourhood Policy.
On 2Â March the Commission presented a report on Lebanon giving a wide-ranging overall view of the political, economic and institutional situation, and also of the state of EU-Lebanon relations.
This report will provide a basis for work on the action plan for partnership with the neighbouring countries, which will include important priorities such as a closer political dialogue and greater cooperation in a variety of areas.
In Lebanon and in other partner countries, the progress made under the European Neighbourhood Policy will reflect their own efforts and their own successes, with the active support of the Union, of course.
In order to take account of recent political developments in Lebanon, the Commission has recommended that the timetable for the next stage of our work and consultation with the Lebanese authorities on the action plan should be linked to developments in that countryâs situation.
It goes without saying that we need to know how the situation is evolving before we move forward.
At the same time, we are pursuing our discussions with Parliament and the Council on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, which, with effect from 2007, will enable us to match our political ambitions with the necessary financial resources.
We hope to have a result before the end of this year, which will allow us to start the planning process for 2007.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will continue to support the efforts being made towards reform and democracy in Lebanon by means of the association agreement and under the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I hope that this House will be our firmest ally in supporting those efforts.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Louis Michel have sufficiently described the devastating effects of the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri.
It is clear that one of the most obvious conclusions must be the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, which must be immediate and must also include the secret services.
There can be no excuse for failing to comply with the terms of United Nations Resolution 1559 and Syria must refrain from interfering in Lebanonâs internal affairs.
As Mr Michel has said, it is clear that free elections must be held in Lebanon without any type of pressure, and we in our political group are pleased with the Commissionerâs comments to the effect that a technical mission is going to be sent to Lebanon with a view to preparing a European Union mission of electoral observers.
We also believe that it is absolutely essential that there be a committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder of the former Prime Minister in an independent manner.
Mr President, this morning all the political groups have negotiated a compromise resolution on this extremely important issue of Lebanon and a satisfactory solution must be found for the inclusion of Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations, since we believe that the actions of this organisation have been proven beyond all doubt and, Mr President, the terms of the compromise resolution will have to be adjusted in order to accommodate a decision which is in line with the concerns expressed within our political group.
I would like to end by saying that the European Union â as the President-in-Office of the Council and the representative of the Commission have said â must advocate the existence of a democratic, independent and sovereign Lebanon, and the instruments available to us by means of the neighbourhood policy and the association agreement offer us a good picture of the form this relationship may take.
I would insist: an independent, democratic and sovereign Lebanon.
Â Â  .â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, my group stands unreservedly shoulder to shoulder with the demonstrators of Martyrsâ Square in Beirut, who are peacefully demanding a future of freedom and democracy for their country and who have already brought about the resignation of the pro-Syrian government.
The Syrian military occupation can no longer be tolerated and the time has come for the positive but vague declarations made by the President of the Syrian Republic in recent days to give way to firm action with a clear and immediate timetable.
We repeat our strong condemnation of the attack which caused the death of ex-President Hariri and the loss of so many lives, and we support the determination of the United Nations Secretary-General to see a full investigation of this episode.
The future of Lebanon can only be the result of a democratic process, based on respect for human rights, with a first step being a decision to forge ahead with parliamentary elections in May.
Those elections must be free, democratic and transparent, which is why we are asking for them to be prepared and monitored by a team of European observers in which, as in the case of Palestine, the role of this Parliament should be a prominent one.
All parts of Lebanonâs complex society must feel they are involved in this process and in the protection of their countryâs unity and territorial integrity.
With regard to Syria, it is a vital country in the Middle East as a whole, a country which can and must opt unreservedly for democracy, for the fight against terrorism and for a constructive role in the solution of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
For a long time, Europe has had a policy of friendship towards Damascus, and I hope that the decisions taken today by its leadership will help to consolidate this relationship and render it irreversible.
The countries of the Middle East as a whole have a responsibility to support the efforts of the President of the Palestinian Authority to reach a just peace with Israel and to collaborate in the development of a Palestinian state.
For this purpose, there must be an end to all support for terrorism and terrorist organisations, both inside their respective states and in the Palestinian territories.
Finally, we should not forget the Israeli-Syrian dimension of this conflict.
Here, we hope for a re-establishment of relations, leading to a peace agreement and to the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Golan Heights.
For too long, the violence of terrorism and of armies of occupation has prevailed in the Middle East, and it is time for a return to the rule of law.
Only respect for law in international relations and for democracy in internal affairs can guarantee peace, stability and prosperity across the Middle East as a whole.
In this context, the European Union must redouble its efforts, enhance the effectiveness of its political role and increase and re-focus the economic resources deployed to achieve these aims.
Â Â  MrÂ President, since our debate two weeks ago, there have been constant changes in the situation in Lebanon in reaction to the pressure â as everyone knows and has commented â brought to bear by a people who are almost entirely united, regardless of their origin or religion, and who are continuing to demand their freedom to live and their freedom of thought.
After the resignation of the Karami government and the joint declarations by Presidents al-Assad and Lahoud on the withdrawal of Syrian troops, there were still tens of thousands of people demonstrating yesterday in Martyrs Square â now rechristened Freedom Square â to express their will and to keep up the full weight of pressure on political figures necessary if a genuine democratic process is to be set in train.
I said that this people was almost entirely united. I used the word âalmostâ because one note of discord was struck by the leader of Hezbollah, HassanÂ Nasrallah, in his speech calling on his followers to demonstrate today, at this very moment, against the UN resolution, and to protest shamelessly against foreign interference and, I quote, âto continue resistance against Israelâ.
I found this latter part of his speech particularly disturbing because it expressed a desire, which I hope is a minority view, to oppose the very fragile resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
Some of us here will be going to Cairo on Friday to take part in the plenary session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
We are aware of the absolute need on that occasion to bolster the position of the Palestinian leader MahmoudÂ Abbas in his courageous desire to reject violence and, as a first step, to establish, in conjunction with Israel, a lasting ceasefire.
If it became apparent that Hezbollah were firmly resolved to oppose this process, it would then be for you, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, to take appropriate action and to go so far â and why not â as to include this movement in the list of terrorist organisations.
I hope that the Council will not need to go that far, as I would like to continue to believe that the enormous desire for peace will win the day.
Â Â  My group will be happy to sign and vote for the resolution drafted this morning, which sets out a number of views that are extremely important for the European Parliament.
You have also expounded and supported those views yourselves, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Michel.
We welcome and encourage the popular demonstrations now being held in Beirut and those that recently took place in Kiev, and believe there are lessons to be learnt from them. We believe they provide the strongest guarantees for the process of democratisation, as long as the people involved know and feel that they can count on international support.
That is a lesson we must remember and from which we must draw conclusions for the future.
We, too, like those demonstrators and like the united people of Lebanon, are waiting for clear answers to emerge from the inquiries being held â both the fact-finding mission dispatched by Kofi Annan and the investigations being undertaken by the Lebanese authorities â to identify precisely who was responsible for this appalling act.
We have also heard the statements made by the Lebanese and Syrian Presidents, and we look forward to further statements.
In fact, given that provision is made for this in the Taif Agreement, why should the security services be excluded from the withdrawal plan?
The Syrian security services in Lebanon should also be withdrawn.
It has to be said now that pursuing this process of democratisation is the best means we have of ensuring stabilisation, and we have already heard just how crucial that stabilisation is for the region.
We expect a great deal from the democratisation process, and the Commission should not, in the report it is preparing on all aspects of the situation in Lebanon and on EU-Lebanon relations, overlook certain key issues that are fundamental for the future of democracy. These include the return of the death penalty; the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared in Lebanon; Lebanonâs adoption of the Rome Statute on which the International Criminal Court is founded; its adoption of the GenevaConventionRelating to the Status of Refugees; a solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees; and also certain individual cases of great concern to this House, such as that of the lawyer MrÂ Mughrabi, who is in prison today as a result of statements he actually made in this Chamber to Members of the European Parliament.
There are therefore a lot of hopes riding on this situation, hopes that I am sure this resolution will encourage.
Â Â  . â The position held by Parliament and the EU with regard to events in Lebanon should strike a balance between clarity and responsibility.
Clarity in expressing the urgent need for an independent international inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the assassination of the former prime minister, its causes and effects; in expressing the solidarity that must be shown towards the democratic, peaceful and pan-community movement demanding full sovereignty for Lebanon and democratic elections; and in expressing the demand that Syrian troops and intelligence officers withdraw, under the Taif agreements and the United Nations Security Council Resolution.
Clarity is essential, then, but clarity must be accompanied by responsibility, given the extraordinarily fragile nature of the mosaic of Lebanese society.
It is this responsibility that has led my group to request a separate vote on paragraphs 6 and 7 of the compromise resolution.
Firstly there is the Syria question.
The withdrawal to the Bekaa Valley, as laid down in the Taif agreements, is, by objective standards, a laudable step and the demand for an end to any foreign interference cannot only be aimed at one country.
Israel still occupies Lebanese land and France and the United States are hardly innocent bystanders.
This is particularly true of the latter, which gave tacit approval to the Syrian presence in Lebanon for years and years, and yet now, with the strongest military presence in the region, approaches Syria with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop.
This is another disaster in waiting for peace and stability.
Secondly, there is the issue of Hezbollah.
There is no organisation that I could feel further removed from, but demonising the so-called âParty of Godâ and classifying it as being wholly dependent on Syria is neither wise nor true.
Hezbollah cannot be fought by placing it on terrorism lists, but by committing its political wing to the democratic process, by tackling the brutal inequalities in Lebanon and by achieving a fair resolution of the conflicts arising from Israelâs occupation of land.
Let Europe provide an alternative to the policies of blindness and force in the region.
Â Â  . Mr President, that Syria is playing a game in Lebanon with the international community is evident from both President Assadâs parliamentary speech last Saturday and his agreements yesterday with his Lebanese counterpart, Mr Lahud.
The Security Councilâs Resolution 1559 is not yet applicable to Damascus.
It clearly demands the total and immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory.
Ominously, at the end of last week, the Syrian Head of State did not breathe a word about the influential presence, within Lebanese territory, of his secret services, which would appear not to form part of the Syrian troop movements there.
This is consistent with the recent Israeli observation that Syria is currently preoccupied with strengthening its secret presence in the land of the cedar, something of which the UN Secretary-General was officially informed yesterday by the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs.
There is yet another way in which Damascus is brazenly flouting resolution 1559.
The resolution stipulates the disbanding of all militias in Lebanon.
This would involve the dismantling of the Shiite terror movement Hezbollah, pawn of both Syria and Iran against the Jewish state, as well as the forced departure of dozens of officers of the Iranian revolutionary guard, who train Hezbollah and Palestinian terror groups within Lebanonâs borders.
Given the seriousness of the situation in Lebanon, I hope that the Council and the Commission will deliberately obstruct those forces in Syria, Lebanon and Iran that do not want to know of a fully-fledged Lebanese state sovereignty, or like any political settlement between Israel and its closest Arab neighbours.
Damascus, Teheran and their Lebanese satellites should stop their sinister game once and for all.
It is up to the Council and the Commission to do something practical to bring this about.
They would, for example, do well to start by placing Hezbollah on the European list of terror organisations.
Â Â  . Mr President, once again the eyes of the world are on the Middle East.
Elections have been held in Iraq, but there is ongoing disorder and widespread killings are taking place.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have met and this can be seen as a first step on the long road to peace and reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
Now the focus is on Lebanon and Syria.
The catalyst for this political uncertainty was undoubtedly the killing of the Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
The Lebanese Government has since resigned.
We all know of the tragic civil war that engulfed Lebanon between 1975 and 1990.
We all know that the Taif Accord, designed to bring about peace in that region, is in place.
However, the bottom line is that there are still 15Â 000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
While I recognise that this is substantially less than the 40Â 000 that were there until the late 1990s, the Lebanese people clearly want the Syrian troops out of their country.
That is why I welcome the recent statement by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He signalled that Syrian troops would withdraw from Lebanon.
The sooner that is done the better.
President Bashar al-Assad specifically recognised that Syria would not stay in Lebanon once the Lebanese people did not want them there.
We all know what the answer to that is, so the Syrian troops must be swiftly withdrawn.
I concur with the previous speakerâs comments about groups already beginning to work inside Lebanon to destabilise the country yet again.
In the broader political field, the European Union and Syria have yet to agree on a new EU-Syria economic association agreement.
I believe that securing agreement for such a new arrangement would help to improve relations between the European Union and the Syrian people.
The implementation of such a treaty is long overdue.
I urge the Council presidency to work towards finalising this arrangement as quickly as possible.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Lebanon has become destabilised because Syrian troops have been present in the country for 29Â years.
There are 14Â 000Â Syrian soldiers stationed there, which is 14Â 000 too many.
Yesterdayâs decision by the Lebanese and Syrian presidents to withdraw some of Syriaâs troops from Lebanon is a step in the right direction, but only a small one.
It is not only regular military units that are stationed in the country, but also the Syrian special services.
To put it quite bluntly, the latter exert an influence on the internal situation in the country.
The fact that paramilitary, or, more accurately, terrorist organisations are stationed in Lebanon is a further problem the country faces.
I am astonished that the Parliament resolution no longer refers to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah organisation as a terrorist organisation, as it did in its original version.
I find this entirely incomprehensible.
We should call a spade a spade, and call terrorists terrorists.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my outrage at and condemnation of the appalling attack that took the life of Rafik Hariri and 14 other innocent civilians.
I wish to offer my sincere condolences to the families of MrÂ Hariri and of the other victims of this horrifying attack.
I also wish, in accordance with the declaration of the United Nations Security Council of 15Â February, for the truth about the causes and circumstances of this attack to be established, so that its perpetrators can be swiftly brought to justice.
This was an attack on all the peoples of Lebanon, regardless of their faith or political hue, and was carried out to create a climate of fear in the population.
We should not play into the hands of those who seek to destabilise Lebanon.
This event is a reminder of just how important it is to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which reaffirms the international communityâs commitment to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, which implies total and immediate withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon.
The international community must remain active and vigilant, so as to ensure that the forthcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for the spring are held in democratic and transparent conditions.
These elections will give an indication of the commitment â or lack of it â of the parties concerned to respond to the demands of the international community.
The Council should perhaps take the initiative of organising a peace conference on Lebanon, with a view to taking advantage of the climate currently prevailing in the Middle East, which favours the settlement of long-standing conflicts.
The European Union has a duty to participate in the peace process for the region and to advance the democratic cause, âwithout complacency or arroganceâ, as Michel Barnier, Franceâs Minister for Foreign Affairs, put it.
We must not disappoint the hopes of millions of men and women.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wonder if Lebanon will join in the âorange revolutionâ marked by peopleâs reawakening to democracy?
We certainly hope so, but Lebanon has little in common with Ukraine or Georgia.
It will be neither easy nor perhaps totally desirable to break the links with Syria enshrined in the Taif Agreement, but those links need to be clarified and stabilised, and both popular and international pressure will be needed to achieve that.
What is clear right now is that the murderers of Rafik Hariri and of the 14 Lebanese citizens who died in the attack are still at large.
Syria must be able to withdraw from Lebanon without losing face, but the redeployment of its troops cannot be limited to the Bekaa plain if the timetable for permanent withdrawal has still not been established.
The organisation of the forthcoming parliamentary elections has now become a test of Lebanonâs desire for change.
Hezbollah is also a major pawn in Syriaâs policy and is undermining the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, as MrÂ Morillon pointed out.
However, that will also be the case until Israel withdraws its troops from the Golan Heights, as demanded by the United Nations in its various resolutions.
Ultimately, the opposition, by uniting and expressing a desire to proceed step by step, has demonstrated an astonishing maturity and has shown that it is effectively in control of the pre-revolutionary situation that has arisen.
While we can support this movement, we cannot rush it.
The European Parliament therefore needs to pay particular attention to keeping up pressure on Syria to respect its international commitments.
Each of the parties involved â Lebanon, the European Union and Syria â is aware just how close this game is.
The shadow of war is still hanging over Beirut, but, at the same time, Lebanonâs opposition has never seemed so united.
We do not know this opposition well enough, MrÂ President, and I would suggest that we take advantage of the next few weeks to strengthen our links with it.
I would not like to conclude without offering my condolences and expressing my feelings of sympathy and friendship to MrsÂ Hariri, who I am sure will also be a protagonist in Lebanonâs future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are virtually unanimous at the moment.
When it comes to the vote, we shall see.
Certain members are recommending a little more gentle education for the Hezbollah delinquents, but the fact is that we are about to vote on a resolution which coincides with the appeal of the 140 Syrian intellectuals to President Assad, and with that made by a further 33 intellectuals on 25Â February to their Lebanese counterparts.
We are virtually all agreed on that.
However, unlike many of you, I see this unanimity as a source of concern, because it is normal in such serious situations for any agreement reached to be based on information which is too generic or on a minimal level of information which is inadequate.
To conclude, I note that the European Union is continuing strategically to recommend national independence as the goal to be achieved in the Middle East for its peoples, for peace and for the interests of Europe.
Think what would have happened if the same thing had occurred in Europe after the world wars.
It seems to me that, from that point of view, we are all really on the sidelines and are giving bad advice.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I admit that it is still somewhat premature to say that a wave of democracy is flooding across the Middle East, but still, we have had successful elections in Iraq and in the Palestinian regions, local elections in Saudi Arabia, less pre-arranged presidential elections in Egypt, the high point being a Lebanese Government that is forced to step down at the request of its people.
This population is openly using the same means which the Ukrainian people in Kiev had at their disposal to make their displeasure known.
The cedar revolution was also orange.
For the first time, there is good news from that region, because it is good news that Syria is finally withdrawing its troops from Lebanon.
It would be even better if this could be done more quickly and if Hezbollah were to give up its armed protest against the State of Israel and were to invest its energy in strengthening the Lebanese democracy by peaceful means.
What Europe can do, apart from expressing its appreciation for the courage displayed by the Lebanese people, is to refrain from concluding an association agreement with Syria until such time as withdrawal is complete and its support for Hezbollah has come to an end.
Â Â  â Mr President, listening to most of the speakers, I had the impression that I was listening to Mrs Condoleeza Rice, and reading most of the resolutions, I thought that they were communications from the White House.
The truth is that Lebanon, following the war and the occupation of Iraq by the Americans, is becoming the field of application of the Greater Middle East plan announced by the United States and adopted by ÎÎÎ€Î and the European Union.
This plan reinforces the role of Israel, sets its sights on the fight of the Palestinians for a free, independent state and exerts pressure on Syria and Iran.
You do not want them to be independent.
You only want them to be independent under your control and it is in this direction that resolution 1559 has been raised again.
Why has it been raised now, I wonder, and what are you hoping for?
Do you not know that it was the outcome of an agreement in order to stop the civil war in Lebanon?
And now efforts are being made to create the preconditions so that there can be a new military intervention in the area and overall attack on the peoples.
The assassination of the former prime minister of Lebanon is operating as huge provocation with multiple objectives.
We consider that the peoples and the political forces in the area must resolve their problems and do not need protectors.
Finally, we ask you: how much hypocrisy is there?
What about the 40Â 000 occupying troops in Cyprus?
Why do you not ask about them â now, immediately, tomorrow â and why do you not lobby for them to withdraw from the island?
Why two sets of standards?
That is why we say that the European Union and the United States of America have a different objective.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has long ignored, almost to the point of forgetting them, the historical and political characteristics of Lebanon, an outlying bastion of Christianity â albeit not alone â in that unsettled region.
United Nations resolution 1559, put forward by France and the USA, demanding the withdrawal of the 14Â 000 Syrian soldiers from Lebanese territory and the restitution of sovereignty to Lebanon after over 30 years of occupation, has been fundamentally ignored since the autumn of 2004.
It took the barbaric assassination of former Prime Minister Harari to re-invigorate the yearning and desire for freedom on the part of the opposition and much of the Lebanese people, and, above all, to awaken the quiescent conscience of the European Union which had left the Lebanese people for years at the mercy of Syrian domination.
The new position of the Saudi regime has left Syria isolated within the Arab League.
It would therefore be appropriate for the European Union to adopt a dignified position and resolve to make the signing of the association agreement with Syria conditional on its total withdrawal from Lebanon.
Let us not desert the Lebanese â patriots who are proud to be Christians and part of western civilisation.
Let us not desert them, as Europe has, in the past, deserted so many nations facing up to barbarism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted that the international community is demanding the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon.
Not before time!
Syria has occupied Lebanon since 1976 and the Taif Agreement called for its troops to pull out 15 years ago.
It is a matter for regret that the proponents of this initiative are not the countries of Europe but the United States.
Franceâs governments both of the left and of the right are particularly guilty here.
By supporting the Syrian dictatorship until last year, they have betrayed the friendship that has bound our nation to Lebanon since the time of Louis IX, thus damaging Franceâs interests in this region.
We should not delude ourselves: the resignation of Karamiâs puppet government and the announcement that Syrian troops are to be redeployed represent just one stage in the process.
The complete withdrawal of Syria, that is to say of its army, of its information services and of its 500Â 000 immigrants, the disarmament of the Hezbollah Islamic militia, the holding of genuinely free elections, the return to their country of outlawed individuals such as General Aoun, the release of all political prisoners and in particular of the Christian leader SamirÂ Geagea â these are the demands of the Lebanese people and the conditions that our own governments should be demanding from Syriaâs leaders in order to re-establish Lebanon as a free and sovereign state.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all the assassination of former prime minister Hariri is an act which we must constantly denounce.
I too should like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to his family and my hope that the investigation being conducted with international support to find those responsible will be successful.
The second point I want to touch on concerns the imminent elections, following the resignation of the government in Lebanon, and to say that I was delighted to hear Commissioner Michel refer to what the European Commission intends to do so that elections are held properly.
I shall insist â as other Members have done â on the issue of the mission of observers from the European Parliament.
My third comment concerns certain preconditions to peace and democracy in Lebanon.
The first is the safeguarding and protection of the rights of minorities and the procedures to protect their peaceful coexistence.
The second is the clear and efficient combating of the activities of Hezbollah, activities which, while centred on Lebanon, also extend outside the borders of Lebanon to the entire Middle East, thereby jeopardising peace.
As for the third, the withdrawal of Syrian troops, I say yes, provided that Syria officially announces a timetable, especially following the recent statements by President Assad.
I accept the concept of a timetable, and I say that as a Greek who is very sensitive on the question of troop withdrawals, because we too have submitted a similar demand for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Cyprus, and I believe that the international community, which is today insisting to Syria that it withdraw its troops from Lebanon, should also do the same with Turkey and any other countries which have occupying forces in other countries.
Finally, given the very positive wind blowing in the Middle East, I wish to emphasise the need for the European Union to be present there, not only economically, but also politically.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we are all still reeling here from the shock of the barbaric murder of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which also took 18 lives and injured hundreds of people.
We are certainly unanimous in calling for a united response based on a combination of principles and action.
President Bashar al-Assad announced last Saturday that his troops would be withdrawn from Lebanon in two phases. This came in response to demands by France and the United States in particular, but also reflected the pressure of international opinion and that of the Lebanese people.
This represents a first step towards the military withdrawal that should have taken place years ago.
It also represents a first step by Syria towards the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559.
We should take account of this first step, but remain firm and unyielding in our demands for the future.
Our road map here is Resolution 1559 as a whole, and we must first and foremost ensure that it is implemented rapidly and in its entirety.
That means Syria totally withdrawing from Lebanon, to allow that country to regain its sovereignty and rapidly organise free and democratic elections, in response to the unanimous aspirations of the Lebanese people, whose concerted action and desire for freedom are most impressive.
The European Union must also remain highly vigilant in view of the evolving political situation in Lebanon.
Many speakers have mentioned Hezbollah, but what is also needed now is a government.
On the other hand, even if a date for the parliamentary elections has not yet been set, it would be advisable for them to be held in the presence of international observers, particularly observers from Europe.
What is more, we need to maintain pressure on the Lebanese authorities to continue to cooperate fully with the UN commission of inquiry, so as to investigate thoroughly the circumstances surrounding the attack on 15Â February. The reasons for the murder and its perpetrators have yet to be clearly identified.
It was an attack on the entire population of Lebanon, regardless of religion or political persuasion. It is out of the question that Lebanon should continue to be associated with the images of division, occupation and violence that we have now witnessed for three decades.
The European Union should give its full support to the Lebanese people so that they can regain their liberty. That is the message that this House should forcefully and unanimously convey.
Â Â  MrÂ President, one minute is very little for such a complicated issue and one with which we are largely unfamiliar.
I shall restrict myself to asking one question: why is only Syria in the dock?
Syria may of course be guilty here, but that is only a hypothesis, and I am surprised and disappointed that there is a universal view that only Syria can be considered as the culprit, whereas Syriaâs involvement is a complex issue in itself. This applies to both the media and also, unfortunately, to Europeâs political classes, which seem to have taken up the refrain, from the extreme left to the extreme right.
There are other possibilities.
There is Iran â Iran certainly has an interest in diverting attention to Syria â and there is the United States, which certainly has an interest in splitting the Middle East into numerous religious and ethnic communities.
There are others.
Why not look at them too?
Who has a vested interest in renewed conflict in Lebanon?
Not necessarily Syria, and certainly not Europe, and, with respect to MrÂ Moscovici and MrsÂ LeÂ Pen, not France, which, in any event, needs Lebanon, a Christian and multi-faith country which in some ways sets an example for the entire region.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the moment of historic hope for the Middle East.
A huge number of people are valiantly moving towards better times: Palestinians who tackle people who attack Israeli citizens, Israelis who hand back huge regions to the Palestinians as a first step towards two states, but above all, the Lebanese, who are fighting on the streets for better times without Syrian interference.
These courageous people, along with all peace-loving people in the Middle East, deserve our support.
The biggest threat to the peace process is now Hezbollah, to which organisation we in Europe adopt a naÃ¯ve and implausible attitude, drawing a distinction between the military Hezbollah and the political Hezbollah.
This distinction is not realistic, for they are both run by one and the same leader, namely MrÂ Nasrallah.
He himself admits that there is no distinction, and his second-in-command recently stated on television, and I quote : âWe believe that the political activity is integrated in the military operations, because they are inextricably linked to the political activityâ.
Then there are those people in the Lebanese Parliament, with whom some in this Chamber would like to do business, and their leader, Hussein Hay Hassan, who himself says: âHezbollah is an organisation in which all fighters are politicians and military at the same time.
The way in which some in the West view our organisation is incorrectâ.
This is coming from the people of Hezbollah themselves.
It is high time we had the courage to send a clear message to an organisation which has links with Syria and Iran, which attacks innocent citizens and speaks out in no uncertain terms against the peace process and against Syriaâs withdrawal from Lebanon.
Two weeks ago, the Councilâs representative stated: âWe are keeping an eye on Hezbollah.
If they adopt a bad attitude, we will consider extra measuresâ.
If we now see what is happening, namely protests and threatening language in Beirut which goes against the process, then I think that it is time for action.
Many fine words are spoken here about the protesters, but what these courageous people now need is not fine words, but clear action and unambiguous decisions.
The time has come to say how matters really stand.
Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation and must be placed on the European list of terror organisations.
The courageous people in the Middle East deserve us finally having the courage to speak this clear language.
Â Â  Mr President, the death â the murder â of Rafik Hariri was a tragedy not only for his family, but also for the Lebanon.
I was myself able to meet him on many occasions and came to value the greatness of his vision.
We now have to ensure that there are no more such tragic developments in Lebanon, and one thing, we have to concede, is clear: it was Syria that originally helped to establish peace and to stabilise the country, but, as happens so often in this life, failure to discern the signs of the times can mean that, instead of stability, new conflicts are sparked off and peace is in check.
That is why Syria must leave, taking its armed forces and its secret services with it.
It should also read the signs from the interior: the old guard in Syria is still in fact standing in the way of development in its own country.
Secondly, here are a few plain truths about Hezbollah.
Hezbollah also helped to drive the Israeli forces out, to restore the countryâs autonomy and to give it a stable peace.
Here, too, though, the same is true: if Hezbollah does not see the way the wind is blowing and is unwilling to help establish peace and stability, then there is no helping it, for nobody in this House will be willing to support it.
Let me repeat, then, that if Hezbollah is prepared, as a political force, to establish peace and stability in the region, then it deserves a degree of respect.
If it is not, then it will get none whatever.
The last thing I want to say in this debate is that Syria, too, is entitled to peace, stability and territorial integrity, but it must be prepared to conclude real peace with Israel, to acknowledge not only its own right to security but also Israelâs, and to help Israel to live in peace and security in the region.
If Syria does that, we will be able to support it in that, but this is a clear and unequivocal demand that we must make of it.
Â Â  Mr President, Lebanon has a recent history of civil war and a complex ethnic and religious balance.
It has never been fully recognised as independent by neighbouring Syria, which has not even bothered to open an embassy there, claiming Beirut is too near Damascus.
Instead, Syria has promoted through its pan-Arab Baâathist doctrine a âgreater Syriaâ concept.
Pressure is now mounting on Syria from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the US and Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
However, President al-Assad has only agreed to implement the terms of the Taif Accord of 1989, which obliges Syria to redeploy its 14Â 000-strong army to the eastern Bekaa Valley, because he is buying time, and he has so far ignored the more comprehensive UN Security Council Resolution 1559.
But the heat is now on, following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, with the so-called cedar revolutionaries on the streets of Beirut.
These mainly Druze and Maronite Christians are blaming the one-party Syrian dictatorship for their countryâs problems.
If the Lebanese demonstrators have their way in the May election, their victory at the polls could signal the end of 30 years of economic and political co-dependence, but it would also make al-Assadâs position a lot shakier.
Hizbollah, the international terrorist executive arm of Iran and Syria, which is based in Lebanon but increasingly working to undermine the Palestinian Authority and peace with Israel, is threatened by its Syrian protectorâs withdrawal.
Hizbollah has 12 MPs in the Lebanese Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers is therefore reluctant to ban it, claiming there is a difference between its civilian political activities and its military wing.
Hizbollah itself makes no such distinction.
France, a traditional friend of the Arab world, is leading this resistance in the Council, with Belgian, Swedish, Irish and Spanish backing.
The latter is being particularly hypocritical as the Spanish Government was quite happy to ban Herri Batasuna and eject its MPs from the Spanish Parliament.
Why, then, is Hizbollah not banned by the EU until it renounces the use of suicide bombers against innocent civilians and recognises the State of Israelâs right to exist?
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, MrÂ President, Lebanon is in the process of writing a new page in its history, and against that background we need not only to be vigilant, but also to play an active political role.
I personally once again vigorously condemn the use of violence as a political tool.
The murder of MrÂ Hariri represented an unacceptable escalation of violence.
The vital international inquiry must do everything possible to shed light on those responsible for seeking to destabilise Lebanon and creating a climate of terror.
I wish to congratulate the Lebanese people on the massive scale and fervour of their popular mobilisation, regardless of religious affiliations, in support of full sovereignty for their country.
They are looking to the European Union to support their fight and we must not let them down.
In this respect, full and rapid implementation of Resolution 1559 is of course a key priority.
Yes, we need to do everything to re-establish a strong, democratic and sovereign Lebanese state and to disarm all the armed militias.
Yes, we need to aim for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, but at the same time we cannot forget the issue of the Golan Heights and the Shebaa farms.
The situation in Lebanon must not be decoupled from the general situation in the Middle East.
An overall and just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital, and we must give our support to the new Palestinian leader.
And yes, the question of the future of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and elsewhere is crucial: the issue of their return must form part of a global settlement.
Furthermore, the successful experience of the election in Palestine illustrates the advisability of having European observers present, and I hope that the Lebanese Government will accept this offer.
I accordingly support the Commissionâs exploratory initiative.
Lastly, I wish to stress the need to seek a positive outcome and the prospect of peace in the region as a whole.
Syria and Lebanon both have everything they need to develop alongside each other, within the framework of a partnership with the European Union, of our association agreements and our European Neighbourhood Policy.
When the time comes it will therefore be up to us to take appropriate initiatives in this context.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having spent recent weeks and months holding highly theoretic and very intense debates on European Neighbourhood Policy, we can now see that the spirit of democracy and human rights that we breathed into this policy has now taken possession of our neighbours.
First the Georgians, then the Ukrainians, and now, tentatively, the Lebanese, are standing up for the values enshrined in our Neighbourhood Policy.
Secondly, among our neighbours around the Mediterranean the Palestinian Authority has been the first to organise free elections â more free than any hitherto held in the Arab world.
Many Members of this House were able, in early January, to see with what pride the Palestinian people organised these democratic elections.
Now, then, we must set our sights higher.
If Jordan supports this peace process and Egypt does likewise, then those who want to disrupt it cannot be partners in our Neighbourhood Policy, and we must not mince our words in saying so.
What that means in plain language is that Hezbollahâs offices in Damascus and its activities in Lebanon demand that we in the European Union say loud and clear that it is intolerable that President Abbasâ peace process should continue to be undermined.
Today, Hezbollahâs activities are not so much directed against Israel; rather, they are targeted responses to individual actions taken by President Abbas in pursuit of peace.
Hezbollah knows that if it can still mastermind one or two terrorist acts, as it has succeeded in doing in Tel Aviv, then the process is again in jeopardy.
So, then, it is in the interests of the Palestinian people and of President Abbas that we should make it quite clear that, if Hezbollah does not change tack, then it should be put on the European Unionâs list of terrorist organisations, just as it already is on that of the United States.
I find it regrettable that this has not found its way into our compromise, although there is an amendment intended to insert it.
I think that any new European neighbourhood policy must make that clear, for the sake of the Palestinians and the Arabs in the region beset by conflicts, and that it would also be in Europeâs interests.
Â Â  â Mr President, developments in Lebanon should be seen within the framework of wider regional equilibrium and stability.
The application of resolution 1559 on the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanese territory is the first, but not the only dynamic element in this global approach.
At the same time, an international initiative needs to be taken to restart the peace process between Israel and Syria.
The European Union has a strategic responsibility to take a specific initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, either by preparing a parallel roadmap, or by extending the current roadmap, so that it includes the Israeli-Syrian aspect of the peace process.
The Council of Ministers and the Commission should speed up the procedures to complete the action plan for Lebanon within the framework of the European neighbourhood strategy, just as they should oppose the connection being attempted between the signature of the association agreement with Syria and prior completion of the withdrawal of the Syrian army.
It is in our interest to keep our options open with Syria if we want to help democratise the country and bring stability to the area.
The withdrawal of the Syrian forces, as agreed, is a first positive step.
Our objective is respect for the international legality and the application of resolution 1559.
However, this objective should not be selective.
It should bind all the countries in the area, including Israel.
If we are to be effective, we need first to be a credible European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is gratifying that the democratic forces in Lebanon appear to have such a lot of popular support.
For too many years, Lebanon has been governed against a background of ethnic conflicts and foreign interests.
The Syrian occupation of the country has lasted for 30 years and is an obstacle to the development of a proper democratic society.
Even if the events of recent days suggest that the Syrian regime is willing to give up its military presence in Lebanon, there are good reasons for maintaining a critical line where Syria is concerned.
Anyone with a knowledge of Syria and Lebanon knows that those in power in Syria are deeply involved in Lebanonâs economy, which they attempt to control.
Even if the actual military forces are withdrawn from the border areas, the long arm of the Syrian regime will still be able to sabotage democratic development.
President Assat has a reputation for ruthlessly using his various intelligence services and his secret police to suppress any resistance to the regime.
A fair number of bloody attacks in Syriaâs and Lebanonâs recent history are witness to this.
In addition, there is the influence exercised over Lebanon by the hierocracy in Teheran, including Hizbollah.
I am still waiting to hear a reaction from Teheran, supporting democratic development in Lebanon in unambiguous terms.
Syrian withdrawal must be followed up by an assertion that an Iranian military presence in Lebanon is also unacceptable.
The EU and the United States stand together on this matter.
The situation must be used to show that transatlantic cooperation can produce results.
With reasonable support for the democratic forces and a common front against the enemies of democracy, the EU and the United States will together be able to help democracy on its way â not only in Lebanon, but throughout the region.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we can celebrate a minor miracle, because in Lebanon, in times past, after the murder of an ex-Prime Minister we would have seen a fresh outbreak of civil war, whereas, on this occasion, Lebanese society has responded with peaceful indignation.
For the first time we have seen Druse, Sunni, Shia and Christians demonstrating together.
Now, what has been termed âthe spring of Lebanonâ needs political support, pressure and assistance.
It is not sufficient to refer back to dignified or dutiful United Nations resolutions, but instead we need a commitment from these institutions, first and foremost to make President Assad of Syria aware that he has to find the courage to go beyond half-measures.
Repositioning a few thousand soldiers in the Bekaa valley, 30 kilometres from Beirut, is not a withdrawal and merely looks like a charade.
Commissioner, we know that there will be no peace between Palestine and Israel, or in the Middle East, as long as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon â an offence to the principle of legitimate sovereignty â persists.
Since we are convinced that peace, if it is to be genuine, must be based on pluralism, we believe that there must be greater passion and political engagement in support of the peace process and of the restoration of full sovereignty in Lebanon.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the majority of speakers have reflected the very strong sentiments of friendship that exist in this House towards the Lebanese people, combined with support for that peopleâs desire for greater democracy and full sovereignty.
The message is that the European Union should spare no efforts to allow this country, which has been scarred by decades of violence and which has suffered so much from the conflicts in the region, to regain its full sovereignty, recover its stability and construct a truly democratic society through free elections.
It is for that reason that we cannot accept Lebanon being used by those who want to derail the Middle East peace process.
Those who are undermining the development of democracy in Lebanon, those who are letting themselves be used to prevent Lebanon from regaining its full sovereignty, cannot expect the slightest sympathy for their position from the European Union.
I believe that on that point, too, your message is very clear.
That naturally also applies to Hezbollah, which has to choose between either taking part in the democratic life of a new, democratic Lebanon, or serving external forces that have no desire for peace either in Lebanon or in the region as a whole.
I support what MrÂ Moscovici said: there can be only one road map for the European Union, and that is immediate and full implementation of Resolution 1559.
That is why we need to work closely with the United Nations, with the Secretary-Generalâs envoy, to ensure the resolution is implemented immediately.
We must support all those democratic forces in Lebanon who seek change and who desire sovereignty for their country.
It is for that reason that free elections in Lebanon are so important.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.15 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on services in the internal market and the patentability of computer software.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to be here to set out the Commissionâs intentions on the services proposal.
I have taken note of the reports referring to a possible withdrawal of the proposal by the Commission.
I can confirm to you that the Commission has no intention of withdrawing the proposal currently on the table.
Based on my consultations and having listened carefully to all sides of the argument, I identified a number of areas where I believe changes would be required for the broad consensus I would like to see emerge.
Many of you have urged me to clarify the Commissionâs position on these points in the interest of facilitating Parliamentâs own deliberations.
Members may recall that during my hearing before the European Parliament, I promised to consult and listen carefully before making any pronouncements on the draft directive, which the previous Commission brought forward.
Since then I have been meeting extensively with MEPs, social partners and ministers.
I was heartened by the degree of support there is across the political spectrum for opening the services market.
If we want to achieve the levels of growth necessary for sustainable development then a vibrant services sector is a prerequisite.
Yet, the single market in services is often still a distant ambition, rather than a reality.
If we are to let our economies develop and grow we must maintain a clear focus on the services market.
The services directive is a key element in our efforts to relaunch the Lisbon Agenda.
Getting the full benefit that services can bring to the EU economy will boost growth and jobs.
If we are serious about the Lisbon Agenda, we must be serious about the services market.
After my initial round of contacts, I went to President Barroso and said that I believed the current proposal would never be adopted unless we were prepared to accept modifications.
That is why in presenting the Commissionâs views on the Lisbon Strategy to you some weeks ago, President Barroso indicated that the Commission believed some changes would be necessary to ensure success.
Opening up the services market is an ambitious project.
The proposal to achieve this is innovative.
To be successful we need a broad consensus.
There are aspects of the current draft that are giving rise to serious concerns.
The debate had become too polarised.
Many of you have raised such concerns and it is clear that shortcomings have to be addressed.
I had the opportunity to outline my views briefly to the Conference of Presidents last week and I am happy to discuss this further with you today.
Let me reiterate the areas I have identified.
The directive will have to be clear that conditions and standards for workers will not be affected in any way.
The text will have to be watertight on this point.
There will be no change to the existing situation in this regard.
I do not want to hear any more talk about so-called 'social dumping'.
This is not what this proposal is about and we should put an end to this confusion.
Another area I have identified is the exclusion from the scope of the directive of sectors such as health and publicly funded services of general interest: for obvious reasons, people regard these sectors as particularly sensitive.
We should address concerns about the operation of the country of origin principle.
We need to maintain this if we want to promote the cross-frontier provision of services.
To do so we will need to address key issues such as giving greater confidence and certainty to businesses and consumers on what law will apply to cross-border transactions.
We also need to build the trust and confidence between Member States necessary for it to operate effectively.
The above points reflect the principal areas emerging from my own consultations.
It is of course up to you in Parliament to make your own decisions.
Clearly, it is your responsibility to decide on the amendments you want to bring forward.
On behalf of the Commission, I am merely signalling our willingness to work openly and constructively with you.
Yesterday at the Council of Ministers for Competitiveness there was an exchange of views on the services proposal.
The presidency welcomed the clear statement that no new proposal would be presented by the Commission.
It endorsed the suggestion that health and social services of general interest be excluded from the proposal.
It agreed that the current text needed to be modified if it was to be adopted.
I hope we can now move the discussion in the European Parliament and Council onto the positive elements that this proposal can bring.
Many aspects of the proposal have met with broad support and we should build on these.
Removing the red tape currently strangling efforts to establish or provide services on a cross-border basis will make a real contribution to entrepreneurship, growth and job creation.
Ensuring that companies have easy access to information on requirements they have to comply with will contribute to this, as will the simplification of authorisation procedures.
Service providers and their customers and consumers should not see their desire to benefit from the single market frustrated by being subjected to discriminatory and disproportionate requirements.
Recipients of services should also have easy access to information on service providers and their services.
It should be easier to choose a service provider from another Member State.
Quality of services should be guaranteed and simple access to dispute settlement must be available.
We need to develop the cooperation, confidence and assistance between Member State administrations.
This is what the single market in services is about.
It will increase competition, stimulate entrepreneurship and provide new opportunities for service providers, which will give a much-needed boost to the EU economy.
By ensuring that we deliver on this we will give the services economy the boost it requires.
We will fulfil the commitment set out in the Lisbon Agenda.
I am prepared to be constructive and positive.
From the meetings I have had with many of you, I have learned a great deal and very useful and constructive suggestions have been made.
I remain open and available to all of you to discuss particular ideas, concerns or proposals you may have.
I believe that with this I have outlined the Commissionâs position and our desire to work loyally within the codecision process.
Â Â  Commissioner, I believe that the plan was for you to speak about both issues, given that Members of this House are down to ask you questions on both the services directive, on which you have spoken, and the issue of the patentability of computer software.
I should therefore ask that you finish your communication so that we can then open up the debate to all the Members of the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is grateful for this opportunity to make a statement on the proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.
I have already had the opportunity to discuss the proposal with the Committee on Legal Affairs on 2Â February and with the Conference of Presidents on 3 March.
On both occasions I took very careful note of Parliamentâs views.
I noted that Parliament considers, in general, that its views were not given sufficient weight at first reading.
From the debate in the Legal Affairs Committee, I noted that there are differing views on the substance of the proposal, in particular its content and purpose.
The Commission gave careful consideration to Parliamentâs request of 24Â February, submitted under Article 55 of Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure.
But the Commission concluded that at that stage, regrettably, it could not submit a new proposal as Parliament requested.
That was not because the Commission wished to persist stubbornly with the proposal, but because the Council was on the point of adopting a common position.
As I explained to the Conference of Presidents, the Council reached a political agreement in May 2004 at first reading.
The Council has been on the verge of confirming the political agreement in the form of a common position since December 2004.
The Commission had supported the political agreement of May 2004.
The Commission could not, therefore, go back on its word when the Council was in the process of confirming its common position.
The Council has now made up its mind and adopted its common position.
It did so yesterday at the Competitiveness Council.
Jeannot KreckÃ©, Chair of the Competitiveness Council, has already explained to the Legal Affairs Committee the reasons behind the Councilâs stance.
It confirmed its common position, primarily for institutional reasons.
The Council wanted to avoid the setting of a precedent, with Member States being seen to back away from a deal they had signed up to in May 2004.
The Council confirmed its position to show that a deal is a deal and that it was not creating a logjam in a key area for innovation.
Yesterday, when the Council took its decision, Jeannot KreckÃ© noted that some Member States had concerns about the substance of the text and that these would be addressed at second reading.
The ball is now very clearly in the European Parliamentâs court.
It is for you to decide how you want to play it.
I do not have to remind you of Parliamentâs rights: we discussed this in the Conference of Presidents.
You can, of course, reject or substantially amend the proposal.
If Parliament decides to reject it, then the Commission will respect your wishes.
I will not propose a new directive.
Should you decide to propose amendments, the Commission will give them due consideration.
No doubt improvements can be made.
You will understand, of course, that I cannot speak on behalf of the Council and I would urge Parliament to engage constructively with the Council on this subject in the future.
I am ready to help in any way.
Before concluding, I would like to say a few words on the substance of the proposal, since Parliament will now need to turn its attention to this.
The Commission proposed to clarify the legal rules on patentability for software-related inventions.
This does not include computer programs or other software as such.
It means inventions that make a technical contribution and that are truly novel.
Such inventions are present in a number of everyday consumer goods such as cars, mobile telephones and domestic appliances.
The Commissionâs intention in making its proposal was to avoid the patenting of pure software and make a clear distinction between the European Union and the United States.
Nothing that is not patentable now will be made patentable by the directive.
The current rules in the European Patent Convention leave patent examiners very wide decision-making powers.
There can be different interpretations as to whether an invention can be patented. This leads to uncertainty for businesses.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are negatively affected by the lack of clarity in the existing rules.
I would like to remind Members that, in the absence of a directive, patents will continue to be granted.
If patent offices decide to grant patents for pure software, then expensive procedures before the Courts will be the only option for those who wish to object.
Those of you who have been directly involved in working on this proposal know as well as I do that this is a very complex area.
Any modifications will need to be carefully examined.
The directive cannot be turned on its head.
We need to maintain a proper balance between stimulating innovation and making sure competition is not stifled.
I hope I have not spoken for too long.
The situation is now clear.
The ball is in your court.
I am sure you will exercise your rights and your judgement wisely.
Whatever you decide, I would like to reassure you that the Commission is listening. I know there is a new wind blowing.
That is reflected in the positions expressed in the Council and Parliament and the Commission will take account of this and respect it.
Â Â  Commissioner, your communications have sparked great interest among the Members of this House.
There are many Members due to speak and we only have 20 minutes for them to do so.
I shall give the floor for one minute at a time and I shall be grateful for everyoneâs cooperation in enabling as many Members as possible to speak.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we listened carefully to what you had to say, and also liked what we heard, because you intend to allow Parliament to play its legislative role, and you can rely on us to do just that.
For the sake of clarity, could I ask you once again whether we will really be able to count on you when we amend the directive to such an extent that we modify some of the architecture of the country of origin principle, when we clearly specify the exclusion of services of general interest, as well as public health and social services?
In particular, I would like to know whether we could count on your support if we were to launch the idea of working with a positive list when using the country of origin principle, possibly also in terms of the area of application.
Thirdly, what will you do with health services?
Will the Commission draft a new proposal or will you plan something different for the longer term?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we are agreed that we want a directive on services, and also that we need to make major changes to this one.
You have mentioned proposals aimed at creating derogations for welfare or health services, and that is one road down which we could indeed go, although major amendments would be needed to do away with the country of origin principle as the foundation of this directive.
I am sure that is quite clear to you.
Commissioner, I have not, unfortunately, found what you have had to say on the subject very satisfactory; you have a regrettable ability to keep on saying that you are clearing things up while only making matters more confused.
You said that you wanted to make proposals; I beg of you, Commissioner, you cannot make any new proposals without at the same time withdrawing the directive.
What do you actually want to do?
Do you want to withdraw it and make new proposals, or wait until Parliament has done its job?
Â Â  Mr President, I am happy to say that I agree with what the previous speaker had to say about the services directive, but, Commissioner, when it comes to the software patent directive, everything becomes incomprehensible.
How can you defend it as you have just done at a time when the Lisbon Strategy is again being lifted high?
Do you not see how, by taking this course of action on software patents, you are in fact hamstringing the European project in defence of which you have just spoken?
How do you propose, by means of these patents, to protect the small and medium-sized businesses, whom you have described as being gravely concerned?
They cannot afford lawyers.
What is going on here is a stitch-up.
