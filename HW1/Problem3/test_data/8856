Sustainable mobility (debate)
The next item is the report by Etelka Barsi-Pataky, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent
rapporteur. - (HU) Parliament welcomes the mid-term review of the fundamental document of Europe's transport policy, the White Paper.
We are pleased that the Commission has prepared its report on the subject after broad coordination, and that it has done a thorough job.
We also welcome the fact that it has made suggestions in several areas with regard to modifying the existing transport policy.
Parliament recognises the achievements of the past five years, while at the same time we are critical on several matters.
Parliament requests the Council and the Commission to consider our recommendations as the cornerstone of European transport policy.
Now, what do these consist of?
First of all, the experience of past years shows that the use of regulation is the weak point of transport policy.
As for implementation, it has been the case more than once that this came only after considerable delay, while sometimes it has been done incompletely or not at all.
The Commission's report does not face up with sufficient thoroughness or honesty to this problem, and therefore it does not suggest appropriate solutions.
Parliament emphasises the importance of cooperation among the European, national and regional levels, of strengthening this cooperation and of working together.
Second, the majority in Parliament is of the opinion that we need to shape our transport policy more realistically than was done in the past.
The review quite rightly observes that transport, as a service, plays a key role in the economy and in society, and that it is inseparable from the latter; our recommendation is therefore that we integrate it fully into the Lisbon Strategy.
For the most part, we agree that existing capacities must be utilised more efficiently on their own or in integration, and that each and every mode of transport must be sustainable on its own; this applies particularly to logistics.
In addition to co-modality in certain areas, the modal shift, in our view, plays an important role especially with regard to long-distance transport.
Third, as far as the growth of the European economy is concerned, the inadequate financing of infrastructures poses a risk.
Neither the Commission's report, nor the Council's position faces up adequately to this problem.
European transport requires more Community financing, more financing by Member States, more courageous financial solutions and, above all, political support, in order to implement its key projects.
We ask, and we expect, that the tasks of reviewing the seven-year budget for this area begin immediately.
Fourth, we should talk about the changed circumstances and new challenges since 2001.
Among these I would highlight first of all those tasks, which follow from the reunification of Europe in 2004 and 2007, which considerably increased the differences within Europe, as well as its diversity, which needs to be analysed much more thoroughly in European legislation.
We have a common interest, moreover, in the interconnected, interoperable trans-European network.
Thus it must be the joint responsibility of every level and every institution to make full use of those sources that ensure cohesion.
Fifth, we need to face the fact that the impact of transport on climate change has increased and continues to increase.
Although the spring session of the Council formulated worthy general objectives, their practical transposition is the task of the legislation that is before us, and that will be carried out in the coming period.
Among these, for instance, is the Commission proposal, due in 2008, on the internalisation of external costs.
Sixth, we must consider here and take account of the fact that traditional arrangements are gradually reaching the limits of their effectiveness, and therefore we must take advantage of the potential of intelligent transport systems.
We need to create a legal, economic and technological environment that is suitable for the industry.
We have launched some large, comprehensive Community projects, European projects that are promising.
But the Union does not have any experience in these innovations, so we need to blaze a trail in this area.
However, European responses to climate change are worthless if we cannot implement these on a global scale.
Commissioner, it is our opinion that after this mid-term review, there needs to be a progressive renewal of Europe's transport policy in this direction and an adjustment to the new challenges, otherwise overcrowding, the pressures on the environment, and the problems of social sustainability will present serious obstacles to the growth of Europe's economy and well-being.
I thank all those fellow Members who have lent their constructive support to the preparation of this report.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to be here to take part in this debate on European transport policy.
I wish to commend the quality of Mrs Barsi-Pataky's work which, by the conciseness of its messages, has given a strong political signal.
You said just now, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, that any transport policy must be able to be constantly updated, for the very reason that it has to adapt, and you have underlined the importance of making this growth in transport sustainable.
I am pleased by the soundness of your report and its relevance to the mid-term review of the White Paper.
You received favourably the realistic approach of the Commission's communication; it is an approach that needs to be brought up to date, in compliance with the Lisbon objectives, and made part of the framework of the European strategy for sustainable development.
These objectives relate to the four pillars of our approach: sustainable mobility, safe mobility, innovative mobility and the international dimension.
You also supported the concept of co-modality and we must indeed, in order to make a success of the modal shift, reduce the negative impacts of all modes of transport precisely so as to ensure the environmental efficiency and performance of each mode of transport.
The promotion of intelligent systems of transport and logistics, urban mobility policies, the development of intelligent charging systems are all ways of contributing to it without jeopardising the mobility necessary for growth.
I shall mention now the items under this heading that are due shortly.
The Green Paper on urban transport, the importance of which you have emphasised.
The action plan on logistics that I intend to submit to you soon and which will include actions intended to remove administrative, operational and functional obstacles: to encourage training and exchange of best practice, to promote standardisation across the different modes.
A communication on port policy is planned for the autumn, in which there will be, among other things, assessments of aspects of integration of port infrastructures in the logistics chain.
The forthcoming appointment of a European coordinator for motorways of the sea and of another European coordinator for waterways, and we are going to consolidate the institutional framework of inland navigation with harmonisation of pilots' certificates and the setting up of a fund for innovation in this sector.
Next, the communication on a rail network focussed on freight in Europe.
Next, the levying of charges on infrastructures.
As you wanted at the time of adopting the new Eurovignette directive, the Commission will present in 2008 a methodology for the internalisation of external costs.
There, now, is a good agenda which corresponds, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, very much with your recommendations.
I should like to add a few comments about certain passages in your report beginning with a reminder that the Commission carries out a rigorous policy of initiating proceedings for infringements, which is beginning to bear fruit.
In another vein, I understand that the international negotiations are a sensitive subject for Parliament.
Having said that, it is up to the Commission to negotiate international agreements, but it will keep the European Parliament regularly informed about the progress of the negotiations.
I also take note of your request for a report concerning the directive on the interoperability of electronic road pricing systems and we shall present, as set out in the directive, a report for 2009.
The Commission is in the process of assessing the impact of the European modular system.
Despite the advantages and increased efficiency in some instances, this option remains controversial.
Finally, the Commission fully supports the development of biofuels with the establishment of European standards for this type of fuel.
It is a matter of making it easier to achieve the European Union's minimum target: 10% of biofuels out of the total fuel consumption by 2020.
I am going now to listen with attention to your comments and once again I thank Parliament and the Commission for giving informed opinions on this mid-term review of the White Paper.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for the work she has done.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I nevertheless have to say that I am sorry that the Committee on Transport and Tourism took only very little account of our committee's proposals.
The traditional way of thinking is that the more transport there is the better it is for the economy and industry.
The Committee on Industry, however, took the view that transport caused others to incur much more in costs which are not at present internalised in the price of transport.
Transport is the sector where carbon dioxide emissions are growing the fastest.
For example, emissions from road traffic have increased by more than 25% since 1990; the figure is more than 50% in the case of air traffic.
This renders meaningless the reductions in emissions which have been achieved in industry and energy production.
It is therefore time we started applying 'the polluter pays' principle in transport too, and internalised the costs of environmental damage in the prices of different transport modes.
Fair competition between the different transport modes also makes this necessary.
The Committee on Transport regrettably wanted to water down this principle so that the environmental charges on transport would be spent in the transport sector.
Transport, however, also needs to take the issue of carbon dioxide emissions seriously.
We have to set clear targets to reduce not just emissions from vehicles but all forms of transport.
Part of this will entail less traffic generally, especially car and air traffic.
Half of the car journeys taken every day in the European Union are less than five kilometres long.
They are mainly in the cities.
If just a third of these short car journeys were stopped and people walked, cycled or took buses instead, carbon dioxide emissions thorughout Europe would go down by several per cent.
For example, emissions in Germany would fall by 4%.
Moreover, air pollution would be reduced precisely where people mostly tend to live.
According to the World Health Organisation, every year over 300 000 Europeans die before their time from air pollution, the main cause of which in cities is car traffic.
Business would also benefit as a result of less illness caused by pollutants.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Barsi-Pataky on this report and by thanking her for her hard work and willingness to compromise.
She has managed, in a very short, but accurate and perceptive report, to give an overview of the key priorities for Europe's future transport policy.
Experts - especially those who can read between the lines - will appreciate that.
However, our citizens will lament the lack of detailed, tangible examples and practical proposals.
The mid-term review on the European Commission's 2001 Transport White Paper shows that we have a lot of catching up to do.
This is not only true for the security aspects, but also for other areas such as sustainability, investment (particularly in TENs) and logistics.
Mrs Barsi-Pataky has indicated the right approach through her support for an intermodal transport network in which each carrier will develop their strengths so as to create goods transport services that are in the public interest.
I was struck by the absence of any call for an appropriate Community framework for intermodal tourism, in other words for structuring the movements of European citizens.
We also need intermodal approaches in public and private long-distance passenger transport in order to satisfy the constantly growing desire for mobility.
I very much welcome the decision to link existing transport problems to the development of intelligent transport systems and innovative technical solutions.
Policies should be bold enough to give priority to security-related legislation in the transport sector.
This should include strict rules for HGVs up to 44 tonnes and transport infrastructure safety management.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Barsi-Pataky most warmly on her ability to synthesise such a heated process and procedure as the revision of this Green Paper, despite all of the, shall we say, good intentions.
It was only to be expected, however, that all of the Members would want to add some of the huge number of ideas inspired by the Commission's proposal.
I would also like to congratulate her on her ability to reach valid compromises, which are going to attract broad support from the whole of Parliament.
She has achieved a good balance between the unquestionable objectives, such as the modal shift in favour of modes that are still under-developed and which offer great environmental advantages, such as railways and inland waterways, while at the same time being able to interweave it with a new notion of co-modality that gave it a touch of realism that was more acceptable to all of the actors in the sector and which reduced many of the pressures that were preventing us from moving forward in a more reasonable manner.
I would point out that one of the great problems with Community legislation - though not just Community legislation - is its deficient application.
It is therefore crucial that we call for innovative instruments for that application.
We also agree with her criticism of the insufficient funding of the trans-European networks and of the other transport measures at European level and we believe that it opens up future perspectives which may be very useful to us in the 2008 debate, in order finally to achieve funding that is a match for our ambitions for European transport.
We are also grateful for your understanding in relation to integrating transport into the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.
We believe that that will finally make the Member States act responsibly in both fields: that of legislative application and that of sufficient funding.
The proposals in favour of logistics also seem to us to be hopeful signs, and we will try to follow them in the report that we are currently drawing up, as well as the innovative solutions and your total and ongoing support for intelligent transport systems.
We also support your call for diversity and what that has meant since enlargement, which you understand better than anybody.
We agree with your approach with regard to the global approach and relations with third countries, which we believe to be crucial to the future of the whole issue of European transport.
We also welcome your support for the Green Paper on urban transport and, finally, we are grateful for your understanding over the need to update your report in relation to climate change, taking up the Council's latest proposal on reducing CO2 emissions.
The only thing I must say, finally, is that we will not be able to join you in supporting the modular aspect that appears in paragraph 11 of your report, but I believe that, by means of the proposal with which Mr Grosch will perhaps provide us, we will be able to find a solution to that little problem between the two groups.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, what we are examining is an excellent report, which enables Parliament to understand, support and align itself with the work that the Commission must carry out in this last brief period of its activities.
The Barsi-Pataky report covers all the problems with which we have dealt in recent years and thus can make a strategic contribution to our policy.
I had the misfortune, if I may put it that way, to arrive just a moment before that clear change in priorities that has occurred over the last few weeks, with the possible inclusion within the Union's activities of the fight against climate change and direct responsibility for the issue of energy costs.
I believe that this makes it necessary for us to review the whole text in the light of the new priorities, justifying or clarifying all the policies that we must implement to ensure that transport, too, makes its contribution to the attainment of these two objectives.
This means working to use alternative fuels or the same fuels with more efficient engines, trying to organise more efficient journeys with the aid of logistics but also, and above all, adding principles and logic to our need to insist on the better use of more energy-efficient and climate-friendly transport, as well as organising our lives in such as way as to reduce unnecessary mobility demands.
This merely underlines once again the historic strategies, which all in all are a credit to the European transport policy.
Interoperability, access to the markets and the integration of networks are making a dominant reappearance on the stage, albeit with two qualifications: time and money.
Time is becoming more urgent: everything needs to be accelerated and pushed to achieve swifter results if we wish to maintain the objectives of reducing CO2 and energy costs, as anticipated in the new objectives that the Union has set itself.
The other problem is funding.
The way in which the Union acts as intermediary regarding the Member States' investments needs to be reconsidered in the medium term: I am referring not only to the funding of infrastructure, which is certainly the largest amount, but also to interoperability and to other measures that are designed to facilitate market access.
This funding not only needs to be obtained at European level, but also requires the Commission to have the possibility of coordinating the policies and funding of all the States, so as to ensure that the results we require are rapidly achieved.
on behalf of Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the report has a promising title: 'Keep Europe moving - sustainable mobility for our continent'.
The clearest statement in Mrs Barsi-Pataky's report is in paragraph 14: 'the mid-term review of the Transport White Paper 2001 has not laid down long-term objectives nor given answers'.
The EU's transport policy is riddled with inconsistencies.
Many good principles are correctly identified, but often are not put into practice.
The report makes it clear that the negative effects of climate change have increased, not least as a result of a bad transport policy.
Many people still believe that growth is a constant: ever faster, ever higher, ever further.
Growth may be sustainable, but is not a good thing.
Incessant growth will not achieve the Kyoto targets, and the aim of halving CO2 emissions by 2050 will remain a pipe dream.
Often we only treat the symptoms, not the cause of the evil.
Satu Hassu from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has already cited various examples.
We have been afraid to tell the whole truth about the costs.
We want to build new, ridiculously expensive high-speed train tracks while the existing tracks, in Italy for example, are rusting away.
Air traffic emissions are not included in the CO2 calculations, and transport is being promoted all over Europe.
Let us look at a very real, topical event: today in Vienna, the transport ministers from Italy, Austria and Germany have again happily declared their commitment to the Brenner Base Tunnel.
The economic viability of the Brenner Base Tunnel is very dubious in the light of our experience with the Channel Tunnel.
The finance comes from Member States who are already contravening the Maastricht criteria, which puts it on a very shaky footing.
Some of the approach sections have not even been planned.
It really is a massive white elephant.
There is talk of transferring goods traffic to rail, yet the plans are for a high-speed passenger line.p
The objectives of a socially acceptable and environmentally-friendly transport policy need to be: reducing unnecessary traffic flows, moving to more environmentally-friendly transport methods, being honest about the cost - which means transport prices must include all the costs of construction, maintenance, addressing environmental and health problems, and the cost of accidents - and sustainable taxation of transport based on CO2 emissions, including, most importantly, for air traffic.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, practice has proved to be more inflexible than theory.
Halfway through the planning horizon of the White Paper on transport, it transpires that the objectives are not yet within reach.
The Commission's decision to fine-tune the objectives is both courageous and sensible.
I take my hat off to you.
The change of course does, however, mean that we need to have different irons in the fire.
It is no longer only the intention to shift cargo, but to improve every modality. This requires copious amounts of international decisiveness and tenacity in a number of cases.
There is also plenty to do in Europe, including the introduction of adequate infrastructure, the use of new technology, specific action programmes for market sectors and the further introduction of the polluter, that is, the user pays principle.
These elements have been included in the Barsi-Pataky report with very good reason.
As such, I can identify with most of the content of her report.
I have tabled amendments in respect of two points.
This House lays down transport legislation, whereupon it is often up to the Member States to transpose this legislation.
It has transpired that one and the same piece of legislation is interpreted and enforced in different ways in different Member States.
This means, for example, that lorries driving across various Member States comply with this selfsame piece of legislation in one country and not in the next, with all the consequences that this entails.
I regard this as unacceptable.
This is why, in my Amendment 4, attention is drawn to this, and Member States and the Commission are urged, where necessary, to agree on a common interpretation of legal documents.
This amendment does not provide for common penalties applicable to infringements.
The second point concerns urban transport.
Although I am well disposed towards it, I take the view that this should fall within the Member States' remit, and should remain so.
The role of the European Union can therefore be nothing more than facilitating.
By way of conclusion, I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her efforts and congratulate her on this result.
(DE) Mr President, the Commission's mid-term review rightly highlights a number of common transport policy successes, notably the constant improvements in incorporating transport policy priorities in other policy areas: the internal market for one, and environmental policy for another.
I would like to thank Vice-President Barrot for specifically referring to the study on internalising external costs.
We are eagerly awaiting the findings and recommendations for further action.
The mid-term review must also recognise that many actions that were identified as necessary have either failed or are threatened with failure because of the lack of funding and unwillingness to provide funding on the part of the Union - or more specifically, the Member States.
This indicates that new impetus is called for at half-time.
We need more money.
We need better systems.
We need more, better and new technologies, and above all, we need better logistics.
There are also new issues to address.
It is vital that we involve the new Member States and the candidate counties in the older existing system of trans-European networks so that we can all grow together.
With all the different facets of security considerations, there is still a lot of work to be done.
On the subject of urban transport policy, boldness and sensitivity must be our watchwords.
A methodical approach is needed: it is not necessary to enshrine every feasible and conceivable idea in European law straight away.
It may be better to opt for less binding legislation, and more stimulus in the form of best practice and respect for subsidiarity.
Transport as a whole is set to keep increasing, not decrease.
Some have a vision of the future in which transport growth and economic growth will be completely separate.
We do not want to fall flat on our faces, though: growth is not appropriate for all areas.
Amendment 6 from our Scandinavian fellow MEPs should not be seen or used as a back door for the so-called EuroCombi HGVs.
What may be good practice in Scandinavia is not suitable in the rest of Europe.
My thanks to the Commission. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.
(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Barsi-Pataky, who has produced a skilfully worded report with some very clear messages.
I also wish to thank the Commission and Commissioner Barrot for their evaluation of the White Paper, involving a lot of constructive new thinking about the EU's transport policy.
The White Paper will be the framework for sound and wide-ranging transport decisions over the next few years.
The evaluation may help bring about better decisions.
The EU's Heads of State or Government have, of course, decided that efficient transport should be a part of the Lisbon Process, designed to make the EU into the most competitive knowledge-based economy before the year 2010, and that of course sounds all well and good.
It shows that there is increasing understanding for the fact that efficient transport is crucial to economic development.
At the same time, the Commission's commitment to co-modality and its focus on the interplay of different forms of transport testify to a more realistic understanding of what drives demand for transport, which is to say that people want the safest, most efficient, comfortable and inexpensive means of getting from A to B. We must develop each individual mode of transport in ways that are environmentally sound and we must do more to coordinate the different forms of transport so that proper consideration is given both to efficiency and to the environment.
Such a policy requires investment, and one might well doubt somewhat whether the EU Heads of State or Government will honour their fine words about enhanced transport.
We shall get some perspective on the matter shortly when we hear what the Trans-European Networks are to get.
I am afraid that not enough money has been set aside for the Trans-European Networks for 2007 to 2013, and we must demand that the agenda for the mid-term review of the 2009 budgetary framework includes more money for transport investment.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is stuck in traffic jams, and the situation is getting worse.
Change is needed.
Yet transport plays a vital role in our economy.
If our transport policy is poor, the economy will suffer because it is dependent on the transport sector.
So it is important that we create links between transport policy and other policies.
We can and must make progress on a lot of important regulation, such as harmonisation, starting at European level, but we must remember that political measures can only be taken at Community level if they offer a clear added value.
This means constantly evaluating the need for all EU transport policy regulations.
Existing measures have to be reviewed regularly, so as to be able to nip any undesirable trends in the bud.
Overregulation is detrimental to the transport market.
In order to make real improvements to mobility and environmental protection, we need to establish substantial incentives for the relatively environmentally-friendly, but hitherto neglected rail and inland waterway sectors.
We need to get the Member States on board in this area.
There is still a wealth of unexploited potential, and that is a challenge for Europe.
At the same time, there is no satisfactory answer to the question of whether the European Commission should intervene in urban transport.
Are we responsible for this sector?
Does that not go against the principle of subsidiarity?
Can Europe dictate how our towns and cities manage their internal affairs?
The European Commission cannot be allowed to use the current hysterical climate change debate to extend its powers.
If we want to make sustainable improvements to the transport situation and thereby to environmental quality in our cities, we need to get Europe's citizens behind us.
Only through changes in the behaviour of our citizens as transport users will we achieve substantial and genuinely effective results.
This will require targeted information campaigns, however, which would need to be initiated and supported at European level.
To close, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for her excellent and thorough report on the subject and for always being open to discussion.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
European transport faces major challenges: a uniform market and good connections and cross-border permeability, services in large cities, safety and quality of services and working conditions for transport workers.
This involves above all good and systematic regulation of European and national legislation. It also involves proper organisation and logistics, a lot of investment in infrastructure, but above all it involves energy consumption.
There is no such thing as transport without energy supplies.
Using energy in transport creates harmful emissions.
We must limit these emissions on environmental grounds using the requisite technology.
The cost of fuel is high, and we must reduce fuel consumption by incorporating new technology into engines.
But new pollution-cutting and fuel-saving technologies cost money, and we have to develop them further to bring down their price, as cheaper technology in transport is cheap transport, and cheap transport means a competitive economy.
So here again, the main problem is new technologies.
I would like to ask this House, during the mid-term budget review, to greatly increase expenditure on transport research and technology.
We need to be innovative in transport technology, otherwise we will lose the race for competitive transport, a competitive economy and the Lisbon strategy.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, quite simply but frankly, to say to Mrs Satu Hassi that I am surprised by her comments as we are totally committed to sustainable mobility.
I am surprised, Mrs Hassi, that you should think that we are forgetting the 'polluter pays' principle.
I think I made, with Mr Dimas, a brave commitment about sharing with aviation the allowances for greenhouse gas emissions.
We observe a political line and I am very surprised by your comments which, if I may say, seem to me a little excessive.
I am also going to take the opportunity of saying to Mr Kusstatscher that I find it difficult to understand him: it is quite clear that at a time when we are building infrastructures for high speed trains, we are freeing up conventional lines for freight.
It is not just by chance that I stated just now that there would be a communication on railway lines dedicated to freight.
Mrs Sommer, may I say to you also that I am not looking for competences.
On the other hand, I take into account, on the one hand, the expectations of citizens and, on the other hand, the fact that, if you want rail to have its rightful place in Europe, it is necessary to ensure interoperability.
If you want a sustainable development policy, there comes a moment when you can do it only by coordination and harmonisation on a European scale.
I say this to you straight out, because you will understand that as a Commissioner, committed as I am, I am happy to accept a certain number of justified criticisms, but I feel obliged to answer back directly when the criticism becomes excessive.
I come now to some comments that I wanted to make.
The Commission has already begun removing obstacles to the running of trains: simplifying the certification of railway vehicles, railway interoperability and safety, the third rail package.
I thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism for their work in this field towards reaching an agreement.
In the aviation sector, we have two regulations concerning the interoperability of European traffic management systems.
We adopted, in 2007, an 'airports' package that is focussed on the role of airports in the competitiveness of the internal aviation market and, as for infrastructures, we have a new trans-European network (TEN).
Mr Costa is right, however, when he says that we shall have to really redouble our efforts to coordinate financing because, as Mrs Ayala and others have emphasised, we find ourselves faced with a budget which is too limited to be able really to undertake the major works on infrastructure that will enable sustainable mobility.
You are absolutely right and I thank Parliament for forcefully pointing it out.
Mr Koch spoke about co-modality in tourism and he is right.
Co-modality must also work in favour of passengers.
As far as infrastructures are concerned, as I have just said, we are going to try to mobilise all possible resources and to develop public private partnerships with the involvement of the European Investment Bank.
I shall say a brief word on the social aspects of transport.
From April new social rules in relation to professional road transport came into force and we presented three proposals for regulations with a view to modernising admission to the occupation of road transport operator and access to the road transport market.
With regard to passengers' rights, we have, thanks to Parliament, begun to introduce rights for passengers with reduced mobility in all modes of transport, particularly by coach and by sea.
I will admit to you, knowing Parliament's sensitivity on this subject, that we must now actually put these rights into practice.
As far as safety is concerned, I should like to emphasise again the priority of road safety in our action, as the first European Road Safety Day attests.
We have also simplified the rules in relation to transport of dangerous goods and we have three air, sea and rail safety agencies, which are not idle.
Safety will keep us busy in the autumn in the context of conciliation on common rules in the aviation sector.
With regard to innovation, on which Mrs Barsi-Pataky was right to insist, it is really a major problem.
Transport has to benefit from new technology.
That will be the case with the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) for air traffic.
It is the case with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) to equip new railway lines and then, of course, it will be the case with energy saving and green propulsion to ensure the sustainability of road mobility.
All that will be the subject of an action plan for energy efficiency and will be part of the European strategy for energy defined by the European Council.
I shall not elaborate on the international dimension.
It is obviously necessary to pursue this policy that has enabled us to sign an open sky agreement with the United States and with other countries.
Henceforth, we are going to pursue all these efforts.
Mr President, I shall leave it at that, because, of course, all of that deserves much more explanation.
I thank Parliament and particularly Mrs Barsi-Pataky, because I think we are engaged in a transport policy that really takes into account future requirements, which looks not to the past but very much to the future, with this double objective: to enable mobility such as the Lisbon objectives require and, at the same time, to ensure that this mobility remains compatible with the demands of environmental protection and the fight against global warming.
It is a very difficult battle.
I thank Parliament very much for its support and, personally, I feel very committed to these efforts towards sustainable mobility.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007.
Recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on bilateral trade relations between the EU and China by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0129/2007).
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to introduce this subject on behalf of the Committee on International Trade.
I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Mandelson and his services, who have dramatically improved the flow of information sent to our committee regarding the various bilateral and interregional trade negotiations.
The committee hopes that this style of cooperation will continue for international negotiations on partnership and cooperation agreements in which, as in the case of China, trade is a significant factor.
Our trade relations with the People's Republic of China are of great importance for both sides.
Last year, China took over from the USA as the largest exporter to the European Union.
At the same time, the European Union's trade deficit with China rose to EUR 128 billion.
The Committee on International Trade has been monitoring China's growing importance in international trade for some time now.
As early as 2005, our committee chose to produce an own-initiative report on the subject: the first report ever produced on an individual trading partner.
A second report looked at the consequences of the expiry of the quota system for the Chinese textiles and clothing industry.
We should congratulate the rapporteurs - Caroline Lucas and Tokia SaÃ¯fi - for their foresight two years ago.
In the European Union and developing countries, concerns about the textiles and clothing industry and the impact of opening the market to China have still not been allayed.
This uncertainty has been increasing as the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding is now due to expire.
We need a clear statement about China's market economy status in order to investigate allegations of dumping in this area.
The Lucas report looked at the issue of Europe's strategy in terms of optimising the value creation chain and increasing production of high-tech goods.
The belief that the European Union can continue to offer cannier solutions in the long term and set the pace for scientific and technical progress has to be called into question in view of the incredibly high numbers of well-qualified Chinese school leavers.
We do, of course, recognise and welcome the reduction in poverty that China's meteoric rise has brought about in the past 20 years.
At the same time, it is reasonable to expect China to comply with the WTO rules that it accepted when it became a member.
This includes provisions on intellectual property and the principle of non-discrimination for imported goods.
Nor can we afford to ignore the ecological and social consequences of China's growth.
We should be prepared to support those who are addressing the problems on the ground.
Commissioner Mandelson, I believe I read that last month at a trade union conference in the United Kingdom you said that in international and bilateral trade talks, we seek to set fair environmental and social standards.
I only hope that this applies to our major trading partners, not just the small ones.
So we expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that you are currently negotiating with China to incorporate all these elements, and that the interests of all affected parties will be considered, instead of focussing solely on market access.
Commissioner, perhaps you could tell us to what extent this message is being conveyed through the EU's stance in the negotiations on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with China, and also how China has responded to our position.
Another, more general, question is that of the relationship between international and bilateral negotiations.
The European Union's trade strategy sees national bilateral and interregional trade relations as complementing the multilateral efforts made within the WTO.
The WTO negotiations seem to have stalled.
Could you, Commissioner, explain what is the basis for conducting bilateral discussions, given that it is currently unclear what shape the global framework for future negotiations will take, and therefore what the agreements will need to look like.
Lastly, I would like to ask you whether it is really necessary, before we reach an agreement in a multilateral framework, to negotiate individual WTO-plus agreements containing provisions that we know many developing countries are not happy with.
Would this type of conduct not make concluding a multilateral agreement - which is the solution that our committee favours - even more complicated than it is at present?
Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson is not only an inspired orator, he is also a tireless negotiator.
Six years after the accession of China to the WTO, we are still waiting for a balance in bilateral trade between the European Union and China.
China enjoys fully the benefits of the open markets, without itself complying fully with its obligations under multilateral rules and disciplines.
The Chinese markets are still to a large extent closed and non-transparent.
There are high import barriers, which result - according to estimates - in lost profits of EUR 20 billion a year to European businesses.
Protection of intellectual property is inadequate.
I need only mention that, in 2006, 80% of imitation goods seized on the borders of Europe were of Chinese origin.
The Commission preferred to continue bilateral dialogue with China on intellectual property issues rather than coordinated action between the ÎU and the USA, which activated the WTO dispute settlement mechanism against China.
Dialogue would appear to be the way forward.
However, we are awaiting concrete results from this specific dialogue.
In any event, dialogue does not preclude the use of other legal means.
In the textile and clothing sector, all means should be used to safeguard the smooth development of European flows when the Shanghai Agreement expires in 2008.
As far as footwear of Chinese origin is concerned, the Commission is called on to monitor imports closely, in order to prevent the risk of China's circumventing the already inadequate trade defence measures adopted by the Union.
China, as a trading policy power constitutes both a threat and an opportunity.
What we need to fight against are China's competitive advantages that derive from prohibitive import barriers, from unfair competition and from economic, ecological and social dumping practices.
The liberalisation of trade, which we enthusiastically support, should be based on reciprocity and accompanied by equivalent institutional counterbalances.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, based on the fundamental premise that relations between the European Union and China are of vital strategic importance in political terms, we have to ensure that our trade relations are governed by two principles, which have been very well expressed by the Commissioner: on the one hand we must invest in cooperation and, on the other, we must always keep up a very demanding attitude in our relations with China.
Our trade relations with China are extremely asymmetrical.
It is not just our more direct interests that are at stake, but also our essential values in terms of environmental protection, respect for employment rights and guaranteed protection for certain fundamental social issues.
In that context, we must establish a permanent debate on our cooperation efforts with this emerging great power, which is absolutely essential for keeping the international system in balance.
That is why we cannot close ourselves off from China.
Indeed, we cannot close ourselves off from a growing market that is opening up new opportunities for us, which, of course, we have to seize.
Here, too, we have to be demanding about the opening-up of those markets and about respect for intellectual property rights, for example.
At the same time, the European Union must adopt this highly demanding attitude in relation to fundamental issues concerning certain core principles of our model of economic, social and political organisation.
That, in fact, forces us to adopt the balanced position that I have mentioned (and I believe that the European Commission has been making efforts to do so by adopting the trade protection instruments that are available to us whenever we find that there is a real danger of Chinese exports threatening certain European industries, particularly footwear, clothing and textiles) and to be extremely demanding in the relations that we have to maintain with China in this area.
That, I believe, is the path we need to take, which must be based precisely on the fundamental idea that we cannot forgo having ever closer relations with China.
At the same time, we have to try to promote some of our values.
To conclude, I feel that we Europeans are in a very special position in the international context, in that our interests are to a great extent identified with our values.
Protecting our interests depends on promoting many of our values and, if we do manage to promote them, we shall certainly be defending our interests.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I feel it is appropriate to begin by expressing Europe's support for the flood victims in China.
Our fellow Member, Mr Markov, has raised an extremely important question, for which I would like to thank him on behalf of the Committee on International Trade.
The EU and China are two of the oldest cultures in the world.
On the one hand we have the largest trading bloc and on the other the fastest growing economy in humanity's history.
So this is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed outside the WTO: an issue that requires a bilateral approach and a bilateral agreement.
Both sides have a great deal at stake.
We should not allow ourselves to be pressurised by the USA.
So I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for refusing to adopt a common WTO strategy for dealing with China on the subject of pirate goods.
Both sides - China and the EU - have both interests and instruments to protect against and to allow abuses of intellectual property rights: anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures.
What matters is how we deal with one another - how we use those instruments.
The Commissioner has said that reciprocity is vital, and I would agree.
We Europeans benefit from the fact that China has adopted our continent-wide European patent laws wholesale.
That is a good thing.
But having the laws is not enough: the rights must be enforceable and they have to be enforced.
It is also in China's own interest to do so, though - you know that the Chinese company Heier will soon have an interest in protecting its own patents. Which proves that China does need this strategy.
What should we do in the meantime, though?
We are threatened with a very hostile scenario, whereby the Chinese apply for patents that are similar to ours, then close their market.
They have already proved that it can be done.
Thanks to the former President of the European Patent Office, Mr Pompidou, in around four years' time, China will actually have overtaken us in terms of the number of patents.
I think we should link the patent issue to the EU's climate protection targets.
That is right, with our climate protection targets!
Let me explain why: China is a win-win culture, a culture that strives to achieve harmony.
So I think that if we have something to offer, we may succeed.
China is currently experiencing massive environmental problems.
Social stability is threatened; the government is under great pressure because of huge environmental problems.
At both the IPPC Conference and the G8 summit, China indicated that it wants to work towards the climate protection targets.
Yet in many areas China lacks the technology.
So our offer could be that we will support a CO2-free coal-fired power plant with our technologies, as a gesture, but in return we can demand that our patent rights be respected.
Commissioner, you are on the right track.
Thank you very much for the information that you have provided today.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Commission has begun talks with China with a view to a new partnership and cooperation agreement, Parliament's Committee on International Trade feels a duty to draw the attention of the Community executive to some well-known issues, which characterise relations with the Asian giant.
China has a right to economic growth and development, which equates to well-being for its citizens, which also constitutes an opportunity for the world economy.
This should not take place, however, at the expense of compliance with the rules of international trade, of what has been agreed within legitimate forums and of what China accepted when it entered the WTO, otherwise the consequences for its economic partners, starting with Europe, could be disastrous, as they could for Chinese citizens themselves.
The talks with China are the most appropriate opportunity for tackling these issues bilaterally.
We need to find a way to tackle the issue of insufficient protection of human rights and inadequate environmental, social and safety standards.
Nobody is expecting China to achieve our levels, but to gradually achieve more acceptable standards.
We need to act as 'exporting fathers' to improve access to the European Union market by means of the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers and, more generally, of administrative obstacles of various kinds that very often discourage businesses, especially small ones, from investing in China, and we need to take a firmer position on combating counterfeiting.
The Chinese Government must do its part and show political will and take effective action to combat a phenomenon that concerns a large number of businesses, and especially consumers, worldwide.
Above all, food-related counterfeiting, which has recently been an increasing problem, deserves the greatest attention because it affects the health of ignorant and defenceless citizens who trust in the appearance of labels.
This battle against counterfeiting and forgery must involve both the European authorities and the Chinese Government.
On these three aspects we expect the Commission, in the course of the talks that Parliament will follow with the utmost attention, to adopt a firm approach that will lead to clear and unequivocal results for our entrepreneurs, our consumers and also for Chinese citizens, because by 'well-being' we mean not only European well-being but also the well-being of Chinese citizens.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Commissioner, the status of market economy is not yet within China's reach.
There are still too many irregularities in the bilateral trade relations for this.
The frequent violations of intellectual property, for example, spring to mind.
Commissioner, I have gleaned from your excellent intervention that following your meeting with Chinese Minister Bo Xilai on 12 June, the dialogue on intellectual property rights has been resumed.
This news has brought me great joy.
Moreover, I take the view - unlike my Liberal counterpart - that in matters such as these within a WTO context, the EU would do well to tag along with the United States straight away. After all, the United States remains our most important strategic ally.
Commissioner, I should actually, above all, like to draw your attention to another important aspect of our trade relations with China, namely the European export of secondary raw materials, such as used paper.
This is a huge issue at the moment.
Last weekend, the Dutch prominent press dedicated a large article to this very subject.
As you know, the new European rules for the export of these raw materials will enter into force in two days' time.
It is through the Commission's fault that no agreements have as yet been concluded with important countries such as China and India.
This means that, as from 12 July, used paper and other recyclable materials will become the most dangerous form of waste.
You will appreciate that this has major implications for the export of these products.
I would urge Commissioner Mandelson to promise this House a transitional provision that runs until 1 January 2008.
During this time, you will be able to conclude agreements with those countries with which there is nothing in place as yet.
With this, you will be able to prevent exports from grinding to a halt and these products from accruing in European ports, such as that of Rotterdam.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will really take action, because this is a matter that comes across to the Dutch public as very negative in terms of Europe.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we would agree that precisely because of the scale of EU's trade deficit with China, the European Union needs to be given much better market access opportunities, that the distortions created by Chinese State aids have to be reduced, and the Chinese Government needs to enforce WTO-standard intellectual property rights in the provinces as well.
We also need to work together to convince China that we are not just presenting a list of demands, but rather that it is in China's interest to allow fair market access.
We have to make China understand that if they want to lick their environment into shape, if they want to create an efficient energy supply - after all, China has plenty of money, there is no problem on that front - then we need to be given access to their public procurement market.
Then we will be able to sell our products in China in a sensible trade in goods, and China will be able to purchase modern coal-fired power stations and sewage plants and suchlike and make use of our technologies.
China does not need handouts, it has plenty of capital: it has the largest foreign currency reserves in the world.
China is currently setting up a fund to invest its money worldwide.
Our message to the Chinese Government should be: invest your money in your own country!
Do something for environmental protection and energy security, improve safety in the coalmines.
If we are successful, we will also be able to improve trade relations in the long term.
Of course, as you indicated, these agreements also contain a human rights clause because we have been discussing human rights with China for years; we must stand firm on that point.
As a previous speaker said, no one expects China to respect all human rights overnight, but we do need to see significant progress.
The People's Republic of China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights several years ago, but has not ratified it and does not apply it.
So we need to turn around and say: you chose to sign it, you said you wanted to uphold human rights, now do it!
(ES) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the information that you have given us and also for your work in favour of balanced relations that are beneficial to both parties.
I agree that China must not be seen just as a threat to certain sectors, but also as a great opportunity.
We also agree, however, that it must continue to make efforts to apply the agreements, to open up its markets and to create an open climate for investments.
As you have pointed out, European industry is still complaining that there are an excessive number of barriers and obstacles that put it at a competitive disadvantage.
In this regard, we are still talking about tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers, such as piracy, counterfeiting, discrimination between national and imported products and so on.
We therefore believe that opening up negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with China is a good initiative that must enable the European Union to strengthen its bilateral trade policy on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, which you yourself have mentioned.
We are delighted to agree that the issue of human rights should be one of the issues tackled within the negotiations on the agreement, of course.
Specifically, we must point out that the Chinese Government is making progress in this area and the rights recognised by the International Labour Organisation should also be taken into account, since they are a crucial aspect of human rights.
The agreement must also serve to continue promoting a commitment on the part of the Chinese authorities to effectively - not just theoretically - protect intellectual property rights through the adoption of relevant measures in the administrative, legal and border-control fields.
I would like to refer to the 'memorandum of understanding' between the European Union and China on trade for the textile and clothing sector, which expires this year.
There is concern in the textile industry about its expiry and about the fact that the conditions of the agreement between the United States and China are being extended until the end of 2008.
In view of this disparity, therefore, I would also like to ask you what measures can be taken to prevent situations of tension such as those which took place in 2005.
(PL) - Mr President, once again this forum is discussing trade relations with China, which has over the past decade emerged as a world economic and political power.
In October last year, the European Commission approved a programme for EU-China relations, which entailed an increase in mutual undertakings.
In this situation, it would be sensible to support changes for greater openness and pluralism in China, as well as cooperation on energy and climate change because we know that China is one of the world's major producers of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, we must not forget about the alarm that was caused when thousands of tubes of counterfeit toothpaste, some of them manufactured in China, were discovered in Spain, and containing doses of toxic diethylene glycol far in excess of European standards.
China means cheaper goods in European shops and greater competition, but is it always healthy?
I am in favour of making the best of the opportunities offered by the dynamic development of relations with China, especially following my visit there, when I was able to see first hand this fast-developing world power.
The Commission says that a strong Chinese economy is in the economic interests of Europe, and rightly so.
However, we should not forget to look after the interests of the members of the Community above all, and to assess the opportunities but also the threats that cooperation with this Asian tiger poses through the prism of these interests.
(SV) I am convinced that fear of China's economic growth really is exaggerated.
I believe that those who have a sufficiently long historical perspective on trade policy recognise a good deal of the disquiet and a good many of the arguments from the debate about the incorporation into the world economy of Japan and of other Asiatic tigers (such as Korea and Taiwan).
Certainly, it is easy to allow oneself to be frightened by the relative size of the countries concerned.
As the Commissioner pointed out, however, their economies supplement Europe's economy, and their size is, rather, a great opportunity for Europe.
I am convinced that the strong and sustained growth and the boom being experienced in the world right now is due in large part to the fact that China, India and other large countries in the world are in the process of being incorporated into the world economy.
That does not, however, mean that there are no problems in trade relations.
I believe that we have many important problems to get to grips with, for example infringements of copyright and issues concerning intellectual property rights, as well as Chinese markets closed to everything from financial services to car parts.
I am almost more concerned, however, about the protectionist tendencies to which China's growth is giving rise in Europe.
Not that I believe the Commissioner to be in favour of such tendencies, but there are many voices that are now demanding more trade barriers in order to stop imports from China.
Talk of stopping, for example, Chinese textile exports has been heard in this House in the course of this evening.
I am convinced that the European trade barriers against China cost European consumers and European companies more money than do imports of Chinese goods.
We should, therefore, continue to combat European trade barriers rather than Chinese exports.
The fact is that China's growing prosperity, together with trade with China, not only give thousands or millions or, indeed, hundreds of millions of Chinese people richer and more dignified lives; they also make Europe richer.
We must not forget that trade is never a zero sum game.
We are both winners.
(ES) Mr President, allow me to begin by saying something that is said so often at these night sittings, which is that we are discussing such an important issue amongst such a select band that I have the impression that we do not even have a representative from the Chinese Embassy present at this sitting.
I am entirely confident that the verbatim reports of debates that Parliament's services produce so efficiently will enable them to read what we are saying.
If I am to follow on from the previous speech, I must draw a conclusion: the globalisation that we are currently seeing would be unimaginable without the explosion of China.
China's presence on the world market has simply been a decisive and unquestionable reality, but a very recent one let us not forget.
The explosion of China, which has been direct and immense in the case of production, will be even more so in the case of consumption and also in distribution at world level, becoming one of the main determining factors of both elements.
But neither must we forget that the quantity and characteristics of Chinese goods, largely defined by the profile of its workforce, its internal market, limited in income terms but incomparable in absolute quantity terms, and, more recently, its investment capacity, make China a great supply and demand power.
However, as a wonderful article today by our fellow Member Mr Martin points out, China is a key factor in the success or failure of many international negotiations, including that of the recent G4 meeting.
Can our approach to relations with China be simply to say that everything is a free-for-all, that is to say, all doors are open to what we send and what we may receive?
I believe not.
We must do it in a regulated manner and, furthermore, we must demand clear reciprocity, the removal of barriers to access for European products, adequate protection of intellectual property rights and patents, full respect for the standards required in social terms - which I believe to be crucial - and equal respect for environmental and safety criteria for goods produced in China.
And of course we must not forget human rights.
We are not just talking about values in metaphysical terms.
We are talking about rights applicable to people, to citizens like ourselves.
We are talking about values that are quite simply beyond dispute and which cannot be treated in relative terms.
Just today more people have been executed in China, and that is the most serious violation of human rights imaginable.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for a very clear and convincing message and I see that we share the same concerns.
Ten months ago this Parliament decided that trade relations with China require reciprocal market access, which has to be founded on the WTO rules, fair competition and a reasonable balance of interests.
The 'round' situation, sadly, does not match those expectations today.
We are worried about the increasing trade deficit with China.
We are worried about the fact that 70% of all counterfeit products on the European markets originate from China and that EU industries are suffering extensive damage as a result of unfair competition and social dumping.
At the same time, many EU exporters are handicapped when trying to enter Chinese markets.
Therefore, the EU representatives should insist first of all on providing legal security for foreign companies in China.
I agree with the Commissioner that imbalance in the relationship is mainly a product of politics and not economics.
The widespread use of slave labour, including children, is an extremely alarming problem that should be addressed at the highest possible level.
The recent cases exposed are only the tip of an iceberg.
China has now been a member of the WTO for six years but it has not implemented significant WTO commitments, including protection of intellectual property, national treatment and transparency.
I still see leverage to create a fair and reciprocal balance of relations in linking firmly China's request for market economy status with Peking fully meeting its WTO commitments.
Lastly, China is to be seen as a sobering example, bearing in mind Russia's impending WTO membership.
As far as we would be hesitant about insisting on reciprocity and meeting commitments, it would be unrealistic to hope that EU support for Russia's membership will make Mr Putin's state behave according to the WTO rules.
(HU) Two weeks ago, 20 Members of the European Parliament went to China, and their trip there confirmed that the picture is much more complex and nuanced than what we have available to us here.
I agree fully with Mr Fjellner that the 21st century could be China's century, and that for the European Union this represents an enormous challenge and an enormous opportunity.
There is very great asymmetry not only in trade, but also in the fact that the Chinese are much more familiar with the European Union than we in the European Union are with China.
The picture is much more nuanced, be that in terms of human rights or on other questions.
This is an enormous competitive disadvantage for us.
The problem is not only that we do not know the Mandarin Chinese language, but that they know the English and European languages much better - this is an enormous asymmetry.
We need to overcome this, for if we do not make changes to this situation, we will not progress in excellence.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, bearing in mind your probable desire for this House to rise before midnight, I would just like to say that overwhelmingly the contributions to this debate have been very balanced and very realistic.
I think that Mr Calabuig Rull and Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez, for example, made appropriate observations in stressing the fact that China is an opportunity for Europe, as well as a threat.
Another appropriate observation was that of Mr Fjellner that we need to take the longer-term political view in our relations with China, but he also referred to the growth of protectionism, of a sort of Chinese nationalism which is becoming more prominent in China's trade practices.
My view is that China's nationalism does not sit comfortably with the enormous benefits that it is deriving from the internationalist trading system that is based on reciprocity.
Without reciprocity China will not be able to expect in the future the continued goodwill and balanced approach that it has been receiving from Europe.
The fact is that China is falling below our expectations.
It is not that it is failing to comply with or implement all its WTO obligations and commitments, because in many respects it is.
But in certain other key areas of economic activity in China, in financial and other services, it is failing to implement fully the commitments that it made upon its accession to the WTO.
One or two concerns have been expressed about textiles.
This House will recall that in 2005 I negotiated a voluntary agreement with China that gave European industry an extra period of two-and-a-half years to restructure and to adapt to the new global situation in the textile sector.
It was a once-and-for-all, bilaterally concluded agreement and the Commission therefore has no means simply to seek an extension of the agreed levels that have been operating beyond the beginning of 2008.
However, I will be putting in place means to monitor and to keep under surveillance any sudden and large-scale changes in imports of Chinese textiles that threaten to disrupt our market in Europe, and I will consider what, if any, action I can take in the light of disturbances to our market.
This is quite distinct from the use of trade defence instruments.
The textiles agreement was based on fair trade. It was not unfair trade.
It was just a disturbance that we were unable to take on on such a scale at this time.
In other respects, the use of TDI is not against China's natural competitive advantage but against unfair competition, and we will retain the right and the full use of our trade defence instruments and employ them as and when necessary.
In conclusion, others have referred to the need for China to consciously build up the standards it operates in relation to social, labour and environmental standards.
That will always be a feature of the discussions that I undertake with Chinese officials.
I am personally very committed to growing technology transfer with China on climate change projects. This is a key way to ensure Chinese interest in tackling climate change.
It is a win-win situation.
The EU can export energy-efficient, clean technology and China can make a contribution to tackling its environmental problems.
This is at the heart of our dialogue with China on climate change and it is something in the trade realm that I intend to build up in the future.
That concludes my remarks in response to this debate, which I greatly welcome.
As I say, it has been very balanced, and I will certainly ensure that I and my services take into account fully the remarks and observations that have been made by Members of this House this evening.
Mr President, I asked the Commissioner a very clear question: at the moment there is unrest in my country, a big news report on a mission of the Commission agreeing to the export of so-called secondary resources such as old paper, recycling material, etc.
What are you going to do, Commissioner?
I ask you to conclude agreements with countries such as China and India and pause until 1 January 2008, because otherwise there is a standstill in exports in harbours like Rotterdam.
I asked you what you were going to do.
I did not get an answer.
I hope you forgot it.
Member of the Commission. I think in the circumstances and in view of the time, it might be better if I gave the Member a written response to his question.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last serious and very recent case of widely-consumed counterfeited goods - a toothpaste containing antifreeze, sold on the European market and produced in China - brings back into the limelight the problem of combating 'multinational forgery'.
It is in this large Asian country, where de facto slavery is permitted for workers deprived of any sort of protection, that most of the products of the counterfeiting industry are concentrated - medicines, cosmetics and food products, as well as toys and items of clothing containing carcinogenic chemical substances that are strictly prohibited in the European Union.
Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon that, while until a few years ago was restricted to high-end products (luxury lotions, perfumes, watches and bags), is now expanding to include products within the reach of an ever-growing number of users, leading to a high risk for consumer health.
Today, more than ever, it is necessary for the political and industrial West to adopt a strong position towards powerful, wealthy China.
On the one hand, we need to step up coordination between the Member States in inspections of imported products and, on the other hand, we need to persuade the Chinese Government to apply wide-scale, very strict on-the-ground, checks in order to protect European industry from unfair competition resulting partly from counterfeiting and piracy.

Presentation of the programme of the Portuguese presidency (debate)
I am delighted to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, the Portuguese Prime Minister, JosÃ© SÃ³crates, to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
As always, it is also a pleasure to have the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, with us.
(Applause)
As you can tell from the names, this is a very special line-up.
Portugal is at the centre of the European Union.
It is a great pleasure to invite the President-in-Office of the European Council, Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates, to take the floor.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Mr President - my dear Mr Poettering, my dear Mr Barroso, honourable Members, at the start of the half-year of the Portuguese Presidency, in the presence of the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Europe, I would like to reaffirm the main guiding principle of this Presidency: the construction of a stronger Europe for a better world.
To this end, we make a clear commitment: we will do everything possible to transcend the period of doubts and uncertainties as to the course the European project should follow.
We should like to ask all Members here, in the seat of European democracy, to support us in that common objective.
It is well known that Portugal was not a founder Member State of the European Communities.
However, when we restored democracy in our country, in 1974, after 48 years under an authoritarian regime, our principal objective was to join the European Communities, as they were known at the time.
We achieved that objective in 1986.
On assuming the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the third time, I would like to reassure you of the Portuguese Government's determination and its commitment towards promoting and strengthening the values of peace, freedom, solidarity and prosperity that inspired the founder Members in 1957; those values which we, now 27 Member States and almost 500 million citizens, reaffirmed last March in Berlin.
I am confident, honourable Members, that this half-year will see us emerge from the deadlocks and obstructions that have been holding up the European project for too long.
The example of the European project is motivating many peoples and countries in various parts of the world, who are the first to ask the European Union to play a more active role in world affairs, and they have difficulty in understanding our hesitations.
I have always considered, and continue to consider, the European project as one of the noblest and most vital political projects of our times.
The construction of Europe is important for the European economy, for the promotion of European values and for European citizens.
Yet the construction of Europe is an equally important factor in meeting global challenges, taking advantage of the opportunities of these times of change and building a fairer, more stable and more developed world.
It is not only the people of Europe who need a strong Europe; the world also needs a Europe with a proactive voice.
Mr President, honourable Members, I think you will agree with me that the success of a Presidency always depends on the clarity of its programme.
Our priorities for the next six months are clearly defined: the reform of the Treaties, an agenda for modernising Europe's economies and societies and the strengthening of the role of Europe in the world.
The biggest challenge, of course, lies in pursuing the process of reforming the Treaties, on the basis of the mandate adopted at the last European Council.
I have pleasure in commending to you the merits of the strategy and negotiations conducted by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, whom we have consistently supported throughout the last six months.
I would also like to acknowledge with gratitude the clear positions adopted by Parliament in the Resolution it adopted on the basis of the BarÃ³n Crespo-Brok report, which led to an agreement which was reached between the Member States that preserved the core objectives of the Constitutional Treaty and which incorporated the signals given by the French and Dutch referendums.
The progress that was made at the last Europe Council was only possible as a result of the impetus it was given by the European Parliament, which has always maintained a strong, consistent and constructive position in that respect, and never resigned itself to the deadlock at the time.
The agreement reached at the 21 and 22 June European Council took the form of a clear and precise mandate, as Portugal has always considered necessary.
We are now in a position to move forward.
I would like to make it clear to Parliament that there is one point on which I have no doubts. The decisive moment was in October 2006 when the Heads of State or Government of the three countries that made up the trio of Presidencies - Germany, Portugal and Slovenia - agreed to prioritise the resolution of the institutional impasse in their programme.
At that time, in October 2006, there were few who believed that such an objective was possible.
The fact is that that objective is now within our reach.
We therefore approach that task with confidence and should now complete it by transforming the mandate into a new Treaty.
I know we are facing a difficult and demanding process of negotiation and reaching agreement.
I am naturally prepared for the problems that always arise, especially in the final stages of negotiating processes.
I know, however, that we can do it.
One thing is clear to me: our mandate is not to change the mandate. Our mandate is to transform that mandate into a Treaty.
The mandate, furthermore, is clear.
It is clear as to which parts of the previous Constitutional Treaty must be abandoned, as to what should be retained in the Reforming Treaty and as to what innovative new aspects should be added to the Treaty of Nice.
The best thing we can do, honourable Members, is to take advantage of the political momentum.
We have to move quickly.
This is why I decided to open the Intergovernmental Conference on 23 July, separately from the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
On the same day, we will be distributing a draft Treaty drawn up on the basis of the detailed instructions in the mandate.
In the course of the same week we shall be holding meetings with legal experts to examine the text and identify any potential difficulties.
The informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on 7 and 8 September will be used to take stock of how this is progressing.
We intend to play an active role in ensuring that agreement on the Treaty can be reached during the informal European Council in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October.
That is our objective and I think you will agree with me that this timetable is closest to the spirit and desire of all the European institutions and also the one that will best serve the interests of the Union.
I am relying on the European Parliament to achieve that objective.
That, furthermore, is why I have argued that Parliament should have three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference, and not two as on previous occasions, thus ensuring greater representation for this House.
For the same reason, moreover, I am also going to propose that, whenever the Intergovernmental Conference is attended by Heads of State or Government, Parliament be represented by its President.
I know I can rely on all the institutions to contribute.
I am grateful to the European Commission and the Central European Bank for issuing their opinions promptly.
I am grateful to Parliament for its efforts in ensuring that its opinion could also be adopted today, thus fulfilling the necessary conditions to enable the Intergovernmental Conference to begin this month as well.
I know I can rely on the willingness and commitment of all the Member States.
This is a moment of convergence when all the institutions come together so that a prompt decision on the Treaty can provide a clear sign of Europe's confidence and determination to make progress in its project.
Madam President, honourable Members, the reform of the Treaties is still only one of the tasks facing the Union in the next six months and I should like, if I may, to take a few minutes to talk to you about some other extremely important issues within the Union.
Apart from institutional matters, the citizens of Europe are demanding answers to questions that directly relate to their everyday lives, in which they recognise that Europe must produce practical results that make a difference and help improve their living conditions.
I believe no one is in any doubt that Europe must invest further in modernisation.
Just over seven years ago, AntÃ³nio Guterres, then Prime Minister of Portugal, came to this House to present the Lisbon Strategy.
Up to now, that Strategy has been the road map for the modernisation of the European economy and society.
I therefore have particular pleasure in telling you that the 'Lisbon Strategy' will once again be at the heart of our plans.
The strategy defined in 2000 with a view to strengthening competitiveness and social cohesion, by investing in knowledge and innovation, is still the right way forward and still has the support of the main European political forces.
What we shall be doing is actively to contribute to a new round of the Lisbon agenda, which will be adopted in the spring of 2008 during the Slovenian Presidency.
We shall prepare for that new round by maintaining the balance between the three components of that agenda, namely the economic, social and environmental components.
The review of the internal market will enable us to place the accent on the business competitiveness, on opening up the markets, on eliminating context costs, and on the role the cultural industries can pay in terms of job creation, economic growth and innovation.
The next half-year will also be particularly relevant as regards political, energy and environmental options, and, on those matters, Europe can have only one objective: to continue to take the lead in environmental issues and, in particular, in the fight against climate change.
We shall therefore meet the objectives of promoting the debate on a technological plan of action for energy and the environment, and will emphasise the role of biofuels, particularly in the context of the report that emerged from the first summit meeting between the European Union and Brazil.
We wish to give the social dimension of the 'Lisbon Strategy' the visibility and relevance it deserves.
Ten years after the launch of the 'European Employment Strategy', it seems essential to us to encourage a debate on the best ways of coordinating employment policies, with a view to boosting the creation of sustainable jobs in a context of global competition.
This line of action pursued by the Portuguese Presidency will be closely linked with the training of human resources, the reconciliation of work and family life and the fight against poverty and exclusion.
The European social model, with its well-known diversity, requires us to reflect together on the sustainability of pension and retirement systems, and also to identify the reforms that are necessary in the labour markets and systems of protection against social risks.
In that context, the aim of our debate on so-called 'flexicurity' should be to find integrated and balanced solutions, which should be reflected in general shared principles at European level that take account of the diverse social conditions in the various Member States.
Honourable Members, for the Portuguese Presidency, one of the basic core values of the European project lies in the interface between freedom and security.
In that context, one of the Presidency's priorities will be to strengthen police and judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and crime.
Terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to international peace and security.
Democracies are not afraid of terrorism and know how to stand firm in the face of that threat.
If there is a good example of that firmness it was provided last week by the British Government, to which I should like to pass on a message of solidarity from all the countries in the Union.
The fight against terrorism must therefore remain a common objective for all the Member States, because only European cooperation will make it possible to prevent, protect ourselves against and combat terrorism.
The Portuguese Presidency will work to implement ongoing initiatives under the EU strategy against terrorism, the action plan to combat terrorism and the continued implementation of the strategy to prevent the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, which will be reviewed during the next six months.
We therefore consider it urgent to find a replacement for Mr De Vries and define the resources and the mandate that will enable his replacement to perform his or her duties effectively.
Honourable Members, history has taught us that there is no freedom without security.
This is why the Union's security policy is also essential in order to preserve the open and tolerant nature of European societies.
It is therefore a source of pride for me to say that it was Portugal that suggested, and it was also a Portuguese company that designed SIS-ONE4ALL, the technological solution whereby the new Member States could become full members of the Schengen area and whereby borders with those countries are to disappear at the end of the Portuguese Presidency.
We shall thus fulfil one of the greatest wishes of those citizens: freedom of movement of persons in Union territory.
Honourable Members, I should also like to say a few words about immigration policy.
We shall give special attention to this issue during our Presidency.
Europe today is an area that welcomes millions of immigrants who live, work and bring up their children here, and whose contribution is essential to European economic growth.
We must therefore draw up a European immigration policy based on prevention of illegal immigration, but also one of including and integrating legal immigrants and of effective cooperation with their countries of origin, one that can regulate migratory flows to our mutual benefit.
Only a policy effective in both the country of origin and the country of destination, one that addresses both the causes and the effects, will be capable of dealing with the scale of the phenomenon in a manner compatible with our values and responsibilities.
Mr President, honourable Members, the current international situation is creating special responsibilities for the European Union and I should now like to speak to you about the European Union foreign policy agenda under the Portuguese Presidency.
The citizens of Europe are unequivocal in their demand for us to take an active role on the international stage, based on the values of international law, mutual respect, dialogue and cooperation.
Similarly the international community expects the Union to play a committed and consistent role in major international affairs.
In the second half of 2007, there are decisions on delicate world issues that cannot be put off - the future of Kosovo, the nuclear dossier on Iran, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.
There is to be a series of especially important bilateral summits, with India, China, Russia and Ukraine.
Relations with the United States, in the context defined by the Washington Summit, which took place under the German Presidency, will be monitored as closely as one would expect of such strategically important relations.
In all cases, we will be equal to our responsibilities as holders of the Presidency, and will work closely with Javier Solana, High Representative for External Policy, and the European Commission.
I should like to draw your attention to three initiatives with which we are closely linked and which deserve special emphasis: the EU-Brazil Summit, which has already taken place, the EU-Africa Summit and Euro-Med meetings.
In this first week of the Presidency, we have already held the Summit with Brazil with the aim of moving relations to a higher level of mutual understanding and close cooperation, at all levels.
This initiative is particularly dear to the Portuguese, as we share our language and much of our culture and history with Brazil.
We are seeking to create the political conditions whereby, as is happening with other emerging economic powers, a formal relationship of mutual benefit to Europe and Brazil may be created, which will in turn help us achieve the kind of relations we should like to enjoy with Latin America as a whole.
Closer ties with Brazil will also bring practical results in terms of our response to global challenges.
Last week's summit with President Lula has also made it possible to keep open a window of opportunity, which we must now make the most of in the Doha Round negotiations, and we shall do everything possible to support the European Commission in that context.
I am among those who take the view that the Doha Round negotiations represent an important factor in regulating globalisation and that the conclusion of the negotiations will be highly positive.
This should continue to be a priority for the European institutions.
The EUROMED ministerial meetings form part of a series of negotiations, including what are known as the Barcelona Process and the New Neighbourhood Policy.
These meetings serve to highlight the importance we attach to reviving the crucial political debate with our partners to the south of the Mediterranean.
We share common concerns and are facing challenges relating to development and social cohesion that emphasise the growing interdependence of the two sides of the Mediterranean, and we are convinced that we can help overcome certain obstacles in essential areas such as the management of migratory flows and the potential contribution of diasporas to their countries of origin, with the support and commitment of the European countries and the relevant international institutions.
Finally, we propose to hold a second EU-Africa Summit, having been behind the previous Summit in Cairo in 2000, which, as you will recall, took place under a Portuguese Presidency.
Without overlooking certain difficulties that will have to be overcome, we are convinced that there is no justification for the fact that no meeting of this kind has been held at the highest level for more than seven years, when it comes to two continents with such close historical ties and that are so interdependent in today's world.
Portugal is in a particularly good position to take on this responsibility and is very much counting on the African Union and all European and African countries to ensure that this Summit offers a chance to revive dialogue and cooperation on matters of the greatest common interest.
We shall therefore take on the task of defining a new strategic partnership between the European Union and Africa aimed at sustainable development, ensuring peace, fighting endemic diseases and maintaining a balanced partnership in the management of migratory flows, to our mutual benefit.
Mr President, honourable Members, this is our agenda, which I have briefly described to you.
I am aware that we are holding the Presidency at a time when the international situation is extremely delicate and that we have been ambitious in the definition of our own objectives.
We know that Presidencies on their own do not resolve all the problems that arise, but we also know that we can make a difference if we adopt clear objectives, if we are humble in the way we pursue them and if we demonstrate the will to reach the necessary consensus.
Many European philosophers define today's world with the prefix 'post' - post-democratic, post-modern or post-industrial - it is for them a 'post' world.
All that this concept really means is that we are living in a world of change, accelerated change, and we do not yet fully understand what we see happening.
Amidst all these uncertainties and unknown factors, however, we believe one thing is certain: in a changing world the worst mistake is to stand still.
That is a mistake that Europe must not make.
Honourable Members, our firm proposal is to ensure that Europe does not stand still and to advance the European project in the cause of creating a better world.
(Applause)
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for the presentation of your programme.
The applause shows how well it has been received here in the European Parliament.
Above all, we would like to thank you for making it clear that the European Parliament will be represented at all levels of the Intergovernmental Conference.
You personally have always supported that approach, which guarantees that the European Parliament will be able to give its approval to convening an Intergovernmental Conference.
We in the European Parliament also have great expectations for our work with the Council General Secretariat.
I would now like to invite the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, to address the House.
President of the Commission. (PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, I should like first of all to extend a very special greeting to the Prime Minister of Portugal at the start of the Portuguese Presidency.
The programme outlined for the Portuguese Presidency is ambitious and demanding, and the Intergovernmental Conference will naturally occupy a prominent place, particularly until the European Council meeting in October, but the Portuguese Presidency involves more than the very important issue of the Treaty.
Other tough assignments include foreign relations, with important summit meetings being held with many of our partners, the relaunched Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Employment, and innovation.
Yesterday the Commission adopted its opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).
As I have already stated in this House, the IGC about to begin will be of a very different kind from its predecessors.
Thanks to the work that has already been done, to the efforts, in particular of the German Presidency, which I would also like to commend, and to the fact that we have been able to make such clear progress, we can say that the degree of detail in this mandate is unprecedented.
Never has an IGC begun with such a precise mandate.
In certain areas, in fact, that mandate adopts the wording of the 2004 IGC, while in others it uses highly-developed legal and technical language.
As a result of that degree of precision, we can now say that the central question is no longer about its political substance, since that was essentially resolved when we met in the European Council, but rather about keeping faithfully to the content of the mandate.
We therefore need to be clear on this.
I want to make the position of the Commission clear: we fully support the mandate and consider that the issue does not need to be discussed again.
The crux of the matter, as Mr SÃ³crates has told us, is to transform the mandate into a Treaty.
It is not to create a new mandate.
That would be very much a backward step, and in my view, it would be inconceivable for us to go back on what has unanimously been agreed.
It would be a sign of a serious lack of confidence if we were now to try to renegotiate a mandate to which everyone has agreed.
It is impossible to build a strong Europe without confidence in the value of the commitments we have made.
It is also true that, from the Commission's point of view, the mandate is neither ideal nor perfect.
On many points we would have been more ambitious.
Nobody finds the mandate absolutely ideal, and that is how the European project works and has always worked.
Since 1957, our integration project has always moved forward by means of political compromise and not with ideal solutions.
That is once again how it will be.
Nor should we forget that the agreement we reached at the European Council was hard won, based as it was on a delicate political compromise.
Our responsibility is to maintain that compromise at the IGC, all the way to final ratification.
The Commission fully supports the Portuguese Presidency's intention to hold a short, condensed IGC.
It will begin on 23 July and, if all goes well, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure that it does, it may be concluded at the informal European Council in October.
The Commission does, however, reserve the right to express its opinion on positions and proposals of governments of Member States during the IGC and, in particular, we shall be vigilant to ensure that the mandate is duly fulfilled.
We think it is our duty to do so.
Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, as we have already mentioned, the Portuguese Presidency goes beyond this vital matter of the Treaty and I am pleased to note that the Prime Minister and President of the Council intends to give particular attention to the Lisbon Strategy.
The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment, which we collectively relaunched in 2005, is now producing some quite encouraging results.
Unemployment in the European Union has fallen from 10% in the mid-nineties to 7% last June.
Our analyses prove that structural unemployment is also falling, which is fairly encouraging for Europe in the medium and long term.
Our data also show that there has been a 50% increase in women's employment.
These figures are most welcome in a Europe we want to make more competitive, fairer and more inclusive.
Economic growth has also reached its highest levels since 2000, in a context of the higher potential and growth of the European economy, which leads us to believe that the recent growth is structural and not merely cyclical.
It is fair to say that this progress is largely due to the reforms inspired by the relaunched Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Employment.
The fact is that, by giving the various governments of the Member States a common reform framework, Europe is facilitating, supporting and strengthening precisely that movement to reform which, admittedly at varying speeds and with different scopes, all European governments have been implementing in one way or another.
It is therefore appropriate to emphasise here that the much-maligned Lisbon Strategy is a crucial factor in the economic and social modernisation of Europe.
The fact is, however, that there is no room for complacency.
There is still a lot to do to make the European economy more competitive and European society fairer.
In particular, we must increase the contribution of innovation to economic growth.
I know this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency and this is something I applaud.
Innovation is the driving force behind the triumvirate of the Energy Technology Plan, the European Technology Institute and the first Innovation and Technology Community, which we intend to see specifically targeted at energy issues and the fight against climate change, and which we hope will be launched during the Portuguese Presidency.
This is the clearest example that the relaunched Lisbon Strategy is seeking to connect the different aspects, such as this key central aspect of the fight against climate change and energy security.
To achieve success in that area, we must do more in the field of innovation and that is why I am pleased to note that the Portuguese Presidency intends to include innovation as an essential topic at the December European Council.
Education, scientific research and innovation are essential elements of the European society we want to build in response to the most pressing concerns and challenges posed by this new century.
To achieve the objectives we have set in the context of European energy and climate policy, we have prepared an ambitious and consistent strategy to ensure sustainability, security of supply and European competitiveness.
It should be emphasised, however, that for the success of that strategy we must warmly applaud the conclusions of the March European Council, which mark a turning point in the history of energy and the fight against climate change.
In order to achieve results now we must step up our efforts in the areas of scientific research, technological development and innovation.
The technological plan in the area of clean energy technologies is a cornerstone of that strategy.
The creation of the European Institute of Technology, which is now so well received in the European Parliament, also constitutes an essential means of increasing European competitiveness by mobilising efforts on a European scale and better liaison between knowledge and innovation.
Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commission states in the opinion we adopted yesterday, the reforming Treaty will reinforce the capacity for action of the Union in external relations, which is highly symbolic: two of the central pillars of the Portuguese Presidency are institutional reform and the Union's external relations. The active cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission in this latter field is obvious.
Last week, Mr SÃ³crates and I myself went to the final session of the African Union Summit in Accra, and on the following day we attended the first EU-Brazil Summit.
With Brazil, our latest strategic partner, we share an ambitious agenda that includes energy, mainly biofuels, which we want to be sustainable, the fight against climate change, and trade relations.
In the case of international trade, we have made a very strong appeal to President Lula to reach an agreement at the Doha negotiations.
The Commission emphasises the commercial importance of Doha because trade drives economic growth and development.
Trade has lifted millions out of poverty in Asia and it can go on doing so, not only in the Asian countries, but also in South America and Africa.
International trade must, however, be based on multilateral rules and institutions and the European Union has a vital role to play in the consolidation of international rules and governance.
Doha is therefore an essential issue.
It has to do not only with trade, although trade is important in itself; it has to do with our multilateral vision.
We cannot actively support multilateralism and then defend unilateralism when it comes to trade.
We also need to make progress on this matter because it is not only an agenda for trade, it is an agenda for social development, an agenda that can strengthen our links with developing countries.
In the case of Africa, the strategic partnership between Europe and Africa is also essential for international stability.
The EU is the main source of financial, economic and technical aid for Africa.
Europe is the major trading partner of the African continent, importing more than all the other G8 countries.
From the beginning of its mandate, the Commission I have the honour of chairing has made relations with Africa one of its most urgent priorities.
For example, the Commission has opened its first EU history college outside Europe in Addis Ababa, where we held a working meeting with the Commission of the African Union.
Yet there is still much to be done in relations between Europeans and Africans.
The imminent EU-Africa Summit, to be held under the Portuguese Presidency, is a unique opportunity to set an ambitious agenda, including practical issues such as energy, migration, the fight against climate change and, obviously, democracy and human rights. We have a duty to talk with our African partners about issues of democracy, human rights and governance.
We have talked with the rest of the world, it would be incomprehensible for us not to talk with Africa.
There are, admittedly, certain political and diplomatic problems to be resolved, but those problems, the relevance of which we have to acknowledge, cannot and must not become obstacles to an essential strategic partnership for the future of globalisation.
Africa and Europe must work together.
I have said more than once that the EU has a mission for the 21st century, namely the promotion of justice, freedom and solidarity throughout the world.
The EU cannot and must not be a group of countries dedicated to looking inwards.
It can and must be a force for reform and stability in the world, and for the defence of European interests and the promotion of European values.
We are a community of values, particularly the values of freedom and solidarity.
The African continent is undoubtedly a region that needs our support and commitment.
The European Union cannot close its eyes to the drama that is being acted out so close to it.
Before I finish, I should like to wish the Portuguese Government every success and reaffirm the Commission's absolute willingness to work with the Presidency.
I may say that I have total confidence in the ability of Portugal - a country that has proved its commitment to Europe - of the Portuguese Government and authorities, and of all the country's political forces to work for Europe.
We share with the Portuguese Presidency the excellent slogan it has chosen for this period: a stronger Europe for a better world.
Together we shall succeed in working to this end.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr SÃ³crates, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes the Portuguese Presidency's ambitious motto: 'A stronger Union for a better world'.
By making its will to build central to its mandate, the Portuguese Presidency is following the German Presidency's lead.
And by capitalising on the dynamism of Mrs Merkel's achievements, you will show, Mr SÃ³crates, that a Presidency's success depends on its having a strong political will and a strategy of convergence on ambitious, but realistic, priorities.
Your success will also depend on your cooperating with this Parliament.
Involve us very closely in your work and your decision-making.
As far as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is concerned, institutional reform, the security of our fellow citizens, the pursuit of the internal market and the consolidation of growth are the crucial aspects of your Presidency.
The agreement reached on 21 and 22 June takes up the bulk of the advances contained in the previous text.
If the Member States ratify it by spring 2009, Europe will finally be able to make effective, transparent and democratic decisions in areas such as security, growth, energy, climate change and demographics.
Going back on the commitments made would be to regard the European Union as a house of cards: one card fewer and the whole house collapses.
As far as our group - and in particular Mr Brok who will represent it - are concerned, the Intergovernmental Conference must be devoted to the legal finalisation of the revised treaties and should be concluded, as you wish, Mr SÃ³crates, in time for the European Council in the autumn.
Mr SÃ³crates, while a stronger Union for a better world motivates your work, you cannot overlook the security of our fellow citizens, and you have spoken of this matter at length this morning.
The terrorist acts in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe and the breaking of the ceasefire by ETA worry us and call for Europe-wide anti-terrorist coordination.
Mr SÃ³crates, I am aware of the Member States' reluctance to cooperate in this area.
The 'every man for himself' principle must be eradicated; it is the security of the people of Europe that must prevail.
Faced with international crime, terrorist cells, the complexity of the networks and the sophistication of the methods used, not least regarding migration, we are in danger of being caught up and we have a duty to act immediately.
The vacancy of the post of EU anti-terrorist coordinator is unacceptable.
Thank you for your commitment.
Mr SÃ³crates, let us show the same determination on the subject of our security as we do on climate change and energy.
The victims of the terrorist attacks require us to stand united.
Under your leadership, we expect more cohesion and the Member States to be more involved in an effective anti-terror coordination model.
With regard to the other priorities such as the pursuit of the internal market and the consolidation of growth, our fellow citizens will only adhere to the European ideal if they can see that our social model, the free movement not only of persons, goods and capital, but also of services, and the promotion of education, training and innovation, are reflected in so many tangible improvements in their everyday lives.
Becoming the world's most advanced economic area means having political will and courage.
Portugal dared to have the Lisbon Strategy.
The opportunity has been given to it to provide the best 'after-sales' service.
We value both the social and the economic dimension of European integration.
Mr SÃ³crates, we hope, like you do, that progress will be made with Africa on migration issues and that our links with Brazil and the emerging countries will be strengthened.
Like you, too, we regard transatlantic relations as one of our priorities.
Over the last few months our partnership has taken a big step forward in quality terms; it must now make progress.
Firm positions in terms of respect for our values and ongoing dialogue must govern our neighbourhood relations with the Balkans, Ukraine, Belarus and, of course, Russia.
Mr SÃ³crates, the PPE-DE Group wishes you every success with this stronger Union for a better world that you so earnestly desire.
We will support you when it comes to defending the values of peace and solidarity, courage and responsibility.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, almost exactly one year ago, on 1 July last year, there was an excellent football match that Portugal won in a penalty shootout after extra time.
It was a remarkable game.
The Portuguese kept their nerve and every penalty went in.
The ball is now in position for our penalty shot.
You have said everything there is to say about the Intergovernmental Conference.
Now you need to get the ball in the net.
From this morning's speech, I suspect that your nerves are as steely as those of the Portuguese football team.
If you score this time, in October you will win the trophy.
(Applause)
We are realists, Prime Minister SÃ³crates: there is not as much in the mandate as we might have hoped, but we accept that no more could have been achieved in the negotiations.
However, there is a good deal in the mandate.
You need to make it clear to all participants in the Intergovernmental Conference that there can be no going back on what has been agreed.
I have a comment to make to my fellow Member, Joseph Daul, at this point.
I have certainly noted that this is the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I hope that all sections of the PPE-DE Group, right through to the committee chairmen in your group, will take the same view.
(Applause)
The higher the committee, the less I am certain.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would happen if we went backwards?
We would find ourselves in another crisis situation like the one we have just resolved.
And if we are in a crisis, President-in-Office, then the laudable objectives you have just described would again be out of our reach.
How can we really implement a cohesive Lisbon Strategy with a two-speed Europe?
The two are mutually exclusive.
You are quite right: we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy.
Three years ago, a decision was taken to revitalise the Lisbon Strategy.
Three years down the line, we have not made much progress.
It is good that you are saying as President-in-Office of the Council we are going to get our heads down and get things moving, speed things up. There are two main reasons for speeding things up, though: you are quite right to say that we want to focus on qualifications.
If we want to become the most competitive knowledge-based continent, we need to focus on qualifications.
What we want from the Lisbon Strategy, above all, is social stability.
If we have greater economic growth - which we do, there are more jobs, and the reforms are taking effect, in fact thanks to Gerhard SchrÃ¶der's Government, they are already having an impact in my country - if we have more jobs, then there is one thing we need above all: for that growth to be sustainable and to bring sustainable social stability.
Otherwise the Lisbon Strategy is worthless.
If, as you quite rightly said, President-in-Office, we are looking for a subject that forces us to act as a Community, and a Community of 27, and where there is massive popular support, then climate protection is it.
The Live Earth concert last weekend clearly showed us how enthusiastically young people will champion a cause.
So let us harness that enthusiasm.
These young people go to the concert, and when it is over, they ask: and what now?
Bono and Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer do not have the solution.
They can champion a solution, but it is up to us to provide it through practical actions.
If we offer that solution, though, if we actually implement the ambitious targets, then I am certain that the people of Europe will be behind us, and that is exactly what the European project needs.
When I talk about climate protection, Prime Minister, I am very grateful for your strategy on Africa and Latin America, because climate protection will only be feasible if we involve Africa and Latin America.
In the case of Africa we need to recognise the bitter truth that the continent is most affected by global warning, despite making the least contribution to that global warming.
This is a significant factor in the Africans' plight.
I am very grateful for your position on Latin America too: the European Union's transatlantic relations go far beyond our relationship with the United States of America.
Above all, it is incumbent upon us to support Latin America in finding multilateral solutions to international conflicts, in United Nations reform, and in combating financial crises triggered by the financial markets.
Which countries were most affected?
Argentina, and also Brazil.
It is vital that we in Europe work with the Latin Americans.
My group will be running with and supporting this initiative in the autumn, and we are very grateful to you for organising the summit.
There are some people in this House who immediately get twitchy if there are two speakers in a row from the same country.
Mr President, today we have seen a Portuguese President-in-Office of the Council from the left and a former President-in-Office from the right working together for Europe.
I think that is worthy of note.
Overcoming issues that divide us at home in order to work together for a Europe for everyone else, this sense of common ground, of setting aside our differences, is what defines the notion of Europe.
That is exactly what we need to build a stronger Europe, because as you quite rightly said, not only Europe itself, but the whole world, needs a strong and united Europe.
That can only be achieved by resolving our differences, and concentrating on what unites us.
So I wish you all the best for your Presidency.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, President-in-Office, the programme that you have presented combines clear goals with ample ambition.
Success is not immanent, but Liberals and Democrats have high hopes of a European Union double act under the two JosÃ©s.
Indeed, you appear to compete for the laurels of economic liberalism.
As Britain's newspaper the Daily Mirror might say, 'It's the only way, JosÃ©!'
Who, if not you two, could convince Europe's governments of the beauty of Lisbon and the importance of its agenda?
Put the 'is on' back into 'Lisbon' - the need to consolidate public finances, the commitment to financial discipline and debt management, the drive to complete and strengthen the single market.
Yes, even in the face of populist opposition in your own parties.
It is not just in Asia that the free market has lifted millions out of poverty - it has done the same for 50 million people in the EU in the last 10 years alone.
Most importantly, there is a need for sustainable economic recovery in Europe to be built on job creation rather than on rigging the rate of exchange to ratchet up export-driven growth.
Therefore, my group particularly welcomes your initiative to open the discussion on flexicurity.
We have to modernise social protection and benefit systems to face the challenges of a global market.
Let us protect workers, not uncompetitive jobs.
Our social safety net should protect not failing businesses but rather those in them, helping them to find new employment opportunities.
The only European social model that matters to me is the one that preserves our prosperity by preparing our people for the future.
And, yes, if we talk about the future, let us not forget the fight against climate change.
Let us look at how we can merge the Gothenburg and Lisbon Agendas and use innovation in green technologies to help us be more innovative, create more jobs and lead the world in setting the climate change agenda.
President-in-Office, you are right to place an emphasis on Africa - discovered, exploited and then abandoned by Europeans.
The fact that you have called the first EU-Africa summit in seven years says it all.
It has been the forgotten continent for far too long.
Africa needs Europe, and Europe needs Africa if we are to deal successfully with migration, disease and climate change.
China offers money for natural resources and weapons for money.
That is the road of 21st century economic colonialism and it is the wrong way forward for Africa.
But Europe must avoid talk of the dimensions of empire.
Let us learn from the past and forge a new and generous partnership.
In justice and home affairs, we appreciate the fact that your Presidency will focus on a series of measures strengthening the area of justice in the European Union.
After the revealing comments by Germany's Interior Minister, Mr SchÃ€uble, my group will be on the guard against the erosion of civil liberties that underpin our society.
(Applause)
We want to see the framework decision on procedural safeguards agreed in the Council as a necessary accompanying measure to the European arrest warrant.
And we caution against a response to terrorism which changes the nature of our society by fettering the freedoms for which you fought in the Carnation Revolution.
Two weeks ago, this House applauded the Council for agreement on a mandate for the IGC, but last week we learned from some of your colleagues in the Council that they were hollow words.
Well, that was rather an ephemeral victory.
I believe I speak not only for my group but for many colleagues in this House when I urge that the package agreed at the June Summit should not be unravelled.
From a school on the Sagres peninsula, your country gained world repute as a nation of navigators.
As President-in-Office, you will need those skills to navigate through the treacherous waters of Council negotiations.
We wish you good luck and fair winds.
Boa sorte!
(Applause)

And in particular when we speak about Africa we have all seen the difficulties and the concerns that have been raised by many colleagues with regard to the attendance of certain people at that conference.
Perhaps this could be an opportunity for us, instead of shouting 'no' from the sidelines, to encourage other African countries to cooperate with each other, to use the open method of coordination of what should be proper democratic controls and proper procedures for the rights of individuals and freedoms for individuals when we meet at this African summit.
Darfur is mentioned often but rarely given any real meat, and the African summit provides us with another opportunity to try to bring together the disparate parts and elements in the conflict to ensure we can find a clear way forward.
Concerning the reform treaty - as you rightly mention the mandate has been set for the IGC in very specific terms - in many ways, despite what other people may think, we should expand or change those terms.
We are best to deal with what we have before us and what has been agreed by the 27 governments.
If I could sum up what the reform treaty should be about in one single phrase, the reform treaty is about giving us the freedom we seek, which is not the freedom to do whatever we wish, but rather, the freedom to achieve all that we desire.
In particular, when we speak about that freedom, we must take into account our climate and in particular climate change.
As I said in Lisbon, I welcome the fact that the Brazil Summit gave us an opportunity to bring forward the whole idea of renewable energies and look at ways of creating new world trade organisation and partnership with the developing world and, most importantly of all, to guarantee that our citizens have the rights and freedom to succeed in Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (PT) Mr President, a stronger Europe for a better world.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'a stronger Union for a better world': my group and I like your slogan very much, and I believe that there are three things the Presidency should do to ensure that over the next six months we remember this stronger Europe.
With regard to the intergovernmental conference, you should not tolerate at all those who wish to back-pedal the agreements reached, but you should, meanwhile, find areas for possible improvements, such as in the field of climate change, and seek to promote and allow the opening up of the intergovernmental conference to the eyes of the European Parliament and to public debate.
For us, these are the conditions for a successful reform of the Treaties.
This reform will not be the last, because we are committed from now on in this House to reinitiating the battle for the European Constitution.
On the Lisbon Strategy, we believe that no progress will be made unless, over the next six months, you are able, together with the Commission and Parliament, to strengthen the climate change agenda, since this cannot be separated from the Lisbon agenda.
Following the decisions taken during the German Presidency, the time has come to act, rejecting the attempts by many Member States to become swept up in wheeling and dealing, where each party has the aim of reducing its commitments to the minimum.
For this reason we would like to relaunch - and I urge you to take this into consideration - the idea of a Pact on climate change and energy security, based on the goal of restricting temperature increases to 2Â°C above the level of the pre-industrial era and on instruments that include mechanisms for imposing sanctions, exactly as in the Stability Pact.
There must be three lines of action, on which we would like concrete results within six months and on which I would ask you to respond, right now, in this debate: the issue of energy saving; transport, which unbelievably remained outside the agreements reached in the spring but which is responsible for 30% of emissions; and renewable energies, on which unfortunately the Barroso Commission has still done nothing, especially with regard to the heating and cooling Directive.
The issue of renewable energies enables me, Mr President, to bring to your attention the issue of biofuel and relations with Brazil.
We are worried: we do not like the mystical vision and miraculous significance given by President Lula to biofuel, as a new 'green gold'; nor do we like at all the fact that the issues of deforestation, illegal importing of timber, food safety and the European contribution to the development of innovative technologies for renewable energies have been excluded from the agenda.
I would briefly like to make a similar observation on the issue of Africa.
The fine words of Presidents SÃ³crates and Barroso have a specific and worrying implication, which I urge you to consider: the pressure exerted by the European Union on various African countries to make them sign the economic partnership agreement by the end of the year.
The Commission is using money from the Development Fund to convince these countries, in many of which civil society is opposed to the agreement, because the total opening up of their markets would ultimately achieve nothing but a reduction and restriction in their ability to integrate into the international market.
I would have liked to say many other things to you, Mr President, but I am unable to do so.
I hope that I will have other opportunities to do so.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, what we have just heard from the current President of the Council proves that this is going to be yet another wasted opportunity to put on the agenda some of the serious economic and social problems that need changes in policy and responses on the part of the Community institutions: for example, the unequal distribution of income, increased job insecurity and the poverty in which nearly 80 million people live, including increasing numbers of workers on low pay and fewer rights, old people with negligible pensions, and women and children being denied fundamental human rights.
Instead of attaching priority to changing the objectives and statutes of the Central European Bank so as to demand that it be subject to democratic control, to curb the rise in interest rates and to stop social injustice from getting any worse, he persists in his obsession with the main proposals contained in the neoliberal and militaristic draft Constitutional Treaty and greater concentration of the power of major EU powers.
Instead of fighting for the withdrawal, or at least a radical revision, of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon Strategy, in order to kick-start investment in the public sector and SMEs, to curb deregulation and the privatisation of fundamental sectors and public services with a view to creating more jobs with rights and reducing poverty and social exclusion, he places the emphasis on the sacred cow of competition to increase the power of the economic and financial groups.
Instead of proposing measures to respect the dignity of working people, and to alleviate the increasingly insecure situation of millions of workers, particularly women and young people - as several thousand people demanded at the demonstration organised by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers on 5 July in GuimarÃ£es - what we are seeing is an emphasis on flexisecurity, which more than anything else means flexi-exploitation of the workers.
That is why we stress the need for a sea change on the part of the EU, and why we say it is time to listen to the people's demands, to extend democracy and to commit ourselves to a fairer social Europe characterised by progress and a fairer distribution of income; it is time to uphold the principle of sovereign States with equal rights, to strengthen international cooperation and solidarity, to commit ourselves firmly to peace, whether in the Middle East, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa.
We reaffirm our objection to a so-called reforming draft Treaty, but which, in practice, is nothing more than a reproduction of the Constitutional Treaty by means of a major smokescreen designed to circumvent referendums and to reduce democracy and the opportunity for people and national institutions to make their voices heard, for fear of pluralistic debate and public opinion in our countries.
That is why we want a referendum in every Member State, as public opinion in our States demands.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Polish newspaper recently published the following story: What was the first European referendum?
Answer: when God, having created Eve, said to Adam: 'choose your wife'.
The image is apt.
Today, far away from the Garden of Eden, the Portuguese Presidency has taken over from the German Presidency.
The latter will have been marked by its trickery, with an attempt to impose on the people of France and of the Netherlands a barely disguised and pruned text that they rejected by referendum.
This mini-treaty is nothing but the Constitution in disguise.
Some years ago, Mr Padoa-Schioppa, the father of the euro, wrote a piece in a French journal, the gist of which was that European integration stems more from enlightened despotism than from democracy.
We have a vivid illustration of this today with this gross manipulation.
How can one say that the new text corresponds to the desire expressed by the people of France and of the Netherlands during the referendums if it is not submitted to another such test by referendum?
If I may, Mr President, I shall express a wish in this House at the dawn of the Portuguese Presidency: if we do not want the people of Europe to turn their backs once and for all on the political class, then the Portuguese Presidency must make a total break with its outdated methods and undertake immediately the one genuine European reform that the people expect: less technocracy, more democracy.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, may I take this opportunity once again to express our gratitude for the magnificent reception that yourself and your government reserved for the chairmen of the parliamentary groups very recently in Lisbon: it testifies to your will to work seriously with this Parliament.
We can only approve a number of your objectives, the ambition of which does not surprise us. They include that of helping to resolve the problems in Africa, problems that we must indeed admit have only worsened since the countries of Europe left, unlike what some people would have us believe.
They also include an effort aimed at Latin America, and in particular Brazil, which is dear to your heart and which is close to you - all that is justifiable.
As I have already had the opportunity to say to you, I believe that the only way that the European international policy that you hope to develop will have any legitimacy and transparency is if it distinguishes itself from that of the hegemonic superpower that the United States has now become.
I fear, Mr President, that my fellow Member, Mr Watson, and many others like him are confusing two things: on the one hand, the necessary restoration of economic freedoms within a nation or within an area of which the parameters are almost the same in social protection terms and, on the other, a form of unbridled free-marketism that is reflected in downright unfair competition founded on social dumping.
The truth is that, in the beginning, an economy develops only within a protective framework, which is true for the major partners of the world market that, today, are Japan and China.
With regard, lastly, to the Intergovernmental Conference, you are going to have to apply a road map that has been proposed to you and that is a veritable manual with which to deceive the electorate.
We are, in effect, keeping the substance of a constitution that, as has just been said, has been rejected, and changing the vocabulary.
True, we are doing away with the words 'constitution', 'foreign affairs minister' and 'framework law', we are not mentioning the Charter in the text and we are merely publishing it in the Official Journal.
However, we are keeping the extension of the Union's powers, majority voting and a single presidency, which would deprive us of your presence today, if it were in force.
We are keeping everything to which the people did not subscribe and which they would most probably reject if they were properly informed.
Mr President, you are the representative of a nation that is small in size but so very glorious in terms of its immense history.
Such glory was possible only thanks to the constant battle that Portugal has always fought - from its birth and throughout its history - to uphold its independence.
I beg you: do not be a party to the disappearance of this most precious of assets of your nation and of all our nations - our national independence.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr SÃ³crates, we welcome the presentation of the guidelines that Portugal intends to follow over the coming months: naturally, we agree with the priority placed on the Intergovernmental Conference and can only offer our best wishes for you to achieve the aim of fully and faithfully turning the mandate into a new treaty.
As you yourself said, the Presidency will have more commitments than just this one over the coming months.
We welcome the list of priorities that you have set yourselves and understand the reasons why, in relation to some of these priorities - Lisbon, Africa, Brazil - Portugal will be especially committed.
At the same time, we would like to emphasise the fact that, in order to turn your slogan into a reality and demonstrate that a stronger Europe can lead to a better world, we need not just good intentions but facts, which are not chosen by us but derive from the actual priorities of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.
On this point, I would like to draw your attention and that of your Presidency to the most urgent priority, which is set by a region close to us in the Mediterranean - the Middle East - on which Europe can and must do more.
This region has not had much of a presence in the recent past but now that the dangers are becoming more acute and the opportunities greater as a result, Europe must demonstrate that it knows how to be stronger in order to contribute to a better world.
(PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, you will certainly have noted, as I have, the enormous groundswell of both expectation and sympathy you have aroused on all sides of this House, and there must be some reason for that.
The reason is, of course, the firm and decisive manner in which you have rejected any interference with the decisions taken at the June meeting of the European Council.
Continue along that line and you will certainly have even stronger support after the informal meeting of the September European Council.
You also mentioned the Lisbon Strategy and the need for a new cycle.
We all agree with that.
We must, however, bear in mind that one of the reasons for the breakdown of the first Lisbon Strategy was the cardinal sin of not having given the Commission the responsibility for steering that strategy, a task for which the intergovernmental model has proved inadequate.
In recent years, the President of the Commission - and he deserves great credit for this - has tried to make use of the fine detail to move the strategy forward.
Nonetheless, the Council must accept that the Commission must be even more deeply involved with it in order to achieve the ambitious objectives you referred to, Prime Minister, in your speech.
As far as foreign relations are concerned, it has to be said that you have started off on the right foot.
The Summit with Brazil was an unqualified success, as I can confirm from President Lula's comments at the Conference of Presidents in Brussels.
I would also like to tell you that neither in Africa nor in Europe should anyone be held to ransom by Robert Mugabe.
Let us say so clearly.
The summit must be for debate and must not concentrate on that sole or principal topic.
There are many other issues to which you have referred, which must be the subject of our discussion and our dialogue and partnership with Africa.
Just one more point, Mr President. In the case of relations with Russia, you have had the courage to visit President Putin in an atmosphere you knew would be unfavourable to you.
You should now try to persuade your colleagues that Russia needs to be involved in [addressing] international problems, for Russia needs to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.
Prime Minister, you have the support of this House, you certainly have the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the ambitious programme you have presented.
I am on your side, and wish you every success.
(NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to congratulate Portugal on its Presidency and thank it for its pledge to work closely together with this House.
You can rest assured, Mr President, that we will take you at your word.
We welcome your intention to organise an EU-Africa Summit and an EU-Brazil Summit.
As far as the EU-Africa Summit is concerned, though, we should not leave people in any doubt as to the fact that EU sanctions during your Presidency cannot simply be academic.
To put it bluntly: at a summit such as this, there is no room for leaders who have reduced their own people to a state of misery and famine and who persist in this.
Whilst a clear-cut position such as this does not make it any easier for you, Mr President, this is the product of a system we introduced ourselves at the time.
I wish you much luck for the Brazil Summit.
Brazil is an important country, and a reinforcement of the ties between the EU and Latin and Central America is a welcome development.
I should also like to ask you a question.
According to a brochure I read about your Presidency, it is the intention to make a contribution to disarmament and non-proliferation.
I would appreciate it if you could expand on this a little.
Finally, I should like to mention an issue that has not been raised before.
It is clear, Mr President, that, in the next six months, you too will need to face up to all the crises that may develop anywhere in the world.
There is one which will undoubtedly be at the top of the agenda and which we will be debating this afternoon, in fact: the crisis in the Middle East and Palestine.
I hope that you too will be able to make a positive contribution in this matter.
- (PL) Mr President, the priorities put forward by the President of the Council which started with the Portuguese presidency, are cause for great hope.
It is particularly important to strengthen transatlantic relations, not only in the war on international terrorism, but also in the fields of economic relations and research.
The presidency has also made equally valuable declarations about helping to stabilise the Western Balkans, and about drawing up a strategy, in conjunction with African partners, for the continent's development.
We would also happily adopt an outline for the EU membership prospects of Ukraine during the European Union - Ukraine summit.
Unfortunately the Portuguese presidency has also inherited the so-called 'new constitutional treaty'.
Let us hope that this troublesome legacy will not obscure the ambitious aims the presidency has set for itself, which are of real importance for the future of Europe and the world.
Mr President, coming from Scotland, a smaller Atlantic maritime nation, I warmly congratulate our Portuguese colleagues and thank Mr SÃ³crates for his enthusiasm, his realism and his ambition today.
I only wish my own country, Scotland, could take its natural place as a constructive and enthusiastic partner Member State, but we are on our way, for we do have much in common.
We want to see realism; we want to see dynamism; we want to see reform; we want to see progress; and, in the reform treaty, you have an opportunity to deliver for all of us.
My party decided, on balance, that we could not recommend the previous draft of the Constitution to our voters, but that is in the past, and we view your efforts with a fair heart and an open and constructive attitude.
We wish you all the best.
The EU is far from perfect but what is right with it is to be saved and is to be promoted.
If you can build on the successes and sweep away what does not work - like this building, perhaps! - I hope to congratulate you in December also.
(PT) Prime Minister SÃ³crates says he has received a clear and precise mandate.
I agree.
He knows that the governments of Spain or Luxembourg Governments will argue that the new Treaty is the same as the previous one and will require parliamentary ratification.
He also knows that the governments of France and the Netherlands will say exactly the opposite ultimately to support the same idea, namely that there will be no referendum for anyone.
I wonder why he says nothing.
Are we to have six months of doublespeak, or will we see the political vision to include the people in the decision?
I am also puzzled as to why he says nothing about certain other things.
Europe has no policy on Iraq; does Washington have to decide to call its boys home before we can have such a policy?
Europe has two policies on the Iranian nuclear programme; will bombs have to fall in Iran before we see that such an escalation ought to have been prevented?
Europe has an irresponsible policy in Palestine and Lebanon; in the one case, it has always supported its President without recognising governments, and in the other it supports the government and opposes the President.
Does it all have to go wrong before we see that our role ought to be to encourage internal agreement?
Last summer there was an unscheduled war.
A year later, it is looming again.
Mr SÃ³crates, we shall only prevent it if we want to do so.
Mr SÃ³crates, you are part of this great deception: the attempt to hoodwink the British, the French and the Dutch into accepting a treaty without a referendum.
The other day you said that this treaty was less federalist.
I ask you: less federalist than what?
You really could not make some of this stuff up.
Fortunately, there are some voices in the EU who are honest and say that we have the substance of the Constitution and all we have done is to change the terminology.
Others say that we have 90%, or 99%, of what was there in the first place.
Whether we are playing the game that you are playing or whether we are being honest, we all know the truth, which is that if the British had a referendum on this, 70% or perhaps more would say 'no'.
I wonder whether it would not be better for everybody if the British just were not part of this European Union.
Why do we not just get a quickie divorce?
We can do it very quickly; let us keep the lawyers out; let us have a free trade agreement; let us have a Swiss-style relationship.
I think everybody would be a lot happier, most certainly we would be.
While we are at it, I simply cannot bear listening to you and Mr Barroso blathering on about Africa and what we have to do to help people there.
A very good start would be for you to stop Mr Mugabe attending the summit in December: that would send a good message.
However, I will give you a real challenge, a positive thing that you could do.
Yesterday Mr Barroso talked about the EU being an empire and, when it comes to Africa, my goodness me it is!
I urge you to stop the fisheries deals with West Africa.
Stop your own fleet.
Stop the Spanish fleet plundering western African resources, killing African fishermen.
If you do that in your six-month Presidency then you will have done something positive for Africa.
Please act!
(SK) Despite the fact that the Portuguese presidency is facing many challenges, the most serious one being the staging of an intergovernmental conference to negotiate the draft Constitutional Treaty, I am pleased to see that the Portuguese Presidency will also be dealing with other issues.
The main issue here concerns the strategies in sectors that are within the purview of national states, for example the health sector.
This week, namely on 12 and 13 July, the minister of health will be holding a Round Table devoted to healthcare strategies in Europe, and I have the honour to be taking part in these round table discussions.
The meeting will be addressing issues such as discrepancies between the healthcare systems of Member States, legislation in the area of healthcare services, the problem of the rising incidence of cancer in the European Union and the mobility of patients and health professionals.
I appreciate the fact that the talks will also include the participation of representatives from Slovenia, which announced some time ago that the fight against cancer would be one of the major priorities of its presidency.
Prime Minister, I would like to wish you every success.
Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this Presidency is embarked upon at an important time for the European Union.
I am delighted that my country and your country share the same patron saint, St George, who was well known for fighting dragons and dealing with difficult problems.
I hope that this will be the case with this Presidency also.
I am delighted that you are giving such emphasis to the issues of Africa.
The plight of the continent and the fight against global poverty are matters which the British Conservative Party feels very strongly about.
However, I must also press you, I think, to ensure that the EU-Africa summit later this year takes place without the presence of Robert Mugabe.
