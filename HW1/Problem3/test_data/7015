It is only a short step from artificial regions within the nation states to artificial regions straddling them.
If European groupings of cross-border cooperation make that step they will be entities with a legal personality, with their own statutes, organs and budgetary rules.
The Commission explicitly states that EGCCs are a means of overcoming the major difficulties in carrying out cooperation due to the many national laws.
This is a momentous development hidden away as usual behind dry jargon.
Conservative-controlled Kent County Council will love all this.
It has already set up an unofficial cross-border region â Transmanche â with Nord-Pas de Calais, but the people of the UK will not even accept attempts to set up regional governments within their own borders.
I assure you there is no way they will accept regional government from beyond them.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the excellent report by Mr Casa on the European Fisheries Fund.
It correctly identifies the key policy objectives and the means to achieve them.
In Ireland, aquaculture has long been recognised and identified as having a critically important socio-economic contribution to make in our coastal communities.
I am, therefore, particularly pleased at the important provisions that will allow diversification into aquaculture.
I am pleased that a number of elements in the Commissionâs proposals concerning small-scale coastal fishing, and aquaculture investments in particular, have been amended in committee.
These amendments will seriously contribute to achieving the overriding objectives of the Fisheries Fund.
I do not approve, however, of certain mandatory elements in the Commissionâs proposal, notably the requirement that socio-economic measures must be included in national plans.
I believe that the application of the subsidiarity principle would be more appropriate.
Today, more than ever, there is a vital need for subsidiarity.
I, therefore, particularly welcome the fact that it would be up to each Member State to set its own priorities and to decide where and how the funds will be spent.
Finally, we must all ensure that the negative bashing of the common fisheries policy stops and that this fund is presented to the European electorate as something positive; indeed, it must be presented as something the sector can fully and wholeheartedly identify with, something that will allow the development of the sector, something that will contribute to a better future for fisheries, not least for the fishermen and women on the west coast of Ireland whom I represent.
Â Â  Article 160 of the Treaty states that the European Regional Development Fund is aimed at helping to correct the largest regional disparities within the Community.
Proposed Amendment 8 draws particular attention to ensuring that this Fund complements the aid provided by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which is natural.
Why do IÂ mention this?
The success of our plans to reduce regional disparities in the European Union depends directly on the success of rural development.
Most regions of Europe are rural regions, and the most backward regions are the most rural of these regions.
Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, current studies clearly show that where agribusiness prospers, so does the rural environment and the entire region, and where it falters, so does the rural environment and the entire region.
This is a rule that applies almost without exception.
Thus, our current endeavours to reduce regional disparities would be put in question by the efforts at downplaying such common agricultural policy whose aim is to attain sustainable prosperity of agriculture and of rural regions.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us constantly bear in mind that the problems of the European Unionâs regional development cannot be successfully resolved without ensuring rural development, and that prosperous rural regions will become aÂ reality only when the farmers prosper.
We are not rivals, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  The negotiations on these proposals have come at a time when intense debate is under way about the future of the European Union, about where we are heading and how we are going to move forward.
We are no longer just talking about the need for enlargement to be a success, but about what means the European Union has at its disposal to meet external challenges, or, as the representative of the Council said, âto deal with the challenges of the 21st centuryâ.
The instruments of regional and cohesion policy must play a key role both in âdigestingâ enlargement â to adapt Churchillâs expression â and in responding to the challenges.
There can be no question that the most important evaluation criteria must be efficiency and effectiveness. But while laying great emphasis on these criteria, we must not allow a situation to arise where we adopt, or push through Parliament or elsewhere, regulations of a sort that could put Member States at a distinct disadvantage.
Now, in this phase, it has emerged that a good few proposals included in these reports ruin newly acceded countriesâ chances of utilising these funds.
A good few speakers before me have already mentioned the N+2 rule, the VAT issue, and so on. Moreover, these proposals are included in the reports in a way that changes previous practice, making the conditions less favourable, or ignoring possibilities that relate to improving the competitiveness of a particular region, or to other Lisbon objectives.
We therefore urge both Council and Commission representatives present here today to please ensure that any proposals they put to us later on, and any proposals they support and develop, provide equal opportunities and equal rights for all Member States as regards access to the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Â Â  A decisive experience for the EU-10 in the transformation processes of the last 15 years has been the disappearance of national borders, the fact that borders have become ethereal, and the recognition and implementation of democratic European values such as subsidiarity, solidarity and regionalism.
As Robert Schumann once dreamt, national borders no longer divide.
We are uniting not countries, but regions and citizens.
Regions would like to have common goals, organised mechanisms for cooperation and, in the spirit of subsidiarity, they would like to be able to decide directly on cooperation and on the necessary funds.
This will make Europe more democratic, and more economically efficient too.
We welcome the Commissionâs efforts to take the request of the regions and the principle of subsidiarity into account when drafting the legislation, and we greatly appreciate the complicated and multifaceted legal negotiations it has undertaken in an effort to allay the initial fears of national governments.
My Group understands the caution evinced by the Council and the Member States with regard to the jurisdiction of the new groupings and the reduced role of central government entities, and we are preparing for the next round of negotiations.
The Europe of the Regions is versatile: it is characterised by a variety of levels and forms of local government.
For this reason, EGCCs are a reasonable option.
Why should not we opt for them?
Now, at a time when integration, the common European project, appears to have come to a sudden standstill, representation of local and regional interests is particularly important.
One example of successful cross-border cooperation is the cooperation between Styria and Bavaria in connection with avalanche disasters, to provide an immediate response aimed at disaster prevention.
This operates by providing a simplified way for the parties adversely affected to approach each other for help, rather than by means of time-consuming administrative procedures.
Just imagine what would happen without a regional agreement!
First they would have to apply to their respective central governments for formal consent, and only once they were in possession of the appropriate resolutions and authorisations could the process of providing assistance begin.
The mere thought of this is horrifying.
My Group has drawn Parliamentâs attention to the parallel preparatory work undertaken by the European Council to draft the triple protocol to the Madrid Outline Convention on Euroregional Co-operation Groupings â whose very title reveals the shared goal of the two pieces of legislation.
I think the work of the rapporteur deserves credit and that the compromise proposals are useful, and I recommend that the report be adopted.
Â Â  The proposed directive for the establishment of European groupings for cross-border cooperation was conceived as part of the reformed cohesion policy, which will be made available to members if they so wish.
It still remains in no small measure controversial, which is a result of the fact that, because of its legal nature, it is not in any way whatsoever a tool.
It represents an instrument of the new generation of European policy, established in light of the constitutional goal of increasing geographical cohesion and based on the substantial experience of those regions that in years gone by developed cross-border cooperation within the framework of Interreg and ran into problems as a result of different national legislation.
The new groupings introduced by this directive will be by their very nature purposeful.
Previously competent regions will, with this document, be in a position to implement regional projects of a cross-border nature.
The advantage will be that such activity will no longer be at the mercy of changes in parliamentary majorities in the Member States, and there will therefore be no need for them to be organised at the lowest level.
The new directive differs from the previous practice of interregional cooperation in that such cooperation will have to be carried out at a higher level.
The difference is the legal distribution of duties, which, of course, increases the responsibility of agencies and heightens financial responsibility when dealing with joint resources.
As far as resources from European Union funds are concerned, the state remains financially responsible and will remain so when these resources are managed by groupings.
In the case of other resources, the groupings themselves will be responsible.
The Commission's original proposal had to be supplemented with respect to the competence of the supervisory bodies of any state whose law will be selected.
There must not be any area not legally regulated in an unambiguous way.
We believe that the proposed amendments, which we have adjusted with the rapporteur, have filled any such gaps satisfactorily.
We will see in practice whether our hypotheses were correct.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank MrÂ Casa for this very important report on the European Fisheries Fund, a sector that, unfortunately, has suffered recurrent crises due to excessive pressure on fish stocks and to the problems of organising a sustainable fish management policy which will help keep a human fabric and a dynamic business alive on our coastlines.
We therefore applaud everything which helps to achieve a more selective use of fishing equipment, a reduction in environmental impact, support for small and micro fishing enterprises and transparency in the policies adopted.
However, we very much deplore the fact that the Committee on Fisheries again wishes to subsidise the construction and modernisation of new boats, and indeed their export, although these subsidies were cancelled in 2002 because of their incompatibility with the aims of the policy and because of their pernicious effects.
The Funds should be much more focused on human problems, such as training, technical support, redeployment, the role of women, assistance in the event of socio-economic crises, improved knowledge of environments and ways of preserving and restoring them, etc. These are the things which are vital for the future of fisheries and we hope that the Council will not give in to the temptation to satisfy certain national lobbies to the detriment of the wider interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, allow me to start by thanking all five rapporteurs, especially my honourable friend MrÂ Hatzidakis, on the effort which he made in drafting this report.
However, we must not forget that, when we talk of European regional policy, we are talking about the development of a programme designed to promote social and economic cohesion and allow the Union to undertake actions to reduce regional inequalities, promote real cohesion and invigorate employment, while also serving to redistribute and counterbalance the cost of the internal market as regards the less developed regions.
This report, which deals with most aspects of the Union's regional policy, does not, in my opinion, give enough weight to the less developed regions.
Nor must we forget that the new Member States which are suffering from serious geographical inequalities, such as Cyprus and Malta, need more help within the framework of European regional policy.
In order for this need to become reality, we must take account of the imperatives for a sustainable cohesion policy for the whole of the European Union, which will take the form of actions, not statistics contested on numerous counts.
Â Â  Mr President, in our market-led economy, large, often international, companies set the tone.
Key words include specialisation and scaling up.
Companies choose their locations on the basis of natural regional benefits, and it follows that not every activity in each region can be carried out profitably.
The circumstances often outweigh any financial incentives offered by governments.
I am therefore not labouring under the illusion that the European structural policy will be able to perform miracles.
It is too unrealistic, too inflexible and too limited in scope for that.
That does not mean, though, that European structural policy could not in certain circumstances contribute to a temporary reduction in regional and local economic bottlenecks, for practical experience demonstrates that it can.
The reports by our fellow Members are therefore worthy of at least some support, with particular attention for a few bottlenecks.
I am particularly thinking in terms of the continued option of including private funds in the calculation of cofinancing, regional and local partners having the necessary influence in drafting and executing plans, and spending available resources within the periods prescribed for this purpose in an effective and efficient manner.
A possible reduction in the Councilâs total budget will need to be borne by all regions.
In future, we will need to focus on the knowledge element, instead of the production element.
That is where our strength lies, as is also borne out in practice.
We should therefore leave room at each level to exploit that strength and to use the powerful regions to improve the plight of the weaker ones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the fine work carried out.
Article 160 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that the European Regional Development Fund contributes to correcting the main regional imbalances existing within the Community, by participating in the development and the structural improvement of regions lagging behind in development, as well as in the restructuring of industrial regions in decline.
Regional policy therefore represents a chance and an opportunity that we must not waste and that must be managed in the best way possible.
I refer in particular to the southern regions of Italy, which come under the former Objective 1, now termed the âConvergenceâ objective, which still have enormous problems and lag seriously behind in many sectors.
Regional policy can genuinely be very useful for those regions, even if a number of mistakes from the past need to be corrected.
At times we did not utilise all of the resources at our disposal and at other times we utilised them in the least appropriate manner.
MrÂ Favaâs report, with which I agree, seeks to adjust this perspective, by focusing on knowledge, research and development, therefore ...
Â Â  Mr President, my primary observation has to be that the proposed structural and cohesion funding package for 2007-2013 fails to provide adequately for those regions within the EU-15 which, though themselves deficient in infrastructure investment, failed because of the national criteria to qualify for cohesion funds.
Northern Ireland which I represent is such a region.
Our water and sewage and roads infrastructure need huge investment.
We have not seen a mile of motorway built for maybe 30 years.
Our water system requires expenditure to the tune of hundreds of millions.
Yet we did not qualify for environment and road infrastructure assistance under the Cohesion Fund because of the national criteria.
Our nearest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, did so qualify and in the 10 years from 1993 benefited from over EUR 2 billion of expenditure on such projects.
These proposals with their almost total focus on the new Member States do not recognise the glaring needs of regions such as mine.
I therefore call for a reconsideration of the real needs of regions that still exist within the EU-15 that are now in danger of being totally bypassed.
I would like to say a word about the European Fisheries Fund.
It seems to me to be designed largely with a view to managing further decline.
Its prohibition on funding new vessels will do nothing to tackle the dangers and the problems of an ageing fleet.
The fund rather should provide for the specific needs of the fisheries sector in each Member State and, if it did, the modernisation and funding of new vessels would be top of the agenda in many areas.
Â Â  The European Social Fund is without doubt an important element in the promotion of the European social and employment policy.
In the same way, it contributes significantly to meeting the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, such as job creation, support for education and vocational training, the promotion of cohesion and social inclusion, and not least, eliminating gender inequalities.
IÂ would like here to express my thanks to our colleague Silva Peneda for his work in preparing this report.
IÂ wholeheartedly hope these efforts will allow this regulation to eliminate the significant inequalities that exist between the 25 EU Member States in the fields of unemployment, social security, vocational training and education as much as possible.
The European Social Fund is an important instrument in the promotion of social integration and for making employment accessible to various disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities.
IÂ am extremely pleased that in this Parliament we have been able to incorporate the protection of such people into the text of the regulation as a priority.
Ladies and gentlemen, IÂ would like here to draw your attention to the proposed amendment, which IÂ and Jan BÅezina, with the support of my colleagues from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, put forward at Wednesdayâs plenary session.
This is Draft Amendment 98, in which we are jointly proposing that the grounds for the regulation be extended by adding the text, I quote âthat one of the priorities of the European Social Fund be to make up for the negative effects of the exclusion of workers from the new Member States from the EU labour marketâ.
In our view, this clause is of great political importance regarding the decision to impose a transitional period for granting workers from the new Member States access to the labour market of the European Union.
Today we know that this decision, which was taken before our accession to the EU, has proved unfounded.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs JÃ¶ns, the shadow rapporteur on the Silva Peneda Report for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is unfortunately, for personal reasons, unable to be here today, and so I shall be presenting the essence of her comments on behalf of our group.
In the first place, we are grateful to Mr Silva Peneda for his good cooperation.
He has indeed managed to pull all the threads together and to summarise the most important objectives for everyone.
The report adds much of importance to the Commission proposal, and we hope that it will receive widespread support tomorrow.
We will be tabling only one amendment, and it is one that we believe to be a necessary addition.
There are four points I wish to make, and I shall do so briefly, as is only right and proper.
Firstly, we are glad to see that the report calls on the Member States to do more to implement innovative measures across national borders.
This ensures added value for Europe and disseminates the best practice that we have learned from labour market policy.
Secondly, we regard it as of the utmost significance that more attention is given to nation action programmes to address social exclusion.
People out of work for long periods of time and those who have not completed their schooling need special help, and these are in a position to provide it.
Thirdly, we welcome the obligation imposed upon the Member States to target action more specifically at women, and the requirement that they ensure that gender budgeting is implemented.
Some Member States, such as Germany, Belgium and Austria, are already distinguishing themselves by allocating more than 10% of their ESF funds to womenâs employment.
To sum up, we are convinced that ESF measures must continue to benefit asylum seekers, who, in many cases, have been with us for many months, waiting for a decision on their applications for asylum, and so they need our support.
Irrespective of whether they are eventually granted asylum or return home, we must offer them something.
Â Â  Mr President, thanks are due to all the rapporteurs for the open and inclusive manner in which they have handled the dossiers and for the extent of the consensus they have built.
My own thanks are particularly due to Mr Hatzidakis for supporting the ALDE amendments to his own report.
I speak specifically, however, of the Casa report; here we wish to introduce references to an ecosystem-based approach to management, to Regional Advisory Councils and to improved disclosure on financial control structures.
I ask colleagues to vote in favour of them.
On a personal note, whilst I believe that there is much to commend already in the report, there are certain aspects that, like the Commissioner, I cannot support.
Resources allocated to the fund are limited; there are many needs to be met.
The inclusion of safety improvements and of improvements to quality conditions on board vessels, and the inclusion of measures to make vessels more environmentally friendly may be acceptable, particularly for the small-scale coastal sector.
However, I am strongly opposed, both in principle and as regards the practical effects, to using European taxpayersâ money for wider fleet renewal.
This is simply an attempt to turn the clock back.
More generally â and I turn to the President-in-Office â I would like to echo colleagues from across the political groups and urge the Council to take very seriously Parliamentâs recommendations on the financial perspectives and on structural funding as found in the Berger and Hatzidakis reports.
Otherwise, I fear serious adverse effects for both economic regeneration and social inclusion.
I also believe very strongly that EU funding should be available to areas in need wherever in the Union they happen to be located.
In this light, I wish the UK well in its Presidency, hoping that it will include a speedy on the financial perspectives.
When its Prime Minister spoke recently to this House, he referred to a âunion of values, of solidarity between nations and peopleâ.
May this understanding above all inform the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the purpose of the European Fisheries Fund should be to implement the common fisheries policy, according to MrÂ Borg.
In Scotland, though, a more accurate description of the need would be to compensate for the disastrous effects of the common fisheries policy on our communities and it is a worry that the total fund projected is about the same for 25 as we have had for 15 Member States.
I support most of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, with the exception of vessel construction.
In particular I support changing the presumption from fleet reduction to adaptation, so that account can be taken of individual circumstances in areas.
I support highlighting the importance of aquaculture, priority for small-scale inshore fisheries and the compensation proposed for enforced tie-up.
I welcome the fact that the Commission considers fisheries important enough for its Fisheries Commissioner to be here for this debate.
It is a pity that the Presidency did not do likewise, but then that is all too typical of UK governments and how they see fisheries, particularly in Scotland.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a sword of Damocles hangs over this debate, in the shape of the financial perspectives of the Union, which have a decisive influence on the definition of the EU cohesion policies.
The cohesion policy is the best instrument for reviving the role of political Europe, whose crisis is often caused by neo-liberal choices and the militarisation of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The rapporteurs have carried out some excellent work in drawing up fresh methods of achieving the objectives of the new cohesion policy.
I should like to thank in particular MrÂ Fava and Mr Andria for the work they carried out.
In order to be able to plan the future, however, an assessment also needs to be carried out of the impact that the Structural Funds have had on businesses and the economy in the weak areas of Europe.
Often, in fact, the Structural Funds did not help to improve the quality of life of citizens in underdeveloped areas, but rather were a matter for the mafia, were handed out according to a system of patronage or were utilised in order to cover holes in budgeting, and at times they were not even spent.
Whilst a debate on the amount of funding is necessary, thought must also be given to the quality of spending.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs.
A lot has been said about cohesion and the balanced development of Europe.
If such development is to become reality, however, appropriate decisions must be taken regarding the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and cross-border cooperation.
I should like to take this opportunity to call for the adoption of more flexible solutions, especially with regard to the n+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund, to non-recoverable VAT, to social housing and to the multi-fund approach.
Amendments to this effect would benefit not only the new Member States, but also the old Member States.
Numerous examples can be found to show that companies from the 15Â old Member States win tenders to invest in the new Member States.
The new Member States also have a full understanding of such problems as the statistical effect and conditions on islands.
I would add that this far-reaching divide into old and new Member States is damaging for the EU.
Mathematical game theory recognises that games exist in which the gain of one party does not result in the loss of the other.
We should take part in just such a game, as this would benefit Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by defending the excellent work and the difficult consensus achieved by the rapporteur, Mr Casa, in the European Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries.
Secondly, I would also call on the critics of the fisheries restructuring policy to leave behind the hackneyed argument that a fishing vessel or an aquacultural plant are synonymous with environmental disaster and rather to give them their support.
I can assure you that, with the budget reserved for us by the European Fisheries Fund â 4Â 900 million for six years and 27 countries, which represents an increase of just 1Â 500 million on the current fund for 15 countries â we can do little damage to the environment or the Communityâs budget.
I believe that the report has sensibly introduced more measures than were contained in the Commission's proposal, with a view to providing greater flexibility and thereby enabling the Member States to respond better to their various sectors.
We have extended the cases eligible for renovation and modernisation of the fleet, because it is difficult to understand why we are condemning certain professions to work with obsolete and dangerous means of production, in particular the small-scale fleet, which is the most outdated.
To express our regret at accidents and to pay tribute to the victims is of little use.
But now we have the opportunity to help to prevent them since, furthermore, we now have a whole range of methods of teledetection and satellite monitoring, in order to prevent too much from being fished or the wrong things being fished.
Mr President, allow me to say a final word about mixed companies.
I believe them to be the guarantee of an effective development aid and cooperation policy and, in accordance with the Commissionâs support for them within the new policy on association agreements, I would like to defend them.
However, Commissioner, I do not believe that it is possible for mixed companies to be created in developing third countries without the corresponding Community assistance, since these countries do not have the same legal guarantees for investments.
So if we really want mixed companies to be a cornerstone of development cooperation, Commissioner, let us give them assistance from the EFF.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the rapporteurs.
Regional development is one of the cornerstones of the European Union.
I welcome Parliamentâs position on regional policy per se, but I also believe that we must have sustainable development.
I welcome the review of the common fisheries policy as giving a sustainable framework for fisheries.
I deeply regret that the report on the European Fisheries Fund has been transformed into a vehicle to reopen decisions taken during the CFP review.
The review clearly ended subsidies for boat building and put into place limitations on modernisation.
It is disingenuous to say that engine replacement and other forms of modernisation do not increase fishing capacity.
I welcome the focus on sustainability within the Commissionâs EFF proposals.
I also noted that, in his working document on the CFP, Mr BÃ¶ge commented that the overcapacity of the Community fleet still is, despite the efforts made in the framework of the previous structural programmes, one of the main reasons for the over-exploitation of certain stocks.
Sustainability is the key to future prosperity and development in the fisheries sector.
I do not buy the argument that old small boats are unsafe and need replacing by public money.
It may be undeniable that they need replacing.
However, my previous old small car was unsafe and needed replacing, but I had to pay for the replacement myself.
All right, I was not running a car-based business but, if I had been, I would not have expected the government to step in and give me the money.
Fleet renewal needs to take place, but I want that to happen on a sustainable basis.
We should not subsidise too many fishermen to chase too few fish.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I speak as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the regulation on the ERDF.
I should like to first congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Fava, for the excellent work carried out.
I consider the reference made by the rapporteur to the issue of public security as the guarantee against organised crime infiltrating the expenditure processes linked to the Structural Funds to be positive.
Significant consensus has been reached on a number of points among many of us, of different extractions and origins in terms of both geography and politics, on the significant issue of social inclusion.
During the debate in committee, extremely effective compromises and points of synthesis were found upon reading the amendments.
I welcome the fact that the rapporteur chose to pay the utmost attention to the requests put forward by my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
In particular, we obtained more attention for the urban dimension.
Emphasis has been placed on the driving force that a good programme of investment and management of funds directly apportioned to the cities can have for the economic and sociocultural revival of the suburbs and surrounding rural areas, as the Commissioner here present also stated today.
That will act as a real engine for the sustainable and long-lasting development of the regions.
Finally, with regard to the issue of disabilities, I have requested that the aims of the ERDF should include a specific commitment to promote measures aimed at removing the architectural barriers in projects financed by the Fund, so as to ensure equal opportunities for accessing the Fund.
With regard to the other issues, particularly the issue of VAT, I believe that they have already been thoroughly discussed previously.
Â Â  â Mr President, last year we said 'yes' to the new countries and 'yes' to their financing, but not for this financing to be at the expense of the financing of disadvantaged areas in the old countries.
Greece has three thousand islands which we all want to visit in July and August, but no one asks how they live the rest of the year, often with no oil, no doctors and no public transport.
We must therefore see that this 0.41% of the budget is not enough; it is less than inadequate for us to cover the outermost regions fairly.
We were told that Greece would get EUR 24 billion.
That is what the former Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, said.
Now the new Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, comes along and says that we shall get just over half of the fourth package.
These are ridiculous arrangements.
Countries cannot progress in this way. The European Union cannot progress in this way.
The Member States must be encouraged to take up resources.
In 2003, we got EUR 2.6 billion, according to Mrs HÃŒbner, and last year we got 1.4 billion.
This year, not a single euro has been entered and seven months have already passed.
This is money which is missing from the market, missing from farmers, missing from production and missing from productivity.
We must at last stop seeing people as numbers because, if we carry on like this, with Mr Blair's policy, you should know that, at your next meal, you will not be served tomatoes, you will be served microchips and, instead of getting fruit and vegetables, you will be getting CD-ROMs and floppy disks.
People live here, not robocops!
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak at this point.
Colleagues will report on future contributions, but I am grateful to you for understanding the difficulties involved in being here for the changed time of the debate.
We have heard some excellent contributions.
I particularly welcomed Mr Galeote Quecedoâs stress on the importance of cohesion to the future of the European Union.
I also agree how welcome an early decision on the budget would be.
That requires a serious focus by all of us on achieving an outcome.
We will certainly undertake to play our part in trying to bring about such agreement.
I also note the emphasis he placed on such issues as VAT and housing.
I say to Members that we will now reflect on the points raised today and examine carefully the reports and the amendments that are adopted tomorrow.
The Presidency will then maintain close contact with Parliament as we move towards a common position, in order to discuss how best to accommodate your concerns.
Some of those concerns were very varied.
Mrs Krehl referred to the success of the cohesion funds in the UK.
I agree, and that is one of the reasons that we agree with the point that Mr Beaupuy made when he called for a focus on the ten new Member States.
Mrs Griesbeck called for agreement but reserved the right to say ââ.
I say to her and others that we should all focus on getting the right answer for the 21st century for Europe.
But, again, today the focus is on the regulations.
As I said in my opening remarks, there are differences of opinion on the package of regulations, but it is clear from the debate that there is a strong consensus between the Council and Parliament on many aspects of reform.
We are all determined to develop a dynamic and efficient EU regional policy that contributes fully to the Unionâs key objectives and helps ensure that enlargement is a success â all except Mr Smith, who read a press release into the record, and perhaps Mr Booth, who seems to have missed the enormous benefits of regional development in England.
But turning now to the mainstream of the debate, Parliament has raised a range of questions and issues regarding the size of future structural funds budget, as well as its distribution between the Member States and their regions.
A number of Members, especially MrÂ Hatzidakis and Mr Andria, have defended the broad architecture of the Commissionâs proposals, which would focus an expanded structural funds budget on three objectives â convergence, competitiveness and cooperation â and have opposed any modification of the distribution of funds between these three priorities.
MrsÂ Schroedter emphasised the role of the EU regional policy in ensuring EU solidarity.
I agree â although there is evidently a range of views â on how to introduce genuine solidarity in practice.
For example, MrÂ Triantaphyllides argued for a greater focus on the poorer Member States, while Mr Allister suggested that the Commissionâs proposals would allocate too much to the new Members.
The Council is also pursuing a debate on the best way to focus and deliver the funds in the next financial perspective so that they make the most efficient contribution to the EUâs regional development; asking a range of questions regarding the Commissionâs proposals for the allocation of the funds, for the distribution between the three objectives, on the emphasis placed on convergence funding for richer regions, primarily in the richer Member States and the proposed 50-50 split of funding between the old and new Member States.
Others have questioned aspects of the technical rules for delivering programmes, such as the application of the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, where there was a welcome reference to flexibility on the way that applied, and the treatment of VAT and other expenditure.
These are complex issues and how we resolve them will have a major impact on the effectiveness of future structural fund spending.
I noted that most parties in Parliament and the Council are broadly supportive of the Commissionâs proposals to strengthen the strategic focus of structural fund spending on the Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg agendas.
We all want a rigorous evaluation and more flexible and efficient mechanisms for delivering projects and we are all eager to maintain robust rules for monitoring expenditure so that structural fund spending is rigorously accounted for.
We can agree with Mr Silva Peneda and Mrs Krehl on the need to simplify procedures for delivering structural fund programmes.
While we welcome many of the Commissionâs useful initiatives in this area, the Council can certainly agree with Mr Silva Peneda that there is scope for even greater simplification of some of the proposals in the draft regulation.
We can also agree with Mr HarangozÃ³ and others on the need to maximise private sector involvement in the programmes.
As for the priorities for structural fund support, again the Council and Parliament have much in common.
On the ERDF, we all agree on the need to maintain an appropriate level of concentration on a limited number of priorities and, as Mr Fava has argued, to strengthen the focus on activities, such as innovation, research and development in support for Lisbon targets.
On the ESF, we can agree with Mr Silva Peneda on the need for a clear focus on the European Employment Strategy.
The outstanding issues are now clear.
Both the Council and Parliament are eager to maintain a strong principle of partnership so that national, regional and local stakeholders continue to participate actively in the delivery of programmes.
However, there are differences that we need to resolve on working with partners.
Similarly, there is widespread support for measures to improve the effectiveness of structural funds.
But we have differing views on some aspects of the Commissionâs proposals.
For example, the Council has been unable to offer support for the Commissionâs proposals to establish obligatory performance and contingency reserves, because we fear that the administrative difficulties and bureaucratic cost would outweigh any concrete benefits they might achieve.
These are not insurmountable difficulties, but we need to work closely together to resolve these differences over the coming months.
We will take Parliamentâs views into account as we prepare new compromise texts to be discussed in the Council working group.
My colleague Alan Johnson will be visiting the Committee on Regional Development on 12 September, and will be happy to discuss these issues further with Members then.
We will keep in close contact with the rapporteurs to discuss matters with them as the Councilâs position develops.
From todayâs debate I have a very much clearer understanding of Parliamentâs views on these very important dossiers.
Time is tight and our two institutions will need to cooperate closely.
For my part, I can assure you that the Council will work constructively and effectively with you to find a way forward.
I look forward to our cooperation over the coming months to establish the common ground on which we can build a cohesion policy fit for a new Europe in the 21st century.
Â Â  Mr President, taken as a whole, the draft regulations for the structural funds achieve their intended purposes, but, in my opinion, several issues are not resolved accordingly to the tasks that have been set out.
I shall note three of them.
I unequivocally support improvement of the financial management of the European Union funds, as well as stronger discipline in project preparation and implementation; however, the application of the n+2 principle to the Cohesion Fund can lead to the directly opposite â hurried project preparation and implementation and an ineffective and wasteful use of European Union taxpayersâ money.
It would also significantly reduce the capacity of the new Member States to absorb the grants of the Cohesion Fund.
As a minimum requirement, I propose considering the n+3 principle.
Secondly, I consider that we must seriously evaluate and rework the extension to seven years of the period for aid programmes and conditions contained in the draft regulations, as well as the requirement for relocated businesses to repay the grant of the Structural Fund, which is in blatant contradiction to the single market principles, constitutes an infringement of competition and fundamental freedoms of the European Union.
Thirdly, we must preserve the possibility of financing projects from the private cofinancing of European Union funds, without involving national public funding.
Therefore I propose that we provide a possibility of including private cofinancing in general attributable costs.
In that way it would be possible to carry out projects for a greater total amount and make the use of national public funding more effective.
Â Â  MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ HÃŒbner, ladies and gentlemen, it is at moments of political uncertainty, like the one that we are experiencing, that the European institutions, in order to be credible, have to demonstrate strength and provide definite answers to the demands of the citizens.
Parliament, as a consequence, must have the ability to transform political ideas into decisive measures.
The reports we are examining today represent an effective answer to the very many issues relating to the cohesion policy and to regional development that emerged in the wake of enlargement.
Statistical criteria alone are not enough to demonstrate the real economic situation of the various European regions lagging behind in development and they are insufficient for providing tangible answers in terms of solidarity to those regions that have still to overcome the hardships due to structural difficulties or to objective situations such as insularity or peripherality.
I should like to stress that the cohesion policy must not be merely an opportunity for stating its decisive importance for achieving European integration and for the genuine involvement of all citizens.
In order to be effective, constructive, and above all credible, it will have to be supported by sufficient financial resources.
The 0.46% reserved for the cohesion policy under the proposal for a regulation is a modest figure, in view of the large increase in the population eligible for inclusion under the âConvergenceâ objective following an unprecedented enlargement.
With regard to our group, we agree with the proposals contained in the reports, which, inter alia, are the product of in-depth discussions and mediations.
On this subject, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs and the supporters.
I should just like to focus on a few items relating in particular to the European Fisheries Fund, in which fishing boat engines are not included among the processes of modernisation.
Renovating the fleet does not necessarily mean increasing the fishing effort.
To conclude, I reaffirm the need to overcome the limits of the obsolete model, which focuses primarily on the land, seeking to obtain full acknowledgement of the special nature of maritime cross-border problems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioners, it seems to me that, logically enough, the proposal by Parliament that is beginning to take shape is more or less in line with the long-term draft budget we presented earlier.
I shall concentrate on the European Social Fund.
The Social Fund has two overarching tasks which have become more and more important: to bolster the employment strategy and to promote social integration and combat discrimination.
These are two challenges faced by the EU in the new and globalised society with its demographic changes.
That is why these objectives are more important than ever.
Lifelong learning is very important to increasing the level of employment.
Europe will not be able to compete with India and China, with their social models and with their pay and conditions in the labour market.
Instead, we must compete, for example, through research and development and through the skills possessed by the EUâs labour force.
This is something for which the Member States, businesses and the two sides of industry must accept responsibility, but the EU can make a valuable contribution by increasing skills throughout our area.
We have a host of disadvantaged groups which need to participate more not only in the development of society but also in the labour market.
In order to cope with the competition from outside, we need everyone â women especially â to participate in the labour market in the future.
Women are still under-represented and discriminated against in the labour market.
The same is true of people with disabilities who, like people from countries outside Europe, are at present excluded from the labour market to an incredibly high degree.
Allow me to draw attention to a number of important points.
It is good that the transnational dimension is increasing.
We are retaining the innovative dimension that has existed in, for example, Equal.
It is important for the Social Fund to be able to operate to some extent in conjunction with other funds at local and regional levels.
In conclusion, I agree with MrÂ Å pidla who said how important it was, in the future too, for partnership and the two sides of industry to play a prominent role in the work of the Social Fund.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to call most emphatically for a degree of consistency.
When we voted on the BÃ¶ge report a few weeks ago, we made it a rule that we would not extend the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund.
We made it a rule that enterprises that had benefited from the Structural Funds would have to remain in the same place for five years.
We are now planning to change that.
A couple of weeks ago we had one opinion, and now we intend to change our minds.
I would appeal for a degree of consistency.
In the BÃ¶ge report we decided that if the n+2 rule were extended to the Cohesion Fund, it would become impossible in many instances, especially in the case of the new Member States, to benefit from this Fund when implementing large projects.
Similarly, it would appear that while we are giving money to businesses with one hand, we are taking it away with the other, since we are now introducing the rule that VAT will not be an eligible expense, after so many poor countries and regions have joined the European Union.
Polish children say that, âwho gives and takes away winds up in hellâ, and I would appeal for us not to give with one hand and take away with the other.
As far as VAT is concerned, and presuming that the amendments are not adopted tomorrow, I would call on the Commissioner and the Council to give serious though to a zero rate for VAT on investments made under European funds.
A zero rate of VAT would make it possible for those who do not want EU funds to return to the budgets of the individual countries to find common ground with those who cannot afford to double their contributions as a result of the changes currently being proposed.
I would urge the House to take these concerns seriously, and they are indeed serious concerns, particularly in the case of the new Member States.
I would urge Members to ensure that enlargement does not become an illusion.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warm congratulations to the five rapporteurs. I should like especially to express my warm congratulations on the excellent job done by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Casa.
I shall comment on the report by Mr Casa and defend my amendments.
The Casa report tries to attach a great deal of importance to balance and respect for the environment and to the proper management of fish stocks.
I would add that we need to look at how we are also going to protect European fishermen.
I therefore have three proposals: firstly, to allow fishing equipment which respects the environment; secondly, for there to be the facility to acquire equipment to improve fishermen's health and safety conditions and, thirdly, for there to be the facility to change engines on fishing vessels up to the same horsepower.
We cannot send our fishermen out to fish for us with engines which are 20 or 25 years old.
The second part concerns aquaculture; this must be protected, it must be enlarged and it must produce more fish.
Why?
Because the global demand for fish has increased.
Either we overfish, which means disrupting the ecosystem, or we provide the facility for more fish to be produced by aquaculture.
That is why the European Union needs to support this sector as much as it can.
What is of crucial importance is that these enterprises protect the environment, they are environmentally-friendly.
That is what must take top priority.
It does not matter if they are small, medium-sized or large enterprises.
I hope that the small enterprises will become big and the big enterprises bigger, so that they can produce more fish, which our planet needs, instead of our overfishing.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to highlight a number of what I regard as key points before tomorrowâs vote on the regulations and the Structural Funds.
We are opposed to the full application of the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, as in our opinion this could result in the new Member States losing out on substantial amounts of cohesion funding.
We should also endeavour to find some way of ensuring that VAT falls under the category of eligible expenditure. This will be particularly important in the case of the European Regional Development Fund in the event that future recipients of funding include towns and villages.
Our demands to this effect met with incomprehension on the part of the rapporteur, the coordinator and a number of other Members, and I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed at the outcome of our endeavours.
I believe in the common sense of the majority, however, and I therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, it is through our support for Europeâs most disadvantaged regions, particularly those in Eastern Europe, that our solidarity is given expression.
I would like to emphasise something about which previous speakers have not pin-pointed, namely that European structural policy also kick-starts innovation in those regions that are not typical candidates for support.
What I would like to stress is the importance of Objective II, employment and competitiveness, whereby Europe helps to give infrastructures and innovation and international dimension.
Both in Europeâs traditional centres of economic activity and elsewhere, the result of such impetus will be growth, from which, at the end of the day, we will all benefit.
Structural grants do not just support growth and European pilot projects; I would emphasise that promoting the competitiveness of regions helps to get the European ideal accepted in Western Europe.
While this is particularly true of grants from the Social Fund, it also applies in the case of Objective II, territorial cooperation.
Whether as a consequence of cross-border social institutions, enterprise zones or chambers of commerce, cross-border association is the way by which the European ideal is lived.
It is because it is important that this form of European support be maintained that we endorse the principles underlying the Commission proposal.
We have to give very serious thought to how, even with less money at our disposal, we can retain the structural policyâs political substance.
We will have to rearrange the way in which structural and agricultural policies are funded, and what that means is that agricultural cofinancing must be required at national level, along with rules that make public-private partnerships simpler.
We will, in future, also have to think about funding structural programmes by taking out loans.
If there have to be cuts, they will have to be made across the board, in all fields of action, and not to the detriment of individual regions or programmes.
The bottom line is that European structural support works.
We should fight for its political substance.
We appeal to the Heads of State or Government to do their part for the benefit of Europeâs regions.
Â Â  I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the coordinators for their work; it has not been easy, given the current situation, but they are succeeding and they deserve all of our support.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her efforts to understand Parliament's position; we hope that she will make every effort to facilitate an agreement which is as urgent as it is necessary.
We would call on the new Presidency, whom we welcome on the other side of the fence, to demonstrate, through concrete actions, their European passion, which we would like to believe is sincere.
However, as those who have been governing for some time are well aware, nothing exists unless it is in the budgets.
So the first requirement if Europe is to be credible, as Mr Blair wishes, is a sufficient budget produced on time.
We also hope that both the Commission and the Presidency will provide compensation, which is acceptable both in terms of its fairness and of its gradual nature, for the regions and Member States likely to suffer significant financial losses as a result of the new allocation of resources for the enlarged Europe, as well as preferential treatment for regions affected by the statistical effect, regions affected by the natural effect â the outermost regions â and areas with special structural difficulties: mountain regions, border regions ..., regions suffering depopulation or low population density and regions with accessibility problems, such as my region, AragÃ³n.
Furthermore, we want the new objective of competitiveness, which must relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and redouble efforts on R+D, to serve also to reduce the technological gap between regions and Member States.
Anybody who thinks that Europe can make progress on the basis of a few top people while the majority remains digitally illiterate is guilty, ladies and gentlemen, of complete naivete or a lack of intellectual honesty.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is one of the pillars of European integration.
It will become even more important during the next programming period, since it will act as a tool both for reducing economic differences between regions and for making Europe more competitive on the global market.
Although I very much appreciate the work done by all those involved in formulating Parliamentâs position on the drafts, I am disappointed at the lack of interest that has been shown to date in most of the new Member Statesâ demands and needs.
The debates that have lasted for many months within the Committee on Regional Development have left me with the impression that the suggestions made by Members from the new Member States have not been given due consideration.
By way of contrast, a great deal of attention has been paid to the needs of other players, such as the former cohesion countries, and to remote regions and regions affected by the statistical effect.
Their demands were not only listened to, but also given due attention.
I find the attitude of Members from the former cohesion countries particularly irksome in this connection, since they have so far snubbed our proposals to keep the current rules in place, even though they themselves benefited from these rules in the past.
I am thinking in particular of the n+3 rule for the Cohesion Fund and of the rule classing VAT as eligible expenditure for non-taxpayers.
I regret to have to say that the majority of concessions made to the new Member States related either to the report on the current Structural Funds Regulation or to the report on the Cohesion Fund.
Parliament is not entitled to make direct changes to the Commissionâs proposals in either of these cases.
The same demands were flatly refused in the case of the proposal on the European Regional Development Fund, however, to which we are entitled to make changes.
To put it another way, concessions have only been made to the new Member States in instances where they are of very limited significance.
As I see it, a decision to remove VAT entirely from the list of eligible expenses would be a major political blunder, not to mention insensitive treatment of the new Member States.
It could prompt tens of millions of citizens in these countries to ask whether they are really being treated equally, given that they are being denied the benefits of advantageous rules that the old Member States enjoyed for many years.
I should therefore like to call upon the goodwill and understanding of this House, and I would ask Members to vote in favour of keeping these rules in place during the 2007-2013 period.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, especially Mr Hatzidakis, on the very good job they have done throughout the procedure.
It is an undisputed fact that cohesion policy is the lever for the development of the European Union.
Cohesion policy has contributed to development and to the creation of jobs, with positive results for the convergence of regions and the Member States of the European Union.
The tools of cohesion, the Structural Funds, bring Europe close to the citizens, contribute towards development and demonstrate in practice the principle of solidarity.
Today, cohesion policy is being called on to face important challenges and extended inequalities within the Europe of the 25: we need urban development, but we also need rural development.
Today, cohesion policy is being called on to help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategy.
We cannot have any choice but to guarantee the Structural Funds the minimum resources needed to allow them to operate effectively, by which I mean 0.41% or a minimum of EUR 336 billion.
Consequently, what is needed is for there to be no further delay, so that structural policies and the corresponding regulations are brought to a close as quickly as possible during 2005.
Â Â  After expressing the obligatory, though heartfelt, congratulations due to our rapporteurs, I would like to focus very specifically on an issue that many speakers have already touched on: the issue of refunding VAT payments.
In my home country, I represent a region that is perhaps the poorest.
I know there is a certain logic in not supporting expenditures from community funds that are really revenues belonging to the treasuries of Member States.
I would, nevertheless, like to present the other side of the coin.
Local authorities in my region that are planning on taking part in the development measures through the Unionâs structural policy, will be deprived of the opportunity to apply â because of their very poverty â if this burden falls on them too.
Please consider very carefully how you decide regarding these proposed amendments.
Let the rule stay as it is!
I would like to raise another point: Union regulations are constantly changing, and we, the representatives of the new Member States, feel that these changes are increasingly to our disadvantage.
This process must be halted, because in the event of things carrying on as they are, enlargement will not be a success, but a massive fillip for Euroscepticism and the political extremes.
Fellow Members, please act responsibly and consistently.
If something has worked until now, let it stay, and do not try to push the very poorest regions to the periphery!
Â Â  â The two recent no votes on the EU Constitution are a warning from the citizens that Europe must provide a different social model, one that differs markedly from that of a United States of Europe.
The citizens of Europe have spoken clearly, and what they want is more citizenship, more social concerns and, especially, more European social model.
The purpose of the European Social Fund, one of Europeâs founding principles, has always, in tandem with cohesion policy, been to help people, and has consequently been the policy that people have identified with most.
It is my view that the Social Fund, along with other funds, must not be allowed to encourage a two-speed Europe.
Its aim is not to exacerbate exclusion, or somehow to foster discrimination in all its various forms in our society.
Its aim is precisely the opposite â to put people first.
The time has come to show people that we intend to continue to invest in them.
We must, therefore, get the social model up and running.
The time has come to make sure that objectives are met and that the statistical effect does not make the innocent carry the can for the guilty.
We must guarantee that we do not jump from comitology into a numbers game and that the smallest regions are not made to foot the whole bill for the change.
Our hope and expectation is that the package of regulations before us today, despite all the financing that has remained on stand-by, will actually help to implement a Europe of the regions with the people at the forefront of priorities.
This purpose will be our driving force for Europe.
Â Â  â Circumstances have conspired to ensure that this debate on the future of economic and social cohesion is taking place at a particularly crucial time for the European project.
If we are to emerge from this crisis, the European Institutions, and in particular the Council, must draw up a regional development policy that is characterised by the kind of vision and solidarity needed to meet the enormous challenges facing the EU.
Accordingly, the United Kingdom, which has just assumed the EU Presidency, has a huge responsibility.
I view this Presidency with a mixture of apprehension and hope.
I feel apprehensive because the United Kingdom is, as we know, one the six countries seeking to restrict the EU budget to 1% of GDP, which I feel runs counter to a strong cohesion policy and to the ambitious objectives for future EU action that we wish to set.
I also feel apprehensive because of the UK Governmentâs stance on the renationalisation of the European economic and social cohesion effort, which, were it to happen, would amount to a terrible lack of solidarity not only with the new Member States but also with certain regions that are still in need, namely Portugal, Spain and Greece.
Along with these concerns, however, comes a great deal of hope, in that the United Kingdom is known to be in favour of attaching priority to strengthening the EUâs competitiveness, without which there can be no strong economic growth, and to ensuring that it is at least equal to that of the United States of America.
This will in turn enhance job creation.
We will not fulfil this objective if we do not have the courage to implement the Lisbon Strategy in full.
A strong, revitalised European cohesion policy with adequate financial resources is one of the crucial factors in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
In the least-favoured regions of Europe, there is enormous potential for competitiveness and development that needs to be tapped.
This should be one of the main objectives of European cohesion policy.
Â Â  Mr President, one year ago the European Union enlarged to include 10 new, and mostly poor, Member States.
Although we constantly hear references to balanced development from all quarters, in the majority of cases these are nothing but hot air.
Attempts are in fact now being made, âon the flyâ as it were, to change the principles currently governing the implementation of the main tools for funding regional development.
Why are different and harsher conditions being imposed on the new Member States than those that benefited the development of the 15Â old Member States?
Classing non-recoverable VAT as non-eligible expenditure and introducing the n+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund are obvious obstacles to the development of the new Member States.
Do measures of this kind show solidarity within Europe?
The present principles should not now be changed, as otherwise the poor will not be able to afford to benefit from EU aid.
The new Member States must have the same development opportunities as those which were enjoyed by the 15Â old Member States, and which they put to outstanding use.
It is time for the talk of a Europe of equal opportunities and balanced development to finally gain legislative force.
We should make changes for the better instead of for the worse, and we should not divide Europe into those who are better off and those who are worse off.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has led to a widening of the economic and social development gap between the regions of the Union.
The cohesion policy, of undoubted added value for all parts of Europe, must remain more than ever the instrument of European solidarity, aimed at reducing regional disparities.
I share the rapporteursâ opposition to any change in the overall architecture of this reform, any re-nationalisation of regional policy or any drastic cutback in Community spending.
The proposal to impose financial sanctions on companies which, after receiving European funds, decide to relocate their businesses has now become indispensable.
Additionally, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Development for their strong support both for the Special Fund of EUR 1.1 billion for the outermost regions and for the possibility of extending the scope of the ERDF, on an exceptional basis, to finance operating aid to these regions to compensate, in both these cases, for the extra costs due to their remoteness.
Moreover, I ask for full implementation of the requirement set out in Article 299 paragraph 2 of the Treaty, providing for particular treatment for the outermost regions and guaranteeing them access to the Structural Funds, particularly in the case of those regions whose GDP is already in excess of 75% of the Community average.
With regard to the European Fisheries Fund, I am pleased to note that a real equilibrium has been achieved between environmental concerns and socio-economic considerations.
The Committee on Fisheries has accepted my proposal to enable the financing, through the European Fisheries Fund, of public aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet in the outermost regions.
In the majority of the outermost regions, fishing is a very recent business and fish stocks are still abundant.
It would be unthinkable and counterproductive to prevent this type of aid.
However, I regret the rejection of my request that public support for the transformation of outermost regions should be maintained at the current rate of 75%, and not 50% as proposed.
I hope the Council will follow the route opened up by the European Parliament on this reform, which is vital and urgent for so many European regions.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Communityâs regional policy exists just as much for the sake of cohesion among Member States as of cohesion between the different European regions.
Solidarity requires us to direct the bulk of the Funds to the new Member States, but we must also remember that certain regions of the old Member States still need to gain the benefit of the leverage effect produced by the Structural Funds in order to implement projects of structural importance and to consolidate the progress they have made in their development.
I therefore support the Commissionâs proposal, because it offers a fair balance between focusing the funds on the poorest regions â and therefore on the new Member States â and giving attention to the poorer regions of the old, wealthier Member States.
To disturb this balance would not only be dangerous for European cohesion, but it could also heighten the phenomenon of European citizensâ disaffection with the European project, because European regional policy is the most visible and best- known policy in our countries.
I therefore wish the Council a rapid and favourable conclusion to the negotiations on the financial perspectives in order to equip regional policy with an adequate budget and to assist the regions which still require help.
Â Â  Mr President, cohesion is the key to the social construction in the Europe of the 25, and, as we all share responsibility for this, the new Member States and poorer regions should be able to count on our solidarity.
The structural funds must allow the reconstruction in those new Member States to run as quickly and successfully as possible.
Europe must display solidarity.
We should not be caught up in self-interest, for that will not do the public in the 15 old Member States any good either, and, quite apart from aid from funds and structural funds, we should also provide access to our countries and ensure no regions are screened off.
I would now like to turn to the European Social Fund, in respect of which Mr Silva Peneda has done such an excellent job.
The ESFâs review, as currently proposed, is important.
Why?
Funds are being set aside for the Lisbon objectives with a clear focus on the new countries, and this is something I wholeheartedly support.
In fact, this morning in the Netherlands, I enquired about our expectations surrounding the ESF.
The response that I received from the Netherlands will shock you: they were quite clear; they wanted nothing.
That comment is in sharp contrast with the opinion of local councils and social organisations in my country, which are opposed to the social exclusion of anyone.
It is therefore only fair that the ESF should provide for jobs and training for all those who are socially excluded, wherever the problems may occur.
In short, we should not use the funds, and particularly the ESF, to build new walls.
The large city issue is universal.
We must learn and innovate across Europe.
There is added value, even for the 15 old Member States.
Europe can play a stimulating role not only in directives, but also in this sense, because even the old 15 still have a thing or two to learn.
Â Â  Mr President, the Structural Funds are an essential example of EU solidarity â solidarity between the richest and the poorest parts of the EU â and I am delighted to see that the Structural Funds have been refocused to concentrate on achieving the Lisbon goals.
There will be better strategic planning, and there will be increased simplification, which is what we are looking for.
In the Hatzidakis report, we are also asking the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of making sure that the money is spent properly, and we are demanding that the Finance Minister in each Member State signs off the accounts on an annual basis.
We want to see an end to the blame game, blaming the Commission for the failures within the Member States.
In Wales, we have enjoyed generous support from the EU Structural Funds, and I would like to see that support continue for West Wales and the Valleys.
If the Council gets its skates on, we may sort out the budget before December and we may see a situation where we receive the maximum amount of funding.
Being poor is not a badge of pride, but, on this occasion, it would be a window of opportunity to help our poorest communities.
I am also pleased to see that there is a reference now to inactivity in helping people who are inactive in the workplace.
Â Â  Mr President, I have risen to speak in this debate, which relates to the Council regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, as a representative of a new Member State, Poland.
I would therefore like to start by saying how delighted I am at the fact that the work on these regulations has continued, even though the Council has failed to reach an agreement on the new Financial Perspective for the years 2007-2013.
The fact that these regulations are being prepared a long way in advance of the period during which they will apply will enable the Member States, and in particular the new Member States, to make appropriate preparations in terms of public authority structures, the various types of institutions, beneficiaries of the projects and national legislation.
In view of the limited time available, I would merely like to highlight two issues that are particularly important for the new Member States.
The first is the problem of VAT, or more specifically the problem of classing this tax as an eligible project cost.
If such a decision were taken, this would have particular significance for public beneficiaries of projects, which do not pay VAT.
In Poland, for example, this would affect the majority of projects, and in such instances VAT would increase the costs of implementing these projects by more than one fifth.
This, in turn, would lead to a reduction in the number of projects submitted, as well as frequent financial problems for beneficiaries.
Mr Hatzidakis has agreed in his report to such a solution with regard to VAT and the Cohesion Fund.
A group of Members has proposed that a similar solution also be adopted with regard to the European Regional Development Fund, as there is no logical reason why different solutions should be adopted for different funds.
A second important proposal that has been submitted by a group of Members is that the n+2 rule should not apply to projects implemented under the Cohesion Fund.
This would allow greater flexibility with regard to this Fund, as well as making it easier to implement large infrastructure projects, especially in the new Member States.
Adopting such a solution would also be in accordance with the provisions relating to this matter in the BÃ¶ge report on the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
Finally, I very much hope that a majority of Members of this House will ultimately vote in favour of these two important proposals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Europe needs a regional policy characterised by solidarity.
We have very big differences between regions in the EU, especially between new and old Member States.
That is unacceptable on a continent where importance is attached to welfare.
We cannot, however, rely on the internal economic market alone being able to bridge the gulfs, and that is why we need the Structural Funds.
The new regions should therefore be allocated a larger proportion of the Structural Funds, and the richer countries must have their own regional equalisation policies.
At the same time, the EU countries must also, however, emphasise that growth and research provide scope for regional development.
The European Parliament is now submitting a proposal that makes sense in financial terms too.
We also emphasise how important it is for environmental work to be given priority within the Structural Funds.
Finally, I wish to emphasise that, according to the Commission and the European Parliament, there are regions with permanent geographical disadvantages, including sparsely populated and mountainous regions, which also need to be compensated via the Structural Funds, because the geographical conditions do not change over time.
I assume that the European Council will take account of this too in the future financial perspective.
Â Â  This is the first time that urban public transport has figured in the regulations on the Cohesion Funds as an objective to be supported.
On the part of the Committee on Transport, we welcome and support this.
It is important to make the proposal more precise, however.
In the case of urban fixed-rail public transport systems, in addition to the track we need to include the vehicles or, to use the technical terminology, as in my proposed amendment, the so-called rolling stock.
After all, without it the giant would only have one arm.
Likewise, the routes used for bus transport, in other words the roads that carry the bulk of transport by bus, must be included and listed here.
So, what is it we are saying?
We are saying that it is vital to develop route infrastructure and vehicles together in order to achieve results; the two are inseparable.
We are striving to reduce congestion by making public transport in our cities as attractive as possible.
Well then, for European cities â which are eligible to receive cohesion support â the proposal that I am asking Parliament to support will mean a genuine improvement and a rise in standards.
The Committee on Transport also proposes extending the objectives of the Cohesion Fund to include motorway-type sections of access roads linking larger regional towns into the trans-European network.
In some regions, the towns have a crucial role and are a major wellspring of cohesion.
Appropriate infrastructure connections could significantly increase the existing competitive potential of these towns and thereby also enhance cooperation.
I ask Parliament to give resounding support to this proposal, too.
Â Â  â Given that I shall speak about the European Fisheries Fund, I should first like to praise the Committee on Fisheriesâ work on this draft.
I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague Mr Casa on his good work on what is set to be one of the most important issues to be addressed in this legislature.
I believe that it is essential for the European Fisheries Fund to be the major instrument in squaring the objective of conserving the biological resources of the sea with fishing possibilities.
Against this backdrop, the money earmarked for this purpose must be consistent with the actual needs of the fisheries sector, which is integrated into an enlarged Europe with new challenges ahead.
Given the fact that the financial envelope for the 2007-2013 period is virtually the same as the one in the Community framework still in force and that Europe has enlarged from 15 to 27, it strikes me as both logical and necessary that the overall financial allocation for this Fund should be increased.
The indicative fund level, as just mentioned, is no higher than of 0.5% of the Community budget, expressed as an annual average.
As well as the financial aspect, I feel that the intervention strategy proposed by the Commission should also be changed.
I refer, for example, to the restrictions as regards the objectives and general intervention rules for the fund that the Commission is seeking to place on businesses.
It will be impossible to ask our businesses for competitiveness and environment protection technology if we only support micro and small enterprises.
I now turn to the issue of modernising fishing vessels.
I feel that the Commission must rethink its positions on replacing Community fleet vessels.
Banning them strikes me as wrong in terms of economic, biological, safety and operational capability considerations.
Lastly, I should also like to point out that the outermost regions must continue to enjoy the protection of the common fisheries policy.
Accordingly, I feel that the derogations currently applying to the outermost regions, as enshrined in the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), must remain in the new text of the European Fisheries Fund.
Additionally, I wish to stress the importance of the idea of strengthening some of the measures contained therein.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work of synthesis, which has been demonstrated by the compromise amendments supported by all of the political groups.
From the text approved by the Committee on Fisheries, Commissioner, I would like you to take account of certain very positive issues and to take good account of them, because they reflect the reality of this sector â which some of us know well since we see it on a daily basis â for example, that Member States can present national plans throughout the period of programming or that the article relating to equal opportunities between men and women be strengthened and this view of gender equality integrated into fisheries activities, and, with regard to aquaculture, the extension of aid to medium-sized businesses, not just micro and small businesses, and that the improvement in the working conditions and safety of workers in the sector can be funded.
Also important is the consensus reached on eligibility criteria, the low level of employment and fisheries activity in decline, which make it logical that the reference to municipalities of less than 100Â 000 inhabitants be removed.
Two more controversial points, the renovation and modernisation of vessels and engines and mixed companies as an alternative to scrapping, have been saved in a positive manner, as a result of a good willingness to negotiate.
My group is in favour of the fleet being able to continue with the process of renovation and modernisation, provided that it does not mean an increase in capacity.
We have the obligation to keep fisheries activity alive and well in the European Union, guaranteeing decent salaries and conditions for workers in the sector and preserving resources, but we also have the obligation, Commissioner, to save lives at sea.
My region, Galicia, knows a lot about this, since over the last two years many of its people have been lost at sea as a result of construction problems, structural problems involving vessels.
We cannot allow this to carry on and we must continue to support the renovation of the fleet.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make two specific and brief comments in the two minutes that are allocated to me.
I should like to start by saying something about the âObjective 2â regions, which should not be left out in the cold.
It is undoubtedly a good thing that the limited resources be mainly deployed in the area of the Lisbon objectives and that innovation policy be central to this.
Although that is, of course, to be welcomed, there is hardly any room, if any at all, for the so-called traditional projects which are, in fact, just as important to the local economy and employment.
Hence this appeal for a really decentralised policy, because it is invariably the regional policy makers who really know what measures are needed to boost the local economy with the future in mind.
Regional competitiveness and regional employment, for those are the issues at stake, currently account for some 17% of the resources of the structural funds.
Surely it cannot be the intention, Commissioner, and I would also say to the Council â not currently present â that the budgets in this area need to be reduced in absolute terms, simply because the current âObjective 2â regions then have to suddenly pay the price for a lack of European solidarity
Secondly, as Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Berend have already said, it is crucial that cofinancing from the private sector should remain an option.
Hence our express request to retain the purport of Amendment 52.
Finally, we unreservedly support Amendments 124 and 126 about VAT.
As has been said repeatedly on this platform, if the non-recoverable VAT is abolished as a cost qualifying for subsidy, this would mean a heavy blow to very many projects, for example in education.
I am sure the Commissioner will agree with me that we should avoid this at all costs.
Â Â  â I should like to join in the congratulations for MrÂ Casa on his outstanding work.
I also wish to commend the Commission, and the Commissioners attending this House today, on its positive proposal.
Yet I must also mention what, to my mind, are the major omissions in your proposal, namely the Natura 2000 network and its presence on the oceans, and the undertakings made by the Commission as regards the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).
These are international commitments that should lead to compulsory expenditure on the Commissionâs part.
Unfortunately, whilst the Commissionâs proposal is a good one on many levels, there is a glaring gap in this area.
I should like to call on the Commission and the Council to plug that gap as soon as possible and to make their final decision on the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, of all the instruments with which European employment policy is implemented, the European Social Fund is the most important; for the period between 2000 and 2006, it made available EURÂ 80Â billion for measures to combat unemployment and for education and training, with EURÂ 12 billion going to Germany alone.
Between 2007 and 2013, priority is to be given to helping workers and businesses to adapt and to prolonging working lives.
Following the last European Council, it is to be hoped that the British will come up with one initiative or another as regards how this is to be funded.
Glad though I am that the social partners are to be involved in devising and implementing projects, and that we are, together, endeavouring to improve the exchange of best practices, I do repudiate the Commissionâs ideas about separate ESF projects for convergence on the one hand and regional competitiveness on the other.
MrÂ Silva Peneda was right to point out that this would produce the novelty of a Europe with multi-speed support.
Having measures that benefit only the new Member States and do the old ones no good at all will not work, for what we need is solidarity.
It is not acceptable that the Commission is in favour of ESF funds being used only if the public purse pays its share as well.
The consequence of this would be that many projects would go under for lack of money.
A third point I would like to make is that no reference whatever is made to the possibility of the ESF helping to run courses open to craft industry trainees from various firms.
In my own country, Germany, these are run in the craft industry associationsâ training facilities, and with a great deal of success.
They pass on new, up-to-date, and important business knowledge.
For this reason, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls for these measures, from which trainees and apprentices benefit, and which help small and medium-sized enterprises financially, to be continued.
I ask all those who are in earnest about support for SMEs â which are, after all, the backbone of the European economy â to make good use of this opportunity and vote in favour of this amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make the general comment that structural policy is one area of Community policy of which people in Europe are very much aware, and of which they generally take a favourable view; in this, it resembles the agricultural policy, being also a policy that promotes the interests of rural areas.
Although financial instruments and the rules under which they operate still vary, our long-term objective must be to have a policy that applies to the EU as a whole.
We all have to consider how, in future, we may foster closer cooperation between the various funds and policy areas and thereby arrive at a generally coherent policy.
More specifically, there are a number of points to which I would like to draw your attention.
One of them is to be found in paragraph 47 of the Hatzidakis report: the difference in the levels of support given to regions on either side of the new internal borders must not be allowed to exceed 20%, or else competition will be distorted.
Another is the simplification of administration: if the administrative authorities are not to face excessive obstacles in their day-to-day handling of the programmes, the Commission must demonstrate a high degree of flexibility, particularly when programmes are altered or adjusted.
Particular attention needs to be paid to mountain and hill areas, which perform many functions that are vital to the overall viability of the EU and of its rural areas.
Few, if any, of these additional tasks are being performed to their fullest extent, and so the Community needs to intervene in this area if we are to have an overarching structural policy.
I would add that, in future, for the sake of policy coherence, competition policy, which imposes limits on aid, will need to be brought much more into line with structural policy than hitherto.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports and for the great deal of work they put into preparing them.
The future reform of structural funding will bring about many changes to regions within the original 15 Member States.
That causes concern in many regions, such as my own region in Northern Ireland which has received excellent support over many years. A great deal has been achieved as a result of that.
I believe that the greatest problem for the European Union â and perhaps it should reflect upon the two ânoâ votes in France and the Netherlands â is that we try to make the one suit fit everyone, from one end of the Union to the other.
It does not work that way; we cannot make that happen; that is one of the great misunderstandings.
While we understand the needs and requirements of many in the ten new Member States, it is of little comfort to those who will lose out substantially.
Northern Ireland, where I come from, is a much better place than it was ten years ago.
It is not perfect by any means, and I would not claim otherwise, but we have, to some degree, an imperfect peace, which we did not have at that time.
However, in the last 30 years we have suffered the scourge of terrorism, when our towns, cities and villages were bombed to pieces.
Many people lost their lives, but the will and resilience of the people saw us through those dark and terrible days.
The rebuilding had to be paid for, however, so instead of gradual investment in infrastructure and the development of our road, rail and other connections to the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe, instead of upgrading our infrastructure, all the finance went into rebuilding the bombed-out areas.
That has left us with a serious legacy of decay and decline with out-of-date structures and over-capacity in our water and sewage works.
We have not built a single kilometre of motorway in that time.
The west and the north-west of my province are crying out for infrastructural developments that will provide links within the province and encourage industry to those areas.
Our rail system has been improved in recent years but still requires further development in rolling stock.
We have lost out.
We will need further support.
Commissioner, you recently visited Northern Ireland and came to Belfast.
It was a very short visit.
I hope that we will be able to welcome you back in the near future, when you will be able to see and perhaps help us on our way through some of those difficulties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say a few words and I thank you for this opportunity.
I would like to thank all of you for this inspiring debate.
I have been listening carefully to your arguments and I am absolutely convinced that, as we continue our dialogue and cooperation through the consecutive stages of the legislative process, the Commission will be able to accommodate many of your concerns and that it will be to the benefit of our proposals.
In that context the commitment of the Presidency to work in partnership for early results has indeed been encouraging.
I shall briefly make two comments on two issues to which I did not refer in my introductory remarks.
On partnership, I want to say that the Commission fully agrees with all those of you who pleaded for reinforcement of the partnership in the process of implementing the funds.
Yes, it is the principle of partnership that makes the governance of our policy so unique.
My second comment is on an issue quite dear to my heart and that is private capital participation in the financing of cohesion programmes.
The Commission would certainly like to see Member States making use of public-private partnership in the implementation of the cohesion policy and I can tell you that the original proposal has been modified in order to allow Member States to define the co-financing rate at programme and not priority level.
I shall finish by emphasising what unites this House and the Commission, not what divides us.
I am sure that the Commission and Parliament are both convinced that the Unionâs cohesion policy, whilst focusing on the poorest and responding to their needs, must apply to every region of Europe.
The solidarity expressed by this policy was vital for the harmonious development of the Union in the past and it should remain so in the future.
I believe both Parliament and the Commission are convinced that a vibrant and adequately resourced cohesion policy can make an essential contribution to the modernisation of the Unionâs economy by helping it to achieve the Lisbon goals and benefit from the globalisation of markets.
In conclusion, the construction and further development of this policy is our common task and the Commission has drawn strength at every step of the way from the support, both intellectual and political, of this Parliament.
I commit myself to continuing the dialogue between our institutions within and beyond the formal procedures.
Together I am sure we can make something which will be of lasting benefit to our citizens and help them improve the quality of their daily lives.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very closely to your observations and comments, and I should like to thank the House once again for these valuable contributions.
I am delighted that the Commission and Parliament have reached agreement on the basic issues, and we are very much behind the Houseâs efforts to ensure that equality between men and women, and equal opportunities in general, are taken into account in every sphere of the European Social Fund.
Cohesion policy must help to eliminate all forms of discrimination.
In this respect, I would remind the House that the Structural Funds already play a key role in promoting the social inclusion of the Roma and other disadvantaged groups, and will play an even more prominent role in the future.
Cohesion policy must also promote social inclusion, by means of our common objectives in the fight against exclusion.
Parliament reiterated this point, which is in any case one that has the Commissionâs backing.
I can tell you that the Commission is able to accept a total of 68Â amendments.
That leaves 31 amendments that it cannot accept, and the reasons for this are as follows.
Firstly, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the future role that may be played by the social partners in implementing the work of the European Social Fund.
This is why we have accepted Amendments 6, 46 and 54, and having accepted these amendments we cannot accept any amendments that run counter to them.
Our reservations concerning certain other amendments stem from a number of considerations.
Some are horizontal provisions that come under the scope of other regulations, while some overlap with other provisions of either the draft regulation or the present regulation.
Others are unworkable or do not come under the remit of the European Social Fund.
Finally, some are at odds with the principles of healthy and effective financial management.
Honourable Members, I am delighted that the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament has been so fruitful.
The intended outcome of this cooperation is a guarantee that the European Social Fund will continue to function effectively in the future, while adhering to the growth and employment objectives of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
The principles underlying the European Social Fund in the period from 2007 to 2013 will be cohesion, consolidation and simplification, and it will also be underpinned by a partnership extended to involve all key stakeholders.
I am quite sure that a strategy viewed in these terms will be an effective tool in our efforts to boost employment in Europe, to promote social cohesion and equal opportunities and to eliminate all forms of discrimination and disadvantage.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, given the limited time at my disposal I can only comment broadly on the spirit of the amendments tabled.
The Commission can agree to a number of amendments, which also reflect the progress that has been achieved in the Council.
These include eligibility for replacement of engines for small-scale vessels under strict conditions so as to ensure that there is no increase in fishing capacity.
With respect to aid for young fishermen operating in small-scale fisheries and wishing to purchase a second-hand fishing vessel, proposals considered by the Council restrict such aid to the purchase of vessels below twelve metres not using towed gears.
Your request to apply this possibility to all vessels requires further examination.
The scope of socio-economic measures has been extended to training and to compensation for fishermen working on board vessels whose activity has been stopped permanently.
The requirement whereby aid for temporary cessation of activities must be accompanied by a reduction of capacity is withdrawn and replaced by reinstating the current FIFG provisions setting the threshold of Community contribution to all types of temporary cessation.
We stated in Council that EFF-funded plans put forward following the adoption of emergency measures may also cover real-time closures for reasons of concentration of juveniles or of spawning.
It is proposed to extend EFF support to medium-sized enterprises operating in the aquaculture, processing and marketing sectors, while keeping small and micro-enterprises the priority.
Aquaculture is made more visible.
Indeed, we have included aquaculture in the definition of the fisheries sector, and support for aquaculture is explicitly quoted as one of the objectives and missions of the EFF.
Support for inland fisheries, with the exclusion of vessel construction, and the starting-up and restructuring of producers' organisations are reinstated.
There are new funding possibilities to enhance and protect the environment in Natura 2000 areas concerned by fisheries activities.
In addition to other provisions on equal opportunities, we have added support for collective actions aimed at networking and the exchange of experience among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women.
The Commission cannot accept the following proposals that have been included in your report.
The construction or replacement of vessels, even with no increase of capacity.
The Commission cannot accept a proposal that goes against our conservation policy.
Such aid would contribute to maintaining the situation of fleet overcapacity.
The Commission is not prepared to move on this point, which for us remains a fundamental pillar of sustainable fisheries.
The same applies to aid for the establishment of joint ventures.
Such aid benefits mainly private vessel owners and would run counter to our commitments made within international organisations.
However, there is agreement that studies on the feasibility of such joint enterprises could be funded.
Regarding the replacement of engines for all types of vessels, let me repeat that during the Council deliberations the Commission accepted a compromise whereby the replacement of engines would be allowed for small-scale vessels.
I have listened to your views with regard to the extension of aid beyond the parameters already accepted by the Commission.
Clearly, this must be further evaluated.
I am of the view that the installation of young fish farmers need not be financed in the same way as that of young fishermen, because aquaculture is not facing the same recruitment problems as the catching sector.
I am willing to look into this further.
We have proposed the reinstatement of aid for inland fisheries.
However the Commission cannot accept the request to extend aid for the construction of inland fishing vessels, because precaution is also required in inland fishing, where some stocks are reported to be in a bad situation, and given the limits of scientific knowledge in this area.
We nevertheless envisage that vessels operating in inland fishing should enjoy the same treatment as vessels operating in marine fishing.
Finally, we have also carefully examined your amendments concerning the 'horizontal issues' with regard to the management, monitoring and control systems.
As you are no doubt aware, these provisions are very much inspired by the proposals for a Regulation on Structural Funds.
For the sake of coherence among Community instruments, we shall await sufficient progress to be made in the negotiations on these proposals.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
The Commission is in a position to accept the following Amendments: 4, 8 (2nd part, as from âand the creation ofâŠâ), 10, 12, 13, 27 (1st part, up to âgap between regionsâ), 60, 65, 73, 74, 80 (1st part: âthe development ofâŠproject developmentâ), 102 (Article 14.1.2 âfunctionallyâ) and 108.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (1st part: âthe cultural âŠdiversificationÂ ofâ), 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 (2nd part, after âgap between regionsâ), 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 (2nd part: âArticles 8âŠ11â), 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117 (2nd part: âimplementing âŠwater policyâ) 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125 and 126.
The Commission is able to accept the following amendments on condition that they are reworded:
The Commission is able to accept Amendments 32 and 117 on condition that they are reworded.
In the case of the first part, âmanagement âŠwater suppliesâthe Commission is open to accepting investments linked to the supply of water, as well as those related to its management and quality, without for all that funding the operating expenses and salaries in respect of water management.
In the case of the last part, âpromotion âŠNATURA 2000â, the Commission is able to accept the funding of investments related to Natura 2000, but not that of operating and operational expenses.
The Commission is able to accept Amendment 68 on condition that it is reworded: âby supporting urban and rural development and relationshipsâ.
- Concerning the Commissionâs proposal to establish a European Grouping for Territorial Co-operation I am glad to tell you that the Commission is in a position to accept most of the Parliamentâs Amendments.
- The Commission can fully accept the following 17 Amendments : 1Â -Â 7, 12, 14Â -Â 16, 23, 25 - 27, 32 and 35.
- Another 17 Amendments are acceptable in principle/substance, but subject to rewording (Amendments no 8, 9, 13, 17, 20Â -Â 22, 24, 28Â -Â 31, 33, 34, 38, 39 and 41).
- A group of 2 Amendments is only partially acceptable (Amendments no 36 and 37).
- Finally there is a small group of 6 Amendments not acceptable to the Commission (Amendments no 10, 18, 40 and 42Â -Â 44).
The last three amendments were tabled for the plenary session. However, their content was already covered by amendments accepted before.
- Two Amendments (11 and 19) only concern an error in one linguistic version.
Â Â  Â  The next item is the report (A6-0175/2005) by MrsÂ Bozkurt, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on the role of women in Turkey in social, economic and political life (2004/2215(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there was a woman in rural Turkey who was about to be married off against her will, and womenâs rights organisations told her that new legislation in Turkey meant that she could go to court to have her marriage declared null and void.
When she told her parents that she intended to do exactly that, they realised that there was no point whatsoever in marrying her off and so the wedding was cancelled.
This is just one example of the way in which Turkey is in the process of improving the position of women.
Turkeyâs new legislation comes in for praise in the report on the role of women in political, economic and social life in Turkey by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
In the area of womenâs rights, Turkey has made many improvements in relation to the new constitution, labour law and new criminal law.
These things exist on paper, and they must now be put into practice.
Although Turkey has made a start on this, it must persevere.
Respect for womenâs rights is an absolute condition for EU membership.
The report urges the Commission to put womenâs rights high on the agenda in discussions with Turkey.
Yesterday, Commissioner Rehn explained to this House the shape that negotiations with Turkey will take.
I am pleased that he added that womenâs rights will be a key priority and that they will be a core issue in the annual progress report on Turkey.
In addition, the Turkish Government has indicated that it is taking the report very seriously indeed.
For example, in response to earlier discussions in Turkey about this report, it has already been decided to set up a womenâs rights committee in the Turkish parliament, and the government has already committed to building more relief centres for female victims of violence.
A large majority of Turkish womenâs rights organisations support the findings in my report.
In this House too, the report met with wide support during the vote in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
I am indebted to all those who have worked on this report.
In particular, I would like to thank the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the excellent cooperation in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
Needless to say, wide support for the report does not mean that we see eye to eye on everything.
I would like to single out a few aspects which could be significant for tomorrowâs vote.
In Turkey, women participate in politics only to a very limited extent, and one possible solution that the report proposes to this is a system of quotas that can help involve more women in politics in the short term.
The quotas are suggested as a possible solution to a problem but are not compulsory, since the European Union cannot, of course, demand of Turkey something that is not yet generally accepted in its own Member States.
I join with the womenâs organisations in Turkey in asking for your support in this area.
The amendment on this subject tabled by the Liberals is one with which I can identify, provided that the Turkish Government is called to account in terms of its responsibility.
I would ask you to support the oral amendment that I will be presenting in the plenary the day after tomorrow and with which the Liberals can apparently agree.
Then there is the issue of the headscarf.
In Turkey, the strict division between church and state means that the wearing of religious clothing at universities or in government offices is prohibited.
If women refuse to remove their headscarves, they cannot attend university, nor can they work in the civil service.
In my report, I have repeated the Eurlings reportâs appeal to the Turkish Government that it be ensured that all girls and women, irrespective of their backgrounds, can enjoy their right to education.
I endorse the amendment tabled by MrÂ SzymÃ¡nski of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which makes an indirect appeal for the ban on wearing the headscarf to be lifted.
I do so, not because I am unaware of the negative implications this ban may have, but because Europe itself has no agreed policy on wearing headscarves.
We can hardly ask Turkey to do something which we have not figured out for ourselves.
In addition, the European Court of Human Rights recently decided that Turkey, with this ban, is not flouting womenâs rights; each country is entitled to adopt its own policy on religious symbols.
Turkey should therefore find a sensible solution of its own to the issue surrounding the headscarf.
I would gladly help find that solution, provided that, for example, the problem can first be discussed at great length in the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee.
This topic must be debated both in Turkey and in Europe.
It goes without saying that we as Parliament cannot solve this problem ourselves, but we can make a contribution to the discussion.
Finally, I should like to urge everyone to vote for this report, understandably, because it is my own report, but I have made particular efforts to bring about good cooperation with other parties in respect of this report because it is important, I think, that Turkey sees that the appeal to work hard on womenâs rights comes from the whole of the European Parliament.
I would thank you in advance for your help and for your attention and look forward to your contributions during this debate.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was here two and a half hours ago, and it is annoying that once again there is a quite unreasonable delay before we can start this debate, especially as it is such an important issue.
I have to say, it is no wonder that European competitiveness is on such shaky ground, when people cannot keep to such a simple rule as a timetable.
I hope that the Bureau might reflect on this and also do something about it for the future.
I welcome this opportunity to discuss womenâs rights in Turkey on the basis of Mrs Bozkurtâs excellent report at a particularly important moment in EU-Turkey relations.
Last week, the Commission submitted the negotiating framework for Turkey to the Member States and it is the most rigorous framework ever presented by the Commission.
It states that the Union expects Turkey to sustain the process of reform and ensure its determined implementation to respect fully the rule of law and human rights in all walks of life and in all corners of the country.
I have said that in the negotiations with Turkey the journey is at least as important as the destination, but to have a meaningful journey you need a destination and it is precisely the prospect of EU accession that provides Turkey with such an aim and gives the European Union credible leverage to influence issues such as womenâs rights in Turkey.
Let us be frank.
No other perspective would give Turkey the same incentive to adopt and implement European values on gender equality as the prospect of its becoming a member of the Union.
This is the secret of the success of our enlargement policy and let us not forget this secret.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
It is a well-researched and comprehensive report that addresses many of the issues identified by the Commission in its regular reports.
The reportâs recommendations should be taken on board by all relevant parties.
I welcome in particular the reportâs focus on promoting womenâs participation in the workforce, increasing the representation of women in decision-making positions and combating domestic violence against women, and especially the need for more shelters for the victims of violence.
I share the rapporteurâs appreciation of the Turkish Governmentâs efforts to introduce constitutional and legislative reforms, for instance the penal code, which addresses the situation of women and promotes gender equality.
The new penal code has been criticised in some respects, but overall it represents a clearly positive development that modernises the criminal system, as it includes many improvements for women.
I shall give you some very concrete examples.
The penal code implies and leads to the criminalisation of marital rape, the abolition of discrimination against non-virgin and unmarried women, the criminalisation of sexual harassment in the workplace, the abolition of the patriarchal concept of the head of family, and equal rights to children born out of wedlock.
All this is included in the new penal code.
Now it is a matter of implementation, implementation, implementation.
Finally, I would like to underline that womenâs rights will be a main priority for the Commission in the process of accession negotiations with Turkey and we shall assess the state of womenâs rights in depth in our next regular report, which the Commission will adopt on 9 November this year.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week I read in a major German monthly magazine a marvellous report on three Turkish businesswomen.
Reading the report we are considering today, one can appreciate how great the gender gap in Turkey is.
Our main concern is to help human rights, specifically, in this instance, the rights of women, to gain acceptance.
Violence against women, including domestic violence, the so-called honour killings, forced marriage, the high incidence of illiteracy among women â all these things are alarming.
Many hundreds of thousands of girls are not allowed to go to school, either because their parents are backward or because the facilities are absent.
Kurdish women are particularly affected by these things.
As the Commissioner said, laws get passed, but we have yet to see them put into effect.
I very much hope that the Commission will insist on that being done.
Honour killings and forced marriages, though, are problems that particularly affect Turkish women who have come to live among us, and, hence affect our society too.
The political parties should also take appropriate action to address the under-representation of Turkish women in legislatures, but forcing Turkey to adopt quotas and a âzipperâ system of placement on the election lists is, to put it mildly, humbug if we do not first try to do that sort of thing in our own countries.
I hope that the resolution that will be adopted with support from all of us will help womenâs associations in Turkey to tell it like it is to their political representatives in that country.
The changes are needed, for these breaches of the law are infringements of human rights, and â quite apart from any desire for membership of the European Union â the need for them to be outlawed ought to be self-evident.
I hope that this will also, slowly but surely, dawn on politicians in Turkey.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend to the rapporteur the congratulations of the Socialist Group on her report, which is timely and very sound, and we have had innumerable discussions both with the womenâs committee in Turkey and in this House.
We have had talks with the NGOs and with the political class and the social partners.
All these have resulted in a wide-ranging debate in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and a report supported by almost all the groups.
It is very clear from the report that much has been done in Turkey towards complying with the European Unionâs .
The new penal code entered into force on 1Â June.
It must now, of course, be put into effect, and there must be no let-up in the pressure for it to be so, but Turkey must also be given the time in which to do this.
From now on, marital rape will be punishable, and honour crimes are now stigmatised as the thoroughly dishonourable and criminal acts that they actually are.
It is now for Turkey to take the next step and appoint women to political office.
A 4% quota for women in the Turkish parliament is not feasible; a 1% quota in municipal council chambers is minimal to the point of insignificance.
This is where Turkish women need our help, and, with the aim of getting this House to send a clear message, the womenâs organisations have sent us an urgent appeal, begging us to support them with quotas and with best practice, but above all to put it in a resolution.
That, I think, is what we should do.
We should also, again and again, denounce violence against women and put it on the agenda.
Negotiations are due to commence on 3Â October, and this report will have an important contribution to make to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are quick to advise countries outside the Union on issues where we ourselves still might have much to do.
This report on womenâs rights in Turkey points out that women constitute only 4.4% of the Turkish parliament.
The issue must be raised and the objective should be a change for the better.
We cannot, however, propose a mandatory quota system to try to increase womenâs participation in Turkish politics without also calling on our own Member States to change their legislation in exactly the same way.
We cannot demand of Turkey more than what we ourselves are prepared to do.
Accordingly, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled Amendment 3.
I would like to appeal to our Turkish associates.
Encourage women to participate more in politics; be bolder than the heads of many of the current Member States of the Union!
For example, the proportion of women in the national parliament in France is approximately 12%, and in Italy it is smaller still.
I have not heard the heads of either of these countries or the European Union express concern about the situation and the restricted participation of women in these countries.
It would be enough if action were taken there.
We should not conceal our own problems and point an accusing finger just at Turkey.
We should address the problem of low numbers of women in political life both in Turkey and the Union, and, indeed, in the selections the Union itself makes.
Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, who has done some excellent work.
At the same time I also wish to thank Commissioner Rehn, who has, to his credit, raised the issue of womenâs rights in these membership negotiations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, would like to warmly thank the rapporteur for this report.
I hope that, tomorrow, a clear message will be sent out, and not just from this House.
I would like to see the Commission giving a more prominent place to equality policy, which has, I think, been somewhat in the shadows until now.
We have to make it abundantly clear that we will not be content with progress that exists only on paper, but demand that womenâs rights be put into practice.
I am glad that we have laid down a quota.
We should go further and actually consider demanding the same thing in the European Union.
It really does testify to our political bankruptcy that women make up only 4% of the members of our national legislatures and 1% of our local councils.
There is an urgent need for action to address this, and nothing short of quotas will do the job.
In view of the fact that it was as long ago as 8 March that this House adopted a resolution making explicit our opposition to forced marriage, I again ask your support for our amendment on the immediate registration of the newborn, which would prevent the legitimation of forced marriage through underage girls being declared to be adult.
Â Â  . Mr President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left endorse MrsÂ Bozkurtâs report and will also be voting in favour of it tomorrow.
The report makes it clear that there is still much to be done, in society and in the economic and political spheres, despite the improvements in the position of women in Turkey, as exemplified by such things as the legislation on honour killings and marital rape.
We, the GUE/NGL Group, see it as important that a political solution be found to the situation in South-Eastern Turkey and that the disadvantaged position of the Kurdish regions become a thing of the past.
It matters to us that women in backward rural areas should have more opportunities to work and be educated, and that projects to this end be supported.
That is why one of my contributions to the report is the clause calling on the Turkish Government to cooperate with mayors in these regions in drawing up and promoting targeted programmes on equal opportunities and rights for the women who live there.
An improvement in the position of women in Turkey will represent a great step forward for negotiations on that countryâs accession.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am speaking as the author of the book entitled 'Women Today', a book which has become a bestseller in my country, and I address my honourable female friends.
If they love the women of Turkey and feel real solidarity with women, they should not vote for the report.
What are the real circumstances?
They are described in an article which was published a few months ago: a 14-year-old girl was raped by her uncle, she told her family, a family council was held and they killed the girl.
The murderers are free.
That is the reality.
That is the situation.
We cannot write reports from Brussels.
We can write reports if we go to Diyarbakir and see how women live. In mediaeval circumstances.
Prejudice is rampant against women.
The education system in Turkey cultivates it.
The patriarchal structure of the family orders the raping and beating of women.
If we want, at last, to show respect for women anywhere in the world, we cannot vote for this report.
Mr Erdogan, the prime minister of Turkey, has put women in Turkey back ten years.
From where they had a woman prime minister, today the prime minister's wife goes round in a veil.
That is the retrogression of women in Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, polygamy, forced marriages, illiteracy, honour killings, domestic violence, discrimination in politics, and more of the same besides: this report on the role of women in Turkey is, in terms of content, reasonably exhaustive and well-founded, but anyone who follows the political situation in Turkey from close range will have long been aware that the candidate Member State, the so-called âsecular model state Turkeyâ to use Mr Michelâs words, âis in a very bad way indeed in terms of human rightsâ, particularly in terms of womenâs rights in an Islamic society.
It is, however, helpful that the rapporteur, a few months before the official start of the accession negotiations, makes us revisit some of the facts.
For those who learnt nothing from the way in which the Turkish police beat up peaceful female protesters, this report comes at exactly the right time.
In fact, if reports were to be presented here on the role of religious minorities, the occupation in Cyprus, the rights of Armenians, and the restriction of freedom of expression of opinion and of assembly in Turkey, then these would not be received with many accolades either.
At least once a week, independent sources report grave shortcomings in the area of what we, so ceremoniously, call âfundamental rightsâ.
The situation in Turkey has not improved in any area whatsoever and incidentally, this whole report is in flat contradiction to the optimistic noises we heard last year from Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Prodi when the Commission, completely at odds with the truth, led us to believe that there are only minimal human rights problems left in Turkey, only to give Turkey the green light.
In conclusion, the question is, of course, whether we will have the political courage to draw the only obvious conclusion, which is to Ankara, frankly, that Turkish society is too different in terms of values from our own to admit Turkey to the European Union by the date envisaged, for that is the only sensible lesson we can draw from this report.
Â Â  It is not just in Turkey that the situation of women is a yardstick of democratic development.
Turkey has made huge progress in this regard, and this still holds true even though we know there are legal loopholes.
No one questions the fact that the constitutional amendments and the new criminal code are a great step forward, not only in terms of womenâs rights, but also in terms of universal human rights.
Practice, however, shows that application of the law in implementing these rights is slow and inconsistent.
The problem is not just that it is more difficult to change traditions and customs than it is to change the law.
The report encourages the Turkish Government to be more consistent in its efforts to change the situation.
It is good that the constitution assigns responsibility for creating equal opportunities to the governmentâs jurisdiction, but no underlying strategy is apparent regarding how the government intends to achieve this goal.
It is good that men can legally only have monogamous marital relations, but in practice the Imams still perform the marriage ceremony for second and third wives too.
It is good that around 40% of university teachers are women, but this does not alter the fact that nearly a quarter of women are illiterate.
Wherever the government is committed, the results are visible.
In recent weeks, as part of a government campaign, more than twenty thousand previously unregistered children were officially registered in the course of just one day.
The aim of the report that has been presented, together with the proposed amendments, is to ensure that the progress made in practice helps to close the often enormous gap between the and the human rights situation.
Â Â  Mr President, it has certainly been a long and difficult job to collect all the relevant information and data in order to compile such a detailed report concerning the situation of Turkish women in real terms.
We have been considering countless problems, many of which are encountered in all spheres of life in Turkey in the areas of womenâs rights and gender equality.
Although Turkey has started to meet the challenges on a legal basis, the real transposition of principles into everyday life still lies ahead.
Turkey, which has been applying for EU membership and regards itself as a potential candidate, should respect fundamental human rights and the in the fields of human rights and gender equality.
The Turkish Government has proved its strong commitment to European principles and values by creating a new Penalty Law to protect womenâs rights.
I offer my congratulations.
It should be recalled that we have proposed designating 2006 as the European year of action to combat violence against women.
Turkey should join in with this, both in principle and in real terms through concrete and visible action by taking steps not only against violence but also towards implementing gender equality in other areas.
A strong political will for implementing gender-equality policies is not the sole means of gaining success.
It should be obtained by overcoming many other obstacles, such as traditions, patriarchal social structures, religious aspects, habits, educational, employment and family values, standards and stereotypes all of which hinder progress.
This is a big challenge, since these structures have been built up over centuries and it is not easy to implement reforms all at once, but if Turkey intends to approach and join Europe, it should respect European values as well.
We strongly believe that the Turkish Government will be embarking upon taking steps towards implementing our recommendations.
It is in our common interest to monitor the progress made in order to get a real picture of the situation.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Bozkurt most warmly for the excellent report that she has produced.
The topic of equal rights for women in Turkey is one that I regard as not merely an issue in relation to Turkeyâs aspiration to membership of the European Union, but as at the very heart of it.
The educationalist and educational social worker in me would not wish to omit something positive: when the Turkish daily paper starts to run a campaign under the slogan of âsend me to school, Daddy!â, then that is a cause with which we can ally ourselves.
This has to be seen in the context of the planned accession to the EU; the same can be said, for example of the Turkish media group Dogan taking a stand against violence within families, and, its doing so is another thing we can welcome.
I believe that Turkey must also, over the coming years, come to a new consensus within its own society on the headscarf issue.
It cannot be right for mothers wanting to attend their childrenâs celebrations to be barred from the university campus in the city of Erzurum in Eastern Turkey for wearing the headscarf.
I advocate a forthright ânoâ to the wearing of the headscarf being enforced, but I also want to say ânoâ to the warped secularism that bans mothers from visiting their children at school.
Â Â  Mr President, the report we are debating today tells us that Turkey is not ready to join the European Union and participate in a system of values of Christian origin, and that it does not wish to be ready.
I propose that accession negotiations with the country, which are due to start in three monthsâ time, should not be opened, if only because womenâs rights are not respected in Turkey.
This is only one of many reasons, the most important of which are cultural differences.
I propose that negotiations should be opened when Turkey becomes similar to Europe, which is likely to be never.
We do not have the right to demand of Turkey that it abandons its own civilisation and its own system of values, as well as its own religion, since religion is at the root of every civilisation.
Are women in Turkey really subject to discrimination?
Are they discriminated against more today than in the past?
Perhaps Turkey simply has different standards and cultural models that cannot be translated into the European model of behaviour.
It may even be the case that the increase in violence against women is an expression of the fear and aversion of traditional Turkish society towards European integration.
The Turkish people will not be able to respect us Europeans, who have been brought up in a different spirit and within a different value system, if they cannot respect their own women and national minorities.
Â Â  â Mr President, one of the most basic issues by which Turkey's progress towards Europe will be judged over coming years is improvements in protection for human rights.
Within this framework, improvements in the position of women in all sectors in Turkey is of vital importance, especially bearing in mind that gender equality and respect for human rights and, above all, women's rights, are today part of the .
The European Union must stand by Turkey in its efforts to adjust.
However, certain issues must be noted, as highlighted by Mrs Bozkurt in her report:
Firstly, that the government department responsible for women's rights must develop an integrated policy with adequate financing.
The important problem of violence against women, either in the form of crimes of honour or in the form of domestic violence, must be abolished and protected by any government policy.
The participation of women in political life in Turkey is minimal.
It must be improved by strengthening quotas or greater active participation by women both in democratic parties and in government itself.
To close, I should like to express my support for Mrs Bozkurt's report, in which she really has tried to formulate feasible and material proposals to help the pre-accession process of this country towards the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Members for their comments, which included some very important messages that will have to be taken into account.
I will just respond to two or three points made by most of the speakers.
Firstly, as the rapporteur, Mrs Pack and many others said, implementation is indeed at the heart of the matter, as is a change of mentality.
The legislative changes are important and their implementation essential, but changes in mentality and mindset are at least as important.
We therefore support, and will reinforce our support for, awareness-building measures to strive for a change in mentality and mindset regarding the practical application of womenâs rights and the attitude of the security forces, for instance, in terms of human rights in general.
That is also the objective of the civil society dialogue that we launched last week, which will accompany the negotiations and move forward in parallel with the negotiations proper.
We aim to create long-term partnerships, for instance between womenâs organisations in the European Union and Turkey, in order to increase mutual understanding and strengthen civil society in Turkey, which is one of its weak points.
That will certainly enhance womenâs participation and European values of gender equality and womenâs rights.
As regards quotas, mentioned by Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki and the rapporteur, the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that we cannot ask Turkey for more than we are prepared to provide ourselves.
The fact is that some Member States have quotas and others do not.
I recall that the Member State I know best has, for quite some time, had quotas to enhance womenâs participation in public decision-making.
I recall that as a young member of parliament in 1991, together with Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki, we faced a vote on quotas on the basis of gender equality.
Once I had a meeting with other MPs under 35 and realised that I was in a minority of 12.5%, because the other seven MPs under 35 were women, I certainly voted for the quotas so as to ensure equal representation of both sexes in the future.
On 3 October, we will start a long and no doubt difficult journey.
It is important to realise that it is precisely the prospect of accession that provides the incentive for Turkey to enhance womenâs rights.
It also provides a very strong push for activists and citizens who are concerned and want to work for these important European values.
I can assure you that the Commission will carry out objective and strict monitoring in the course of these accession negotiations.
It is a very good idea to repeat this exercise every year and thus follow the progress made on womenâs rights in Turkey.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0176/2005) by Mrs Niebler, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (COM(2004)0279 C6-0037/2004 2004/0084(COD)).
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Niebler, and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for their key report on our proposal for a revised directive.
The purpose of this proposal is to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation on equal treatment for men and women in employment.
The revised directive is intended to gather the relevant provisions of previous directives on this issue in a single document, in order to make them more workable and easier to understand for all citizens. This ties in with our attempts to make the EU more open, more transparent and more relevant to everyday life.
The proposal does more than merely consolidate existing legislation, however; it also simplifies it and takes cautious steps to modernise it.
This will result in significant improvements, the most important aspect of which will be the use of consistent terminology and, most importantly, consistent definitions, which will ensure that the legislation is more coherent.
Explicit use has been made of a number of horizontal provisions relating to occupational social security schemes, and recent case law of the Court of Justice has been incorporated in order to increase legal certainty and clarity.
It is entirely true that the proposal fails to introduce new policies or innovative ideas, but it should be stressed that we are in a unique position in that we are revising a directive on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement.
The major advantage of this legislative method is that it allows us to make technical improvements to EU legislation at Community level and to safeguard past achievements without reopening the debate and calling into question solutions that have already been found to be politically sensitive and complex issues.
The Commission has endeavoured to take advantage of this method and of the potential it offers for legislative revision in order to better promote equality between men and women.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrowâs vote on the recast directive will draw a line under the very in-depth discussions in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, and so I am sure you will understand how much Mrs Niebler regrets her inability â due to a close family bereavement â to be present at this debate.
She has asked me to make this statement on her behalf, and I ask the Houseâs indulgence for that.
Mrs Niebler is grateful to all of you for the good and fair cooperation in the Committee while preparing this important report.
What the Commission has proposed in this instance is a rather tricky tightrope walk between a mere consolidation of current legislation and a partial improvement of the existing regulations with the intention of drafting them in more comprehensible terms, modernising and simplifying them, while also incorporating into the consolidated text the case-law of the European Court of Justice.
Speaking as a former member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I myself can do no other than endorse that objective.
What Europe demands in this area needs to be expressed more transparently, more comprehensively and with greater clarity, and it is for that reason that we support this approach.
It is no secret that this proposal has arrived at a time when the process of transposing Community decisions in the Member States is the subject of decidedly vehement debate â I need mention only the over-heated debate in Germany, where the Red/Green government is, indeed, facing political defeat for going far beyond what Europe requires, but that is not the point at issue.
This directive concerns itself solely with the equal rights of men and women at work, something that is at the very heart of European equality policy, and its being a matter for the European Union to deal with is not a matter of dispute.
After decades spent working towards equality, how do things stand now?
Despite our efforts at equality in the world of work, we can see that there is still a gender gap, amounting to some 16% of wages.
Men are twice as likely to occupy positions of leadership and three times as likely to be at the top of companies.
At the highest decision-making levels of the 50 largest listed companies, the proportion of women amounts to a mere 10%.
Three subject areas gave rise to lively debate in the Committee.
For a start, various members demanded that the directive should include reference to parental leave, but Mrs Niebler has taken the view that the use of this recasting to bring about such a fundamental change in European law is not opportune.
The fact that rules differ so widely from one Member State to another â with parental leave varying from three months to three years â means that extending the directive to cover it would entail enormous changes and make both in-depth debate and an impact assessment necessary.
It is therefore worth supporting the compromise that we have come up with, according to which the social partners, who are already doing something about this, are urged to review the existing regulations with this in mind.
The second subject of critical scrutiny in debate was what are known as the âunisex tariffsâ.
At one point, the Committee, by a very narrow majority, expressed itself in favour of the idea that the distinction drawn between men and women in occupational pension schemes should be done away with, but Mrs Niebler has warned, in no uncertain terms, against resuming this debate at this stage, for it was only a few months ago that, after protracted negotiations, a very well thought-out compromise was reached in relation to provision for old age.
Mrs Niebler regards it as very important that this should be mentioned, for, if we now reopen the debate on the âunisex tariffsâ, a highly politically controversial issue, then there is the risk of the recasting directive being lost as a result of our expecting too much of this process of consolidating legislation currently in force.
The same argument holds good in respect of the third issue, namely our call for more pressure to be exerted on the Member States and the social partners to get them to improve matters.
Let us not, then, put the whole directive at risk by weighing it down with substantial demands; that the law should be clear and comprehensible is of value in itself.
That is what the directive aims at, and I ask you to help enable it to bring that about.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a revised directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women has been presented to plenary today in its new form, following months of laborious processing by the rapporteur, Mrs Niebler.
During this processing, all sides had the opportunity to express themselves and to be heard by everyone who helped to formulate today's proposal.
The rapporteur deserves warm congratulations, because she combined the Commission's suggestions for simplification of the codification of older legislation with a broader scope for horizontal policies in basic sectors of European law, such as in the sectors of pay and insurance.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I find that the safeguarding of equal opportunity in the workplace is being improved, from access to training, access to employment, to career development, especially as regards pay.
The proposal strengthens the principle of subsidiarity, in that the Member States are repeatedly called on to decide on individual measures for equal treatment.
The fundamental right of effective legal assistance and dissuasive sanctions for harassment are also safeguarded.
The different point of view between the revision procedure and the codecision procedure should not lead the Commission into continuing a vendetta between it and Parliament.
The demographic problem of the European Union imposes the granting of equal opportunities to men and women as far as parental leave is concerned, which was decided in a directive between the Commission and the social partners alone.
The Commission is, moreover, called on to propose a review of the directive.
Inequalities are created at times when women are occupied with underage children or people who require protection.
That is why the proposal for measures to combine work and family life, with parallel protection for maternity, are not wide of the mark.
We are also calling on the Council to express its political will âŠ
Â Â  . Equality of opportunities between men and women is a fundamental right and a priority in the European Union.
Community policy aimed at ensuring equal opportunities has been on the Communityâs agenda since the start of integration, albeit with variations in content.
The directive that â we hope â will be adopted tomorrow summarises the directives already dealing with this issue, and thus reflects the aim of the legislators to set out uniform, simplified regulations bringing together all the existing provisions on the matter.
A crucial component of the directive is that it sets out as a goal not only gender equality as regards treatment of men and women, but also equality between the genders.
It is important to stress that the principle of equal opportunities cannot be narrowed down to employment, because it affects all areas of life.
This principle demands that there should be no discrimination of any form on the basis of gender, especially with regard to marriage and marital status, and most notably as regards conditions for access to social security schemes, in calculating contribution obligations and benefit entitlements.
Since womenâs traditional roles within the family are one of the main reasons for inequality in the workplace, the directive calls for more flexible working time arrangements in the workplace to enable both men and women to combine family and work commitments.
The directive aims to enable injured parties to assert their legal rights effectively; this is facilitated by the reversal of the burden of proof in cases of discrimination, and by the prohibition of indirect or hidden discrimination.
The directive also makes a special point of drawing Member Statesâ attention to the fact that elimination of the disadvantages faced by women is inconceivable unless governments take an active role, and furthermore, there is also a need for democratic institutions to monitor governmentsâ efforts in this regard.
Let us have specialised institutions for guaranteeing womenâs rights both within the government institutional system and outside it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for their helpful and constructive cooperation.
Next, I should like to raise two issues of current interest: firstly, the obligation to comply fully with the legislative sovereignty of Member States; and, secondly, the economic recognition of the work of women in all its forms.
Firstly, to a social Europe, permitting full equality between men and women, but also to a respect for countriesâ different cultures.
The Beijing action plan is clear, and the European Union should also comply with it.
It states that the implementation of any political programme is the sovereign responsibility of each State, acting in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms; moreover, the taking into account of, and full respect for, various religious and ethical values and the cultural heritage and philosophical beliefs of individuals and their communities should contribute to the full enjoyment by women of their human rights in order to achieve equality, development and peace.
Finally, since we are concerned here with a revision, it has only been possible to adopt what was already in previous directives.
However, a directive on the economic value of female work in the non-commercial and informal sector, or non-remunerated work of women in the area of social, inter-generational or professional solidarity would be useful.
It has an economic value.
I invite all fellow Members to familiarise themselves with the ideas of Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker, whose studies have accurately assessed the economic value of womenâs work in all its forms.
This work is worth full reconsideration, evaluation and quantification in the interests of full economic equality between men and women.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Niebler, on the comprehensive and balanced text she has prepared.
This compromise wording, with the amendments that have been made, represents an important and high-quality parliamentary contribution.
Its main aim is the revision of the terms of the previous directives on equal pay, equal treatment in access to employment, training and promotion, working conditions, occupational social security systems and the prevention of harassment.
This revision will enable us to present a single coherent wording, free of any contradictory definitions, to increase the transparency and clarity of the legislation on equality of treatment and to facilitate effective implementation by reinforcing the , avoiding any regression and incorporating all recent developments of European jurisprudence.
By including also all the definitions of direct and indirect discrimination and of harassment, together with the principle of equality of pay and occupational pension arrangements, this text will provide the clarification and simplification that are essential to good implementation in the Member States and will ensure a high degree of legal certainty.
However, I regret that, of the three main aims set out by the Commission â to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation â the aim of effecting improvements has not resulted in any concrete proposals in the text.
A vigorous policy on the protection of self-employed women, particularly in the areas of agriculture and crafts, on parental leave and on the reconciliation of professional and family life should have formed part of this objective, and I deplore its absence.
I therefore ask the Commission to send a strong signal, firstly by urgently revising and improving Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed activity, and, secondly, by re-examining Directive 96/34 on parental leave, in order to adapt it to the current situation through the introduction of incentives in the Member States, such as reasonable compensation and statistical recognition of the value of this unpaid work.
Essential improvements have to be made to combat traditional segregation of roles within the family and to ensure a better balance of women and men in the labour market.
In short, a better reconciliation of work and family life.
Equality of treatment is an essential condition for achieving the goals of sustainable economic, social and environmental growth and development which form part of the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy.
Europe must ensure minimum rights for all men and all women and must urgently ensure they are respected in the Member States.
This aim requires us all â Parliament, the Council and the Commission â to show a strong political determination and intelligent cooperation in the service of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, addressing the issue of equality of pay has been one of our biggest equality-related problems for several decades now.
Community legislation up till now has been unable to eliminate this area of inequality.
Mere incentives and recommendations will not be enough to achieve equality of pay in the future either.
It has to be made clear that unjustified differences in pay are unacceptable.
We need stricter requirements, we need legal sanctions, and we need results.
Member States should report how they implement the principle of equal treatment in practice.
There is insufficient information on how it is implemented in law.
We need to adopt proper procedures in the Member States.
We were just saying that Turkey needs to implement legislation and that it is not enough merely to agree with just laws.
In this respect, the EU and its current Member States could take a look in the mirror and implement the laws and regulations that we have adopted jointly.
Instead of spurring on the social partners, the Member States should ensure that they implement and promote the principle of equal treatment, and thus do what EU treaties and legislation prescribe.
If an employer flouts a regulation, he or she should have to answer for it.
We parliamentarians want to improve current legislation, so that it might promote the equal treatment of women and men.
Hopefully, we will reach consensus with the Commission and the Council regarding objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has, in the past, been an unfailing beacon of equality for women.
In the debate on Turkey, a lot was said about being a community of values, and about the value of equality in the European Union, one that I hope is not being eroded.
We regard the inclusion of occupational pensions in this report as indispensable, knowing as we do that women suffer discrimination on the grounds of their gender, for the firm has no idea whether they or their male colleagues will live longer.
Not only is discrimination in occupational pensions incompatible with Article 13 of the Treaty, but also with the principle of equality in the workplace.
I therefore expect the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality as a whole to support this proposal, and hope that they will do so.
I might add, moreover, that I think it improper of Mr Wuermeling and others in this House to make, in passing, sweepingly derogatory comments about the idea that the anti-discrimination directives should apply outside working life.
I expect you, Commissioner Å pidla, to reiterate your clear and explicit backing for the anti-discrimination directives, not only in respect of discrimination at work but also outside the workplace.
Where womenâs policy is concerned, one cannot say âstopâ one day and âgoâ the next, but, rather, we must instead make it clear that it constitutes one of the values of the European Union.
Equal opportunity policy is not something one can back out of.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the whole report concerns the very basis of all work on gender equality, namely the right and the opportunity to earn oneâs own living.
I wish especially to emphasise three parts of this directive.
The first matter concerns equal pay for equal work.
That is nothing new, but something also included in previous directives.
The point is reinforced, however, in that the two sides of industry are called upon to take both the initiative and the responsibility in connection with the principle of equal pay.
Despite the fact that we have had the directive on the principle of equal pay, there are still big differences in pay, meaning that discrimination still goes on.
The second part to which I wish to draw attention is that concerning parental leave.
