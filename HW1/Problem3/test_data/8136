Nevertheless, against all the rules, negotiations were opened.
What we feared last year has come true.
By opening accession negotiations, we have let go of one of the last means of exerting pressure to force reform.
The process of reform has petered out.
Either governmental bodies have failed to implement at all or failed to implement properly reforms that had already been decided on, or â as happened recently â such reforms have been withdrawn by parliamentary decisions.
For example, the Turkish Parliament adopted the new Anti-Terror Law despite vehement protests from the Commission, resulting in a further curtailment of the already limited freedom of expression and of the press.
The Prime Minister of Turkey is using the EU process for his own ends and attempting to Islamise the country by stealth.
By doing so, he is playing into the hands of the nationalists, who vehemently oppose Europeanisation.
Does Prime Minister ErdoÄan even want the country to join the EU?
At all events, his refusal to recognise Cyprus underlines the fact that he does not accept the EU.
Is this kind of candidate acceptable?
Cyprus is a litmus test.
If Turkish politicians do not give way on this, the negotiations must be discontinued.
Turkey is now under obligation â without any ifs and buts and without imposing any new conditions or demands.
The Commission must make this a mission, and the Council of Ministers, too, must demand the fulfilment of and enforce Turkeyâs obligation at long last.
Anything else would be unfair to the Turkish people, who are pinning their hopes on us.
It is only our pressure that will effect change.
If we Europeans fall down again, we shall be forever a laughing stock that no one can take seriously.
Then nothing will change in that country.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a serious mistake in Euro-Turkish relations for us either to play down the significant progress which has been achieved by exaggerating the bad things about Turkey or to paint an idyllic picture by concealing the truth.
There are forces in Europe following one opinion or the other for reasons of their own.
However, with post-enlargement fatigue and the institutional crisis in the European Union, we do not need to add contradictory messages to Turkey.
It is time for our message to be clear and in keeping with the decisions adopted.
We need to welcome the ninth reform package adopted by the Turkish Government as a positive element.
However, if we look at it in essence, it does not meet European specifications.
In fact, the statement by the deputy prime minister of the Turkish government, MrÂ MehmetÂ AliÂ Sahin, in the Turkish Daily News, that his government does not intend to allow the Halki Seminary to reopen is a cause of anxiety and concern.
The demands of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul and the demands of the Greek minority in Imbros and Tenedos remain unresolved, I fear.
As Commissioner Rehn said earlier, the principle of international law must be respected.
This of course applies to Turkey, but it also applies to the European Union.
We need to remain constant in our support for Turkey's strategic objective of accession to the European Union.
At the same time, however, Turkey should immediately ratify and apply the Additional Protocol by the deadline in question.
The road to Europe may guarantee the stability and development of Turkey.
However, Turkey will need to overcome past phobias and syndromes.
The syndrome of the Treaty of SÃšvres.
That is why I believe that reconciling with history must not be a source of insecurity and risk.
It is an indicator of the democratic maturity and self-confidence of a country.
The call for the traumatic history of clashes with the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos to be acknowledged should not have a destabilising effect for the national stereotypes of Turkey.
Our specific amendment does not impose new preconditions on Turkey.
We are against the acknowledgement of the genocide of the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos as a political prerequisite.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report and this debate are, in my view, a sign that Europe is closing in on itself.
Some Members are at least brave enough to say it more openly: they regard Europe as a religious entity and area, which means that political Europe is dead.
I thought, instead, that the dream â the inspiration, the creation and the dream of a federalist Europe â was precisely to expand the area subject to the rule of law and democracy.
That is the great offer that we should be making to Turkey and, just at a time when Islamic fundamentalism is rising throughout the world, we should insist on it and put it in practice in a report to speed up the accession process.
In that case the criticisms, including the severest ones, might make sense.
In fact, different solutions are obviously presenting themselves here: not Turkeyâs full, political accession, but rather enhanced cooperation agreements, all things that in themselves do not have the strength of the political message or of full accession.
If we follow that path â which, unfortunately, was also suggested by President Barroso in his statement yesterday â we shall bear the responsibility not only for pushing Turkey away, but also for pushing away political Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the stated EU position and that of my party is to support Turkish EU membership.
But nevertheless, no one can under-estimate the challenges it poses in terms of Turkeyâs absorption into the EU, with its very large population and hence the political influence it will gain by joining the EU, its relative poverty and therefore demands on the structural funds, as well as its distinct and separate cultural and religious identity.
Given the current discussion on large-scale immigration, and in particular the challenges faced by integrating the existing Muslim minorities in our countries, a major concern inevitably will be unrestricted freedom of movement of Turkish workers.
Turkeyâs membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference countries will certainly complicate the CFSP.
Recent Marshall Fund of Germany polls in Turkey have shown it to be the most anti-American and anti-Israeli country amongst EU and candidate countries; but more worrying in my view is large Turkish support for theocratic Iran.
Turkey will of course have to abide by all the economic, political and human rights clauses of the Copenhagen criteria before joining, and there are clear examples of continuing discrimination against Christian minority rights, including the Greek Orthodox and Syriacs, and ongoing impediments to free speech, such as Article 301 of the Penal Code prohibiting insulting Turkishness.
In my view, failure by Turkey to come to terms with its past, including the 1915 Armenian genocide and the blockade of the Republic of Armenia, is deeply regrettable.
But non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, where Turkey continues to station troops since the 1974 invasion, and the failure to implement the Ankara Agreement on the enlarged customs union to allow Cypriot ships to dock at Turkish ports, is currently a critical issue before the European Union.
Neither is it true that torture has completely stopped, in spite of it being banned by the State; it is still allegedly being used against Kurdish insurgents, and we have heard about that from Mrs Flautre.
We can therefore be sure that EU accession negotiations will be very lengthy, and I for one fully support the Eurlings report.
Â Â  I would like to thank MrÂ Eurlings for his report.
We in the Swedish Social Democratic group are in favour of Turkish membership once the criteria we have had for everyone else have been met.
We should not set higher requirements for Turkey or subject it to special treatment, as has been suggested in this debate today.
Right now, it is the EU that is the guarantor of progress in Turkey, not only through the encouragement we provide, but also through our demands in relation to issues such as human rights.
A former MEP, now a Social Democrat member of the Swedish Parliament, has written to the Turkish ambassador in connection with the fact that 1Â 200 childrenâs books by Swedish childrenâs authors, used by Swedish schools and funded by the Swedish International Development Agency, Sida, and the Olof Palme Center, were stopped by Turkish customs.
I find this unfathomable and I have therefore put a question to the Council in this regard.
I support democratisation in Turkey and problems such as this one need to be solved.
I share the critical views on the report expressed by the other speakers from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Let us encourage progress and solve the problems but stand firm on the fact that we in the EU wish to see Turkey as a member when the time is right and the democratic deficit has been rectified.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Rehn speaking to the Committee on Foreign Affairs said, inter alia, that the momentum on reforms has been lost, the Penal Code punishing the expression of opinion remains in place, there are reports of interference by the military in the judiciary, there are restrictions on the property rights of non-Muslim religious foundations and the human rights record in south-eastern Turkey has deteriorated.
That is the essence of the matter and of the Eurlings report.
Some Groups wish to table amendments to redress the situation.
How?
By introducing a dozen amendments against Cyprus, in the view that this is the way to redress the balance.
Are we helping Turkey if we encourage it not to extend the Protocol by introducing conditional linkages?
Are we helping Turkey if we delete the paragraph asking for the withdrawal of Turkish troops?
Can you imagine what would happen if Turkey voluntarily withdrew some troops from Cyprus and how much it would be in Turkeyâs favour?
Or what would happen if we were to delete the paragraph asking Turkey not to veto the participation of Cyprus in international organisations and so forth?
Furthermore, we are restricting the two leaders in Cyprus, who have already agreed on working methods in the search of a solution, by indicating to them the basis of talks which neither of them has raised as a precondition.
Does that help Turkey?
I do not think so.
Finally, as regards our moral duty towards the Armenian community in Europe, we must demand recognition of the Armenian genocide.
Â Â  â Mr President, failure to integrate Turkey into the European Union will deepen the mistrust between the West and the Muslim world, strengthen fundamentalist tendencies and revive the doomsday prophecies predicting a clash of civilisations.
Turkey should carry out the necessary reforms and face up to its own past in the same way as other European countries have done and continue to do.
However, the European Parliament cannot set accession criteria for Turkey that are based on historical and moral factors if such criteria were not applied to other countries applying for European Union membership.
We are burdened by a particular political responsibility.
I would like to draw your attention to the latest public opinion polls and surveys of the views of the European elite carried out by .
According to these polls, âTurkey has cooled toward the United States and Europe but warmed toward Iranâ.
At the same time, âthese trends are not reflected in the more critical attitudes in Turkeyâs younger generation which has the most positive attitude towards bothâ.
Let us not waste this pro-European potential!
Â Â  Mr President, I spent last week in Turkey with members of the Human Rights Subcommittee.
We were there to evaluate progress on human rights issues and the effects of reforms on the ground.
On balance, MrÂ Eurlings has done an exceptional job in producing a tough but fair report on the story of Turkish accession so far.
On the Armenian issue, I believe that it should be mentioned in the report, but it should not be introduced as a new precondition for membership, as we should remain committed to the original criteria if we are to stay credible.
I am supportive of the principle of Turkish accession, but recognise that it will be a long, hard road.
We need to send a clear message with this report that, while EU membership is achievable, it will require significant and sustained commitment to reform.
The two human rights concerns on which I wish to focus briefly are freedom of expression and the ongoing Kurdish issue, which needs a new approach.
On freedom of expression, despite reform packages â and we are now on the ninth â journalists and writers are not free to comment openly and critically on Turkey or its government members.
Article 301 of the penal code remains in place to punish those responsible for âa public denigration of Turkishness or State authoritiesâ.
Prison terms of up to three years can be imposed.
Up to 60 such cases are currently being brought against writers by the State Prosecutor.
Despite the high profile case of novelist ElifÂ Shafak, which was thrown out of court last week, self-censorship will continue to be forced upon the press until Article 301 is done away with entirely.
On the Kurdish issue, a guerrilla war using terrorism continues in the south-east â a Kurdish area of Turkey â and must be condemned.
PKK terrorism and the massive military response in the south-east are inflicting real hardship on the region and its population.
A new approach is required that uses diplomacy and politics instead of force.
Â Â  Mr President, a year ago Labour MEPs warmly welcomed the opening of accession talks.
We look forward to eventual Turkish membership of the EU.
We understand that, now that the active phase of negotiations has started, Parliament needs to be frank about progress in its reports.
There are serious problems, in particular with preserving freedom of expression.
Further reform of security services and the judicial system and further progress in implementing new human rights legislation are essential.
However, our criticisms must always be balanced, fair and honest, recognising achievements as well as shortcomings.
The prospect of EU membership has already empowered modernisers and human rights defenders in Turkey to push for the necessary changes.
We must give them our wholehearted support.
We must not establish new preconditions for membership that were not applicable to other potential members and we must remain clear that negotiations are for full membership and that that is our only goal.
An EU with Turkey as a Member State will entrench values of multiculturalism and understanding between different religions and therefore strengthen all communities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly I would like to thank Camiel Eurlings.
He has done some excellent work and has drafted what is actually quite a bold report, which in its own way suggests that enlargement is taking place much too quickly.
There is still so much to be done with regard to Turkey that we cannot even contemplate the idea of its membership in 10 yearsâ time.
I was delighted to read in this morningâs newspaper that European Commission President Barroso has stated that it was unwise to continue enlargement before we had dealt with the matter of the Constitution.
I totally agree with him.
We cannot push for enlargement on such a large scale as would be the case with Turkey and at the same time see through the question of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
We should be listening a lot more carefully to public opinion and to the ideas of the people.
When we recall what happened in the French and Dutch referendums, it would be better to take account of what the people think about this issue.
We should also think about how far and how fast the EU can expand.
If our citizens do not receive a reply to the question of how quickly enlargement is to take place, they will not be able to put their trust in the current EU.
It is a pity that Commissioner Rehn has left.
I would have asked him what Plan B is if rapid progress is made and Turkey is about to join the Union in some 10 yearsâ time and they have a referendum in France, for example.
If the people say no, we will not be able to endorse Turkish membership.
What is the plan, and how should we then proceed so as not to disappoint the Turks and stop the entire project collapsing because again there could unexpectedly be a NO vote in a referendum?
Perhaps, however, we will have the answer to this later on.
Â Â  â Mr President, the accession negotiations under way with Turkey should continue.
Turkey should be treated in the same way as any country we have negotiated with in the past.
The process of harmonising Turkish and European law will help Turkey to modernise and liberalise its economy and to move closer to the fundamental values on which the European Union is based.
Turkey is a country that has taken on the incredibly difficult task of separating Islam from the structures of government.
This Muslim countryâs secular nature is worth fostering and is something that we should offer particular support to in a world where the extreme and fanatical face of Islam is manifesting itself with increasing frequency.
Nevertheless, Turkey needs to know that it cannot count on receiving special treatment.
Ankara cannot expect the Union to lower its standards or water down its laws and requirements based on the European treaties.
I would particularly like to draw your attention to the issue of civil rights and liberties.
It is not enough simply to change laws and legal provisions.
The civil service and the judiciary need to pay constant attention to civil liberties, freedom of speech and religious freedom.
Progress in this field will be judged on the basis of hard facts.
Ankara must understand this and must not be offended by the fact that we will be asking questions, assessing the situation and checking that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected, and that they enjoy the same rights as all other ethnic minorities in the European Union.
These rights include being able to have their own Kurdish language schools at every stage of the education system, starting with nursery education.
New anti-terrorist legislation must not be used to restrict civil liberties and discriminate against minorities.
The European Union will also examine the freedoms enjoyed by Christians, who are still unable to reopen a seminary shut down years ago.
If Christian schools are not allowed to operate freely, it will be impossible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union.
Finally, although we may be discussing Turkey, let us not forget that it is equally important for Europe to open association negotiations with Ukraine in the future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, as this debate draws to a close, I should like to remind the House once more that MrÂ Eurlings has presented a good, constructive report, even if it has not been seen that way and has been criticised in Turkey.
The fact that the outcome of negotiations is open and that they could â and should, in my opinion â result in alternatives to full membership is nothing new, but rather the subject of discussion in the Council and Parliament.
I would contradict expressly CommissionerÂ Rehnâs statement here in his opening speech that he expects the conclusion of negotiations, and accession, by the end of the decade. That leaves less than four years.
No one who wants to see Turkey become a full member is saying that it can join in its present condition â it has to make fundamental changes.
Turkey must recognise and respect human rights, freedom of religion and minority rights.
It must resolve the Armenian issue and actively recognise Cyprus.
Does anyone in Turkey really believe that Turkey could join the EU whilst failing to recognise another full member?
An insider said recently that Cyprus would be recognised only when Turkey became a full member or voluntarily broke off the negotiations.
If the EU, including the Commission, tolerates that, it will mean letting go of all our chances of holding Europe together.
On the subject of freedom of religion, it is remarkable that the Turkish authorities â the deputy party leader, the highest representative of the religious authority, a State official â judged the Popeâs speech before even reading it.
PopeÂ BenedictÂ XVI was compared with Hitler and Mussolini â an outrageous episode that shows and documents the intolerance and Islamism in the minds of the people with whom we are negotiating.
In view of the burgeoning nationalism and the uncompromising attitude of the ErdoÄan Government, I have considerable doubts as to the political will to actually cede sovereignty to the EU.
That is why the Eurlings report is right and necessary.
Turkey should see the advice and requirements as an opportunity rather than a threat.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this thorough and commendable debate has very clearly brought up the challenges and problems associated with Turkeyâs accession negotiations.
In addition, however, Turkeyâs immensely important strategic role for the European Union has been made clear.
In our role as the country holding the presidency, we will promote the talks on membership in accordance with the general principles of enlargement. These include the uniform treatment of applicant countries and progress based on their own merits.
It is worth saying once again that the European Council confirmed in summer 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments regarding enlargement, and the work continues on this basis.
There are many challenges facing Turkey, but obviously the talks on membership support the continuation of Turkeyâs reform process, and that is in the interests of everyone.
One of the key issues is that Turkey should ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement.
At present we are working hard to find a solution which on the one hand would allow direct trade between the European Union and North Cyprus, and on the other would ensure that Turkey also opened its ports to Cypriot vessels.
At the same time as the accession negotiations are taking place, it is also important to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus question within the framework of the United Nations.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this worthy, dynamic debate.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done.
It is obviously an important contribution.
It is an extremely interesting assessment that will undoubtedly help to sustain the Commission report of 8Â November.
Even though we do not necessarily agree on everything contained in the report, I believe that it is important for Parliament to take up this issue and to clarify our own point of view by means of its contribution.
The debate that has just taken place has, I believe, well and truly brought to light the issues involved in Turkeyâs accession process, which began almost one year ago.
The Commission will, of course, take account of this debate when it presents its own report on 8Â November.
That report will, as always, be rigorous, objective and uncompromising.
It will be based on a wide range of information sources, including both official government data and the analyses of Turkish and other non-governmental organisations, or even of large international institutions.
It will also take into account the reports drafted by the committees of your Parliament, as well as the Bozkurt report.
I should like, MrÂ Toubon, with all of the respect that I owe you and that I have for you, to reassure you.
This will not be a childrenâs story.
The Commission is not wont, moreover, to do what you are suddenly accusing it of.
Nor indeed is its aim, even if it were to please you, to produce a report that is unilateral and unsubtle or incomplete.
It is therefore important to always bear in mind the issues involved in this project.
The decision taken on 3Â October 2005 certainly reflects the desire to fulfil our commitments, but it also conveys a powerful mutual interest.
I heard someone say in this Chamber just now that Turkey had more to gain in this instance than Europe.
I am not at all convinced about that.
I believe that Turkey obviously needs Europe in order to continue becoming modern and democratic and supporting the development of its economy, but I believe that Europe also needs Turkey at its side, as a focal point for peace, stability, democracy and prosperity.
Current events, as someone also said, are enough to demonstrate each day the strategic value of this exercise.
Whether we are talking about Iran, Iraq, the Middle East in general, the dialogue between civilisations or the energy crisis, Turkey always seems to be a key country, a vital asset to Europe.
That does not, of course, in any way exempt Turkey from the obligations that any accession candidate must fulfil, and the European Union will make sure of that.
In doing so, it will not set itself up, either, as a teacher who tyrannically delivers his lessons.
Let us remember that it was Turkey that presented itself as a candidate.
It took that step.
It therefore agreed to face up to the difficulties of European integration, because it saw in that the key to its own future and to that of its people.
It is on this account that Turkey must now stay strong in pursuing and strengthening the reform process that it has itself courageously begun.
We, for our part, are obviously going to continue encouraging it along these lines, and we shall not stop doing so.
Turkey aspires to join Europe.
I believe that we should give it its chance; one that must be fair, that stems from clear and transparent rules that are established at the outset and that will not change, either, according to the mood of the day.
I should like to add something.
I often have the feeling, and not only in this Chamber, that, when we debate this matter, it is as though we were evaluating Turkey for accession today, when that will actually take place tomorrow.
It goes without saying that Turkey will not join tomorrow and that the process is likely to last for some time yet.
This is therefore only an interim evaluation.
Judgments are made in relation to progress and to advances - which sometimes take too long - and even to setbacks.
It is quite clear that this is an evolutionary process.
It is therefore very unfair to take a snapshot in time and just focus on that.
That is not what accession is about.
That does not correspond, I might add, to any enlargement process that we have known in the past.
Why, then, should Turkey be treated any differently?
Now I come, before concluding in 20 seconds, to the Armenian issue.
I should like all the same to point out â and I am very mindful of this point, as is Europe, because it comes under the duty to remember that is part of our legacy of values â that this issue is not, nor has ever been, a condition laid down by the European Council for the opening of negotiations or for accession itself, whether in the case of Turkey or of any other candidate country.
Imposing this condition today would amount to moving the goalposts and would be very strongly felt in Turkey to be a ploy by the European Union to lay down new conditions with the aim of preventing Turkeyâs accession at all costs.
It is, on the other hand, vital to ensure that freedom of expression, including on sensitive issues that are linked to Turkeyâs past, is fully respected in that country.
The experience of our own countries demonstrates that the debate on the past, however distressing it may be, always comes about as a result of an act of awareness within our societies and rarely, if ever, as a result of an order, of a diktat from outside.
This entire debate is linked to the principle of reconciliation, which is one of the main driving forces of the European project.
The Commission has always been clear on this issue.
Turkeyâs relations with Armenia must improve, starting with the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening up of the land border, which is currently closed.
The prospect of Turkeyâs joining the EU must lead to an improvement in bilateral relations and to reconciliation, including in relation to the past.
We obviously expect Turkey to treat this issue as an integral part of a free and open public debate in which it must be possible to exchange all points of view.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there you have the response from the Commission and my impressions after having followed this extremely interesting debate.
I am, of course, going to feed matters back to MrÂ Rehn, who is more familiar with these issues than I. Be in no doubt whatsoever that your contribution to the report of 8Â November will be welcomed.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to protest at Commissioner Rehnâs absence from this important debate.
I find the reason he has given unacceptable.
I do not think it fair to this House either.
He could have responded to the many comments that have been made in response to the Eurlings report.
Â Â  I can inform you that MrÂ Rehn had other commitments and could not be present at this sitting.
MrÂ Michel, you have the floor again.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to remind MrÂ Claeys that Commissioner Rehn has already explained in detail that it would be impossible for him to stay.
Whilst that really was unfortunate for the debate, I have tried to stand in for him by clarifying arguments and answering questions.
I will, of course, report back to MrÂ Rehn, and I am convinced that in the next meetings, he will probably be able to come and answer those questions in person.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0429/2006).
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, by yesterday 13 Member States had officially notified their national allocation plans to the Commission.
In other words, approximately half the plans are still pending, but it is important to emphasise that the plans notified already represent over 60% of the emission rights approved by the Commission for the first trading period.
The Member States which have notified their plans are Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
The remaining Member States must of course notify their plans.
Most of these plans â in a preliminary form â are already undergoing public consultation in various Member States such as Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
Several of these Member States have already made significant progress in the relevant consultation procedures and they are expected to notify their plans to the Commission within the next few weeks.
The Commission attaches great importance to the remaining Member States submitting their plans for the second stage as quickly as possible.
Letters have already been sent out drawing the attention of the Member States to their obligations.
If there are further delays, the Commission will examine the possibility of starting infringement proceedings against the Member States which have delayed, on the basis of ArticleÂ 226 of the Treaty.
However, according to the information available to it, the Commission estimates that the last Member States will have notified their plans by the end of 2006.
The Commission has already started to evaluate the national allocation plans notified and intends to take decisions on them in the autumn, in other words by the three-month deadline from completion of the plans laid down in the emissions trading directive.
This will allow the Commission to take decisions on most of the emission rights market before Christmas and to complete the evaluation procedure by the spring of 2007.
This will safeguard the smooth and timely start of the second stage of the European Union's trading mechanism in all the Member States for 2008.
The Commission cannot, of course, decide on the merits of evaluations under way, but will use every political and legal means at its disposal in order to ensure that all the plans are in keeping with the Kyoto commitments and the confirmed data on emissions for 2005, in a bid to safeguard equal terms of competition for companies.
Â Â  The whole point of national allocation plans is to ensure that the EU emissions trading schemes deliver the best possible benefits for the climate.
The lack of transparency in most Member State processes to determine their first NAPs has resulted in legitimate questions and concerns on the validity of the data within the first set of plans.
In the first year, 2005, the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated in those 21 countries.
That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market.
Will you insist that the information and data sources used to set the targets in the second round of NAPs will be publicly available to allow independent verification and to ensure maximum benefit for the climate and fair competition across the single market?
Â Â  .
The criteria for preparing the National Allocation Plans for the second trading period are described in the directive. There are 12 criteria; two are very important.
The first is whether the Member States are on track to achieve the curtailment target and how the allocations for the emissions trading system, together with other measures, will contribute to the achievement of that target. The second is the available publicly-known data regarding the emissions.
For the second trading period, we have the advantage that we have the actual emissions for 2005, which are as described previously.
So these two criteria will be very important in making the National Allocation Plans achieve the scarcity that is needed in the market in order to give companies and installations incentives to make the right investment in cutting down carbon dioxide emissions.
Â Â  Can the Commissioner comment on the validity and logic of a policy that compels Member States to radically reduce emissions with resulting increases in EU energy prices and lower manufacturing output while, at the same time, we promote trade with and production in China, the worldâs greatest polluter, with no enforceable requirements for the suppression of emissions from them.
I do not object to trade with China, but I do object to the lack of compulsion upon them to reduce their emissions.
In effect, are we not really trading jobs and emissions ...
Â Â  . In our plans for the post-2012 period we consider it very important to bring on board all the big emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
You are quite correct that China is one of the big emitters, but you forget that the biggest emitter is the United States, which emits about 25% of the greenhouse gases in the world.
China comes second, with about 14%, together with the European Union, but in order to have the equilibrium which is needed regarding the contribution by each country to the battle against climate change, we have to take into account what the United Nations Climate Change Conference states, i.e. that each country should contribute in a common but differentiated way, which means that countries like China, India and other fast-developing countries, which have contributed to a smaller degree historically to the creation of the greenhouse phenomenon and have only a fraction of the per capita income of the developed countries, have to contribute in a different way according to their capabilities and their possibilities, without hindering their economic development and without creating unfair competition with other countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, as a result of emission allowance trading, the price of electricity in Europe has generally risen, and furthermore, the price of electricity has risen independently of this, which means that the price of nuclear and hydro-electric energy has risen, resulting in windfall profits for the producers.
In the Nordic countries, there are common electricity markets, and the price of emission allowances has been passed on directly to the cost of electricity in the Nordic Power Exchange.
It has also been passed on to the cost of nuclear and hydro-electric energy, and has produced windfall profits for producers in these sectors.
When the allocations are reorganised, does the Commission intend to do something about these windfall profits that producers make from emissions trading?
Â Â  . You are right.
There are quite a few electricity companies that have windfall profits because they included the cost of free allocations in electricity prices.
There are, therefore, windfall profits across Europe.
There are two ways to fight that.
One is by auctioning some of the allowances instead of allocating them for free. That is a possibility for the second trading period.
Countries can auction approximately 10% of allocations and the proceeds could be used either to promote innovation or to lessen the burden of taxes for labour, for example, or for other purposes.
The second way is to liberalise the gas and power market in the European Union.
Â Â  . Firstly, SIS II is of crucial importance, because it is one precondition, if not the only one, for the enlargement of the Schengen area, which is a true European area for the free movement of people.
My second point is that enlargement of the Schengen area is a crucial political priority for the European Union and it will remain so.
I can confirm the Commissionâs full commitment and my personal commitment to achieving this goal as soon as possible.
Some technical problems have emerged in this first phase of the technical implementation of this very complex system which, as you know, will connect the central part here in Strasbourg to all Member Statesâ national systems.
There are problems and delays due to some litigation.
There were technical problems with the preparation of the Strasbourg site, but these problems have now been totally solved in close cooperation with the French authorities.
A large majority of Member States have requested at least an extra three months in order to test the connections needed between the central system and the national systems.
My fourth point is that agreement on the legal basis has not yet been reached.
We are working very hard.
A few days ago there was a very fruitful trialogue to try to secure an agreement between the rapporteur, the Council Presidency and myself.
The implementation of national projects has been delayed in all Member States that have asked to join the Schengen area, except one.
All the experts in all Member States, including the new ones, were and are perfectly aware of the current situation. That is why national experts have proposed that there should be a new timetable for the implementation of SIS II.
Next week the Council of Interior Ministers will probably approve a new timetable for SIS II.
It will approve a proposal for a new timetable, which will be visible, pragmatic and realistic, and will also decide to establish a task force formed by national experts from the Member States to monitor continuously the national implementation of national systems.
Following that, there will be a concrete possibility to discuss a realistic timetable.
On the one hand, it is really a political commitment, but on the other, it is extremely complex from a technical point of view.
The delay has occurred not because of political problems but because of technical problems, and all the Member States have been made aware of them through their national experts cooperating in the Technical Committee.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your reply.
When the ministers of the interior and justice discussed the Schengen issue last week in Tampere, there were ideas voiced that this is still a political question and that the new system will not be joined by all countries at one time, but rather whenever they are ready.
The old members will join the system first, and the new ones will then follow.
I would like to ask you to confirm, or preferably, deny that, which of course would be much more appealing.
We expect a quick response concerning a realistic agenda and realistic date for the enlargement.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, my answer is definitely yes: implementation of the SIS II project is one of the prerequisites for uniting and enlarging the Schengen area.
I believe that the timetable to be approved by the Council of Ministers next week will set very precise dates for the new Member States to join Schengen.
As was mentioned previously, there is a second requirement, which is that each of the new Member States must be in a position to adapt its national security and border control measures, as laid down in the Schengen Agreement itself.
If these two conditions are fulfilled, the date laid down by the Council of Ministers will be a firm date for joining Schengen.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks for the commitment the Commissioner has shown in connection with the realisation of Schengen.
I have two questions.
It has been discussed that âSchengen plusâ is supposedly to be implemented before SchengenÂ II, in a transitional period.
Is âSchengen plusâ a necessary requirement for the implementation of SchengenÂ II?
I am thinking here of Slovenia, which has apparently already implemented SchengenÂ II.
My second question is this. What additional interlinking of files is envisaged with SchengenÂ II?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the possibility of an intermediate solution â in other words Schengen 1+ â was raised by one of the delegations.
This, in my view, is a solution worthy of serious consideration, so long as it gives us the added value that SchengenÂ 2 will certainly provide.
I would remind the honourable Members that over a year ago it was the Commission itself that put this idea forward.
In other words, why not look for an intermediate solution between Schengen 1 and Schengen 2?
Such a solution would in fact be called Schengen 1+.
At the time, a large majority of Member States rejected this intermediate idea on the grounds that it would not be sufficiently secure, as SchengenÂ 2 would be.
Now, as you know, the idea has been put forward again by the Portuguese delegation.
We shall reassess it, but everything depends on the added value it provides.
The next question is, âWhat is this added value?â
SchengenÂ 2 will feature immediate, real-time connection through a central part in Strasbourg, a second part in Salzburg and the national systems, which will be connected with direct exchange of information in much shorter times and with much more secure personal data protection than is the case at the moment.
This is the main feature that makes me consider SchengenÂ 2 the most advanced proposal yet on the table.
Â Â  Commissioner, I would like to ask you about security.
I am sure that the Commission is very interested in the security and reliability of these Schengen borders but, as you know, the new countries have invested millions of euros in creating this information system and, with the postponement of their entry into the Schengen system, there are some fears that these systems will be outdated and not suited to the new demands.
Â Â  . This is a very important question.
Many colleagues and ministers in Tampere raised exactly this point.
My answer was, and I repeat it here, that I am aware of the impact of delay and possible additional cost. That is why I have promised all the ministers to study very carefully the possibility of taking at least partial account of the additional cost of postponing the concrete operation of SIS II.
For example, I can take the IT scale systems into consideration.
I have already postponed the possibility of spending money until the end of 2007.
Why not think about postponing it again, or try to have additional funding for this extra cost?
I cannot, for example, co-fund salaries for people in the police, but I will give serious consideration to the security infrastructure.
Â Â  I wish to point out that the issue of the enlargement of the Schengen area will be debated at our October plenary session.
Indeed, we shall have the opportunity to return to the issue in the presence of MrÂ Frattini.
Further to the European Court of Justice's ruling of 18Â July 2006 in Case C-119/04, will the Commission consider applying for a revision of that ruling on the basis that important information concerning the actual working situation of foreign language assistants in Italy was not made available to the European Court of Justice?
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, in its ruling of 18Â JuneÂ 2006 on case C-119/04 the Court of Justice stated that, by the deadline established in the reasoned opinion, the Italian Republic had failed to provide recognition of the rights acquired by former assistant teachers who had become language teachers and specialists, although such recognition was guaranteed to all employees in the country, and had failed to fulfil all of the measures arising from the Commission v Italy ruling of 26Â JuneÂ 2001 in case C 212/99, and had accordingly failed to carry out its obligations under ArticleÂ 228 of the EC Treaty.
The Court of Justice decided, however, that there were no grounds for imposing the fine requested by the Commission.
After examining the events in question, it did not have sufficient information to conclude that the Italian authorities were failing to meet their obligations.
The Commission would draw the honourable Memberâs attention to the fact that the Court of Justice also pointed out that under LawÂ 2/2004, which does not rule out renewing the careers of former assistant teachers of foreign language under enhanced conditions, each of the universities in question might retrospectively renew the careers of these teachers.
The Court of Justice nevertheless also held that there was still a need to determine whether or not the measures adopted following the lawful approval of the regulation were actually applied.
The Commission services are currently analysing the substance and impact of this ruling, and the best way to proceed.
One of the main questions that should be resolved in this regard is whether the acquired rights have been fully recognised and renewed, including the implementation of retrospective payments to those who are entitled to them, as declared by the Italian authorities.
Â Â  Would the Commissioner not agree that it is scandalous that no fines were imposed on the Italian authorities by the European Court of Justice, given that it is now almost 20 years since the matter was first brought to the Commissionâs attention, and that on each occasion when the Court has decided on this matter, it has found against Italy; and that even today, as I understand it, in La Sapienza University the criteria laid down have still not been complied with?
Also, would he not agree that it is extraordinary that the Court can claim that insufficient evidence was provided by the Commission to enable it to make a decision in relation to the imposition of fines?
Will the Commissioner undertake to ensure, even at this stage, that the Courtâs decision will be reviewed and that the Italian authorities will be obliged ...
Â Â  MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, in its discussion on the case, the Commission held to the view that was stated before the court and on which the court gave its ruling.
From this perspective we are both formally and substantively involved in the trial in question.
Accordingly, the Commission is responsible for resolving this matter and for examining whether the ruling has been applied in full, whether it has resulted in retrospective payment and whether careers have been renewed.
This is what we have to do and this is the direction in which we are heading.
How the proposed measures will turn out remains to be seen.
In my view, the bottom line is that the legal framework of the EU and the European Community must be respected, and this is the way the Commission always works.
It made its position on the matter very clear during the negotiations.
Â Â  I welcome the fact that you will be monitoring whether the ruling is properly applied.
I think it is now 21 years since this matter was raised by one of my former colleagues, Hugh McMahon, as well as Mr De Rossa.
I wonder whether we could consider having a birthday party for the question on its 21st anniversary when it comes of age, because it appears to be proceeding exceedingly slowly.
Â Â  . MrÂ Ford, throughout this confusing process, the Commission has consistently maintained that the obligation to achieve results arises from the 2001 ruling applying to actual settlement of earnings and to social security contributions owed to former assistant teachers.
The criteria used in the regulation under lawÂ 2/2004 on renewing the careers of teachers were also called into question.
At the time, of course, the court decided or stated that it had no reasonable grounds on which to establish that the ruling had not yet been applied in full.
It took into consideration the fact that the Italian universities had informed them that payments, or at least some of the payments, had been made.
The court did not address the issue that it was the universities that had provided this information and not the assistant teachers.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, the decision of the court is final, and the Commission must now examine the relevant facts and decide on what action to take next.
It remains to be seen whether the next step is to reopen the process or some other course of action.
I can only assure you that the amount of time the process has taken strikes me, personally, as extraordinarily long and I feel that one of the cornerstones, one of the vital components, of legal certainty is that satisfaction ultimately ensues within a reasonable amount of time.
This does not mean immediately, because some cases are complicated, but within a time frame that can be considered appropriate.
Â Â  . The question you asked is very important for the Commission and all the European institutions.
The proposal we got from the Council consists of two parts: one part relates directly to the 2007 budget and the other relates directly to the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013.
I should like to elaborate on the consequences in your question for both elements of the proposal that we got from the Council.
Firstly, with regard to the 2007 budget, the Council has reduced appropriations by EUR 56 million.
That means that the Commission would not even be able to maintain the current level of staff, while the Council has approved 801 new posts for new members for enlargement. However, it refused to grant the corresponding appropriations for paying salaries for those positions.
It would make recruitment impossible, from either new or old Member States.
It also will not allow the Commission to replace its staff who will retire during 2007. That means that the real labour force will be reduced by about 420 people.
No recruitment will be taking place at all with this proposal for 2007.
The question was also about agencies.
For 2007 the Council also proposed to cut agenciesâ appropriations by about EUR 29 million.
The second part of the proposal consists of reducing posts for the seven-year period.
The Councilâs proposal has two parts.
Firstly, every second post becoming vacant would be deleted from each institutionâs establishment plan. I have heard rumours that it is proposed for all three institutions â Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Secondly, the Commission would have to delete 500 additional posts, justified by the Council by the concentration of programmes and new managerial approaches.
For the Commission that could cost up to 2000 positions during the seven-year period; for other institutions, such as the Council and Parliament, about 200 positions.
At the request of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Budgets, in early September I signed the working paper with all the detailed technical explanations and financial figures about that proposal.
If you like, we could provide you today with that package for your information, in order to study the question in more detail.
The consequences only for the Commission will be a loss of close to 2000 posts, which means close to four DGs. It is also approximately half of the positions that have been given for enlargement during previous years.
It does not take into account at all the fact that the Commission already started administrative reform on its own premises in 2002 and its ongoing reform. It also does not take into account that the European institutions are not national governments and the specific tasks which Parliament and Council perform are different.
As an example, the European Commission, as a public civil service, is the cheapest public service in the world.
In our budget all three institutions â the Council, Parliament and the Commission â only take up about 5% of the budget for administrative expenditures, while in most of our Member States they take up four or five times more.
We cannot agree because the proposal does not take into account the geographical balance.
We need to keep within the requests of the Council. It does not take into account linguistic diversity, which we also need to keep.
None of these things is taken into account.
Finally, we evaluated this as an attempt to reopen the debate on the interinstitutional agreement, which we signed just four months ago.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, thank you for a very thorough answer.
I would like to mention that, after the question was submitted, the Commission also gave members of the Committee on Budgets written materials on the subject to help clarify the issue.
I would like to ask an additional question.
Can the Commission freely redeploy staff among the different main administrative sections whenever it decides to, without a separate budget decision having to be taken between the budgetary authorities in the Council of Parliament?
Can the Commission freely move posts from one Directorate-General to another?
Â Â  . We carry out redeployment every year; each year we redeploy approximately 400 people internally.
But here we are talking about posts without the preparations to pay salaries.
Inside is part of our so-called productivity gain programme, which was introduced in 2002 as part of the reform.
If the priorities change, we redeploy internally: that is the normal yearly practice.
Â Â  â Commissioner, what measures are intended for taking due account of the new EU Member States when allocating Commission staff posts, and for doing so without increasing administrative expenditure?
Â Â  . Yes, in 2003 Parliament and the Council agreed to allocate 3400 new posts for enlargement in the four-year period between 2004 and 2008.
Each year we have been receiving these posts, together with payments for the salaries.
This year we have again been offered 801 posts by the Council, without any addition for the salaries.
We are not magicians and we cannot magically pay for 800 posts from nowhere.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I hope that this question about the Commissionâs administration will allow me the opportunity to ask a further question on a subject on which I have been contacted once again in recent years.
The Commissionâs administrative practice continues to display the regrettable feature that payment orders for scientific projects arrive far too late.
This is especially true when a researcher or scientist comes to Brussels on an invitation from the Commission, for example, to evaluate research and scientific projects.
Researchers pay for their own travel and hotel costs, make their contribution, and may have to wait several months before the Commission pays the expenses and pays for the work done.
Today I have discovered that this has sometimes taken five months.
Â Â  . It mainly concerns the Financial Regulation and the financial implementing rules.
The Commission has prepared the simplification procedures and they were approved in May.
This package of new legislation is on the Councilâs table and on the Committee on Budgetsâ table with Mrs GrÃ€ssle, who is the rapporteur on this question.
She can confirm that we took on about 80% of Parliamentâs proposals.
The package is very good, but now much will depend on whether the Finnish Presidency will approve it and on the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, while it remains a Council decision.
So I very much hope that a lot more simplification will take place from 2007, especially regarding the procedures for paying for these kinds of projects.
But that is another matter.
Â Â  . Within this question there are seven sub-questions, and I would like to be as precise and technical as possible because the questions were very specific and precise from an accounting point of view.
Your question mainly relates to our manning budget, where we are asking to create a budgetary line which would enable the Commission, where duly justified, to write off items in suspense accounts, and to write off losses which inevitably accrue in an administration managerâs funds in accounts throughout 145Â countries, sometimes with a weak banking sector and other political disturbances.
The creation of this budget line reflects the Commissionâs policy of administrative rigour and transparency, to clear up all files, mostly relating to the years before 2000.
That is mainly because we are now introducing a new accrual-based accounting system which allows us, and compels us, to be more transparent and more rigorous with our accounting system.
This proposal for a new budgetary line was presented in the amended Budget 5, to the budget line 40, and lists the following five types of operations which we will be looking into.
The first is adjustments to cover amounts deposited in accounts in banks outside the European Union which have gone bankrupt during the previous year.
The second is cash differences in imprest accounts.
The third is settlement on some long-standing operations carried out mainly by delegations and representations under the imprest arrangements abroad.
The fourth is repayments of principal and/or late payment interest and whether they were set off, and clearance of non-recoverable amounts of VAT.
Each year, the Commission will include this budgetary line in its PDB proposal, as it is now common practice to write off non-recoverable expenditure and not leave it in suspense accounts indefinitely, which was the practice in the past.
The definition of a suspense account is that it is not just a bank account, but accounting records, in which the Commissionâs annual financial statements are listed outside the EU budget accounts because they correspond to operations which are waiting to be regularised from an accounting point of view, but cannot be attributed by any specific EU budget line for various reasons explained above.
There is therefore no link with the bank accounts mentioned in my answer of 2 July this year, where the accounts were opened or managed by staff other than the accounting officer, both inside and outside the territory of the European Union.
As regards the Court of Auditorsâ 2005 annual report, this proposal also has no link whatever with that publication, other than the fact that the Court constantly presses the Commission to clear up these suspense accounts.
It was presented in good time for the suspense account to be cleared up before the end of the present financial year.
We did this with the amended budget.
As regards the main types of operation in a number of accounts which you ask about in your question and the amounts of money involved, I can provide some examples today.
For example, funds lost following bankruptcies amount to about EUR 1.3 million, concerning mainly EUR 1Â million in Kazakhstan in 1996.
Funds lost from burdens of the past, for example, amount presently to EUR 3.5 million from imprest accounts held outside the European Union and only EUR 100Â 000 from imprest accounts held by representations.
This is due to many different circumstances where the supporting documents that are needed to justify otherwise regular expenditure cannot be traced, despite long searches.
All these amounts relate to years before 2000.
Finally, I just want to say that the creation of this budget line is not only part of the current process to modernise the Commissionâs accounting system; it also reflects the Commission policy of administrative rigour and transparency to clear up all old files, which will become common practice from 2006, and we will do it every year.
Despite the thorough inventory, I want to confirm that no bank accounts were found that have been unknown to the Commission at this stage.
Â Â  â I am obliged to the Commissioner for her answer.
The interpretation disappeared from time to time, as the interpreter could not follow what the Commissioner was saying.
I have tried to follow the Commissioner and have realised that she has not answered one of my questions, namely the one regarding the 377Â extrabudgetary accounts I listed in my question of 2Â July.
This is the second time that the question as to the total sum concerned has gone unanswered.
To this I would add that there is an account of the Economat supermarket for EURÂ 7Â million.
I would ask the Commissioner to tell us what these EURÂ 7Â million were spent on.
Â Â  . I cannot give you an answer at the moment about those specific figures, because that was not made clear in the letter or the oral question.
We understood the main question concerned the budget amendment proposal, to which we tried to reply.
If you would like an explanation about specific amounts, we will provide it in writing.
Â Â  . The Member's question is on the issue of the brain- or skills-drain from Member States that joined the Union on 1 May 2004.
He suggests that the Commission should create a special new fund to reduce the impact of brain-drain.
The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law.
After enlargement in 2004, despite the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers from eight new countries, the EU saw increased mobility from new Member States.
However, in the report we published recently on the functioning of the transitional arrangements, the Commission pointed out that flows from the EU-10, the new Member States, had been fairly limited in relation to the overall working-age population and that they are balanced, at least in part, by mobility from the original 15.
The report shows that migration flows are driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions, both in sending and receiving countries.
Moreover, and more importantly, as pointed out in the report, rather than seeking permanent employment in another country, a significant percentage of migrant workers stay in the receiving country for a limited period only.
Consequently, migrant workers often return to their country of origin, which will subsequently profit from the accumulated experiences gained abroad, especially by highly skilled workers.
In this respect, we can speak about the concept of brain-gain.
It should also be noted that although the âoldâ Member States attract talented people from the new Member States, the United States of America proves to be the most popular destination for tertiary students or educated people from the new Member States.
The problem of brain-drain, insofar as it exists, seems more linked to the salary differential between the country of origin and destination countries than to the quality of the education systems in migrantsâ countries of origin.
The new Member States perform quite well under most indicators in the Education-Training 2010 programme, where we have benchmarks and very concrete objectives.
The answer to the issue lies in the good use of the significant opportunities that will be provided by the structural funds for the 2007 to 2013 period.
The structural funds will bring a substantial contribution to the economies of new Member States and, if used well, should provide the means to ensure steady growth and job creation.
The progressive convergence of the new Member Statesâ economies with those of older Member States should reduce the existing salary differential and therefore eliminate a major reason for brain-drain.
The Commission, rather than supporting the creation of a special fund or efforts to regulate migration, would therefore encourage new Member States to use the structural funds effectively.
The European Social Fund, in particular, will continue to support a comprehensive approach to education and training in the programming period beginning in 2007, namely by supporting measures to develop employability and improve the labour-market relevance of initial and vocational education and training, with a view to encouraging innovation and as part of a knowledge-based economy.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you so much for your thorough response. I must admit, however, that it did not really ease my fears.
The use of the funds is truly a very important issue for the freedom of movement, but the new Members will be âbled whiteâ by giving away their best people to old Members that are far richer.
I would still like to ask you: do you feel any injustice in the situation as it is?
Do you sense any violation of the principle of solidarity?
Â Â  . I would not talk about injustice; I would prefer to talk about freedom, which we have, and responsibility, which is the best part of freedom, or the other side of the same coin.
When we speak about the âbrain drainâ, it is not only the new Member States versus older Member States. The same happens in the Union versus most competitive partners in the world.
When I was in France and Germany they talked about the brain drain to the United States.
So either we are aware of the problems and the lack of competitiveness, the lack of value placed on knowledge or the lack of respect for knowledge in Europe, and improve conditions for intellectual property for patents on this continent for so many issues connected to innovation and the transfer of knowledge into real life, the real economy, production and services, or we will comment and lament later on, and maybe even more, because time is passing quickly and globalisation is really influencing our lives.
All our policies, programmes, strategies aim towards this goal.
I do not want to anticipate developments in the Commission, but in a few weeksâ time we would like to propose, for example, the establishment of a European institute of technology.
Either we create space for a European dimension in knowledge and the transfer of knowledge and we improve together or, as I said before, we will lose time and momentum.
I do not want to discuss that at length now, maybe next time I shall say more.
The Lahti Summit in October should deal with the ten points for improving innovation in Europe. The first two points are education and universities and an institute of technology, and then there are others.
I think that political awareness of the problem is there.
If there is also the political will to deliver, we can find better answers and better situations in the future.
We need to work towards that.
Â Â  Commissioner, given the announcement on Romania and Bulgaria, could you comment on the indications from the UK and Ireland that they will not be opening up their markets to workers from these two Member States?
Would you agree that many of the host countries need a policy of integrating workers from new Member States, to be fair to their needs, and that we need to allow migrant workers with qualifications to progress in the careers for which they are qualified in the host Member States?
Â Â  Thank you not only for the question but also for the encouragement that we should stay open.
Politically I think Europe is a synonym of openness.
If that is true, then we usually tend to solve problems. If we close, if we isolate ourselves, then problems usually get even bigger in time.
On internal decisions and the opening of the labour market, this is, of course, the right of Member States.
The Commission has always argued in favour of openness or at least gradual opening rather than moratoria.
The report on the second anniversary of enlargement showed that those that opened their markets benefited, which confirms that until now integration in Europe has proved to be a win-win situation.
Of course it must be carried out under certain rules and criteria and, if that is the case, then benefits will continue to be gained by those who are more open.
On qualifications and integration, one of the important contributions will come this month from the Commission.
Last night there was a debate in this House on a European qualifications framework, which should create the basic matrix for comparison and transfer of qualifications between different autonomous national qualification systems or qualification frameworks.
In this sense the value of the qualifications will be higher because we will make them more readable and transferable and we will empower people to use them more properly.
This is one of the most important legal and political answers in order to turn our people in the same Union into citizens more than tourists.
Â Â  Last year the European Commission adopted the Green Paper on managing economic migration in the European Union, which proposed to compensate the costs of âbrain drainâ to third countries, meaning developing countries.
These economic migrants are exactly the same as Lithuanians going to other countries in the European Union, which is referred to as the free movement of persons rather than economic migration.
Why would not the Commission apply the measures it proposed for third countries to the internal market?
Â Â  We do not encourage or propose a brain drain, but we try to mobilise brains.
There are many examples of how either we proceed together in order to release the potential which we have in our Member Sates and our universities in the new generation of students and researchers, or we are lost with the lack of growth, the lack of new and better jobs.
Even in the programmes for which I am responsible, we do not stimulate or motivate third-country nationals to leave their home states, but rather to go back and build up their societies and economies in close partnership with European countries, European institutions or universities.
Instead of lamenting how little we did to stop the brain drain and for the recuperation of European potential, we should focus on the credible implementation of our next generation of programmes.
We want to have even more mobility combined, of course, with freedom.
I am also from a new Member State, and I usually answer that instead of lamenting that more young people go out than come back, we need to create conditions which build or offer a truly European perspective back home in Slovakia, in Lithuania or Latvia.
After two years of membership of the Union, it is becoming more and more evident that the Europeanisation of conditions and prospects for young people is there, but it is a process; it takes time.
The much-quoted, miraculous examples of Ireland or Finland are just logical results of long-term strategic policies where education, training, knowledge and research are at the centre and remain at the centre.
That is a good example for all to follow.
Â Â  Mr President, this happens month after month.
Members have tabled questions to be answered by the Commission, they sit here while you allow supplementary after supplementary and let Commissioners run on at will and our questions are not reached.
It is an outrage the way Members of this House are being treated, it is absolutely outrageous. I protest strongly about this.
Â Â  I can perfectly understand your annoyance, and to some extent I share it, but it is not strictly true to say that the questions will not be answered, as they will be answered in writing.
I am not responsible for setting the Rules of Procedure.
I am simply the referee who interprets the rules and, as you will appreciate, we cannot extend proceedings indefinitely.
Mr Figelâ, you have the floor again.
Â Â  Although estimating the effectiveness of any investment in education is always difficult, the Commission is not aware of any study demonstrating that the return on investment in language teaching is lower compared to other forms of education.
On the contrary, it is commonly agreed that money spent on acquired language skills ensures a good return to the individual, his or her family, companies and society at large in terms of higher salaries, better jobs and increased business opportunities.
According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, more than 50% of European citizens stated that they are able to hold a conversation in one foreign language.
That percentage is encouraging, although it is far from our objective of giving all European citizens the ability to communicate in at least two other languages in addition to their mother tongue.
To pursue that objective, the Commission promotes language learning and linguistic diversity through its programmes for education and training as well as through many other exchange programmes.
Lingua 1 action under the Socrates Programme is aimed at developing and disseminating innovative techniques and examples of good practice in language teaching.
Furthermore, the European Label for innovative projects in language teaching and learning is awarded each year to the most innovative language learning projects in each Member State.
The Commission is bound by its legal obligation to translate into all official languages Community legislation and the related documents that are necessary to enable citizens, companies and other stakeholders to enjoy their rights and comply with their obligations.
As regards other documents, they are translated in accordance with real needs, taking into account available capacity.
That principle applies to all official languages.
Â Â  In my experience many people learn foreign languages, but not so many of them can speak them in everyday life.
I think that is why it is very important to have a criterion at Community level to compare the different language teaching methods.
That would be very useful.
On your other remark, Commissioner, according to figures from InfoPoint Brussels, there are approximately 25% more EU publications in old Member State languages than publications in the new Member State languages.
So those figures are correct as far as I know.
Â Â  In reply to the first comment, we are working on that in real terms, especially on the creation of a European indicator of language competence, which will help us to assess and influence the situation more effectively and to obtain feedback and improvements in the teaching and learning of languages.
On publication, the ratio is something that reflects the total output, but the impact of the new languages has been to increase the linguistic diversity of the Union.
We need, therefore, to function fully in this multilingual environment, because it defines us and provides us with a link to citizens.
This has to be nurtured further, not only in the Union as a whole but also, and especially, in the institutions.
We are working on that.
I do not want to say much about that, as I was asked to shorten my answers.
Perhaps in reply to other questions I can talk about the ways in which we want to promote multilingualism in our institutions.
Â Â  Questions 40 to 43 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  . Mr Guardans CambÃ³, on 20Â July 2005, the Commission appointed MrÂ EtienneÂ Davignon as European coordinator in order to boost the development of priority project No 3, TGV South, which includes the Perpignan-Montpellier section.
The first annual report by the coordinator, MrÂ Davignon, published on 13Â September, states that there may be delays in the implementation of the section in question.
The completion of this section is made more difficult by the presence of protected areas and very built-up residential areas.
On confirmation from the French authorities, it appears that the delays should be far more limited than the ones you have pointed out.
While it is unlikely that we will be able to keep to the date of 2015, the date of 2020 for the entry into service of this infrastructure seems entirely realistic, and it might even be conceivable that the section will be completed before then.
Within the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework, the Commission wants to focus a significant proportion of the Community resources available on the 30 priority projects.
Mr Guardans CambÃ³, in its amended proposal for a regulation laying down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid, the Commission envisages paying special attention to projects concerned with the elimination of bottlenecks, with the cross-border sections and with the waterways, too.
I must insist, MrÂ President, MrÂ GuardansÂ CambÃ³, that Parliament permit the swift adoption of this financial regulation, thanks to which we will be able more swiftly to put in place the funding and to speed up the implementation both of this priority project No 3 and of other projects.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
What credibility does the European Union still have in the eyes of Europeans when it declares a project to be of European interest and sets a date for its completion, and then allows the authorities of the Member States to consider this project an internal project and to state in a press conference that they are not going to carry it through to completion?
You say that the date I have given is an exaggeration; it was the date given by the French authorities in the press conference.
2030: it was the French authorities that said that.
Thus, allow me to have more confidence in the French authorities, which are responsible for completing the line.
What did you just say to us?
What credibility is still possessed by the Commission, which must ensure that European decisions are carried out, if nothing then comes of anything?
Â Â  . I spoke of 2020 after having consulted the French authorities.
You are right, MrÂ Guardans CambÃ³, I am the first to want the major European networks to be completed within acceptable deadlines.
However, that also depends on the Member States giving their support, and you also know that, instead of the EURÂ 20Â billion that we were hoping for under the 2007-2013 financial perspective, we only have EURÂ 8Â billion.
That being said, the coordinator, MrÂ Davignon, and myself do not intend to let the French authorities effectively compromise the future of this major corridor, which is the subject of the priority project.
I therefore have a personal commitment, MrÂ GuardansÂ CambÃ³, and we will do everything possible to ensure that things change, and, although there has been the unfortunate announcement of a timetable that I, for my part, find altogether excessive, well, I am here to tell you that the Commissioner for Transport will fight to change the situation and to ensure that we can have a far more reasonable timetable.
Â Â  Commissioner, having chosen the thirty priority projects, it is alarming that the sluggish attitude of certain Member States should be turning these projects into phantom projects.
Specifically, the coordinator of project NoÂ 3 has complained that, with regard to the planning of the Figueras-Perpignan route, there are regrettably enormous delays.
To what extent, therefore, Commissioner, are you prepared to urge the French and Spanish Governments to fulfil their obligations and give due priority to the route we are talking about?
Â Â  . The national programmes, MrÂ Grandes Pascual, will be examined by the Directorate-General for Transport and myself, and we will have the opportunity, in these negotiations with both France and Spain, to point out the priorities.
There is no question of our distributing European money across all of the projects without having the Member States make a significant contribution to our priorities.
In this negotiation, therefore, I believe that we will have ways of convincing them.
Next, I believe that we will quite easily be able to remind the Member States of the huge importance of these corridors. They are going to completely change the transport sector in Europe, and that includes both passenger transport and freight transport.
I believe, therefore, that we should not have a totally negative and overly pessimistic view of these problems.
It is true that some convincing will be required, but, once again, I, for my part, fully intend, with Parliamentâs backing, to take action so as to progress these projects, which were nonetheless, I would point out, defined by the Member States themselves.
Â Â  . The Commission has already responded within the framework of a written question.
The Member States are not bound to transmit information relating to the management of complaints from air passengers or to the penalties imposed on airline operators.
However, the Commission does, of course, arrange regular meetings with the national control bodies in order to harmonise the application of the regulation and to strengthen the contacts between these bodies so that they will share data relating to the management of complaints.
The Commission is cooperating closely in this context with the Member States in order to draft a guide on how to interpret the provisions of the regulation.
I would point out that we are concerned here with Regulation (EC) NoÂ 261/2004.
I am going to present a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council in January 2007 on the workings and application of this regulation.
The Commission has published an invitation to tender with a view to choosing an external consultant who will be able to collect the quantitative and qualitative data relating to the application of this regulation.
The Commission would like, in particular, to examine the position regarding denied boarding, cancellations, delays and the application of the regulation in such cases.
The results of this study will be incorporated into my communication.
I should like to tell you, MrÂ Tarabella, that the Commission has recorded more than 5Â 500 letters linked to air passenger rights.
These letters are handled carefully.
They enable certain trends to be identified.
This entire monitoring exercise will be used in the context of the infringement proceedings that the Commission will bring against Member States that do not fulfil their obligations to citizens and respect the rights of those citizens as air passengers.
Before we can bring those proceedings, however, we must have enough data.
During the 18Â months of implementing this regulation, the Commission will have collected a critical mass of information and it will be in a position to act when the right moment comes.
I am grateful to you for your question because I, for my part, am really very anxious to ensure that these passenger rights now become a reality within the European area.
Â Â  â Commissioner, can the Commission give me some additional information regarding the amendments that it plans to make to the regulation on air passenger rights in order, firstly, to take account of the hundreds of complaints that have been lodged, for example, at regional consumption centres and that testify both to the serious shortcomings, and to the poor application, of the existing regulations on the rights of these passengers?
Secondly, how does the Commission intend to establish a precise definition of , an argument that is used systematically by airlines so as not to apply the regulation?
Finally, I should also like to ask the Commission how it plans to take account in future of problems such as those recorded by the hundreds of French passengers who were held up recently in Turkey and Israel following failings on the part of the organisers of seat-only sales, which are not covered by any European legislation?
Â Â  . The Commission has organised three meetings with the national control bodies â on 19Â May 2005, 17Â February 2006 and 14Â September 2006, which is very recent â with a view to strengthening the coordination among the various Member States and to harmonising the application of the provisions of the regulation concerned.
In the meantime, we have established a question-and-answer-type information document that will make it easier for the national control bodies to deal with the data on a daily basis.
This document was distributed in JulyÂ 2006.
As I said to you, MrÂ Tarabella, thanks to this critical mass of information, I could actually propose, with the communication that I am going to present before Parliament in prospect, a number of improvements enabling us to ensure that the new law that we have created to benefit passengers is properly applied.
I would say to you once again: the Directorate-General for Transport has handled 5Â 623 letters, which means that we can already identify certain trends.
I must say, for example, that we were pleased to observe a sharp decline in the practice of overbooking.
You are right, though: the events that took place this summer must also be taken into account.
Once I truly have an overall view of things, I hope to be able to come before this Parliament and to explain to it both what improvements have been made and what remains for us to do to ensure that these new rules are applied effectively.
I am grateful to you for having asked that question; it is also an incentive for me to demonstrate even greater vigilance.
Â Â  It is just a question about airline operators.
I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are, but in various instances, with Air France in particular, we are told that it is not up to the airline operator.
What is the Commission doing to make sure that airline operators take their responsibilities seriously?
I had to intervene on behalf of several passengers because they were told that they would not get overnight accommodation, for instance.
I told them that was wrong and that the new law said that they were entitled to that compensation.
Â Â  . Yes, MrsÂ Lynne, I stated that we were going to ask an audit body to review the situation with regard to denied boarding, cancellations and delays, the application of the regulation by airline operators and the national authorities, and the degree of independence of the national control bodies from the national aviation authorities.
You are quite right.
It is not just a question of passengers having rights; it is a question of airline operators and the national authorities being able to really make the people concerned aware of those rights.
Moreover, the study will be conducted in cooperation with airline operators, consumer and passenger associations, and the national authorities.
I personally believe that, in the light of this study, we shall be far more able in future to monitor passenger information, which is in fact a prerequisite for enforcing these new rules.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
Questions 63, 64 and 77 will not be answered because they deal with topics that are already included in the order of business for the current part-session.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  We now continue with the debate on the report by Karin JÃ¶ns on the establishment of a Community programme for employment and social solidarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, the fact that the European institutions have finally adopted a common position on the PROGRESS programme, which deals with employment and social solidarity, is a very important step towards drawing up and implementing a coherent and transparent social policy in the European Union and translating it into the national social policies of the Member States.
The PROGRESS programme not only simplifies and puts the specific elements of this policy in order, but it also integrates them into a single framework.
This is something that had been lacking previously and which will be the key result of our joint debate.
It is right and proper for the programme to be divided into five parts.
Employment is the main challenge currently facing the European Union, its decision-makers and its citizens.
Social security and social integration can be treated as two separate fields but it was probably appropriate to include them both under one section, as social security can be viewed as one of the prerequisites for successful social integration.
Good working conditions complement a policy that aims to improve employment not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality.
The fight against discrimination and the promotion of diversity represent the practical implementation of the principle of positive tolerance and pluralism which should be, and I think is, one of the hallmarks of the European Union.
Creating full gender equality amounts to the implementation of a principle that was adopted in the Treaty of Rome, but which has not been fully implemented until now.
I would like to make two further comments.
First of all, employment is our primary challenge and should be a priority in terms of funding.
However, gender equality is just as important as the fight against discrimination and the fostering of diversity.
I would also like to point out that we have not focused sufficiently on social dialogue, without which we cannot implement the PROGRESS programme.
As far as access to the programme is concerned, it is right to list the institutions and organisations that are entitled to it.
The PROGRESS programme will make a key contribution to achieving the objectives of our social agenda.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, we, too, welcome this report on PROGRESS.
We hope that it is the urgently needed tail wind for EU gender equality policy.
In the wake of the Commissionâs disappointing gender equality roadmap, it is all the more important that as much money as possible be made available for carrying out analyses and public-relations activities relating to EU gender equality policy in the EU Member States.
I am pleased that my fellow Members have put the brakes on the Commissionâs rationalisation pressure, or are set to do so, and have insisted on an increase in funding for PROGRESS.
It is thanks to Parliamentâs persistence that the resources for employment and social solidarity have been increased.
As we all know, politicians are powerless to act without money.
The objective of gender equality policy must be to provide the necessary resources, therefore, because it is impossible to continue this policy without money.
It was a success for Parliament that it managed to push through obligatory gender mainstreaming in all programme areas.
Admittedly we did not succeed in pushing through an independent action programme, but we did push through a cross-cutting task.
Â Â  Mr President, the PROGRESS programme plays an important role in promoting employment and social solidarity and it is all the more important as, increasingly, the drive to put profits before people excludes and marginalises so many.
We are disappointed that Parliament's proposals were not accepted in their entirety and that the Council decided to weaken the programme in the areas of equality, migrant rights and, crucially, in relation to the budget.
However, we believe it is important not to delay the implementation of the programme, otherwise much important work could not take place.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts to strengthen the programme and I hope that in the future we can work together to prioritise EU action to combat social exclusion.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to express my support for all the activities of the European institutions intended to foster growth in the fields of employment and social solidarity and especially for those activities related to PROGRESS, the new Community programme we are currently discussing.
I hope that this programme will not turn into yet another ineffective instrument, swallowing up our joint resources.
I hope that instead, it will contribute directly to changing the difficult situation that many European Union countries face in this area.
I would like to highlight the fact that the issue at stake here is preserving the European social model in the face of a demographic slump that is spreading throughout Europe.
The situation in the Scandinavian countries proves it is possible to implement this model at the same time as maintaining a reasonable level of economic growth.
Of course, the key to success in Scandinavia is a high employment rate, which usually stands at above 70% for both men and women.
Meanwhile, we know that these rates are significantly lower in the majority of the Member States.
In Poland, for example, the employment rate stands at barely 51% for men and 46% for women.
It seems very clear that it is absolutely vital to provide support in the field of employment, especially in the new Member States.
The problem of poverty and social exclusion is another very important matter.
We cannot allow a situation to persist where people are living in poverty, or going hungry, at the heart of Europe, which is one of the richest areas of the globe.
In Poland, over 10% of the population live below the poverty line.
I hope that the PROGRESS programme will contribute to improving the situation.
Wealthy Europe ought to show more solidarity towards social groups which find themselves in a very difficult financial situation.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work on PROGRESS, a new and comprehensive structure for social solidarity.
For many years, social partners have been viewing social funding, human resources and even goodwill as a cake for which they, like hungry children, have felt compelled to compete.
PROGRESS will hopefully take the competition out of the allocation of funding and other resources to social partners representing people who, because of their situation in life â physical, mental, social, ethnic, economic, employment or lack of employment, and so on â need the support of the wider community.
I should like to stress once more that within PROGRESS there needs to be room for small and new NGOs. They need to be encouraged to survive and to thrive.
It cannot only be the older, bigger NGOs, unions and organisations that are recognised and involved.
Needs change and new needs arise.
We need to remember that the well-established groups were once small too.
Â Â  Mr President, hopefully it will be equally on time!
I welcome this new Community programme, which brings together four previous programmes and seeks to streamline them and to provide more money for their implementation.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, my own Group, Commissioner Å pidla and the Council for largely agreeing the amendments which Parliament put forward and which the Commission fought hard for.
It is important that more money is available, but it is also important that we should seek here to enhance the socially-inclusive Europe citizens clearly desire.
I am particularly pleased that we have achieved the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in this new programme.
I look forward to our sharing experiences with each other through organisations across Europe at conferences and so on.
It is a sad fact that the European Union has, over many years, engaged in a lot of pilot projects, but a lot of the lessons that have been learnt in those projects and programmes have not been mainstreamed.
Hopefully the achievement of gender mainstreaming, at least in this programme, will ensure that gender mainstreaming is part of all policies developed by the European Union and the Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is a very ambitious objective that the leaders of the European Union have set the Member States.
The different experiences of individual Member States in areas such as employment demonstrate just how ambitious this objective is.
There are some examples where employment levels have approached the indicators set.
I would remind you that these rates are set at 70% for men, 60% for women and 50% for the 55 - 64 age group.
However, there are countries, especially amongst the new Member States of the European Union, that are a long way from achieving the aims of this strategy.
Bearing this in mind, I must once again applaud the initiative to create PROGRESS, a new employment and social solidarity programme for the Community.
As a member of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to stress at this juncture that ever since the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs began its work, my group has been in favour of increasing funding for specific fields of action while, at the same time, decreasing the 10% target reserve which was stipulated in the draft programme.
The PPE-DE Group specifically stressed the need to decrease the beneficiariesâ own contributions.
This is why we welcome the fact that the funding for the PROGRESS programme has been increased to EURÂ 743Â million.
Fortunately, this increase has already been agreed within the framework of an interinstitutional agreement and included in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
Finally, I welcome the fact that the Councilâs common position contains most of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament This is particularly a positive step in terms of making better use of resources to ensure that women and disabled people are more active in the labour market.
The low level of employment, especially amongst disabled people, is a particular problem in my country and I hope that thanks to the PROGRESS programme, we will be able to remedy this situation within the next seven years.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, on the efficacy of the enterprise.
The Progress Community programme is a very important tool for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the field of employment and social policy.
The importance of this tool is reflected in the agreement of all the institutions of the European Union.
We need to emphasise that the reference to full and equal access for disabled persons to all activities funded under the Progress programme helps to achieve the basic objectives of the programme, in other words combating discrimination and social integration.
At the same time, however, I wish to emphasise that I consider the provision for additional economic and other encumbrances caused by disability to be counterbalanced to be particularly important, in order to ensure equal participation of persons with disabilities in the programme's activities.
Finally, I wish to emphasise the need for non-governmental organisations representing persons with disabilities to participate at regional, national and European level in the works provided for in the programmes, which are designed to transfer best practices and exchange information and raise public awareness about integration and social protection issues.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, the Commissioner and the Council on having worked so quickly and so well.
Thanks to them, Europe will have this instrument from 1Â January, and I hope that it will be, as we have said, a leap forward in terms of improving the coherence and complementarity of the existing programmes.
Secondly, Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that we are taking the Lisbon process seriously in its entirety.
That process obliges us to implement an economic reform and, undoubtedly, a modernisation of Europe, but at the same time to remember that, in order to ensure that the economic reform is a success, we must build a more cohesive and inclusive society.
Now that PROGRESS is on the table, I believe that those who say that the social Europe is purely an issue for the Member States are mistaken.
Europe has much to say and much to do and, although it is clearly still the Member States which are building their welfare states, Europe offers added value in the form of coherence and intelligence and helps our Member States to deal with the immense challenges facing us in this era of globalisation.
I therefore hope that the Commission will act intelligently.
It is a small instrument financially speaking, but it must be used very intelligently.
I hope that we can maintain this approach of working together, of not losing sight of our priorities and of making our Agenda the citizens' Agenda.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate MrsÂ KarinÂ JÃ¶ns for this excellent programme.
In light of the Lisbon Strategy, I consider it very important to take such initiatives, the aim of which is to improve employment, strengthen social solidarity and thus to make the European Union more competitive.
We need ambitious goals: restoring full employment, improving the quality and productivity of labour and strengthening social solidarity.
In this regard, I wish to emphasise in particular the part of the programme that devotes special attention to gender mainstreaming, the implementation of the principle of gender equality in social policy.
I am also pleased that the report strives to take into consideration the special needs of people with disabilities.
In working out and implementing the programme, I consider due cooperation with other committees to be important as well.
In my opinion, the protection of minorities, and in particular of the Roma minorities, should constitute a separate section of the report, and perhaps it would be worth devoting proportionately more funds to the financing of gender equality.
The implementation of PROGRESS calls for European-wide sharing of information and the dissemination of best practices throughout the entire Community, if we want to achieve these goals.
All in all, we have before us a programme that can be realised only through collaboration across Europe, something that deserves our support in every area.
Â Â  Mr President, I am going to talk solely about actions aimed at equality between men and women.
Ladies and gentlemen, when in the middle of 2004 we all hoped that the European Commission would launch a new action plan for equality between men and women, we were surprised to find that, instead, the Commission proposed PROGRESS, a programme for promoting employment and solidarity, which included actions to promote equality between men and women but within a broader framework of social action.
In the belief that it was still necessary to pay greater and more differentiated attention to equality between men and women, the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality was opposed, from the outset, to incorporating the programme on equality between men and women into PROGRESS, and it also called for greater budgetary resources and insisted on the need for equality between men and women to be treated as something common to all Community policies.
An important and positive negotiation therefore began, which has been maintained throughout the parliamentary procedure that is ending today, with results that we can describe as more than reasonable.
Actions aimed at equality between men and women are being kept within PROGRESS, and that is something that we do not find satisfactory.
We achieved the separation of the DAPHNE Programme, but that has not been possible here.
We are still calling for greater visibility for equality policies, but we must congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, the draftspeople for the committeesâ opinions and also the Commission and the Council, because their joint work has made it possible substantially to improve the initial proposal in terms of funding and content and in terms of integrating the gender perspective into all of the programmeâs actions.
Â Â  Honourable Members, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur and all those who contributed to this report, which as I can see from the discussion is seen as a joint success of the European institutions.
It is clear from the discussion that the programme is regarded as being sensibly arranged and equipped with the appropriate resources.
It is also clear that the manner in which the report was submitted is regarded as being appropriate to the situation â and at this point I should like to highlight the fact that the report will be submitted directly to Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must seize the opportunity to ensure that, from 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, we pursue an effective and successful implementation of all of the aims and objectives envisaged in the programme, thereby fulfilling the expectations that are sure to have arisen through the success of this phase.
Â Â  I should like to thank all the speakers, 50% of whom were women.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the report by AgustÃ­n DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the âPericlesâ programme) (COM(2006)0243 â C6-0179/2006 â 2006/0078(CNS)) (A6-0276/2006), and
- the report by AgustÃ­n DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision extending to the non-participating Member States the application of Decision 2006/âŠ/EC amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the âPericlesâ programme) (COM(2006)0243 â C6-0180/2006 â 2006/0079(CNS)) (A6-0277/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, allow me first to express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, for his support for the Commissionâs proposal for the extension of the Pericles programmes.
Pericles, a Community programme for exchange, assistance and training in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, was established by a Council decision in 2001 and is designed to support and supplement the measures undertaken by the Member States to protect the euro against counterfeiting.
With an initial duration of four years â 2002 to 2005 â it had a total reference amount of EUR 4 million.
The Pericles programme covers a broad range of actions organised not just within the EU, but also in third or candidate countries.
Its action incorporates diversified target groups and participants, covering all the areas relevant to the protection of the euro â law enforcement, judicial, financial and technical â and promoting the creation of networks useful in achieving greater efficiency in the fight against the crime of counterfeiting.
In addition, Pericles assists the increased effectiveness of cooperation between law enforcement agents and representatives of the judiciary and financial institutions.
Nevertheless, the counterfeiting of euros remains a serious and especially a symbolic problem, even if its proportions are not alarming.
Since early summer 2003, the number of counterfeit euro banknotes detected in circulation has stabilised at about 50Â 000 a month, a level below the pre-euro levels, lower than the US dollar and extremely low compared to the 9Â million genuine euro banknotes in circulation.
The number of counterfeit euro coins also remains low by historical standards.
Recently police forces have successfully conducted a number of operations to dismantle workshops and seize large numbers of counterfeit banknotes and coins before they enter into circulation.
The Pericles programme is playing a significant role in achieving results in the protection of the euro and the fight against the crime of counterfeiting.
There is clearly a need for continued joint efforts to combat this form of crime.
The Pericles programme has recently been evaluated.
The evaluators concluded that the programme did indeed improve awareness, its target groups have been reached, especially law enforcement officials, and its activities and information exchanges were considered relevant to the objectives of the programme.
Based on the positive evaluation of Pericles and the continued need, in 2005 the Commission proposed the extension of the programme.
Pending an agreement on the Community financial perspectives for the period 2007-2013, the Council initially decided to extend the Pericles programme for one year only, until 2006, but made a political commitment to the continuation of the programme.
Consequently, building on the success the programme has demonstrated, in May 2006 the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council decision concerning the extension of the Pericles programme for the period 2007-2013.
The yearly amount remains unchanged, approximately EURÂ 1Â million, leading to an overall reference amount of EUR 7 million.
The Commissionâs proposal for extension until 2013 also reflects the practical convenience of fitting in with the duration of the Communityâs financial framework.
Once more I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, for their attention to the protection of this important element of the common European identity and heritage that is its common currency.
The public authorities at national and European level, as well as industry, have to keep up their efforts and continue cooperation and the exchange of know-how.
It is through our combined efforts that we will be able to protect the interests of tradesmen, consumers and the economy in general against illicit gain from the counterfeiting of our money.
Â Â  Mr President, the protection of the euro against counterfeiting is very important in terms of maintaining the citizensâ confidence in the single currency.
I agree with everything that MrÂ Kallas has said.
The introduction of the euro as a single currency was a huge challenge.
The dollar, as a currency of a transnational nature, a reserve currency and a currency of global transaction, is presently the most counterfeited currency.
Unfortunately, the euro shares these features with the dollar, though to a lesser extent, and that is why, since its birth, we have had to adopt and adapt many measures aimed at preventing its counterfeiting.
The Pericles programme is intended to support and complement the actions introduced by the Member States and by the existing programmes for protecting the euro by means of exchanges, assistance and training with a view to protecting our single currency against counterfeiting.
As we know, the programme was established by means of the Council Decision of 17Â December 2001, which stated that assessment reports on the programme must be presented, accompanied by a proposal on its continuation or adaptation.
The first report was published and presented to Parliament and the Council on 30Â November 2004.
Then, on 8Â April, the Commission presented a proposal on the basis of which the Council extended the programme to 2006, providing it with a budget of EUR 1Â million and requiring a detailed report on the results of the programme to be presented to Parliament and the Commission.
With regard to assessment, Pericles has made a very clear positive contribution to the protection of the euro and the fight against counterfeiting.
Its continuation is therefore fully justified.
In particular, the perception of the Community dimension of the euro has been improved and it has given the participants a better understanding of the legislation and instruments available; an overall commitment of 80% of the initial reference sum during the period 2002-2006 has been achieved; 64 projects have been implemented involving 76 countries; the effective complementarity of national and Community actions has been emphasised â 48 of the 64 initiatives emerged from the Member States, while 16 came from the Commission or OLAF; the programme has taken on an international dimension, with the involvement not just of all of the Members States and those about to join, but also of other non-EU countries in which the production of counterfeit banknotes is widespread, such as Colombia; considerable structural improvements have been made, with the creation and establishment in several countries of national central offices responsible for combating the counterfeiting of the currency; and there has been systematic involvement of the European Central Bank and other organisations, such as Europol, OLAF and Interpol.

The results of the Pericles programme so far are hopeful, as indicated in the six-monthly report of the European Central Bank on the counterfeiting of the euro.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to counterfeit our currency.
The data corresponding to the first six months of this year show that the proportion of counterfeit banknotes is falling in relation to the increase in the number of genuine notes put into circulation.
As the Commissioner has already said, 50Â 000 notes of our currency are counterfeited each month, while there are 9Â 000 million genuine notes in circulation.
Between January and June of this year, 300Â 000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn from circulation.
Of all the counterfeit notes withdrawn during the first half of this year, 44% were 20 euro notes and 36% were 50 euro notes, which means that there has been a significant increase in the counterfeiting of 20 euro notes.
Twelve per cent of all counterfeit notes were 100 euro notes, while 500 euro notes represented just 1%.
In short, Mr President, I very much agree with the proposal.
It is of crucial importance that the Community legislator ensure that the extension of the programme be properly linked both to the financial perspective and to the introduction of the euro in the new States.
The Council is postponing the Pericles decision until a final agreement has been adopted on the financial perspective for 2007-2013; we entirely agree that it should conform to the financial perspective, with an annual budget of EUR 1Â million.
For all of these reasons, I recommend that, under these conditions, the European Parliament approve the Commission's proposals, modifying and extending the Pericles programme.
I would like to say one more thing, Mr President.
I wish to protest at the change of time for this debate.
I have not been consulted and I have not been given any explanation.
I should have been with the victims of terrorism from my country, but I am here out of respect for all of you.
When I finish my speech, I shall leave to be with them and I would like to offer all of you, and you in particular, MrÂ Kallas, the apologies that you deserve - apologies such as I, for my part, was not given.
I hope that you understand my reasons for having to leave.
Â Â  Apparently the actual timetable has not been changed.
However, we began the Rapkay report this morning and we then went on with the continuation as foreseen in the original agenda.
However, thank you for your observations. I am sorry that it caused you difficulties.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking with full knowledge of the facts and I believe that you should be aware of them too.
I have here the agenda, with the timetable and the schedule for voting on the two Pericles reports this morning.
The two Pericles reports should have been voted on this morning, and here it is in black and white, Mr President.
I would therefore like to offer my apologies for leaving the Chamber now â apologies such as I, for my part, was not given.
Â Â  We understand your position.
We will write you a letter explaining what has happened, from this perspective.
Thank you for your observations and I am sorry that you were put to such discomfort.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, in the euro, we have one of the safest currencies in the world, and that is the way it should remain.
It should not be taken for granted, however, as permanent measures are needed to keep it that way.
By this I mean the technical measures that have been taken and are still being taken in the case of renewal, on the one hand, and training and exchanges on the other.
Pericles as a supporting action programme â which has been extremely successful to date, with 64Â projects and over 3Â 000 participants from 76Â countries â shows the great interest there has in fact been in this action programme.
Counterfeiting and losses have been reduced.
I can give an example for my country, Austria, namely that, in the last year, seizures have been down by more than 40% and losses have been reduced by more than 50%.
The programme can take some of the credit for this.
Evaluation by OLAF has also revealed certain weaknesses, however.
I am obliged to the Commission and the rapporteur for taking the opportunity this presents to set in motion the new Pericles programme, which runs until 2013.
I consider it particularly important that new priorities are being set, for example in the field of practical training and of personnel exchanges and, looking ahead to the new generation of euro notes, specific training in the new technical aspects.
I also welcome the extension to countries wishing to introduce the euro, that is to say, to the partner countries in which counterfeiting is in fact taking place, and also specifically to groups of people who have not been covered up to now to the same extent as by the first part, when the programme was used particularly for law-enforcement authorities.
We must now appeal to the Member States to make optimum use of the programme, so that we can look to the future with optimism and make the euro the safest currency in the world.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the Council decision of 30Â January 2006 amending and extending Decision 2001/923/EC establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, for which I am a shadow rapporteur.
The decision also provides for the extension of the programme to the non-participating Member States.
The main aim of the programme is, by means of exchange, assistance and training, to ensure uniform protection of the euro in all Member States while taking account of the individual situation in each country.
In May this year the Commission presented an evaluation document that was generally favourable, because of the major contribution made by the programme in protecting the euro and fighting counterfeiting.
The Pericles programme has allowed us to identify geographical areas, such as Colombia, for instance, where false banknotes tend to be produced easily.
This has been possible because better structures have been created through the setting-up of national centres committed to the fight against the counterfeiting of our currency.
It is important, therefore, to continue to ensure cooperation among the European institutions â the Commission, OLAF, the European Central Bank and Europol â making it possible to identify those areas where counterfeiting of the euro occurs most.
Extending the programme will make it possible to continue surveillance, training and technical assistance, which are vital activities for maintaining the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
The programme also leads to greater effectiveness by extending technical assistance and even offering financial assistance for cooperation in cross-border operations, thanks to the participation of Europol.
The new Member States deserve particular attention, above all those that are going to introduce the euro as the single currency.
To conclude, I am in favour both of continuing the programme, as proposed by the Council, and of extending it to the non-participating Member States, so that the necessary measures can be adopted to ensure a uniform level of protection of the euro even in the Member States that have not yet adopted it as their official currency.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are in agreement with the Councilâs decision to extend the duration of the Pericles programme.
Extending the programme to Member States that are not in the euro zone is necessary and desirable.
It is, after all, of huge importance that the trust in the euro should not be undermined by counterfeiting.
There are two aspects that cause us to raise questions at the moment surrounding the euro.
The first of these is the use of the euro as legal tender in countries outside the euro zone.
The euro is being widely accepted particularly in Montenegro and Turkey.
Can Commissioner Kallas indicate in what way those countries are being involved in the programme in order to fight counterfeiting and the bringing into circulation of counterfeit euro coins?
In 2004, the European Parliament adopted the report on medals and coins that resemble euro coins.
There was a huge increase in fraud involving coins that resemble euro coins.
Commissioner, could you say whether the Councilâs regulation on this subject has had any impact?
Â Â  â Mr President, ever since a decision was made to create a common currency in the European Union within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty, it has been necessary to contend with the dangers which arise in connection with the project.
Counterfeiting has existed ever since people became aware of the value of counterfeit goods.
It is extremely important to combat the production of counterfeit euros in order to maintain the citizens' trust in the common currency.
At the moment, it is essential for Community legislation to ensure that the way in which the programme is extended takes account of the deadline for introducing the euro in the new Member States and the entry into circulation of a second series of euro banknotes.
It is also necessary to ensure that competences in this important process do not overlap and to make sure that all the joint activities of the various institutions complement each other and are compatible.
It seems essential for the European Commission and Europol to jointly assess new projects that are to be funded within the framework of the PERICLES programme.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we accept that the euro needs to be adequately protected by means of a range of integrated, effective measures involving close cooperation at both European and international level.
We therefore welcome the creation of the Pericles programme.
We support this detailed report submitted to Parliament on the implementation and results of this programme, and wish to highlight the fact that the results have clearly been good.
In the second half of 2003 the number of false banknotes in circulation levelled off. The figures were favourable in comparison both with those prior to the introduction of the euro and with levels of counterfeiting of the US dollar.
Although the number of counterfeit euro coins continues to rise, this figure is still low in comparison with the counterfeiting of the old coins.
In other words, the level of counterfeiting is low, a major factor in which is the high level of cooperation among the relevant services.
Action has been taken to dismantle counterfeiting operations and to confiscate significant amounts of counterfeit notes and coins prior to their entry into circulation.
This programme has therefore largely achieved its objectives, and has made it possible to identify the places, both within and outside the Community, where production of counterfeit notes is at its highest.
It has also led to considerable structural improvements.
In a number of countries, for example, central bodies charged with combating euro counterfeiting have been set up.
I therefore endorse MrÂ DÃ­azÂ deÂ Meraâs excellent report, the aim of which is to extend the programme until the end of 2013 so as to align its period of validity with the financial perspective.
Furthermore â and this is a point I wish to emphasise â it is aimed at extending its application to the non-participating Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the extension of the Pericles programme is undoubtedly important.
It is no good praising the euro as unforgeable and giving it various security features, however, if our citizens and cashiers are unfamiliar with these features or unable to use them properly.
It is true that there is greater awareness now and EURÂ 100 and higher denomination notes are tested, but, since counterfeit EURÂ 20 and EURÂ 50 notes now make up approximately 80% of fakes, we must increase awareness of the problems still further.
Unfortunately, the large size of the area using the euro, in particular, makes the production of high-quality counterfeit coins attractive to counterfeiters.
In addition, the progress made in the field of printing technology has made it increasingly difficult for the lay person to distinguish genuine from counterfeit notes.
With approximately 600Â 000 counterfeit notes withdrawn from circulation each year, much work certainly remains to be done, all the more so because, in addition to the rising figures for these, coins are increasingly arousing the interest of counterfeiters.
The only way to tackle the increase in counterfeiting is by raising awareness, which was the idea behind organising more workshops on the subject, including by, or in, the EU information outlets.
It would make particular sense to increase the provision of information in each of the regions in which increasing numbers of fakes â counterfeit money â have been found.
It may also make sense to extend the search project by means of text-messaging business people to enable the perpetrators to be arrested, which is already being done in Austria with some success.
At all events, making the eurozone an area with an unforgeable currency should be an important preoccupation of all of ours.
Â Â  Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ DÃ­az de MeraÂ GarcÃ­aÂ Consuegra, for his work in this field. It may not be a very exciting area, but it is a very important one.
MrÂ DÃ­az de MeraÂ GarcÃ­aÂ Consuegra has drafted a fine report, as I am keen to point out, as I myself was the rapporteur on this matter when it was one of the topics of the day during the last election campaign.
At that time, opinions were a little more divided, especially with regard to which denominations would be counterfeited.
The line taken by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats subsequently proved to be the right one.
Many people thought that the EURÂ 500 notes would be the ones most counterfeited, but we in the PPE-DE Group were of the opinion that the smaller denominations, such as the EURÂ 20 and EURÂ 50 notes, would be at greater risk.
I am pleased to see that MrÂ DÃ­az de MeraÂ GarcÃ­aÂ Consuegra is in favour of the idea of careful monitoring also in countries where the euro has not yet been introduced.
The risk of counterfeits is, more often than not, greater in these countries, as the populations have not had the same level of preparation as in the Eurozone countries.
It is harder for people in these countries to tell the difference between real and fake notes and, in many cases, people are often less suspicious too.
Fortunately, counterfeiting has been a much smaller problem than had been feared, perhaps due to the very Pericles programme that we are discussing, and especially due to the large scope that it has been given.
This is another example of something good that the EU has done.
This is an area where we no longer have so much conflict, but there is every reason to inform people about this programme, which protects us all in our everyday lives.
Â Â  I am grateful to Members for their comments and their support for the Pericles programme, which tries to fight counterfeiting.
Counterfeiting is politically a very serious crime, which somehow humiliates the authorities, but the fight against it is eternal.
The fight against the counterfeiting of euro coins in the European Union has been relatively successful.
The cooperation between the European Central Bank, Europol and OLAF has also been relatively efficient.
Euro notes are of quite a high quality. But that does not diminish the importance of fighting counterfeiting.
In my previous occupations I have had occasion to deal with the issue.
The main problem is always the streets and dark bars where the counterfeit notes are put into circulation.
That explains why EUR 500 notes are not found amongst counterfeit notes.
One specific question was about Turkey and Montenegro.
Montenegro is a specific issue. It has the euro as an official currency.
It is not so much a question of counterfeiting as of the monetary policy of the European Union.
I know my colleagues are thinking about how to deal with that.
Turkey has promised â I have visited Turkey and discussed this with the Turkish authorities â to gradually phase out the coins that are quite similar to euro coins.
To change the production process takes some time, but at least they have made a promise to do so.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Panayiotis Demetriou, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings (COM(2005)0091 â C6-0235/2005 â 2005/0018(CNS)) (A6-0268/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report and for the excellent cooperation.
Currently, little, if any, account is taken of convictions handed down in other Member States. That is not acceptable in an area of freedom, security and justice.
That is why the objective of the EU is twofold: first, information on criminal convictions should circulate efficiently between the Member States, and secondly, it should be possible to use that information outside the territory of the sentencing Member State.
The main objective of the proposal is to define the conditions under which a conviction handed down in another Member State can be taken into account in new criminal proceedings concerning different facts.
As the effects attached to the existence of a previous conviction can vary widely from one Member State to another, the proposal does not aim at harmonising those effects.
The core principle â which I fully agree with â is, rather, a principle of assimilation where the objective is to ensure that those effects are equivalent to those of a previous national conviction.
In line with that principle, the proposal is not limited to the trial stage but covers the various stages of criminal proceedings where national law can attach effects to a previous conviction.
It encompasses the pre-trial stage where the existence of a previous conviction can, for example, influence decisions on pre-trial detention, as well as the post-trial stage where they can notably have an impact on the execution of the sentence.
The Commission fully supports this report and looks forward to cooperating closely with the rapporteur.
Â Â  â Mr President, the proposal for taking into account previous convictions in the European Union is part of the institutional regulations being promoted by the Commission within the framework of the implementation of the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere and I should like at this point to praise vice-president Commissioner Frattini on the efforts he is making to implement these conclusions of the European Council in Tampere.
The proposal is another step in the direction of the enlargement of judicial cooperation and the development of confidence between the Member States in the field of justice.
It is another measure to promote the principle of the mutual recognition of civil and criminal judgments, which is considered to be the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in the Union.
The institution whereby account is taken of previous convictions needs to be introduced in order to combat crime more effectively, especially as the existing relevant European conventions of 1959 and 1970 have proven to be ineffective.
The proposal as formulated is confined to the regulation of issues of substantive law.
The regulation of procedural issues has been left within the framework of the other proposal which is pending in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is being processed by our honourable friend and rapporteur DÃ­az de Mera.
That proposal is the other side of the same coin.
With the proposal to be put to the vote, administrative convictions are excluded from the definition of a conviction, because in most Member States they are not recorded in the register of convictions and because there is no uniform definition as to what constitutes an administrative conviction.
The assimilation of the importance and gravity of a conviction handed down by a court in another Member State with a conviction handed down in the Member State in which the new criminal proceedings are taking place is being promoted.
Thus, in the event of a conviction for a crime which does not exist in the Member State trying the new case, the conviction is not taken into account.
The proposal is free of the confusion and uncertainty which would exist if the provisions of the original proposal for the selective taking into account of previous convictions and offences had been adopted, but retains the obligation of the Member State not to take account of convictions handed down in another Member State where the principle of non bis in idem, limitation or amnesty are infringed.
We are of the opinion that, as the proposal to be put to the vote has been formulated, it adequately serves both the principle of mutual recognition of court judgments and the policy of gradual assimilation of the law.
It should be emphasised once again that the present measure, like other similar measures, is based on the principles of mutual recognition and confidence.
However, it is important for the Council to proceed as quickly as possible with the approval of the drastic proposal for the minimum criteria in criminal proceedings, which was voted through many months ago by the European Parliament and will strengthen the above principles.
Why is the Council delaying on such an important issue?
Finally, I welcome the statement the other day by the Finnish Presidency about intensifying the drafting of legislation and the monitoring of the application of decisions relating to criminal matters.
Let us hope that this statement will be put into practice.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, over the last seven years we have witnessed the development of tools, such as the European arrest warrant or the transfer of prisoners, which are designed to strengthen mutual confidence between the national judicial authorities and the development of a policy leading to the convergence of criminal law.
Now we are approving the Commission decision to establish a new system, on the basis of which the Member States will be able to take account, in criminal proceedings, of previous convictions against the same person handed down in another Member State of the European Union.
Previous convictions handed down in other Member States will have the same force as those handed down in the Member State in which the new criminal proceedings are to be instituted.
I should like to add something else to the other arguments about the need for the measure expounded by MrÂ Demetriou: that this is absolutely logical, because previous convictions shape the personality of the offender and play a role in assessing the punishment.
To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, who succeeded, with his amendments, in reconciling the views of the Council and the Commission, which differed considerably on certain basic points.
Finally, I hope that the statement by the Finnish Presidency will not remain a statement, but will start to be put into practice.
We need to take faster steps to unify criminal law.
Â Â  Mr President, while taking into account the current diversity of national judicial systems, it is highly desirable to promote mutual recognition of judgments between the European Union Member States.
As already indicated by the Tampere European Council, the mutual recognition principle is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters.
That being so, it is of the utmost importance to lay down an appropriate legal basis, so that a conviction handed down in one Member State can be taken into account in new criminal proceedings against the same person concerning different facts in other Member States.
The Commission proposal for a framework decision should be approved as amended.
The object of the mutual recognition principle is to confer the same validity and the same effect on convictions handed down in other Member States as on previous national convictions.
It should be explicitly stated that the Member State is not required to enforce the conviction handed down in another Member State, but just to draw the appropriate conclusions from the earlier case in the new proceedings.
Furthermore, the effects of previous convictions will still be governed by national laws in each Member State.
A principle of assimilation of judgments given in other Member States to national convictions should be established, still leaving it to national legislation to draw the appropriate conclusions from the principle.
However, I have to consider it necessary for previous sentences to be taken into account, provided that their weight in the other evaluation is equal to the sentence issued by the Member State in which proceedings have been opened.
Moreover, in the case of criminal proceedings in the Member State, a firm conviction related to acts not punishable in that Member State must not be taken into account.
Â Â  Mr President, in this report we see another example of the so-called beneficial crisis which gives the European Union the opportunity to press forward with yet more political integration.
There is indeed a problem.
In London, the Metropolitan Police admit that most of the organised crime is now run by a variety of ethnic gangs, many of them from EU countries. This is quite apart from individual criminals who have come to Britain to pursue their professions.
The real problem lies with Britainâs open border policy and the right of EU citizens to unhindered entry to the UK, as well as the Governmentâs complete abdication of any control over who can and cannot come in from anywhere in the world.
But the telling part of this report is the reference to the Tampere European Council which intends to force a European system of justice on the UK and the comment that âthere is a long way to go until justice is procedurally, evidentially and substantially administered in a more or less similar way in all the Member Statesâ.
Yes, indeed there is, and long may it remain so.
Britain still has â the right to trial by jury and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty â and some of us in Britain intend, and want, that we should keep those safeguards.
The UK Independence Partyâs response to this report is âthanks, but no thanksâ.
Â Â  â (PL) Mr President, the framework decision that we are debating is particularly important as regards the assimilation and harmonisation of legislation.
I agree with the rapporteur that national law should be the only criterion determining whether, and to what extent, legal effects should be attached to previous convictions handed down abroad.
However, we should not forget basic principles such as , the statute of limitations, amnesty or removal of entries from the national criminal register.
I therefore think that we should retain ArticleÂ 4.
We should also emphasise that, during the course of criminal proceedings in a Member State, we cannot allow convictions handed down abroad to be taken into account if they relate to acts that are not punishable in the Member State in question.
I agree with the rapporteur that the best place for the provisions contained in ArticleÂ 6 is in the proposal concerning the Council framework decision on the exchange between the Member States of information pertaining to the criminal register and its contents.
Â Â  Mr President, as in the case of many EU harmonising proposals there is a certain simplistic and plausible appeal to mutual recognition of criminal convictions throughout the Community.
But make no mistake: it is part of a grand design for an integrated and EU-controlled criminal justice system requiring, of necessity, the subservience of national systems.
For me, criminal justice matters are intrinsically national issues and must remain so.
Hence I welcome the resistance at last Fridayâs Council of Ministers meeting to a further surrender of the national veto.
I hope it will be sustained.
Not only because of my opposition to the grand design of which it is part but because it diminishes the protection of my constituents against unfairness, I oppose this proposal.
The savage experience of British citizens abroad confirms my view that we have much to lose from criminal justice integration.
Remember the spectacle made of the British plane spotters in Greece.
Remember the appalling conviction of Kevin Sweeney in Holland.
Why should it be possible for ropey convictions, secured by lesser standards than those applicable in the United Kingdom, to be held against United Kingdom citizens in their own country?
I say they should not.
Therefore, I oppose this proposal.
In the protection of my constituents, my watchword is âBritish standards for British citizensâ.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation from the Committee on Regional Development on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion (11807/2006 â C6 0266/2006 â 2006/0131(AVC)) (Rapporteur: Constanze Angela Krehl) (A6-0281/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, let me start by saying, on behalf of Commissioner Å pidla and myself, that we very much welcome the report on strategic guidelines for cohesion adopted by Parliamentâs Committee on Regional Development on 11 September.
In particular I should like to thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report and also for the good cooperation we have enjoyed over the past year on the dossier.
I have been grateful for the support and ideas of the Committee on Regional Development and Parliament during this period on what is perhaps the most important and innovative part of the new cohesion policy for 2007-2013.
Through the guidelines we are seeking to ensure that Community priorities are more fully integrated into national and regional development programmes supported by the Union.
The guidelines seek to provide a clear and consistent approach in support of growth and jobs under the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
I believe that the guidelines have benefited considerably from Parliamentâs contribution.
I would draw your attention to the recitals that have been added to the document since Parliament produced its report last May.
These are important in the sense that they reveal the political orientation that lies behind the guidelines.
The recitals draw heavily on the suggestions in the report drafted by Mrs Krehl.
For example, they draw attention to the importance of partnership (recital 16), to the contribution of infrastructure to convergence (recital 11), to equality of opportunity and the fight against discrimination (recital 15), to the importance of development that is sustainable in environmental terms (recital 14), to territorial cohesion and to the urban dimension (recital 12).
It is worth noting that in adopting these recitals the Council and the Member States are in effect writing a memo to themselves on how the next programmes should be run.
This is clearly very important for us as we look forward to the programme negotiations.
In addition to the recitals, the text of the guidelines has been reinforced in key areas of importance to Parliament.
In particular we have given more attention to territorial cohesion. This includes stronger wording on the urban question.
We have also developed the text on the three initiatives â Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica â which you have supported strongly.
This should, among other things, make a contribution to developing the use of public/private partnerships in our programmes, which is one of the recommendations of your report on the guidelines.
There are many other areas where I think you will find that the Commission has tried to accommodate Parliamentâs wishes.
I do not need to summarise once again the content of the document, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to remind ourselves of the vision of the new cohesion policy, which the strategic guidelines can help us to achieve.
This vision is centred around economic development, which is increasingly being driven by local and regional resources, be it innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, local human skills or academic institutions.
This vision is about developing our unique system of multilevel governance by taking policy closer to the local and regional levels, closer to the people and closer to the place where growth and jobs are created.
I know that some of you expressed a wish to have more debate on strategic guidelines, so I am looking forward to hearing your views.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with todayâs debate and tomorrowâs vote, Parliament is laying the keystone of two-and-a-half yearsâ work on preparing the legislative package on cohesion policy for the years 2007â2013.
This is a cohesion policy that is to function with 25 â or 27 â Member States for the first time, the new Member States all being beneficiaries of the Cohesion Fund and set to draw great benefit from the future cohesion and structural policies.
We should like tomorrowâs vote to clear the way for the conclusion, submission and approval by the Commission of the operational programmes in the regions, so as to ensure an early start to the projects in the less-favoured regions of the EU next year.
Looking back, I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the cooperation I have received on the report on the strategic guidelines.
The Commission proposal is good; it was a joint effort â with the Commission and the Council, that is â and I should like to mention explicitly here that we had a great deal of direct contact with the regions.
The visits I was able to make to Lisbon, Madrid, Bratislava, Prague, Stockholm and Helsinki as rapporteur contributed considerably to the quality of the report that was subsequently adopted jointly in committee and plenary.
I am delighted that the additional priorities Parliament wanted to introduce for the guidelines have indeed been largely reflected in the document on which the Council decided in August.
Probably the most important point is the clear statement that we want the EU to develop in a sustainable way, that we have more in view than short-term economic objectives, but instead are striving for sustainable improvements, including in living and working conditions, particularly in the less-favoured and underdeveloped regions of the EU.
That is why it was so important to us that access to cohesion funding be free from discrimination.
The final document now present spells out once more that disabled and elderly people and those with a migrant background have exactly the same access to funding as everyone else.
This is an important signal to the public in the regions.
We have attached importance to emphasising that the EU is striving to create not just any jobs, but better-quality, sustainable jobs.
This is closely linked to an improvement in training and in the opportunities for setting up research organisations, and also to the opportunity of bringing the results produced by these research organisations to small and medium-sized enterprises more quickly and to a greater extent.
We have anchored all of this even more strongly in the strategic guidelines.
Very important to us â after a long, detailed debate â is the field of support for towns, cities and urban areas, as it is there that 80% of the European population lives.
For this reason, we must concentrate resources on this field, not only on job creation, but also, for example, on the development of transport infrastructure or the improvement of the environmental situation in towns and cities.
We have emphasised one point in particular, and that is the territorial cooperation that is more important than ever in an enlarged EU to enable us to learn from one another and develop projects together.
Last week, a working-group visit to Hungary gave me the first opportunity to see for myself the kind of strategically intelligent visions and ideas that are being generated in the new Member States, too.
Perhaps some of the regions that have been receiving EU cohesion funding for years could take a leaf out of the new Member Statesâ book.
For this we need to promote territorial cooperation further, however.
A further point â about which I shall speak particularly in my role as coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament â concerns the promotion of equal opportunities in the EU, particularly for women and young people.
In the new aid period, the Community should further draw on the success it has achieved with EQUAL and continue to operate the networks.
This has also been incorporated into the guidelines.
On the whole, we, Parliament, can count the negotiation results as a great success, not only for Parliament, but also for the public.
No success or compromise can survive without a âbutâ. There is of course a âbutâ with these guidelines, too.
Parliament has attached great importance to enhancing cooperation with the social partners and civil society, and this has made its way into the guidelines, in the report finally adopted by the Council, but unfortunately only in significantly watered-down form.
We, Parliament, shall be at pains to speak up again on the occasion of the mid-term review of the structural support period and revise these guidelines together.
This will relate to the cooperation, and we shall also examine very carefully whether earmarking was really a good idea on the part of the Council, or whether it only serves to increase bureaucracy for those involved.
If this is the case, we shall certainly press for its abolition, as Parliament has a responsibility and duty towards the public, a duty it intends to fulfil.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank MrsÂ Krehl not only for her report but also for the hard work she has put into drawing up the European Parliamentâs position.
Parliament's report deals with the Community's strategic guidelines and is an excellent example of interinstitutional cooperation.
The European Parliament, through the work of its Committee on Regional Development, has tried to define its expectations during the course of the legislative process and today we can say that nearly all of these expectations have been taken into account.
It is true that there is a discrepancy between the strategic guidelines as they are presented today and the previously published list detailing Lisbon Strategy spending, which was later included as an annex to the regulation.
Nonetheless, the Members of this House believe that we should support the final version of the strategic guidelines, as they meet our expectations.
It could be said that, for the Member States, the strategic guidelines form an internally coherent basis for planning the implementation of cohesion policy.
Having first adopted these guidelines by means of a Council directive, let us hope that the individual Member States will be prepared to implement them.
An indicator of the resolve of the national governments will be, for example, the use they make of the guideline on strengthening the role of towns during the planning stage and when implementing integrated regeneration programmes.
The strategic guidelines are indispensable for the creation of a framework for implementing cohesion policy between 2007 and 2013. That is why I think the House should support this proposal which takes account of the European Parliament's suggestions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but express my satisfaction and warm congratulations to the rapporteur on the fact that important issues which had been emphasised by the European Parliament were accepted both by the Council and by the Commission.
I could refer, in connection with the initial text, to the improved guidelines on the principle of sustainable development in Structural Fund and Cohesion Fund interventions, of equal treatment for men and women and of non-discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion or disability, with emphasis on the accessibility of people with disabilities to all stages of the preparation and implementation of programmes and works, of the emphasis on the urban dimension and of the linking of urban and rural areas and partnership in general.
One essential success factor for the programmes as far as we are concerned is the extent to which all the interested agencies â at regional and local level â will be included in their planning and implementation, especially the social partners and the local authorities.
Achieving the objective of economic and social cohesion during the new programming period does indeed constitute a difficult challenge, at a time when inequalities in enlarged Europe are increasing and funds for applying cohesion policy are restricted.
The strategic guidelines are an important means in the direction of more efficient and targeted distribution of funds.
At the same time, they strengthen the strategic content of the cohesion policy and create the framework for synergy between it and the Lisbon Strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the start of a new era for the cohesion policy.
In the new programming period and in light of the interim review, the cohesion policy will be called upon to prove â if I may say so â its raison d'Ãªtre and the need for it to continue.
All of the foregoing, together with other quality factors introduced by Parliament in either the regulations or the guidelines, will be what helps to achieve its objectives.
The Member States and the regions must take them into account when preparing their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes.
