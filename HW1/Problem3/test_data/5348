The key issue at stake here is legislative clarification.
I feel that, with both the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the regulations make it clear that Member States must carry out an independent audit, both and .
These regulations have remained unchanged since the beginning of the current financial programming framework.
In this context, the main priority, in my view, is to ensure that the Member States comply with the regulations and that the Commission monitors that compliance.
Anything else will only lead to a lack of clarity as regards responsibilities.
I should therefore like to call on both institutions to clarify the level of compliance with Community regulations as regards these and audits, so that we can be properly informed when we take action.
I should lastly like to say a few words about information on who has received Community funds.
I made this request in a report that I drew up a number of years ago and am pleased that Mr Kallas has followed this initiative.
I hope that, when you criticise politicians for a lack of transparency, you will recall that Parliament requested such transparency a number of years ago in a report that I drew up.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have paid close attention to your comments and will, of course, pass on to the Council the opinions you have expressed.
However, I would like to repeat one thing: I am here to represent the Council and the Member States; in other words, the opinions expressed by the Presidency of the Council here are those expressed in a unanimous vote in the Council.
I am sorry if I have disappointed some of you, but there is nothing more I can say at this stage.
I can, however, reiterateÂ â and I hope you will be so kind as to accept this â that we have agreed to examine, in connection with the 2004 discharge process, the action plan drafted by the Commission.
I can also confirm that the Council will continue to support the Commission in its efforts to make an active contribution to financial management at all levels.
It is a matter of certainty that the Council will take on its share of responsibility, which it has no intention of abdicating.
We will continue to work with the Commission to find solutions that everybody, including all of you in this House, can accept.
I am afraid that, at this relatively early stage of the Austrian Presidency, I cannot say any more.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you very much for this debate.
This question seems very technical.
It is very difficult to explain to the larger public what is actually behind this declaration of assurance.
However, we must work to find solutions which do not bring the very negative political outcome of having to say that the money is not under control.
I hope, therefore, that the Council and Member States will consider this new basis for merging their work.
This is already done at the level of paying agencies and other implementing authorities.
Let us try to provide a single integrated assurance, which also offers positive evidence to the Court of Auditors.
Let us try to find solutions.
As I mentioned earlier, the Commission is fully aware of the areas in the Commission itself in which the Court of Auditors has found a lot of mistakes in internal policies and in research and development.
The action plan includes 16 actions, only one of which is directly aimed at the Member States.
However, I hope that this cooperation will bear fruit.
I would like to make a factual remark concerning the statement that the Court of Auditors has rejected our accounts.
This is not true.
During my term of office, the Court of Auditors has never rejected our accounts.
It cannot always assure the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, as provided in the Treaty.
This means that it cannot claim that millions of transactions are properly checked.
This is true.
It is also very important when we meet journalists to describe the complexity of the picture.
This is a huge exercise.
The budget discharge includes millions of details.
A better understanding of the picture will certainly help.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make a point of order under RuleÂ 145.
I am afraid that there seems to be a misunderstanding of exactly what we are here for.
I thought we were talking about the management directions and the reason we were asking for these directions to come in was because money was going missing.
As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, my role has always been to look into where the money has been lost or misused and where mistakes have been made â the phrase that Mr Kallas has just used.
I was working entirely on the assumption that the reason we were calling for these declarations was that the Member States would look into where the waste and fraud had come and, maybe, even corruption.
It was under those terms that I was asking to express my opinions in my speech.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order under RuleÂ 108, this was an oral question with six questions; I added a seventh question verbally this evening, and we have not had an answer to a single one of them.
Could the Presidency at least give us those answers in writing, please?
Â Â  Yes, Mr Wynn, you will have the answers in writing.
Mr Titford I have full respect for any political opinion in this Chamber.
That is why I did not interrupt you and let you finish your speech.
My remark was just to remind you that the language we use in the Chamber should express our opinions and our political positions.
It was just a friendly remark from me as I chair this sitting that we should try to use language and words that are not unduly offensive or disrespectful.
Apart from that, you have full freedom of expression here, Mr Titford.
To end the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources, by Philippe Morillon, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries (O-0095/2005 â B6-0346/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, the oral question to which we owe this eveningâs debate, together with the proposals that will be submitted to our Parliament for tomorrowâs vote, are based on the observation that the only management measures to have applied to Mediterranean fisheries up to now date back to 1994.
However, these measures are no longer suited to the resource situation or to the decisions taken on other EU shores. These decisions are aimed at implementing a common fisheries policy allowing the sustainable development of this sector of our economy and the preservation of the resources that the Union must, in order to provide enough food for its fellow citizens in the long-term, carry on being able to utilise by exploiting its own seas.
Such a time-lag is due, first of all, to the fact that the Mediterranean is recognised as being one of the most diversified and most complex regions, as much from a biological point of view as from ecological, social and economic ones.
That is why our Parliament had been unable to reach an agreement during the previous legislature and why MrÂ Lisiâs report had resulted in an admission of failure.
That is also why this subject was put back on the working agenda of this new legislature as a priority and why it gave rise to a very delicate compromise at the conclusion of the work of our rapporteur, MrsÂ Carmen Fraga, to whose personal commitment I have a duty to pay tribute in this Chamber.
This report was adopted â firstly in committee, and then in plenary â back in June.
Its recommended measures have not, to date, been the subject of any implementing decision by the Council.
We are aware of some of the reasons for this wait-and-see policy, but I personally had informed my colleagues about the measures in an attempt to push through a number of amendments aimed at preventing the ban on the use of certain types of nets traditionally used by fishermen in the region.
This matter affected, and continues to affect, 75 boats that ensure the livelihood of 350 families and that generate 80% of the fishermenâs turnover when they use anchored nets, known as The disadvantage of this type of fishing was that dolphins were being accidentally caught.
That was until the profession finalised a programme permitting an 80% reduction in these accidental catches through the implementation of sound repellents and the systematic presence of observers on board the boats.
If I am bringing this subject up again, it is because the socio-economic repercussions of the recommended measures certainly deserve more in-depth consideration.
That is why I support, and why my group will support, the proposal for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Article 4 of which demands that the fishermen affected by the new regulation and forced to change their fishing methods be properly compensated.
During yesterdayâs meeting of our committee, the European Commissioner responsible for Fisheries, DrÂ Joe Borg, was able to gauge just how incensed our Spanish friends had become at the prospect of a ban on the gillnets used for fishing in certain zones close to the Spanish coast. This ban would create an uncertain future for the fleet of 80 boats, which ensure the livelihood of 1Â 500 people.
We have here a case altogether similar to that of the small-scale fisheries on the French coasts of the Mediterranean.
That being said, MrÂ President, and while I can understand that certain decisions proposed by the Fraga report deserve to be discussed further and perhaps supplemented by an impact study, that would not justify indefinitely suspending the application of the entire content of a report that, as everyone agrees, is in itself a good compromise.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Morillon, you want to know whether the European Community is honouring the obligations it has taken on in international bodies, given that the Council has not yet adopted the proposal for a Council Regulation on management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea.
In FebruaryÂ 2005, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, to which the Community belongs as a contracting party, adopted binding recommendations to improve conservation and management measures for the Mediterranean.
These recommendations were incorporated in the Presidency's compromise proposal which was put to the 'Agriculture and Fisheries' Council at its meeting on 19 and 20Â September last year.
However, the Presidency realised at that time that, as it was clear during the discussions that there was insufficient support, it was impossible for the Council to reach political agreement on the proposal for a regulation containing technical management measures for the Mediterranean, including the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean's recommendations.
The Council is continuing its discussions on the proposal regarding management measures for the Mediterranean in close consultation with the Commission, and the Presidency intends to put the subject on the agenda for the Council meeting in April.
Â Â  Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I am perfectly aware of the difficulties relating to this proposal.
Parliament has played an effective and fundamental role in unblocking it following its presentation just over two and a half years ago, even finding a procedure which has made it possible to reach a compromise between the Commission and Parliament to overcome the difficulties of the proposal and which, furthermore, has had the support of the majority of the sector and of the national administrations.
When there is so much consensus, it is incomprehensible that the Council, since April of last year, has been delaying the approval of what is probably currently the package of technical measures that most urgently needs to be adopted.
This irresponsibility has many consequences: the Mediterranean is the only Community area which is still far from meeting the minimum requirements of responsible fishing and sustainable development, while in other Community waters much more drastic action is being taken in that regard.
It is shameful that the huge majority of the Mediterranean fishermen themselves have understood better than the Council the urgent need to regulate these fishing grounds, despite the price that they will have to pay.
The Councilâs credibility is therefore being called very much into question.
We also run the risk of failing to comply with our international obligations within the two regional fisheries organisations operating in the Mediterranean.
Mr President, how can we have the nerve to propose more restrictive management measures to third countries again, when we ourselves are not capable of implementing them in our own territory?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as well as telling us about the timetable in response to the question you have not yet answered, I would therefore ask you to explain to this Parliament why, when there is no blocking minority, the Council is incapable of taking a decision in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the majority of the Mediterranean's fisheries resources have been considered to be over-exploited for a long time, and there are certain stocks that have a high commercial value; in particular, I am thinking of the bluefin tuna, which is below the minimum level, according to all of the experts, including ecological organisations and the fishermen themselves.
Although the objectives of the common fisheries policy are the same in the Mediterranean as in other Community waters, it appears that the conservation policy in the Mediterranean Sea has developed in a very different way, and today we are faced with a situation in which the only management measures applicable to this sea can only be described as completely obsolete.
This lack of regulation suffered by the Mediterranean Sea has led to very clear discrimination between the European fishermen fishing in the Mediterranean and European fishermen fishing in other Community waters.
I believe, Mr President, and I do not believe I am far wrong, that it is our duty to ensure that the fisheries legislation in the Mediterranean evolves to the point where it is equal to that in other Community regions.
And in this regard, we are clearly very concerned about the Councilâs passive attitude, because this lack of interest in this sea strikes me as completely inexplicable.
We are talking about a sea and a region of immense importance, with very great complexities, it is true â including geopolitical complexities â but I believe that the Council should see this more as an incentive than an obstacle.
And it is all the more inexplicable in view of what Mrs Fraga has just said: that this report was approved thanks to that close cooperation â as approved by this Parliament â that was established between the Committee on Fisheries and the Fisheries Directorate-General.
For all of these reasons, I would ask you to provide the final impetus and to see what has been achieved as very important; and not to take any backward steps or allow any shortcuts that dilute the content of this report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I, for my part â and you will see that there really is consensus on this matter â should like to stress the urgent need to break the deadlock in this situation, as the state of the resource in the Mediterranean is truly alarming.
This is particularly the case with regard to bluefin tuna, but also with regard to other species, as my fellow Member pointed out.
The wait-and-see policy, the standstills and the prevarications are therefore truly disastrous for the future of the Mediterranean.
Moreover, we want to preserve small-scale fishing, which is so very important in the regions concerned, where it provides a livelihood for thousands of people, as has been said.
Yet, it is not by exempting small-scale fishing from a number of sensible measures that we will succeed in doing this, but much rather by helping it first and foremost to adapt and by supporting it so that it can continue its activities in compliance with the regulations, which need to be those mentioned in the report.
I therefore believe that we must preserve the Mediterranean: this is a crucial issue in terms of the future of fishing and it is also a major issue in terms of culture.
The Council has to be fully aware of this and to be intent on breaking the deadlock in this situation as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Mediterranean represents a very important part of the European Union.
Mediterranean fisheries represent an important sector of Community fisheries.
We want a Mediterranean that is alive, not a dead sea.
For many of us, this sea is our life.
We want fish stocks to be maintained.
We do not want overfishing.
We want sustainability in this sea.
The European Parliament and the Commission have approved a plan of management measures for fisheries in the Mediterranean.
We are urgently calling for the application and implementation of the measures decided.
I would not want to get carried away but it would not be an exaggeration to say that any delay in this matter would be criminal.
We are calling for the measures to be extended in future; in other words, for us to put pressure on the third countries of the Mediterranean as well to apply the measures which we are applying.
This is our duty, in order for us to protect the Mediterranean, which is our life.
However, above and before everything, today, not tomorrow, we are asking the Council to start applying the measures agreed.
Â Â  â Mr President, one year after the approval of the report on the Council proposal for viable fisheries in the Mediterranean, it is obvious that there has never been a Council decision to apply it.
We were also told to our great surprise in the Committee on Fisheries that the budget for the Fisheries Fund has already been reduced by 20%.
It is therefore a natural consequence that fisheries issues remain and citizens working in this sector on a professional or amateur basis are anxious, while the situation is becoming more complicated and, to my mind, worse.
At the same time, the Mediterranean basin is constantly being inhabited by new populaces, resulting in constant aggravation due to industrial, urban and other waste, with a direct and serious adverse impact on fisheries.
The relevant proposals for regulations and draft reports obviously also need to include studies by the scientific community on the effect of environment pollution, geological changes, population differences and fish consumption requirements before they are applied.
It is out of the question for the policy decided not to be applied and, at the same time, for issues to remain outstanding in the fisheries sector, relating mainly to fishing methods, reductions in stocks and the continuing gap between professional and amateur fishermen.
We therefore need to proceed with the political means at our disposal for the promotion of the report by the Council and to start the dialogue with the agencies involved for the improvement of the existing regulation right now.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the resolution on the adoption of management measures for Mediterranean fishery resources, which we shall put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow, is of great economic, social and environmental importance.
As has been mentioned, the current regulation dates back to 1994 and was already considered obsolete even then.
How dare we carry on blaming fishermen for apparently jeopardising the environmental sustainability of the fishing industry if the rules, MrÂ President, are anachronistic and inadequate in the current context, and if no progress has been made on what the European Parliament voted for a year ago?
The fishing industry does not want discrimination.
Instead, it wants to feel that the European Union is on its side and is aware of its unique features.
Let us think of the great difference in the form and depth of the seabed off the Adriatic and the Atlantic coasts, the issue of multispecies fishing, and the long-standing problem of fish sizes, when rules on mesh and net sizes are already being obeyed.
Lastly, but just as importantly, let us remember that different rules are in force for countries that have Mediterranean coastlines but do not belong to the European Union and that, in the absence of balanced bilateral agreements, they result in double standards in the same fishing grounds.
We should have put an end to these obvious discrepancies a long time ago.
We therefore hope that this resolution will lead the Council â whom we respect and trust â to send out the long-awaited signal as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
I am sure that all those who work closely with the fishing sector, and particularly those involved with the Mediterranean Sea, are very much aware of how complex this region is.
It is a region of highly visible biological and environmental diversity, which has a huge socio-economic impact on the inhabitants of the region.
Sadly, the Council of Ministers has made no proper commitment to identifying that diversity and taking whatever action is necessary.
This is a disturbing state of affairs for those of us presenting this resolution because we know that this lack of initiative by the Council has placed us in a position far removed from our goal of sustainable development.
This is a dead end from which we can only extricate ourselves by adopting more responsible rules in greater accordance with the common fisheries policy, so making our aims that much more attainable.
It must be remembered that the only existing rules for managing fisheries have been in force for more than ten years, and even those measures are not so good.
It is very important for us to bear in mind that we are in danger of failing to fulfil our international obligations where fisheries management is concerned, especially with regard to regional fisheries organisations and, in particular, the International Commission for the Conservation of Tuna in the Atlantic and the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean.
I thus urge the Council to take all the necessary measures without delay so that an ideal balance is achieved in the Mediterranean and so that fishermenâs livelihoods are guaranteed.
We can then turn our attention to other projects in the Mediterranean - a region that, I repeat, has unfortunately been neglected for a very long time.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I really just wanted to end by saying that the Council is well aware of how important this issue is.
It is also not true that the Council is inactive or even uninterested in the situation of fish stocks and fisheries in the Mediterranean.
For reasons on which the Presidency will not comment, it has not yet reached agreement.
The Austrian Presidency has now taken over this matter and will work actively towards a solution.
As I said, the intention is to deal with this issue in the Council in April this year.
Â Â  To end this debate, I have received three motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, during the debate on the sustainable exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources, I said that the compromise reached by Parliament and the Commission may not have filled us with too much enthusiasm, but that it was undoubtedly an improvement over the initial proposal.
This is not the right moment to bring up the pros and cons of the compromise; let us just say that I regard it â at least, that is my hope â as a step on the way to the rational management of Mediterranean fishery resources, combined with essential support to improve the precarious level of employment in the fishing industry, which involves thousands of families spread around the shores of .
The die is cast.
We cannot turn back.
I therefore hope that the Council, in making its decisions, does not seek inspiration in the young Saint Augustineâs prayers to the Almighty, as recalled in his âConfessionsâ: âLord, give me chastity, but not yet!â
We can certainly wait a few more months for the regulation to be adopted, but please do not take too long: our fishermen are full of expectation.
Â Â  We resume our sitting with one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a report this week that three of the worldâs largest oil companies no longer directly own petrol filling stations in Northern Ireland.
They left, it seems, as a result of ongoing problems of cross border fuel smuggling and laundering.
Last year, this Parliament roundly condemned Sinn FÃ©in â the IRA â for its continuing criminal activities.
Clearly the tens of millions of pounds sterling it is estimated are being taken annually from its illegal trade in laundered fuel is enough to ensure that the political representatives remain indifferent to such criticism.
The eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission published today states that IRA members are still heavily involved in fuel smuggling, and that the level of smuggling has remained more or less constant.
So much for Sinn FÃ©inâs pretence to be a normal political party.
It is appalling to think that in 2006, in a European Union which prides itself on its commitment both to freedom of trade and freedom of movement, a Member State can be plagued by an organisation so vicious that even the worldâs biggest oil companies cannot survive its menace.
I trust this Parliament will continue to condemn those who fail to share our commitment to fundamental freedoms.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Social Democrat from new EU Member State Estonia, I continue to be concerned about the spread and entrenchment of double standards within the European Union.
Last Monday a directive concerning âcitizens of third countriesâ entered into force.
This created an absurd situation in which the citizens of the new Member States are not even second-class citizens in the labour market.
Circumstances have conspired to make possible a situation in which the European Unionâs labour market is open to the citizens of certain third countries, but is not open to the citizens of other third countries that meet the same requirements.
But who are we defending from whom in this European Union of 25 members?
I have already demanded an explanation from the Minister of Economics and Labour Martin Bartenstein as to when we may expect to see results from Austriaâs work as holder of the presidency of the European Union, as regards the opening of the labour market.
Last Wednesday the minister was unable to give me a straight answer to my question.
I would like to emphasise that issues concerning the opening of the labour market will remain among my priorities.
The free movement of people is one of the four main freedoms of the European Union.
The prevention of that freedom can only be approved in exceptional cases.
Â Â  â The so-called spy scandal in Moscow has demonstrated the Kremlin's true intentions to suppress civil society organisations in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet bloc.
Taking advantage of the dependence of the European states on Russian energy and using the supply of energy to exert pressure, Russia is increasingly allocating funds to blatant propaganda campaigns.
In the countries of Eastern Europe, these campaigns are above all directed against non-government organisations, in particular the foundations sponsored by G. Soros.
The aim is to undermine society's trust in institutions which propagate western values and to keep the society in Russia's sphere of cultural and political influence.
The EU ought to be more active in promoting democratic processes in the post-Soviet area and in the EU's eastern neighbours.
It should express its opinion on anti-western propaganda and should not apply double standards vis-Ã -vis Russia because of a dependence on Russian energy.
Â Â  â The organisations representing workers from the electrical and electronic equipment industry in Portugal have reported that in the past three years more than 8Â 000 people have been laid off by the multinationals operating in the sector, such as Lear, Vishay, Philips, Yazaky Saltano, Alcoa Fujikura and Delphi, leading to serious reductions in employment levels.
The situation will become worse if the threats of orders being placed elsewhere and of multinationals relocating are actually carried out, the latter having led to the loss of more than 6Â 000 jobs.
In so doing, multinationals have gone as far as to blackmail the workers, by, , devaluing wages, by making working hours more flexible, and by making working conditions more precarious.
Measures that have long been laid down must be implemented, in order to stop this race for maximum profit and maximum exploitation, with scant regard for the social impact, and sometimes, inexplicably, supported by Community financial resources.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to register a protest about the portrayal of the Polish Government and Prime Minister as comic opera figures by the media across the Union.
The most recent issue of the has also stooped to this level.
The forces of liberalism are refusing to accept the will of the nation.
The nation voted in free elections to entrust power to Catholics for whom God, truth and goodness are more important than the free market.
Even so, our new leaders are being hounded and criticised by liberals in the media.
Democracy is also being used as a smokescreen for the media terrorism that is currently being perpetrated with impunity in Poland.
The target is the priest who heads the radio station which has millions of listeners in the country.
The liberal press has printed at least 18Â thousand offensive articles during the last eight years.
The question arises as to why the Unionâs agencies, whose aim is to defend democracy, human rights and freedoms and to combat intolerance only react to certain types of human rights violations, turning a deaf ear and a blind eye when Catholics are involved.
Indeed, these agencies even ape the behaviour of those sections of the media that are opposed to traditional values.
I would like to remind the House that a democracy that is not based on truth will inevitably become a dictatorship based on relativism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Polish media have announced that the European Union has decided against awarding a grant from the Cohesion Fund for the construction of the RacibÃ³rz Dolny flood prevention reservoir on the river Oder.
The residents of the Oder river basin have been deeply disappointed by this news, and have lost a good deal of faith in the European institutions.
In JulyÂ 1997 there was disastrous flooding in the Oder river basin. Fifty-four people died and material damage amounted to almost EUR 5Â billion.
The Polish Government set about rebuilding the damaged areas immediately.
Although Poland faced enormous financial difficulties, the programme for the construction of flood prevention barriers is being completed consistently and effectively.
More than one thousand kilometres of flood prevention barriers have been rebuilt, and the flood plain has been increased by over 150Â million square metres.
Throughout the programme my country cooperated closely with its neighbours, namely Germany and the Czech Republic.
Poland is fulfilling its accession obligations regarding implementation of the provisions of the Water Framework Directive in the cross-border Oder river basin region.
I should therefore like to enquire about the reasons why Poland was not awarded financial aid for this project and about the possibility of Cohesion Fund money being made available quickly for this purpose.
Â Â  I would like to thank you all for offering your sympathy and condolences on the tragic event that shocked Slovakiaâs public two weeks ago.
As you all know, on 19 January a Slovak military plane crashed with 43 soldiers and military personnel on board.
Unfortunately, only one person survived the disaster.
The plane was flying from PriÅ¡tina, Kosovo, where Slovak soldiers together with other troops of the international community have been participating in the NATO peace mission.
For Slovakia, 23 January was a day of national mourning.
I would like to thank the EP President for his decision on that day to order that the state flag of the Slovak Republic in front of the Parliament building fly at half mast.
These expressions of sympathy mean a great deal to the Slovak public.
It was not only the loss of outstanding military professionals, but also of young people at the beginning of their careers and of individual lives, of sons and husbands as well as fathers of 36 bereaved orphans.
May they rest in peace.
Â Â  At the World Economy Forum in Davos, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin blamed the malaise of Europe on enlargement.
According to the French Prime Minister, decision-making has become more difficult as a result of the accession of the ten new Member States, and the acceptance of Eastern European countries has often been viewed in the Western half of the continent as an excessively heavy financial burden.
The statement of Prime Minister de Villepin is outrageous and unacceptable.
It seems that the Prime Minister of France, the founding state of the European Union, is not even aware of basic processes.
The crisis of the European Union which is indeed in a difficult situation, has not been caused by the new Member States, on the contrary.
Enlargement costs each citizen of the old Member States 20 euros a year; in light of this, the comment of Prime Minister de Villepin that the financial burden is excessive is incomprehensible.
Moreover, economic stagnation in France had started in the mid-1990s.
It is unfortunate that President Borrell, who was present at the time, did not defend the new Member States.
We should not be scapegoats for Franceâs current crisis.
Â Â  Mr President, there have been reports recently in the British press about a conference held in Salzburg hosted by the Austrian Presidency. The purpose apparently was to discuss how Europe might re-engage with its citizens.
This event happened to coincide more or less with the 250th anniversary of the birth of the immortal and glorious Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Mozart was presented at this conference as some kind of proto-European federalist, because of nothing more than the fact that in his short career he travelled extensively in Europe.
However, what were Mozartâs political views, if any?
On hearing the news of Britainâs relief of Gibraltar and the victory over the French navy at Trincomalee, he wrote to his father, Leopold: âIndeed, I have heard about Englandâs victories and I am greatly delighted too, for you know that I am out-and-out Englishmanâ.
Did the Austrian Presidency know that it was celebrating the birth of a self-proclaimed Englishman?
Â Â  Mr President, last Friday Northern Ireland suffered the double blow of the loss of two factories, both the result of an inability to compete with cheap imports.
âFarm-Fed Chickensâ, a long-standing poultry factory in Coleraine announced its closure with 350Â job losses, and âBarber Threadsâ in Lisburn was a casualty with 85Â job losses in the textile sector.
Cheap imports are now the scourge of EU manufacturing and processing industries.
With Commissioner Mandelsonâs approach at the WTO, it seems the Commission wants to rush further down this road of destruction.
In the name of those being driven from employment right across Europe, I call for a root and branch reassessment of our approach to cheap imports, so that the social economic consequences are properly considered.
We cannot go on haemorrhaging indigenous jobs in the pursuit of what really is an unacceptable dogma.
Â Â  Â Mr President, I am glad the Council eventually reached a compromise on the future Financial Perspective in December.
Nonetheless, I feel the so-called âNew Year giftsâ method applied by the British Presidency is irresponsible and does not favour European cohesion policy.
In addition, the drastic cuts in expenditure on structural funding are certainly not helping to build a Europe of solidarity.
There are also concerns about the lack of clear criteria for how the future reserve fund of unused Cohesion Fund resources is going to be used.
I believe the likely outcome to be that, instead of Europe being strengthened, it will become increasingly divided.
The first month of the Austrian Presidency is over, and by now the new Council ought to be ready to enter into specific discussions with Parliament.
In the meantime, the absence of a negotiating mandate has certainly made us realise that time is money.
The longer we have to wait for a compromise the more we are likely to lose out in terms of delays in the implementation of new programmes, especially those related to structural policy in an enlarged Europe.
Â Â  â In the last two days, the Lisbon Strategy and the review thereof have been under discussion.
This is an issue of the highest importance.
Members of national parliaments have participated in the debate, which has undoubtedly drawn attention to the situation on the ground in the Member States.
Both the Commission and the Council must now take account of the situation in each of the Member States, where unemployment is growing and high levels of poverty and social exclusion remain, in order that the objectives announced six years ago at the Lisbon summit can be met.
What is also needed is a complete break from the neoliberal policies of privatisations, liberalisations and the Bolkestein proposal for a directive, so that socio-economic conditions can be improved and greater economic and social cohesion in the EU can be effectively implemented.
Â Â  That concludes the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0404/2005) by MrsÂ MariaÂ Carlshamre, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future actions (2004/2220(INI).
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of menâs violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society.
It is everywhere and it affects the whole of society directly and indirectly.
I am grateful for what I perceive to be a growing understanding of the scope of this problem.
I want to thank my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities for the valuable help and support I received during this work.
I am also pleased that Commissioner Franco Frattini has shown a strong and honest commitment.
We now have a serious opportunity to recognise all women who have experienced violence but not justice.
The cornerstone of my report is that we need correct figures.
At EU level there are no reliable studies.
However, three national prevalence studies in Finland in 1999, Sweden in 2001 and Germany in 2004, indicate that previous assessments have vastly underestimated the extent of the problem.
Using the United Nationsâ definition of violence against women, these studies show that 40 to 50% of women in these three countries have, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man.
I should like to emphasise that: between 40 and 50% of all women between the age of 16 and 67.
The corresponding figure for the whole of the EU would be incredibly high, at between 80 and 100 million women.
Obviously effective measures must be based on correct facts and figures and the need for similar studies in other Member States is urgent.
The magnitude of the problem in itself indicates that all Member States are repeatedly violating the basic rules of civil liberties and the rule of law on a scale that we have yet to understand.
You may think this an exaggeration. It is not.
I would like to invoke a classic liberal.
More than 300 years ago, the British philosopher, John Locke, introduced a fundamental idea: a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights, the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety.
This is the moral, normative basis for the state and its reason for being.
Citizens agree to obey the laws, but this presupposes that the state fulfils its basic commitment to protect the lives, freedom and property of its citizens.
Any state which fails in this task has broken the contract.
When it comes to violence against women, the failure is measurable in all Member States of the Union.
All violence is a challenge to our civilisation and to the rule of law.
But menâs violence against women is a specific challenge to the contract of which all common policy is an expression.
There is a systematic difference in the way crimes of violence are treated, depending on the gender of the victim.
Violence against men typically happens in public, perpetrated by another man, often a stranger. Violence against women typically happens in private, perpetrated by a man known to the woman, very often a man with whom the woman has or has had a relationship.
The most crucial difference, politically, is that private violence against women is not prosecuted as seriously as public violence against men.
The issue of menâs violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, there is also a history.
Violence in the street from a stranger, primarily affecting men, has been a criminal offence in Europe for centuries, but it is quite recent that violence occurring in the home was made a criminal offence.
Well into the latter part of the 20th century, Europe had many laws which excused domestic violence by men against women.
This legacy lives on in our Union. We can see it in case law, attitudes and perceptions about the less serious nature of private violence.
The issue of menâs violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society.
Menâs violence against women has also been a way of keeping men, in general, in power.
When the UN General Assembly in 1993 adopted the declaration on the elimination of violence against women, it was the first time a UN document had placed menâs violence against women in a gender-power perspective.
It explicitly links violence to the superior position of men.
What we need to do now is to act.
First get the figures right and then proceed to the proper solutions.
The issue of menâs violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, it affects us all.
I demand zero tolerance of menâs violence against women.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I fully agree with the report and with what the rapporteur has just said.
Violence against women is certainly today the most widespread instance of the violation of human rights worldwide.
It is a form of violence that knows no geographical barriers or age limits among the victims, nor does it make any distinction on the basis of class or of cultural or family origins.
It is truly the most widespread crime in the world, against which the European Commission and the institutions of the European Union have an institutional and moral duty to take a firm stand.
I particularly welcome the report before us because it addresses the main areas that Europeâs institutions need to tackle.
The Commission has launched a number of initiatives to help the Member States adopt strong preventive and reactive policies designed to eradicate violence against women.
We are developing legal instruments to encourage close cooperation between Member States on policing activities; on the definitions of crimes, which often do not coincide; and, of course, on strengthening those measures designed to target and eradicate such crimes from civil society and to afford more effective protection for the victims of violence.
Most of the initiatives mentioned in the report come under the Daphne programme, with which we are all familiar: they include victim support and training measures, programmes to reintegrate victims of violence into society, study and research projects, the development of European policies, data gathering, and the definition of indicators, which are unfortunately still lacking.
The Daphne programme, which the Commission intends to continue and develop further, covers all forms of violence, including domestic violence, which is one of the most serious kinds.
Unfortunately, these crimes are not represented in legal statistics because, in the vast majority of cases, the victims do not report violent episodes that take place within the family home.
The measures in question also include a relentless fight against female genital mutilation, an horrendous practice that we must punish severely, and so-called âhonour crimesâ, which we should rename âdishonour crimesâ: it is best not to term it an âhonourâ crime when a man beats a woman for that kind of reason.
The report mentions the need to gather data and draw up statistics, since reliable statistics are one of the basic requirements for making more effective decisions at European level.
The Commission is working on that and, in collaboration with Eurostat, has set up a European system of statistics on crime and criminal justice: violence against women is, of course, one of the areas on which we shall very soon publish statistics calculated from the measures and the data that the Member States make available to us.
I believe that by June 2006 we shall for the first time be able to publish a series of European statistics on crimes and the judicial response to crimes, and they will obviously contain a chapter devoted to violence against women.
On the subject of female genital mutilation, the Commission has financed a large number of projects, all under the Daphne programme, which have produced positive results.
I can also add that, in the area of European immigration and asylum measures, the directive on minimum standards for granting refugee status defines acts of sexual violence against women as sufficient grounds for granting refugee status.
I can also assure the rapporteur that, although female genital mutilation is not explicitly included in the text of the directive in question, the Commission does regard it as an act of violence perpetrated for sexual purposes, and it is therefore included among the reasons that, in my view, justify the granting of refugee status.
I have given this example, MrÂ President, in order to stress the need to tackle the issue of violence against women at a European level and from every possible angle: from trafficking in human beings, to migration policies, to equal opportunities â hence the need for non-discrimination.
In more general terms, we need to use the courts, employment policy and social policies as practical enforcement instruments.
I feel institutionally, politically and also morally bound by these objectives, which will therefore be specific priorities for our work over the coming months.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and for this opportunity to discuss violence that women face in their daily lives.
Violence against women is not a marginal problem; women from all social groups can be victims of violence.
Sometimes high-achieving professional women think they are untouchable.
Every woman can be abused.
It cannot be said that this is not a problem for us or for EU women.
Even though the report focuses on violence by men against women, and especially domestic violence, we should not forget that this is not the only type of violence, despite, undeniably, being the most common.
Unfortunately, children are also often targets of domestic violence, as are men.
Even though they are not the focus of our discussion today, we should not forget that these things happen too.
None of this kind of domestic violence should be allowed to happen.
The rapporteur mentions the figure of 100Â million women in the EU who have suffered from violence from men.
The Commission estimates that almost 1000 women die in Europe every year due to violence in their partnerships.
In Finland alone, the police make 80Â 000 house calls, and 17 000 of them are due to domestic violence â and we are a country which ranks fifth in the worldâs gender equality rankings.
These are horrific figures.
We need to act.
So what can we do?
First we should ensure that Member States take action in combating domestic violence.
More efficient legislation and its true implementation are crucial, as well as coordination between all those involved in this field.
We should also take into account the studies conducted in the United States which showed a clear correlation between animal abuse and domestic violence.
It has been shown that many domestic violence cases have been preceded by animal abuse.
This is something from which we in Europe could perhaps learn.
In addition to more traditional type of violence against women, we have recently witnessed a rise in honour crimes and genital mutilation.
I was very happy to hear that the Commission is putting more emphasis on this human right.
Every woman has a right to decide about her own body.
That is very important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we have been able to debate this incredibly important issue in the EU this evening.
As well as being a criminal act and a violation of human rights, menâs violence against women is a serious socio-political problem throughout the world.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believe that menâs violence against women is linked to the unequal power relations between men and women, and the problem will increase if the Member States do not use legislation in order strongly and clearly to oppose such violence.
Menâs violence against women naturally has considerable social and human consequences.
I always maintain that, behind every woman who is beaten, there are, more often than not, a number of children who, in addition to undergoing considerable physical and psychological suffering, believe that this is the way things have to be, a view that, in the long term, may lead to their adopting the same behaviour themselves when they grow up.
We have to break this vicious circle.
We often also forget the children in these contexts.
It is important that children who see their mothers beaten should also be regarded as victims and be entitled to have their cases heard in court.
It has also been demonstrated that violence against women is an important factor in the lives of women and girls who fall victim to human trafficking and prostitution.
I would also take this opportunity to point out that we should combat the attitude that prostitution is comparable with the exercise of a profession.
This form of violence and serious violation of human beings is absolutely unacceptable.
Prostitution and human trafficking and all forms of violence towards women, including genital mutilation and violence related to notions of honour, fall into the same category.
The EU must set a good example and take a stand on combating these expressions of discrimination between the sexes and of the unequal distribution of power between them.
It is also important to do some preventative work in the form of research, information provision and the exchange of knowledge between the Member States.
More often than not, the focus is, quite naturally, on the victims, but there is also a need for active preventative strategies aimed at the perpetrators of violence and at those in danger of becoming perpetrators.
Finally, I just want briefly to mention one of my own amendments dealing with the relationship between alcohol and violence.
Alcohol is often a factor in acts of violence, and it is important that pleas relating to intoxication as an extenuating circumstance not be accepted by the courts where menâs violence towards women is concerned.
When strategies for reducing alcohol-related harm in society are reviewed, account must definitely be taken, however, of the effect that alcohol has in triggering menâs violence against women.
Â Â  Mr President, it saddens me very much that we have to hold this debate on violence against women, since it means that we are talking about an active, live issue.
The report by Mrs Carlshamre, whom I congratulate on her work, reminds us, amongst other things, that violence against women is a scourge that knows no national, religious, social or economic boundaries; on the contrary, as has been said, it is a universal phenomenon, relating to the inequalities in our societies in terms of the distribution of power and of roles between the sexes.
It is for this very reason that the response must be firm, here in Europe and in other countries where, as in Mexico or Guatemala, the situation has become so bad that there is even talk of âfeminicidesâ.
The time for rhetoric and condemnation, however, is far behind us.
Now is the time to act, to adopt measures in support of the victims, to apply proactive and preventive strategies and to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
But in order for those measures to be effective, we must provide them with the necessary human and financial resources.
A few days ago we celebrated the first anniversary of the law on gender violence in Spain.
That date gives us the opportunity to insist, as the Carlshamre report does, that violence against women must be seen as a clear breach of the most fundamental human rights and that, as well as reactive measures, we must establish programmes of a holistic nature to deal seriously with the issue of the distribution of roles in our society and, in particular, the perception that persists amongst many men that women are merely objects at their disposal and that they therefore have the right to hit them or mistreat them, and even sometimes to kill them.
In short, I fear that the real problem exists within the heads of many men, and that is where action must be taken.
Â Â  . â Violence against women, including the trafficking in human beings, prostitution, violence in the home and the workplace, is an extremely serious issue.
Of these manifestations, domestic violence is the most common, affecting millions of women in Europe.
The rapporteur, whom I wish to congratulate on her work, has presented us with some figures, although it is known no studies have been carried out at Community level.
Commissioner, measures must be taken without delay to ensure that this phenomenon is made more visible. After all, it is appalling that victims of violence die every year in the EU, including more than 100Â 000 women and many children, another area that must be taken into account.
I therefore hope that, after this debate, things do not simply continue as they have been. Hopefully, the instruments will actually be strengthened, as promised, measures will be implemented and the political will for effective change in this area will emerge.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not wish to play down the importance of this significant issue.
Nonetheless, as a member of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to point out that violence is not just a feature of male behaviour.
It is an indication of a personality that has failed to develop properly, and it can occur in both males and females.
Psychological violence perpetrated by women is less immediately obvious but can be equally damaging, as research into cases of violence in male and female same-sex relationships confirms.
It should be emphasised that social factors play a very significant part in the spread of violence.
I refer to aggression in the media and to the hedonistic and liberal lifestyle which is currently being promoted and which is subject to no restrictions, rules or prohibitions.
It is a lifestyle characterised by a relentless tide of pansexualism and pornography and the belief that human beings are objects that can be bought and sold.
Lastly, the recently advocated war between the sexes, which harks back to the Communist class conflict, has fuelled aggression rather than reduced it.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Carlshamre, for her report underlining very important aspects of the fight against violence perpetrated on women.
I agree with her, and I think that it is very important for all of us to adopt zero tolerance towards all forms of violence.
A chain is said to be only as strong as its weakest link and our society must be weak if it cannot protect its weakest link, which is to say its children.
Feminist movements have been exposing violence against women and have always fought for womenâs rights.
As we observe the age of victims getting lower and lower, society must have the courage to protect young girls from violence and abuse.
However, guilty persons are only occasionally exposed, and usually when it is already too late.
Sadly, tragic stories make good articles and increase the incomes of tabloid newspapers.
Unfortunately for the victim, this is a tragic fact.
Young girls usually do not get a chance to live out their childhoods â as a result of violence they become women and often mothers prematurely.
It is for this reason that I too raise my voice today, in order to draw attention to this issue, and to help efforts aimed at stopping the violence that we all know exists in society, although we tend to rely on others to fight against it on our behalf.
I think that it is very important to adopt laws, recommendations and regulations, but we must also support consistent implementation and compliance in our everyday lives.
Not far from the European Parliament there is a young woman in the street with one or two babies holding out a cup and begging for money.
As she is a woman from a different ethnic group, we pretend this is of no concern to us, throw her a couple of cents and walk on.
Â Â  Allow me first and foremost to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Maria Carlshamre, and to all colleagues who helped develop this report.
Violence is an abuse of superiority by one party, but it has to be said that the failure to prevent violence is also a form of violence.
Our basic attitude must be characterised by zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women.
Any solution will depend especially on teaching respect for other people and on intensive cooperation between governments, parliaments and non-governmental organisations.
These bodies should jointly develop procedures for fighting this phenomenon.
Statistics are necessary, but our success primarily depends on effective preventive measures, all the more so since every instance of violence in families affects children as well, and is passed on to future generations.
Communities and ethnic minorities with different cultures, and their own specific forms of violence, must also be the focus of our attention.
Every state of the European Union must enact comprehensive and effective legislation in respect of domestic violence, which will criminalise certain forms of violence.
Neither customary practices nor alcohol should be considered as mitigating factors.
We must clearly demonstrate that violence is simply unacceptable in society.
Mr President, I firmly believe that domestic violence casts shame on the democratic and highly-developed society we live in, as it constitutes violence committed against human dignity.
The prevention of violence against women must be a mission for all of us.
Â Â  Mr President, this report that we are debating today gives us the opportunity to make a strong appeal to the European institutions and the Member States to combat something that is a reality: violence against women for the sole reason that they are women.
We cannot remain on the sidelines in a situation like this; it is our obligation to implement every instrument necessary to put an end to this social scourge.
Violence against women is a breach of human rights, of fundamental rights, such as freedom, equality, life and non-discrimination.
We must call upon the Member States to stiffen penalties and to implement complete legislation to respond to this reality.
In this regard, Spain offers a clear example to the whole of Europe, with the law that it adopted last year to combat violence against women.
Although such violence will clearly not come to an end overnight, this law represents a clear commitment to fight it decisively by means of all the necessary instruments.
We cannot deny that there is greater awareness of this problem today, thanks to the efforts of womenâs organisations in their fight against all forms of violence against women.
We can now say that it is no longer an invisible crime, but rather it is one that is collectively rejected.
Such important aspects as the protection of victims must be accompanied by other measures, such as specific programmes on access to work or to social housing, so that this reality can be dealt with in a complete way, taking account of aspects relating to education, legal assistance and health and without forgetting that these violent situations often also affect minors within their families.
There can be no excuse not to tackle violence against women in a decisive and committed manner, because a society cannot progress while the rights of such a significant section of it â women â are being breached.
We are talking about a serious social problem, and every possible effort will be required on our part if we are to put an end to it.
The step we are taking today is a further step towards the ultimate objective.
We must do everything possible, and more, to reach that objective.
Â Â  Violence against women has existed throughout human history.
In order to create effective strategies for eliminating this serious social problem, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of this phenomenon and the features of it that are specific to different nations.
Post-communist countries, including Slovakia, have long ignored this topic.
Strong traditions have always kept domestic violence hidden behind closed doors.
Another contributing factor has been the fact that some types of violence concerned very delicate matters.
For that reason, the victim would often not report an assault, especially out of fear of the perpetrator, fear for the children or loyalty to the family.
These countries, in particular, typically had low levels of reporting sexual assaults.
It is estimated that the real number of cases is five to ten times higher than the number of cases reported.
Very often, women find it difficult to talk about violence, either because of the shock they have been through or out of shame, and do not believe that anyone can help them.
Others do not even recognise the experience as violence.
For these reasons, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Carlshamre, who emphasised in her report that priority should be given to increasing the level of awareness about this problem in society as a whole.
The report challenges the governments and parliaments of the member countries to take steps aimed at eliminating the silence surrounding violence against women.
Violence cannot be a private matter.
It must become a public issue, an issue for all of us.
The accurate gathering of data is the only way to get to the essence of this serious problem and help to focus the efforts aimed at eliminating it.
It is not only non-government organisations, media, research and educational institutions that can contribute to this, but also all of us who refuse to tolerate such a serious social problem, one that has become an obstacle to the development of a democratic society.
In conclusion, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur for her work.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I am not a man either, but a woman in this discussion, and I would like to thank rapporteur Maria Carlshamret for her well-timed report.
The report claims justifiably that violence against women is connected with male supremacy in society.
The report devotes great attention to the worrying spread of honour killings and genital mutilation in the European Union.
These are traditions that immigrants bring from countries where the balance of power between the sexes is even more skewed than it is in Europe.
The Member States of the European Union cannot overlook such a violation of human rights just because that violence is perpetrated within the family.
We need strong measures and proportional, balanced penalties which act as a deterrent, as indicated in the report.
Direct punishment should be supported by measures aiming to improve the balance of power between the sexes.
I would like to emphasise yet another type of violence that represents and symbolises the unequal division of power better than anything else.
I am talking about the selling of womenâs bodies.
The purchasing of sex constitutes violence and the perpetuation of violence.
The seedbed of prostitution is most closely related to unemployment among women and the low wages paid to women.
Continuing violence and the social problems connected with it make it very difficult to integrate women into the labour market.
I concur with my colleague Figueiredo, who said: âProstitution does not mean equal participation in the labour marketâ.
In my home country, I am trying to make the purchasing of sex a criminal offence.
I do not want violence against women and inequality between the sexes to continue.
I do not want the deterioration of the living environment that accompanies the bordello industry to continue to threaten our cities.
The European Parliament should seriously discuss making the purchasing of sex punishable throughout the European Union.
That would be a step towards equality between the sexes and a great contribution towards the abolition of violence against women.
Thank you for your attention!
Â Â  Things are not going so badly: we have been discussing this issue for almost a decade, and that things are improving is demonstrated by the fact that we are here today, that we are still talking and that women now report the violence they suffer.
This form of violence has been going on for a long time, and women have suffered in silence, and not just their own personal silence, but also the complicit silence of their families, neighbours and the whole of society.
As has been said here today, this scourge affects all sectors of society: the rich, the poor, the educated, the less educatedÂ ... Every single one of us knows of someone who has suffered from this violence.
But not only should studies be carried out on the nature of domestic violence itself, but it is also worth investigating whether, when there is violence in the home, the person indulging in it also indulges in violence in the workplace, whether they also indulge in what is known as âmobbingâ and try to destroy the people around them physically and psychologically, because, when it comes down to it, people who do that are ill and they know of no way to express themselves other than through this kind of violence.
We must also therefore consider what measures the European Union must put into practice.
It is all very well to legislate, but it is also important to provide temporary aid, to provide education and to implement programmes such as Daphne, because all of these help gradually to put an end to this scourge and this persistent blot on our society.
It is also the case, of course, that we must produce statistics and watch how they evolve, because if we are to provide real resources, if we are truly committed and provide the money needed to implement these essential programmes, we need to be able to see how they evolve so that we can put things right in time and be as effective as possible.
We are dealing with public money and that money must be properly justified and, above all, it must be used for its intended purpose, which is no more and no less than to put an end to violence against any woman, not just here in the European Union, but also in third countries, which we help, but without demanding that the laws we apply here be complied with there as well.
Â Â  MrÂ President, violence against women is often played down or simply not mentioned.
Nonetheless, it is a problem affecting one in three women the world over.
Violence perpetrated by men against women is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights such as the right to life, safety, dignity and physical inviolability.
As a rule, it is prohibited by law, but sadly it remains tolerated by society and statistics suggest that a billion women in the world continue to be beaten, forced to engage in sexual relations against their will and abused in other ways.
This is not exclusively a developing world problem.
Even in the Member States of the European Union on average three women die every day as a result of domestic violence.
This means that victims of domestic murders were living in our midst, not in some distant location.
Violence within the family is a major social problem resulting from unequal gender power distribution throughout the course of history.
In our times every state should safeguard the rights of all its citizens, and consequently combat discrimination and violence against women by drafting and implementing appropriate legal provisions.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too would like to congratulate MrsÂ Carlshamre on the report which she has drafted with passion, ensuring that one problem of civilised human society remains topical.
It is clear from the methodical report drafted by the relevant directorate of the European Commission and published in December 2005 and from research by the Council of Europe that violence against women is the main cause of death of women between the ages of 16 and 44.
Even though, as the Commissioner said, there is no global definition of violence against women, this phenomenon crosses borders and is not prevented by social position.
Any woman may fall victim to violence and any form of violence constitutes an infringement of human rights and infringement of the rights to life, safety, dignity and physical and mental integrity.
It is an obstacle to the development of a democratic society.
It isolates woman from social life and the labour market.
It may result in marginalisation and poverty.
This social problem must be wiped out in view of efforts to integrate more women into the labour market.
Psychological violence â humiliation, threats and insults â is one form of violence which destabilises a woman's personality and upsets her behaviour, to the point at which she is unable to contribute to her environment.
However, in order for there to be results, violence must be expressed and that is why confidence in the authorities, in the departments responsible, in the courts, needs to be increased.
The measures to be taken must be coordinated and I congratulate you, Commissioner, for having shown that you are prepared to take these measures by finding the appropriate legal bases and keeping the programme to combat violence separate from other issues.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0401/2005) by MrsÂ Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on equality between women and men in the European Union (2004/2159(INI).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report and on the motion calling for a resolution on gender equality in the European Union.
Gender equality is not only a cornerstone of the European Union, but is also an area in which Europe has blazed a trail and has always been one step ahead of social developments.
The position of women in Europe has changed considerably thanks to Community-level action, first via legislation, and then via the structural funds and Community-wide inclusion of gender issues in all areas of policy.
The Member States made it clear on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the platform for action on women in Beijing, which was celebrated exactly a year ago, that the issue of gender equality receives their wholehearted support.
Although progress has undoubtedly been made in the area of gender equality, important tasks lie ahead for us.
The Commission points this out in the report on gender equality, which is tabled every year at the spring summit of Heads of State or Government leaders.
We must persevere and strengthen the legal bases.
The motion for a resolution clearly refers to this and emphatically points out that the promotion of equality rests on three pillars, which are as follows:
1. legislation ensuring equal treatment for men and women and the fundamental rights of all people, whilst safeguarding the effective implementation of such legislation;
2. incorporating gender equality questions into our policies, especially the Lisbon Strategy and policies aimed at social inclusion, backed up by the principles of good governance and political commitment at the highest level;
3. the implementation of special measures to support specific groups and objectives, such as access for women to decision-making positions and the integration of female immigrants and women from ethnic minorities.
The Commission has pursued this approach in the past and will continue to pursue it in the future.
Its commitment in the area of gender equality will be reaffirmed in the roadmap on gender equality, of which President Barroso and I gave notice a number of months ago and which the Commission intends to table in March.
This roadmap will set out tasks and measures intended to support equality between men and women for the period 2006 to 2010, and will detail how the Union intends to address these issues with its policies.
Most of the measures referred to in the motion for a resolution will be flagged as priorities in the roadmap, along with support for the economic independence of men and women, equal access to decision-making positions, compliance with the principle of equal treatment and the fight against domestic violence and human trafficking.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissionâs report on equality between men and women in the EU sets out the progress that has been made on gender equality, but concludes that much remains to be done if we are to end all forms of discrimination and if women are to enjoy a level playing field with men in both public and private life.
To this end, there needs to be reconciliation between family life and work life, enhancement of the status of women in the labour market, more facilities for looking after children and other dependents and gender mainstreaming in the areas of immigration and integration.
There are two major challenges at the root of any gender equality policy.
One is to close the gender pay gap, and the other is to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life for both men and women.
It is unacceptable that women are the last to have access to jobs and the first to be made redundant, even though they are efficient and dedicated workers.
The gap between men and women in employment stands at 15.8%, whilst the percentage of women in part-time work stands at 30.4%, compared to 6.6% for men.
The employment rate among women with small children is 13.6% below the figure for women without children, whereas men with small children enjoy employment rates 10% higher than men without children.
Women do the lionâs share of work in the home and therefore have less time for paid work.
In couples with children up to the age of six, men do less than 40% of domestic chores and are responsible for 25% to 35% of childcare.
The provision of suitable childcare facilities remains a key instrument in enabling women to enter the labour market and to stay there.
There is a lack of women in all areas of work, especially in those areas traditionally considered male.
It has been proven that women are good managers, and their creative and innovative abilities in urban planning and construction are widely acknowledged.
As one successful female Italian architect once said, it is because men do not wear high heels, or walk with prams, that they do not design properly proportioned walkways or concern themselves with architectural obstacles.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to share some concerns that are worthy of further reflection.
It is the responsibility of politicians to be able to read the signs so that they can stop the situation from becoming any worse.
Mention was just made, as it was in the latest report, of domestic violence, and I should like to draw attention to youth violence and to the fact that it is on the rise.
The images of the recent events in France seen around the world raised the question of what leads hundreds of young people to use violence to draw attention to their problems.
Families, political decision-makers and societies as a whole must talk to one another to ascertain where they went wrong and why.
This problem is not confined to France.
There is a high level of violence among young people everywhere, and this is a very serious problem.
What leads young people between 13 and 17 years of age to attack and even kill defenceless individuals as a form of entertainment?
The facts that have come to light are shocking.
A group of youths robbed beggars and immigrants simply for kicks and recorded everything on their mobile telephones in order to show off to their school friends afterwards.
Another group threw petrol over a homeless woman and set fire to her.
The woman died of her burns.
We cannot turn a blind eye to such cruelty.
It is not sufficient simply to condemn; what is needed is action, so that we do not come to feel a sense of regret later, and say, as the father of one of these youths said, I feel a failure as a father.
The principal cause, according to the experts, is the absence of parents.
There are thousands of young people in the EU who have been consigned to the television, the Internet and the street since they were children.
Parents spend over 12 hours outside the home, leaving the children unattended and at the mercy of all manner of negative influences, leading to academic failure, children leaving school early, indolence, drugs and exclusion.
The second cause is idleness.
With nothing to do, no school or no job, young people become irresponsible.
Add to this a permissive culture in which people have few or no duties and all the rights they want; there is no discipline, no demands are made and no value is placed on work or merit.
I should like the Commission, the Council and Parliament to look into this problem and to take appropriate measures while there is still time.
I hope that the Commissionâs next report is able to talk about more progress in the area of equality.
I should like to express my gratitude to those Members and the secretariat of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for their help in drawing up this report.
Â Â  . It often seems that there is nothing new to be said about the equality between men and women.
Very often we just repeat the same things all over again.
Unfortunately this does not mean that there is nothing left to be said about this issue.
What it actually means is that we are talking about the same concerns over and over again, because in practical terms progress is relatively slow, and one step forward is sometimes followed by one step back.
The best proof of this situation is that in spite of the countless directives and proposals concerning equal opportunities for men and women, created since the Rome Agreement, the situation has not been changing very fast.
The report (for which I congratulate the author) repeatedly points out that Directive 75/117/EC, enacted exactly 30 years ago, prohibits different levels of remuneration for men and women, but also mentions that according to the latest figures, the difference between remuneration levels of men and women is still on average 15% (between 4% and 25%).
Another question is, how many countries have actually implemented and executed the latest Directive 113/2004?
Or let us take a look at the fate of the undertakings adopted by the Council in Barcelona in 2002, to facilitate reconciliation between family life and a professional career.
These are relevant to the higher employment rate of women, but could also represent a turning point in the demographic crisis.
The legislation of the European Union is becoming unreliable.
Regulations may be breached continuously, without any consequences.
The authority of European Union institutions is damaged if its undertakings exist on paper only.
I trust that in the future the Commission will inspect the implementation and execution of the acquis more seriously.
Â Â  . Mr President, until now the majority of voices that have been heard on this important question â and on the previous report â has been those of women.
Hence, it is my honour to bring this discrepancy into balance to some extent and to emphasise that gender equality can be achieved only with the support and energetic participation of men.
I hope this point and the report in general will be applauded by an absolute majority of all men of the European Union.
A very important pledge of this report is to close the gender pay gap and to create pension schemes which are not discriminatory against women.
The experience of the Nordic states shows that the highest living standards and quality of life can be achieved in those countries where women are by no means less successful than men in occupying the highest political posts.
We should concentrate more on the revolting and alarming rate of trafficking in women, which is, in a way, comparable to the drug trade and for which, unfortunately, there is a huge demand in the new and old Member States.
Such crimes deserve stronger punishment across all the Member States of the EU.
Gender equality has always been one of the most important indications of European values for the new Member States.
I am pleased to underline that today these states, including Lithuania, have in many cases surpassed the âoldâ members.
Together with my colleagues, I am happy that the European Institute for Gender Equality is being created.
The new Member States have a strong argument for establishing this institute on their territory.
Lithuania, which in many cases, has a leading position in the implementation of gender equality policies, is more than ready to establish this institution in Vilnius.
Once again, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela.
Â Â  Mr President, I am once again pleased to congratulate Mrs Estrela on having produced a report that is essential to the fight for equality between men and women in the European Union, since, regrettably, the way the different genders are treated is still entirely unjust, particularly in terms of wages, recognition and opportunities.
Nevertheless, the degree of this injustice varies according to the Member State.
The Commission must therefore monitor seriously the application by the States of the Community legislation relating to equal opportunities and take the necessary measures in cases where it is not respected.
Furthermore, since I will become a father in two monthsâ time, I am also concerned about the lack of attention generally still paid to the reconciliation of work and family life and, in particular, the difficulty many men still have in many countries in playing a responsible paternal role, which means that women have to take more responsibility within the family at the expense of their own professional careers.
In short, we must support measures to guarantee equality in employment and in access to goods and services and to their provision.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, as both the Lisbon Strategy and Mrs Estrelaâs report make clear, an integrated community is based on freedom, solidarity and equality, yet there continues to be inequality between men and women in a number of areas.
I wholeheartedly endorse calls for a narrowing of the pay gap between men and women and for European legislation to be implemented.
I must warn, however, that women are disadvantaged not only in terms of salary, but are also often the victims of discrimination; employers are often insensitive towards pregnant women, for example.
In the Czech Republic women have suffered what is referred to as silent discrimination.
Employers often assume that pregnant women are weak and defenceless.
Anti-discrimination laws intended to protect women have yet to be introduced in the Czech Republic.
In some countries there is silent discrimination against employees particularly on the grounds of age, maternity, health and disability.
The time has come for change.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I am a woman who was brought up in Poland, where Christian values are universally recognised.
I can assure the House that I have never been discriminated against in the home, at school, in higher education or at work.
Sadly though, women are in danger of being discriminated against as a result of European Union policies.
I cannot therefore understand the concern expressed by the author of the report on equality between women and men in the European Union at the fact that the employment rate for women aged between 15 and 24 has not increased.
That is the time when young women ought to be in education or perhaps starting families.
2007 has been designated âEuropean Year of Equal opportunities for Allâ.
With this in mind, I would like to call for equal opportunities for children too.
Children should at least be able to enjoy the same opportunity as we had to bond with our mothers.
Children must not be separated from their mothers soon after birth by sending the mother off to work and the children to a childcare centre.
From a medical point of view, plans to grant maternity leave to men instead of to women seem rather odd.
After all, women really need that time to recover from the birth.
For babies, it is a period of adjustment to life outside the womb.
It is particularly important that the first few months of life are spent in close proximity to a loving mother, whose care is vital to the proper development of newborns babies and toddlers.
Rather than granting time off to fathers, it would be more appropriate to increase family benefits and to recognise the time spent bringing up children when calculating pension entitlements.
Men do not have a maternal instinct and their sense of paternal responsibility develops rather later.
Once again, I appeal for responsibility, for women to be treated with dignity and respect, and for children not to be subjected to social experiments.
Â Â  . â I would like to draw your attention to several points.
I believe that an appropriate solution to the problem of gender equality will be found.
Firstly, when gender education is incorporated into school and university curricula.
Secondly, when we no longer confine ourselves to formal governmental and ministerial reports and the governments are requested to show concrete results regarding the implementation of gender equality policies.
Thirdly, when the European Institute for Gender Equality, which is currently being established, does not confine itself to the collection of statistical data, but appoints impartial observers, capable of assessing the situation in every country of the European Union.
Of course, we would argue in favour of a proposal that such an institution be established in Lithuania.
Fourthly, when the comment made by the European Commission is taken into account, that not one project application has been received from the Baltic countriesâ non-governmental organisations, which are concerned with the implementation of gender equality policies, simply because these organisations do not have the funds for cofinancing.
Thus they are also denied access to structural funds.
Â Â  Â Mr President, men and women enjoy absolutely equal rights under Union legislation.
Indeed, the Union perceives this as one of its key tasks in connection with the practical implementation of human rights.
I am sure none of us feels that it should be otherwise.
Of course we are in favour of making progress in those areas where men and women are still not treated equally.
Of course women should not endure violence at the hands of men, though these days there are also many cases of battered men.
Of course women should receive equal pay for work of equal value.
In my country there are more women that men continuing their studies and gaining higher education qualifications.
In my view, the reason why these women do not then pursue their studies still further or take up important positions in business or politics is not because they are subject to discrimination.
It is simply that women have other priorities in life.
They have much more significant and urgent goals to attain than men.
It is important to bear in mind that the factor of time operates rather differently in the course of the life of a man and a woman.
Women have to bear their children at a specific stage in their lives.
They live longer than men to make up for that.
There is nothing to prevent constituents from voting for women to represent them in the European Parliament, for example.
It is not our fault that women themselves prefer to vote for men.
Personally, I voted for the best candidate in our constituency, and that candidate happened to be a woman.
Our whole world order is based on the fact that there are two versions of the human being, the male and the female.
The Creator, or Nature if you prefer, ladies and gentlemen, has determined that although they are equal, men and women are not the same.
They are physically different and have different roles to play in society.
Unfortunately, their financial circumstances differ too, and this should be remedied.
There are also some psychological differences between the sexes.
I urge women to recognise the positive aspects of being a woman and to understand that having exactly the same as men does not always mean having the same things.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the subject of the Estrela report lies at the heart of our concerns about the quality of European democracy and is also directly liked to our development objectives and, specifically, the Lisbon Strategy, which was the subject of the meeting between our Parliament and the national parliaments over recent days.
The report by Mrs Estrela is especially important and that is why I thank her for her initiative in drafting it, because it is the first report which refers to the gender equality situation in the Europe of the 25.
Despite its descriptive approach, it gives us useful information on this situation and the need to address inequalities.
We note that, despite the economic slowdown, employment among women is increasing.
The present average of 55.1% is an optimistic message that we can achieve the Lisbon objectives of 60% by 2010.
However, a deeper and more careful analysis gives us to understand that the position of women in the labour market is precarious, because unemployment is increasing at the expense of women, the share of part-time work is much greater among women than among men, wage differentials continue to exist in all sectors and certain categories, such as immigrants, are victims of particular forms of discrimination in the labour market.
Reconciling family life and work continues to constitute a major challenge, especially for women with small children.
The proposals in the Estrela report were, I believe, the subject of unanimity in our committee and I too maintain that a national strategy is needed with well coordinated objectives in the Member States which, on the one hand, promote mainstreaming in all policies and, on the other hand, apply the measures for the abolition of discrimination where it exists.
However, very good cooperation is also required between government agencies and social partners and non-governmental organisations, especially women's organisations and, on the part of the Commission, monitoring is needed of the application of the and a deeper approach to the issue, with a higher standard of analysis.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very comprehensive report.
Unlike some other speakers, I consider it necessary and timely.
I will highlight just three issues.
The gender pay gap remains unacceptably high across Europe at 16%.
In Ireland, it is approximately 15% and this has major implications for womenâs standard of living, for their families and their quality of life.
This issue must be addressed at national and EU level.
Secondly, I support the rapporteurâs call to all Member States to ensure that women have equal access to social insurance schemes.
In Ireland, spouses of self-employed people or farmers are often not covered by social insurance in their own right, even though they work on the farm or in the business.
They therefore lose out on many benefits and entitlements.
This is discriminatory and needs to change.
Finally, there is an absolute need for positive discrimination towards women in the political system by political parties at all levels, particularly at candidate selection level.
I suggest a level of 50% of women.
To those who would say we do not always get the best people in that way, I would say rubbish; 51% of the population are women.
You will get as much quality from there as from the other 49%.
And why do I insist on that?
Because issues such as caring in the home, violence in the home, trafficking of women and many other issues that are seen as womenâs issues are not just womenâs issues, they are societal issues.
Until we have sufficient numbers of women at decision-making level, they will not be mainstreamed in policy responses and will not be adequately addressed.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this interesting debate, in which a relatively large number of men took part.
I take this as a sign that we have made progress in the area of equal opportunities.
Gender equality is not only a social question, but also an economic one, and our policies will be all the more effective if they take this issue on board.
Equality should be based on a broad approach, involving specific measures and reaching across all of our policies.
The policy of gender equality must be fostered through political commitment at the highest level, involving compliance with legislation and good governance at all levels of power.
We are making strenuous efforts in this direction and I feel sure that our roadmap on equality issues, which we shall be tabling in March, will make a significant contribution.
I should like, if I may, to respond to one of the questions that was asked.
Directive 73/2002 came into force on 5Â OctoberÂ 2005, and most countries have transposed it.
The Commission is currently analysing the situation and, where applicable, will initiate the appropriate procedures.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The initiation reported by MrsÂ Estrela on equality between men and women in the EU has a crucial role in the horizontal way of handling equality matters.
The aim was common to present the second annual report on equality and the first to cover the enlarged EU of 25 Member States.
I am strongly convinced that measurable results could be worked out only with systematic work.
An important message of the initiation is that each year an annual report will be presented.
The report mentions the strategic guidelines of the equality policy.
I would like to emphasise two of the most relevant fields that should be ensured for all: decent work and equal pay for equal job.
My opinion is women hold the key to achieving the Lisbon Strategyâs overarching goal of creating more growth and jobs in the European Union.
The primary task an increase in affordable childcare, following the good example set by Sweden and Denmark.
It is focused by the PSE Groupâs growth and investment strategy, agreed by social democratic governments across Europe.
Last but not least we could achieve the above-mentioned results only with the active participation of men in gender equality.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0390/2005) by MrÂ Markus Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the application of the Postal Directive (Directive 97/67/EC) as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC (2005/2086(INI)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would very much like to thank the Commission for having produced a very ambitious report on the application of the Postal Directive, which forms the basis for today's debate and tomorrow's vote here in the European Parliament.
It has become very clear â and this is also expressed in the resolution we adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism â that the journey we started in 1992 with the Green Paper on the development of postal services in the European Union has continued successfully to today.
We have succeeded in reaching a compromise between comprehensive, high-quality provision of postal services and ever increasing competition in the sector, two essentially contradictory aims.
That, of course, is the specific aim in 2006, if the obligations in the current Postal Directive also have to be met.
I am delighted, Commissioner, that the Commission has put forward a very ambitious timetable, that the prospective study laid down in the directive has now been commissioned, and that, on the basis of this prospective study, we will then be in a position to take further decisions.
Obviously, we cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved so far; we must ensure that we complete the internal market in this field too.
But the postal market is not telecommunications, it is not electricity, and it is not gas.
We therefore need to take a closer look at how we can achieve further developments here.
In our report we have tried to raise a series of questions to which, of course, we would very much like answers, Commissioner, when you present the studies that you have planned for this year.
This will give us the materials we need to be able to reach decisions.
The question is: how can we ensure that postal services work throughout the European UnionÂ âÂ not just in the big cities, in Greater London, in the Ruhr valley, in Berlin, in Madrid or in Rome, but in all regions of the EU?
How can we permanently guarantee the high quality that we now enjoy even in cross-border regions, and how can we do this in a sector thatÂ âÂ as the Commission's communication also saysÂ âÂ is continuing to grow?
I can still remember the debates in this Chamber when the opinion was that postal services would die out anyway, because we could use faxes and e-mail.
Postal services are a growth sector.
So, how can we mobilise market forces to develop new products and thus to create more jobs in the sector?
These are questions to which we in the committee expect answers from the Commission over the course of this year.
They are questions that we have included in this report.
If we can work together very intensively this year â the Commission and the European Parliament, and the Council, which is not very involved at the moment, will join in at some pointÂ â then we can enable further developments in this sector that, at the end of the day, will live up to all of these conditions.
I am very grateful to all my fellow Members who worked with such commitment on this topic.
Postal services affect all of us: in every one of our electoral districts there are many postal customers, many post offices and sorting offices, in some cases run by several postal service providers.
There are therefore always very lively discussions both in committee and here in Parliament.
Many thanks to all those who helped me produce this report.
I would also like to be quite clear: a rapporteur is always pleased when only a few amendments are tabled.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled an amendment that certainly helps to improve the wording of a point that had not come out of the voting in committee very well.
I hope that it will meet with broad approval.
We will then have produced, on the whole, a thorough report which puts the European Parliament in a good position to complete its further legislative tasks successfully.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to briefly inform the House on the state of play of the Communityâs postal policy from the perspective of the Commission and to share with you my thoughts on how I see that policy developing in 2006.
But first of all, I should like to thank Mr Ferber for his report, which is very timely, constructive, balanced and well informed.
In fact, the findings of the report correspond with our own thinking.
Like the report, we are convinced that postal reform in the European Union has brought about positive results for all players and has significantly contributed to the European Unionâs competitiveness.
This directive has already paved the way forward by asking the Commission to submit this year three initiatives: a third report on the application of the Postal Directive, a prospective study about the impact of competitive postal markets on universal postal services, and a proposal on the future of EU postal policy.
The shape of this proposal will be influenced by a number of factors.
One of these, and perhaps the most important, is the impact of Community rules on the postal sector.
The Postal Directive, as amended, establishes balanced principles to allow a gradual phasing-in of competition while maintaining the necessary safeguards for the provision of a universal service.
I must say in this context that developments to date provide no evidence supporting the need for a change to the deadlines set out in the Postal Directive.
The year 2009 thus remains the reference date for our work.
The Commission will ensure that the enforcement of the Treaty provisions on competition will accompany the process of liberalisation.
As far as the state aid rules are concerned, in July 2005 the Commission adopted a package of measures providing guidance on the principles under which it assesses public service compensation for services of general economic interest.
Furthermore, the Commission is fully aware of the social relevance of postal services and will pay particular attention to the situation of every Member State so as to be able to reach common ground.
The results of the prospective study will help us in doing so and will contribute to the analysis of the conditions for a successful postal internal market.
Additional elements will be provided through the results of our recently conducted public online consultation on the future of European postal services.
The Commission will continue its preparatory work in full transparency, and pursue its dialogue with all those involved.
This own-initiative report of the European Parliament represents a very good basis for further discussions.
I very much welcome this initiative and I warmly thank Mr Ferber and his colleagues from the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the excellent work.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the substance of the rapporteur MrÂ Ferber's opinion on the European Commission's progress report.
By means of the opinion presented by the rapporteur, we want to ensure that the Commission uses the measures announced up to 31Â December this year to examine closely all the economic, technological, social and geographic aspects of the increasing openness of the postal market and to inform us of its consequences.
To date â I would like to remind you of this, Commissioner, and I am keen to hear your response â not all Member States have, to our knowledge and that of the rapporteur, correctly implemented the Postal Directive on time.
I think that it is the Commission's duty to monitor the implementation of the measures taken so far very carefully in each Member State, to hold the Member to their obligations and, if necessary, to refer them to the European Court of Justice.
Community law must be applied in all Member States.
By way of conciliation, though, I will say that, following the generally positive developments in the postal market for the benefit of the consumers so far, in my opinion the Commission should stick to the joint decision to complete the opening up of postal services in 2009.
I would also ask you to really go into the issue of universal service in detail once more.
If I may summarise, universal service should mean that we can expect high-quality services at affordable prices in all Member States.
That is our goal, but we should take a careful look at that.
I will give you an example: If even Germany now deviates from the principle that the postage charge for a standard letter should be the same both internally and to all 24 other Member States, then we have to consider what that means.
A standard letter in Germany now costs 55 cent, but the same letter to any other EU country costs 70 cent, the first time there has been a difference.
If that means that the postage charged depends on the costs â the distance and the type of delivery â then what is the justification for a universal service?
What is left to justify the restriction of competition by a regulated reserved sector?
We need to examine carefully the question of what the universal area is, what we want it to guarantee, and whether we need a reserved sector to do that.
I am therefore awaiting your assessment and your opinion with great interest.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is obviously important we are having this debate today, because on 1Â January, the latest step down to 50Â grams for the reserve sector took place, and we are awaiting the Commissionâs study â hopefully to be published in the summer â on accomplishing the internal market by 2009.
There are great challenges facing the postal sector, but also great opportunities.
Post has to keep up with developments elsewhere, not least the switch from consumer-to-consumer business to business and consumer, but also as regards the single market.
It is a condemnation of the European Union that 13Â years after the completion of the single market, there are huge obstacles to cross-border postal activity, the work of the expanding home-shopping market and indeed for newspaper and magazine publishers.
In order for this process to work properly, we have to have transparency, clarity, certainty and the clear involvement of postal customers and consumers.
We recognise of course that each postal market is unique, but that cannot excuse serious regulatory asymmetry leading to serious market distortions.
We have to have a structure whereby national regulatory authorities must work together.
We have to have greater clarity and transparency in the authorisation process and this is one area on which the Commission must focus.
We need Member States to adopt and implement the quality of service standards devised by CEN so that we can compare like with like.
We must ensure that postal customers, small as well as large, are involved in this whole process.
Ultimately the success or failure of this venture will depend on us being able to satisfy people that our little old mothers living in isolated places are still going to get a universal service.
Answer that and this process will be successful.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like straightaway to join others in thanking our fellow Member, MrÂ Ferber, for his own-initiative report.
Allow me to present my point of view from two angles.
Firstly, together with my Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am delighted that this report will henceforth give us the opportunity to debate the legal framework that our Union should implement by 2009 with a view to regulating the opening up of postal services.
Secondly, I support the method proposed, which offers us an approach to the process of modernising this sector that is both controlled and balanced.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, while the aim of opening up postal services is, as has just been explained, one of modernising the sector of activity in question and of improving the services provided to customers, no one is oblivious to what is at stake in the reform or to our fellow citizensâ legitimate fears that a high-quality service will no longer be maintained and that the service will no longer cover all territories, including the remotest ones.
It is therefore with a great deal of interest that I await the economic impact study due to be presented by the European Commission some time this year.
It should be based on reliable economic data and on the results of consultations with all the interested parties, from the trade unions to the chambers of commerce and industry, via all the social partners concerned.
I also draw the Commissionâs, as well as the Councilâs, attention to the need to combat distortion of competition in all its guises.
I am thinking, in particular, of VAT liability and tax harmonisation.
To conclude, I am counting on the Commission to propose relevant and fair schemes for funding the universal service, without second guessing choices that Parliament will have to make because, in the last resort, ladies and gentlemen, it is undoubtedly up to Parliament, as our democratic arm, to explain to the 450Â million Europeans that the strong Europe that we want to build together belongs to them.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the future of postal services, we should start by considering what we are trying to achieve.
The completion of the internal market cannot be an end in itself, but should â as it says in all the declarations of intent â bring positive results for the citizens of Europe.
However, it can already be seen that several states where services have been diluted have recorded a huge impact on remote regions and areas with low population densities.
People in poorly accessible areas must also not be cut off from services.
The idea that opening up the market would, as the rapporteur stated in committee, automatically guarantee that services would be provided to the proverbial old lady in the mountains has since been proved wrong by some classic examples.
For that reason, a study like the one that has been prepared should not pose the questions in a way that practically presupposes the desired answer, as has been done in point 13, for example.
This point clearly shows the author's desire to get a certain answerÂ âÂ so clearly, in fact, that it almost makes the study superfluous.
If we commission a study, we must be prepared to face up to the whole truth.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the liberalisation of postal services is a piece of the puzzle of the general liberalisation of services and the privatisation of public utility companies and harms all the workers.
The social need for reliable, modern postal services is becoming the subject of exploitation in order to secure greater profits for big business.
On the pretext of the new operational programmes, redundancies and changes to postal workers' contracts of employment are taking on mass proportions.
On the pretext, again, of changing communication conduct, the report paves the way for the definition of the universal service to be re-examined.
It endeavours to abolish the obligation which this service provider has to provide ready access to the postal network to all users at adequate fixed collection and distribution access points which cover national and cross-border services.
These amendments, as part of the liberalisation of postal services and the completion of the internal market in postal services in 2009, as referred to in the report, objectively give private post offices the facility to wrest the lion's share of the postal market from public post offices, with painful consequences for users and workers in general.
That is why we are opposed to and voted against the report.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have seen the proposed Constitution for Europe rejected by the French and Dutch people.
The computer-implemented inventions and port services directives were also rejected.
Despite these rejections, the drive towards harmonisation goes relentlessly onwards, even when it has nothing to do with trade or EU efficiency and is bad for citizens.
So here it is, another second-class act, the Postal Directive.
This is none of the EUâs business, and I advise the EU to stay out of it.
The Postal Directive seeks to impose value added tax on postage at a time when letter writing is under great competition from e-mail.
The UK does not want it!
The British Post Office is now 371 years old, and it was the British in 1840 who brought out the first postage stamp, bearing the head of Queen Victoria.
Now the EU wants to stamp its dead hand of inefficiency on it.
A high watermark of philatelic interference, perforated only by ignorance of British tradition and a wish to kill letter writing stone dead.
From Penny Black to EU attack in 166 years!
Is this progress?
In 2004 the Postmaster General stated categorically that the British Government did not want VAT on stamps.
The Royal Mail told me this very week that it does not want it, as it would be bad for small businesses, charities and customers.
The British people do not want it.
They are already paying for the cost of the EUâs common agricultural policy.
What would Stanley Gibbons have said from the Strand in London if he had still been alive?
I suggest he would have published a book with pictures of MEPs who monkey with British postal traditions entitled âStanley Stamps Gibbon Catalogueâ.
When UKIP vote on this report, it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens.
I hope British MEPs stick up for Britain.
The people will watch as Europhiles submit their nations to another excessive stamp of EU authority.
Thank you, Mr President, and good luck to the interpreters!
Â Â  MrÂ Nattrass, for your information, your group may speak today for five minutes, divided up as follows: one minute for MrsÂ Krupa, one minute for MrÂ Bloom, a further one and a half minutes for MrsÂ Krupa and one and a half minutes for yourself, and not two and a half minutes.
If MrÂ Farage has âsoldâ you five minutes, then he has sold you something that did not belong to him.
Â Â  . Mr President, the postal directive should serve all consumers and particularly the needs of rural dwellers.
The liberalisation of services very often benefits those in areas of dense population at the expense of consumers in less-populated areas.
As a Member of the European Parliament for the West and North-West of Ireland, I represent a predominantly rural constituency.
In my experience, many directives over the years have had a negative impact on rural areas and rural development because they inadvertently or advertently benefited areas of high population where liberal policies were easier to follow.
The local post office in rural communities is a vital economic, social and cultural institution and the rights of rural dwellers to postal services cannot be ignored when framing liberalisation plans for those services in the EU.
The provision of and access to such services is the essence of what sustainable rural development is all about.
It has to be highlighted that the opening-up of postal services does not always bring benefits in terms of an increased level of employment and I would ask the Commission to address this in a detailed study that will be given equality, efficiency and customer-orientation in the postal sector, particularly as regards those peripheral areas.
The intention behind the postal directive was good but, like all good intentions, the application was not so good.
I would ask the Commission and the rapporteur to try and put in place a system of postal services that will be fair to all, a universal service.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of gradual liberalisation in the postal sector that has begun in recent years has produced a positive change, in that it has encouraged operators to improve the quality and efficiency of the service and of their production processes.
MrÂ Ferberâs report on the implementation of the postal directive is well-balanced: it underlines the positive effects of the liberalisation undertaken so far, but it also points out the need to assess the social and employment consequences of a further stage in the completion of the internal market, taking account of the particular situations in individual countries.
This further stage will depend entirely on the results of the Commissionâs study, the purpose of which is to assess the impact that completing the market will have on the universal service in each Member State.
It is therefore inappropriate to make any predictions about this study.
Parliamentâs role at this stage is to emphasise that the effect of liberalisation on the universal postal service must be assessed in relation to national differences and particular geographical, social and economic situations, and that political decisions on liberalisation must be made wholly in accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.
The postal service is a vital link for our citizens in certain areas.
To maintain current universal service levels requires a gradual approach.
That is why the Italian delegation cannot support the amendment proposed by MrÂ Ferber, because it implicitly casts doubt on the need for a universal service, which, in my view, remains a right and an inescapable duty for Europeâs postal services.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will be very brief when I say that postal services are not like other services.
They have a human dimension, as has been pointed out, but they also have a social and territorial dimension, which means that the services provided vary greatly from one country to the next.
There is a big difference between serving a very dense population, like that of the Netherlands, which is concentrated on very flat territory, and serving, on the same terms, the same population spread over thousands of islands, as in Greece, or over a very diverse territory, as in France.
Consequently, I hope that the assessment planned by the Commission is objective and that it is not based on the belief shared by some in this Assembly, namely that there is no need for a framework because the market, and nothing but the market as a whole, is equal to the job of regulating postal services.
I also hope that this assessment helps ensure that the opening up of the postal market - which is something Europe needs â is carried out in such a way as to respect what the postal service represents: a universal service whose territorial and social dimension is irreplaceable.
Â Â  The goal of liberalising the postal sector by 2009 is real and achievable.
Results in the Member States where postal reform has been more rapid demonstrate this fact.
It is difficult to understand why the report stresses that as a result of competition in the postal sector former employment levels have not always been preserved.
The goal of postal reform is not preserving jobs, nor of course reducing them.
Jobs can also be lost without liberalisation â as a result of technological modernisation, for instance.
We should not look at industry reform from the viewpoint of the postal sector as a business.
The development of the postal business and its adjustment to new market conditions are business management issues.
The fundamental goal of the restructuring of the postal sector is to better meet consumersâ interests, by giving inhabitants of the European Union the opportunity to receive a universal service.
At the same time, however, the post should not remain simply an industry for the maintenance of the universal service.
We should not forget that the majority of postal services customers â in fact over 90Â per cent â are business customers, whose requirements of the postal sector may be different.
A broad spectrum of high-quality postal services needs to be developed, in order for the industry not only to survive but also to develop.
The range of postal services increasingly interacts with other sectors such as financial services, advertising and commerce.
The future of postal services will be dependent on such successful interactivity.
Postal sector development is one of the engines for the European Unionâs economic development, productivity and competitiveness.
Unfortunately, progress in the direction of a common European Union postal market remains slow.
Â Â  We are once again holding a debate which affects one of European societyâs most emblematic public services, which is of great symbolic value and inspires great confidence; hence its diversity and strong roots.
Furthermore, postal services are essential given their importance in terms of an intensive workforce: a workforce with a level of training and sense of belonging to the service which deserve immense respect and recognition.
Furthermore, the postal servicesâ capacity to enhance social and territorial cohesion is fundamental in an enlarged and increasingly individualist Europe.
In this new phase that is opening up â and at this point I would like to acknowledge Mr Simpson as well, whom I wish had also been present, and I hope that he is here later â I would therefore like to say to the Commission that it is essential that the new process have true and acceptable justification and that it be fully credible, because we are being told that the service will be better afterwards, but what we are seeing today is that what is being proposed to us is greater insecurity in terms of jobs, with a large number of question marks being placed over the service.
We must therefore argue that it is essential fully to guarantee the universal service with all of its quality of service and price conditions and also argue that account be taken of social and territorial cohesion and of the diversity of the current systems in terms of what is good about them â they cannot all be homogenised.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his excellent report, which clarifies the social and economic importance of the postal services, in the face of indications of unemployment and concentration.
It is necessary in my view to prevent this public service, with the advent of liberalisation, from becoming merely an economic service, in which only the wealthier sections of society will be able to enjoy the basic right to send a letter, with the universal provision of service denied to the least privileged members of society and to those living in outlying regions.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission, in future analyses of the sector, to differentiate on the basis of costs associated with funding the universal service, particularly in view of geographic and demographic constraints, in order to guarantee access for all to this service of general interest.
In common with the rapporteur, I feel that postal services are fundamental to the EU, and that they have a positive influence on various sectors of society, such as trade, services and jobs, by modernising investments capable of increasing competitiveness, quality and efficiency, which in turn make it possible to charge less to the citizens and to businesses.
In so doing, a decisive contribution is made to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, as a sector capable of generating jobs and growth.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  I am sympathetic to the fact that the report emphasises that the principle of subsidiarity must be applied to the authorisation procedure.
I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament points out that the Commission should devote special attention to the consequences that liberalisation of the postal market will have for the inhabitants of sparsely inhabited regions (paragraph 9).
What, however, I should like to have seen are stringent wordings that made it clear that a worse service for the populations of isolated regions of Europe is unacceptable.
The Commission has not adopted a position on modifications to rules governing how often post is to be distributed (see oral question H-1135/05).
Nor is the European Parliament clear about this issue.
One basic condition for enabling postal services to be used in the future by people living in sparsely populated regions is that services be priced at a level comparable with that applicable in the rest of the country.
The European Parliament does not adopt a position on this issue in the report.
Nor has the Commission done so.
I am also unsympathetic to the European Parliamentâs criticism of national value added tax on the postal market (paragraph 18) and to the proposal that the European Commission should investigate how the pension liabilities of the public postal operators are being dealt with (paragraph 17).
These are issues that should be dealt with at national level.
I shall vote against this report.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0412/2005) by MrÂ Toubon, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre-packed products, repealing Council Directives 75/106/EEC and 80/232/EEC, and amending Council Directive 76/211/EEC (COM(2004)0708 â C6 0160/2004 â 2004/0248(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the proposed directive on pre-packaging seems to be a very technical dossier.
However, in reality, it is part of the major policy initiative strongly supported by our institutions on better regulation and simplification.
There is Community legislation on pre-packaging, but the current legal situation is neither satisfactory nor clear.
In the European Union, we have a stable legal framework for wine and spirits, where, throughout the Community, products are sold in agreed quantities.
For around 70 other products, current legislation has introduced voluntary harmonisation to which Member States have adopted different approaches.
Member States such as Belgium or the Netherlands have deregulated package sizes altogether.
In other countries, for instance Sweden, Community legislation on package sizes has been made optional for manufacturers.
Other Member States have made regulation mandatory but only for home producers.
Some national rules are entirely based on the existing optional Community directives, but in other countries, such as Germany, national rules are different from Community provisions.
From a legal point of view, the situation is therefore quite confusing, to put it mildly.
At the same time, products freely move from one country to another and consumers find a wealth of products on the market.
Until now, no consumer has ever complained that there was an excess of choice.
The proposal of the Commission intends to simplify the legal situation whilst leaving the benefit of free choice to consumers.
The Commission is proposing a single legal framework to be implemented throughout the Union by all Member States.
In substance, the Commission proposes to leave the free choice that consumers currently enjoy and to regulate package sizes only for a very limited number of sectors, in particular wines and spirits.
The Commission notes that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection endorses this approach in principle.
However, we have different views on the number of sectors that should become subject to the Community regulation fixing nominal quantities.
As far as the Commission is concerned, and based on a wide consultation of consumers in all Member States and European Trade Federations, only the wine and spirits sectors should be regulated.
However, on the basis of a prior commitment to Parliament, the Commission has also included in its proposal the regulation for soluble coffee and white sugar.
Whilst supporting the overall approach, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection suggests that additional sectors should become subject to regulation, including drinking milk, butter, roasted coffee, dried pasta, rice and brown sugar.
The Commission questions the justification for regulation in these sectors.
European industry, with the exception of the coffee sector, is not in favour and consumers have not requested regulation that limits their choice.
The proposed amendment would imply that a number of products that are placed on the market today would disappear.
Furthermore, it would also mean that Member States that never had regulation or had abolished it would have to re-introduce regulation on package sizes. This is contrary to the political aims of better regulation and simplification and does not protect consumers.
The Commission appreciates that the Parliament has carried out an impact assessment of these amendments.
This initiative reflects the Commissionâs common concern for better regulation and simplification.
To conclude, in the Commissionâs opinion, consumer protection today should not be based on limiting consumer choice, but should concentrate on providing correct information to consumers and on the prohibition of misleading practices, allowing consumers to make a well-informed and deliberate choice.
It is fair to say that the Commission, as well as the European Court of Justice, takes as the benchmark the average consumer, reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect.
Vulnerable consumers do not become less vulnerable with rules on nominal quantities, but by better implemented existing Community law on consumer protection, such as labelling and the prohibition of deceptive packaging.
The Commission is working with national authorities towards the better implementation of these Community rules in order to effectively improve the protection of vulnerable consumers.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting on behalf on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has substantially changed the Commission proposal.
It was adopted by 28 votes in favour, with one abstention.
I propose accepting the deregulation of sizes, which is the Commissionâs chosen solution in taking account of the case-law in the case.
The Commission also proposes retaining mandatory ranges in some specific sectors: wines, spirits, soluble coffee and white sugar.
The Commission calls for this derogation to be restricted to a period of 20 years.
The members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection immediately questioned the relevance of the proposal and the quality of the impact study on which it is based.
I was therefore led to propose that other basic products be subject to mandatory ranges.
They are coffee, butter, rice, pasta and drinking milk.
The ranges I propose are quite extensive in terms of intervals, not to mention the fact that, below the smallest size and above the largest, there are no restrictions whatsoever.
I also propose that it be possible to review the arrangement in eight yearsâ time, and not in 20 yearsâ time as the Commission proposes.
Why is the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection presenting you with this proposal?
Firstly, to protect the consumers, particularly those most vulnerable, such as the elderly and the partially sighted, who have far from fully understood the unit pricing laid down in 1998.
Next, to take account of the independent impact study commissioned by our committee and confirming that deregulation would carry risks for the consumer and that it would not lead to greater competition between producers and distributors.
Finally, because better lawmaking does not mean no lawmaking at all.
As Lacordaire said in the 1830s: between the strong and the weak, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that sets free.
You will see that this apparently insignificant and technical text enables us to ask important questions.
To conclude, I will highlight three factors: an impact study that is funded by Parliament itself and that depends neither on the Commission nor on pressure groups, which is a first; a concept of âbetter lawmakingâ inspired only by the interests of our fellow citizens and not by an ideological attitude; and a concern to retain our national cultures, because our nations are very attached to their food traditions and to their consumption patterns.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy applauds the Commissionâs initiative to deregulate and liberalise package sizes.
My committee considers that a free market works in the best interests of the consumer.
We were persuaded to accept the Commissionâs proposal to make exceptions for alcoholic beverages, soluble coffee, white sugar â we added brown sugar for consistency â and for aerosols.
In the interests of consistency, we also proposed a regulated size for spirits bottles of 750Â cl, which was the widely accepted size of wine bottles.
It verges on the misleading to have 750Â cl the standard bottle for wine and 700Â cl the standard bottle for spirits.
Therefore, we regret that this proposal was rejected by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
We appreciate that the Committee on the Internal Market and its very conscientious rapporteur, my good friend Mr Toubon, have considered these matters very thoroughly.
However, we in the Committee on Industry are disappointed to see proposals from that committee to introduce fixed, harmonised, mandatory sizes on a whole range of staple products which have not previously been so harmonised.
We have labelling requirements.
We prohibit misleading advertising.
EU legislation requires unit pricing so that the price for a standard amount must be displayed, and this helps consumers to compare prices fairly.
The ability to decide freely on package sizes is in the interests of the smaller business, the new entrant, the innovative enterprise and, therefore, also in the interests of the consumer.
There is nothing to stop marketing of traditional sizes; there is nothing to stop the use of traditional measures such as pints and pounds.
The Commission proposal did not even mention milk.
Nothing needed to change from the status quo.
The Committee on Industry suggests that Parliament support the Commissionâs praiseworthy attempt to reduce unnecessary regulation and vote against the Committee on the Internal Marketâs proposed extension of mandatory sizes to all these extra products.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon on the work he has done and particularly to commend his approach, which has made the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection the first committee in Parliament to commission an impact assessment where we have chosen â in this case in the interests of consumers â to add to the burden of regulation that the Commission has proposed.
That report is available to colleagues.
It indicated that despite the fact that there would be more complexity, the economic analysis demonstrated that the competitive effects were comparatively small and accepted the view of the rapporteur that there were consumer benefits to offset it.
There will be further discussions about it, but nevertheless I would not want this to go by without congratulating the Commission overall for the direction in which it is trying to take this.
There is a vast range of other products apart from the exemptions that are included in this praiseworthy proposal, and we should not forget that when talking about some of the specific issues.
As the Commissioner is well aware, in my own country, the United Kingdom, there has been a certain amount of entirely misleading controversy caused in the press about this proposal.
I shall confine myself to commenting on that for the record this evening.
First of all, on the assumption that we agree that drinking milk should be included, it is obviously extremely important that the traditional bottle sizes in which milk is delivered in the UK are fully protected.
I am sure colleagues will accept that fully and thus deal with any issues about the loss of the traditional British âpintaâ.
Secondly, but more fundamentally, bread is a commodity that is regulated nationally under many specific regulations.
In the UK, we consume very large amounts of pre-packed sliced bread and I think there is a very strong argument for exempting that from the regulation altogether and allowing Britain to sustain its current regulated pack sizes for this very important consumer commodity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Toubon, many thanks for the excellent report that you have just presented.
To MrÂ Harbour, I would say that it is very important that we respect the cultures and traditions of the Member States.
We should always do that in our legislation.
I think my group will also support these amendmentsÂ âÂ that will not be a problem.
Commissioner Verheugen, you have just said that we need better regulation and, above all, better implementation of Community law.
I absolutely agree with you there, but I would also remind you that it is up to the Commission to ensure that Community law is actually implemented.
I would ask you to be very strict on these issues, because I, as a European, want the decisions we make in Europe actually to be implemented.
On the other hand, you also said that you take as the benchmark the average consumer, as does the European Court of Justice.
That is understandable: we all need a point of reference to work from.
As a social democrat, however, my benchmark in such cases is precisely those people who are not average, because they are disabled, because they are elderly, or because, for whatever reason, they are taking the various opportunities that are available in the Member States and are provided by companies.
It is in these cases in particular that reliability when purchasing basic foodstuffs like bread and milk is especially important.
That is why we must ensure that this reliability is maintained in our shops, and why we will agree to the rapporteur's proposals.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Toubon for his commitment and the way he went about things, but also, and all, to express my gratitude to the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the proposal they have made for the drafting of better legislation and deregulation.
It therefore strikes us as a little odd that Parliament should now respond with a host of exceptions.
We in the Netherlands, a country that rejected the Constitutional Treaty, consider it unnecessary for Europe to get involved in matters such as the measure of coffee or milk, for that is what the internal market is for and measurements and products are subject to mutual recognition.
We are therefore very unhappy about the additional exceptions or additional products that are now being included to qualify for harmonisation.
We will therefore vote against those exceptions and if we cannot throw them out and cannot stick to the Commission proposal, we as Liberals will vote against the proposal as a whole, which we would regret, for this could ultimately set an example.
I hope that we will not have to deal with this now and I hope that I will not, when I return to my own country, have to admit at some future referendum on the Constitutional Treaty that we in this Parliament do get involved in details, which should be left to the man and woman in the street.
Legislation already clearly provides for the price per unit of litre or kilogramme for the benefit of the consumer.
Since that is already incorporated in the price, I think we should not underestimate the European public, or patronise them and treat them like children or second-class citizens.
I think we should have faith in the individuals who can make their own choices, and it is up to us to give them those choices.
Similarly, it would be unfortunate, in my view, if we were to travel to other countries in Europe, as tourists or otherwise, and if we would no longer be able to enjoy the weights and measures that apply there, like, for example, the pint in the United Kingdom.
It is unfortunate to my mind that we have not opted for better legislation and deregulation as the Commission proposed, and we regret the proposals for exceptions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is, in truth, not often that I am able to agree with the Commission concerning liberalisation projects, but this is a sensible form of liberalisation.
I see that MrÂ Toubon has done some serious work and carried out an impact assessment, but that is not sufficient reason for issuing regulations at EU level.
If a country wishes to regulate sizes of loaves and pasta, it can do so, but not at EU level.
There is a danger of matters becoming rather ridiculous when the EU goes in for such things.
What consumers expect is, of course, protection against dangerous additives and an overhaul of those additives that we do use.
They also expect clear labelling, big enough to be read and in their own language, so that they understand which ingredients are included in the products concerned.
The rules to combat misleading marketing cover those problems that consumers could come up against because of confusing pack sizes.
It is that type of legislation that has a real impact on consumersâ needs.
When it comes to alcohol, I agree with the Commission that that is another issue.
In that area, it is a question of monitoring consumption in another way, and the existing rules and those proposed by the Commission are appropriate for doing so.
There are reasons for having regulations in this sphere.
I think that the proposal produced by the Commission, namely not to increase EU legislation, is a well-balanced one.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Verheugen, MrÂ Toubon, I wish to welcome the Commissionâs proposal for deregulating packaging.
I hope that continued debate will bring our own approach closer to that of the Commission, so that it is the consumer and not the politicians who choose.
The rapporteur, MrÂ Toubon, has shown that he is ready and willing to accept my amendment rescuing Swedish milk packs, so that people can still have milk for their coffee at work.
There are still things to be done in terms of deregulating butter and pasta and of having less detailed regulation generally.
It would be bad for competition and for consumers if we were to make matters worse for small and medium-sized enterprises and to use political measures to give market shares to the big conglomerates.
Those of us who come from a small country cannot accept the report in that form.
We have had enough of debates about cucumbers and strawberries.
Let us avoid a debate about âmilk-snatchingâ and go on negotiating with a view to obtaining greater freedom for the consumer.
A lot remains to be done before this matter has been satisfactorily concluded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for many countries, MrÂ Toubonâs changes to the Commissionâs proposal mean new rules being laid down at EU level for an already functioning market.
We Swedish Social Democrats do not believe that the rapporteurâs amendments involve any benefit for consumers.
On the contrary. If the rapporteurâs approach were to meet with sympathy, it would involve major conversion costs for many European companies, and this without the groups we say we represent even needing or necessarily even desiring the changes.
For example, the Swedish Consumersâ Association, which works actively with quite a few cooperation groups and associations on precisely these issues to do with packaging, has, on the basis of our contacts with the Association, never heard any wishes expressed concerning fixed pack sizes.
Moreover, the EUâs institutions would not be complying with their ambition to improve the quality of legislation by avoiding detailed regulation.
We Swedish Social Democrats have nothing against making stringent demands of businesses with a view to their achieving better consumer protection.
On the contrary.
As has been pointed out, however, the regulations are, in this case, unnecessary, and we shall therefore vote against the report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  I welcome this report on rules of nominal quantities for pre-packaged products.
I am in favour of retaining specific quantities for staple foods as I believe it is important to maintain nominal quantities in the interest of the British consumer.
The report preserves essential parts of existing legislation and, in particular, removes the unjustified attempt by the Commission to abolish fixed sizes within 20 years.
Given the complexity of âunit pricingâ, such protection laws will ensure that the current sale of the British pint of milk is not put at risk.
Contrary to inaccurate Eurosceptic scare-stories that have caused much controversy amongst consumers, British consumer choice is protected.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission communication on the European Communication Strategy â White Paper.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank you and the honourable Members for being here this early morning.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present to you the White Paper on a European communication policy adopted by the Commission at its meeting yesterday.
This is not the first time I have spoken about the White Paper in this House.
I first announced it during the debate on the Herrero report, which has been an important reference for my subsequent work.
During the preparation stages for the White Paper I regularly informed the European Parliament about my ideas, meeting with the different political groups, committees etc., and I am sure that several of you will find the key concepts and messages of the White Paper quite familiar.
The feedback and encouragement I have received make me believe that I will continue to find, in this House, the most committed and precious ally when it comes to communication.
Communication is first and foremost a matter of democracy.
People have a right to know what the European Union does and what it stands for, and as citizens they have a right to fully participate in the European project.
This is the key message of the White Paper.
There is a worrying gap between the European Union and its citizens.
Seven out of ten interviewed in Eurobarometer polls say that they know little or nothing about the European Union.
More than half feel that their voice does not count when it comes to European issues.
Trust in the European institutions is falling and so is the number of those who believe that Europe brings benefits to them or their countries.
The perception of a communication gap between the European Union and its citizens is not new.
It has been a subject of discussion in EU circles at least since the referendums that preceded the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.
In this respect recent referendums on the constitutional treaty have been a harsh wake-up call.
Bridging the gap between the European Union and its citizens has become more urgent than ever.
To move forward, the European project needs to be anchored in peopleâs wishes and expectations.
It must belong to citizens, not just to a small elite based in Brussels, or in a couple of big European capitals.
The White Paper is the Commissionâs proposal to respond to this challenge and to lay the foundation of a European Union communication policy.
What should the main purpose of a European communication policy be?
The White Paper argues for developing a working European public sphere, where the European debate can unfold and citizens can participate.
This is a concept that the European Parliament embraced some time ago, and it is now central to the Commissionâs vision of a communication policy.
The White Paper underlines the importance of developing a true European political culture, with pan-European political groups, pan-European media and fora or meeting places where citizens can meet and discuss issues of common interest.
