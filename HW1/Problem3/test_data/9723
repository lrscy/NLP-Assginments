on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to thank my colleagues Malcolm Harbour and Evelyne Gebhardt, and many others, for their excellent levels of cooperation.
In particular I want to thank Commissioner McCreevy, as, without his rational approach to cooperation, there would certainly have been no progress.
Services are a crucial source of growth and jobs in the EU.
During the period 1997-2002 approximately 96% of new jobs were in service sectors.
It is therefore important that there should be no unnecessary barriers to growth at national level.
The Services Directive is a step in the right direction.
I know that there are people in this House who are dissatisfied, because they think that we have not gone far enough, but there are also those who believe that Parliament and the Council took too great a leap.
This proposal now before us is a compromise; it is what it was possible to accomplish given the situation.
The European Parliament has been accused of nibbling away at the Commission's original proposal.
At the same time, however, nobody has bothered to mention the large number of areas to which the directive still applies.
The Services Directive covers such sectors as the construction industry, business services, fitting and installation, trade and distribution, and travel and leisure services.
The spectrum is very wide.
The purpose of this proposal is thus to liberalise services, thereby reducing their cost.
The demand for various services relies on price, but confidence is just as important.
If a service provider does things on time and well, confidence grows and so, then, does the market.
It is not the directive that will determine that: the responsibility lies with the service provider.
The free mobility of the workforce is just as important as the Services Directive for a viable EU internal market.
At the time of enlargement to the east, only Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom allowed free and immediate access to their job markets to nationals of the new Member States.
Now that a new round of enlargement is to take place, once again there are Member States which are erecting barriers.
These new potential barriers are very troublesome, and cause problems for the liberalisation of the internal market.
They are a step backwards.
If we are to take a step forwards with the Services Directive, it is to be hoped that progress will be made in the same way as regards the free mobility of labour.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt, we are disappointed at the refusal of the three largest groups, the majority of this House, to conduct a proper second reading of the Services Directive today.
Mrs Gebhardt fought to the very end, but this makes it all the harder for us to understand how she can describe as a great triumph for Parliament an outcome she recently said contained some points that were legally imprecise and unclear.
Admittedly, the Council put us under great pressure by stating from the outset that any amendment of its text would result in the failure of the whole Directive - but this was the same Council that stated at its first reading that it had followed Parliament's text virtually in its entirety.
Sadly, however, it had not followed our text in its entirety, and a lack of clarity has crept into some points, mainly on issues surrounding social Europe.
This lack of clarity relates to the definition and exclusion of services in general and services of general economic interest in particular.
It relates specifically to the exclusion of social services, and it relates to the recognition of the collective agreements negotiated by the social partners.
These are not trifling matters; they are the fundamental issues that were used by the opponents of the Constitution to obtain a 'no' vote in the French referendum.
We could have taken the Council at its word when it emphasised time and again after the referendums that the new version of the Services Directive would fully respect social rights.
Sadly, however, this is not the case.
It makes a difference whether I give the example of social services or content myself with an incomplete list, which leaves large gaps in the case of some Member States and thus ends up having to be decided by the European Court of Justice.
It is incomprehensible how this could be accepted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
After all, the rapporteur for this committee, Mrs Rudi Ubeda, who is incidentally a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stated in her report on social services that these services differed greatly between Member States and that, consequently, a definition was needed.
How is it possible to exclude in a way consistent with legal certainty a sector that is not properly defined?
Sadly, however, the committee paid no further attention to this issue, but instead merely reaffirmed its reluctance to cause the Council any problems.
Consequently, in its haste to show obedience, it dispensed with its traditional right to conduct a proper second reading of the Services Directive.
This is certainly no triumph for Parliament; on the contrary, it is a defeat - one that we shall regret for a long time to come.
Even the Commission statement does not change this.
At best, it is binding on the present Commission, but it is not legally binding, since the interpretation of the law rests with the Court of Justice - as Commissioner McCreevy has reaffirmed today.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, in Parliament's relations with the Council, we are familiar with codecision and conciliation.
Today, with the Services Directive, we can add capitulation to that.
What other word is there for the incredible decision taken by the majority groups to yield to the Council's urgings by agreeing to withdraw all the amendments examined in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to adopt the Council's common position without opposition, even though it is indubitably a backward step from their own compromise of 16 February this year?
I would remind you that the European Trade Union Confederation felt it necessary to amend this text on certain points that it regarded as being 'of major importance', notably with regard to the 'clearer exclusion of labour law and social services, and clearer respect for fundamental rights'.
In fact, the Council's text makes the preservation of labour law in the Member States subordinate to compliance with Community law - a vague wording that refers to the rules on competition.
Some of you are consoling yourselves with Commissioner McCreevy's reassuring statement.
This really is very odd reasoning.
Dare I remind you that it was in fact Mr McCreevy who, just a year ago, used Community law to justify preventing a Latvian business from recognising collective agreements in Sweden, in the Waxholm affair that caused such a stir?
On the other hand, the Council has restored to the Commission an incredible level of power to monitor - both before and after the fact - the legislation of the Member States; it was precisely this power that Parliament wanted to restrict.
Mr McCreevy sees this change as a crucial improvement, and that is perfectly understandable, but what does Parliament see in it?
Nobody is saying anything.
Finally, the ambiguities and grey areas in the text of the directive - which I criticised at first reading on behalf of my group because, as I said at the time, they leave the door open for uncontrollable interpretation from the Commission and the Court - have already started to be exploited as we feared they would be.
For example, the Commission's communication on social services sets out an extremely simplistic vision of these services, which, by the way, Commissioner Å pidla was keen to stress would increasingly fall within the scope of Community law on the internal market and competition.
Another Commission communication, dealing with the posting of workers, attacks regulations in certain Member States with respect to service providers from other EU countries that it regards as disproportionate.
Here, too, the Commission is leaning on the inexhaustible case-law of the Court.
Where, then, are the safeguards that the directive was supposed to provide against this slippery slope leading the whole of social life into anything-goes competition?
In general, the President-in-Office put it very clearly: 'the Court's interpretation will be needed in many cases'.
Well, my group will not support this massive deregulation exercise.
Above and beyond the issue of services, there is, in my view, the issue of the concept of European integration.
Do we want to use the law to harmonise protective rules and push them upwards, or are we going to accept the harmonisation through the market and competition of standards that will consequently inevitably be dragged downwards?
Do we want to promote parliamentary and citizens' democracy, or are we going to allow ourselves to be governed by case-law and interpretative communications?
A few weeks away from the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, these are perfectly legitimate questions, and I am willing to bet that many of our fellow citizens will soon be asking them quite forcefully.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the services sector is responsible for almost 70% of the European Union's GDP and is the main source of economic growth.
There are, however, thousands of administrative obstacles to the development of this sector.
The main aim of the Services Directive is to cut this red tape, which would then facilitate the provision of cross-border services on the markets of the 25 Member States.
The European Commission has identified over 90 obstacles which service providers, such as mechanics, accountants and IT specialists, have to overcome in order to carry out their activities in another Member State.
As a rule, these difficulties are deliberately created by countries which fear competition from entrepreneurs from other states and want to protect their own markets at any price.
This is usually at the cost of the consumer, who is offered services that are more expensive and of lower quality.
Even in its watered down form, the Services Directive is a step in the right direction along the long and tortuous road of making the European economy competitive and making life simpler, especially for small businesses.
The years ahead will show whether it will, as Commissioner McCreevy claims will be the case, become a milestone in terms of removing the obstacles to the provision of services on the internal market.
We will only know the outcome when the Member States integrate the Directive into national law in a way which really will minimise these obstacles, which are incompatible with the principle of the free provision of services enshrined in the Treaty, and which are damaging to European consumers and entrepreneurs.
The European Commission should play a significant role in this matter and should act as a guardian to ensure compliance with the Treaties and with European legislation. Fortunately, we have managed to avoid further corruption of the Services Directive by rejecting, at the sitting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt.
Further watering down the Services Directive, which was ratified by the Council and is a difficult compromise anyway, would not only be harmful for the free services market, but could also result in the entire project being scrapped and in three years of hard work being wasted.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, what Parliament is endorsing today is a directive for lawyers and judges.
It is the judges in Luxembourg who will determine what has been decided.
The rules are very unclear.
I tried in vain to remove the worst of the imprecision by means of three unambiguous amendments.
1.
The Member States shall be able to require compliance with local agreements by all parties delivering services.
2.
The Member States shall be able to decide for themselves which services are to be performed under the public aegis, and what is to be decided by the market.
3.
The Member States shall also be able to levy VAT and taxes on services delivered from abroad.
These are three important questions to which I have not received clear answers.
The June Movement is in favour of there being a common market for services too, and we welcome, in particular, workers and companies from the new Member States, but Danish rates of pay must apply.
Competition must not be on the basis of lower pay, more relaxed working conditions or lower rates of VAT and taxes.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nine months after it was adopted at first reading, the European Parliament is tying up the Services Directive, known as the Bolkestein directive, by approving the Council's common position with no amendments.
This is a victory for social democracy, won over to economic ultraliberalism.
With the exception of non-commercial services of general interest, nothing escapes the liberalisation of services: even social services are not completely excluded from the Gebhardt report.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are deceiving the people.
This directive will not put an end to social, fiscal and wage dumping.
Clever, dishonest service providers will continue to exploit national legislation, and to use the weak points in the directive by relying on the sectoral directives.
For example, more than 100 000 construction workers are posted in France on temporary contracts, most of them undeclared.
There is lawful social dumping going on with regard to responsibility, because posted workers remain part of the social security system in their countries of origin.
In such cases, labour law is being flouted legally.
Finally, we are opposed to the mechanisms to assess national restrictions on the cross-border provision of services, as they represent an unacceptable monitoring of the Member States by the Commission, and an excessive level of Community bureaucracy.
That is why we will vote against the Gebhardt report.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have managed to turn a proposal that was far too horizontal in scope, far too radical in its drive to deregulate and unrealistic in its enforcement, into a directive that does exactly what it is supposed to do, namely remove obstacles to businesses that wish to establish abroad and to service providers to enable them to carry out cross-border activities, and thus enable everyone, including SMEs, to avail themselves of their fundamental rights under the Treaty.
Despite the very different starting positions, not only between, but also within, the groups, clearly also between the Member States, and despite many widespread misconceptions about the content and repercussions of the proposal, we managed to produce a balanced and justifiable end product, partly by listening carefully to each other, to the people and by working together in a constructive manner.
Economically and socially, we are providing a better opening of the internal market for the benefit of services, for more growth and for jobs without affecting consumer and other social protection.
Institutionally, we have proved that European democracy works and that Parliament is taking its responsibilities seriously.
Legally, even if the wording leaves something to be desired, we certainly look to add value by affording more legal certainty.
I therefore hope that we will maintain this course when we vote and that we will manage to back the common position by a very broad majority, for it is, after all, a good reflection of the compromise that we ourselves hammered out.
I too should like to express my appreciation for all those who, during the course of those two past few years, have managed to work together, not only those with political responsibility in the three institutions, but also the staff.
Mr President, today, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am immensely proud of the work and commitment of both our rapporteur and the members of the committee in enabling Europe to finally give the go-ahead to open up the market in services.
It was the MEPs and Parliament who found the compromise to save the services law from national deadlock and paralysis in Council.
In the British press, surprisingly, Parliament has been praised for coalescing as 'a serious and effective institution'.
The article goes on to say that the key to the services law's success has been forged here in Strasbourg.
I agree with the journalist who says that it is time to pay more attention to the European Parliament.
I want to thank the Council and the Commission for paying attention to Parliament's right of regulatory scrutiny in the new procedures and accepting our three amendments.
This has been the single most controversial but also the most important piece of legislation in the EU.
Despite our ideological and national differences, we MEPs have managed to find a way to open up the market, to boost jobs and growth and give our citizens the trust and confidence to use and access those services across Europe.
The law has been controversial in cutting red tape and bureaucracy for business, but we need to ensure high quality standards and choice for consumers, while safeguarding employees' conditions and health and safety.
Parliament listened to people's concerns and fears, so that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine consumer or employee rights.
Each Member State must now ensure free access to its territory and it must be equally clear that the right to maintain national rules, to protect public policy, public health, security or the environment, must not mean that legitimate protection turns into negative protectionism.
It must be justifiable and proportionate and must not discriminate against other operators.
Let us look to the future.
The litmus test will be whether we can deliver and open up the market for businesses and give the benefits to our consumers.
We cannot shout about the benefits if we do not deliver.
Our work is not yet done.
We must continue to work together as three institutions to make good on our commitment to deliver.
Certainly I, as Chair of the Internal Market Committee, stand ready to make good on our commitment to assist the Commission and the Council in making sure we respect the rights of consumers and employees and deliver for business across Europe.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached a historical moment, because we in this House, as a political body, have taken a decision of our own about one of the basic freedoms.
We will leave the rest for the European Court of Justice to deal with, because last night, we were anxious - this is with reference to gambling - about tackling the really dirty work.
We will get the judges of the European Court of Justice, who are not elected, to do this instead.
I am pleased that now, at long last, the politicians, the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, have taken a decision about the free movement of services.
I am particularly indebted to Mrs Gebhardt for ensuring that her group has not tabled any amendments.
I have also noticed that the atmosphere, now that the compromise is on the table, has improved a great deal because this issue was the source of much tension.
In my view, however, this is not about the tension between Poland and France, between the Netherlands and the Baltic States or whatever.
This is about Europe, China and India.
We, as Europeans, must therefore, keep the momentum going where the different peoples are involved.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pekkarinen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two comments.
I would like to emphasise the fact that the eight amendments tabled by our group were adopted by Parliament at first reading by an adequate majority, which clearly demonstrates that the Council's common position does not fully reflect Parliament's text.
The second comment I would like to make is this: before we start waxing lyrical about the historic importance of this directive, it would be worth exercising some caution.
I would remind you that this directive will be transposed by all Member States by 2009 at the latest, and that the Commission's initial assessment report will not be presented to the European Parliament until 2010.
That, therefore, is when we will see what impact this text really has in the various Member States, at the end of the assessment procedure laid down in Article 39 of the directive.
I would call on those who are promising us a brighter future and talking about millions of new jobs to be cautious: we must not make the people of Europe promises that we might not be able to keep.
I would like to conclude with a few words on the general philosophy that underlies this proposal: our group supported the free provision of services, and in particular of cross-border services.
At the same time, however, we have always stressed that we must have every guarantee with regard to working conditions and the prohibition of illegal labour, and that these conditions must be respected throughout the territory of the EU.
From this point of view, Mr McCreevy, I welcome your statement, but in political terms it only commits the current Commission - and in 2010, there will be a different Commission.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the word go, the Services Directive has been the project of those wanting to see capitalism without any social safeguards prevail in Europe.
The Directive will goad liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation and also wage and social dumping on an unprecedented scale.
Companies will be pleased, but for the majority of people it will be a disaster.
In spite of all the protests and all the opposition, Parliament is to pass this Directive today, and those who stand to gain from it owe particular thanks to those in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who have done their best to throw dust in people's eyes with lies and deceit.
The compromise due to be adopted today is not one that keeps alive the remains of a social Europe.
It is a neoliberal hammer designed to obliterate all social aspects.
Those who support it have to do so with their eyes open.
We shall continue to oppose this neoliberal onslaught.
. - (LV) It is customary to believe that new laws improve, reinforce and otherwise contribute to the success of the European Union's activities.
Such is not the case with the draft directive to be debated today.
The previous European Commission based the draft directive on the state of origin principle - a principle which the European Court of Justice has developed and which has been consolidated in the case law of international private law.
The current Commission rushed to place the draft directive, based on the state of origin principle, within the principles of European Union strategic documents, including the Lisbon Strategy.
This key to the opening of the European services market, however, broke off in Parliament's hands.
The state of origin principle has disappeared from the directive's text, and the wording of the provisions of its Article 16 resembles the mutual recognition principle - a principle which in practice may prove to be too subjective and unwieldy to open up the services market.
Today the European Parliament will delegate to the Member States full responsibility to decide whether, when and how the European Union's services market will develop.
We can only hope that this will, in fact, occur.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the referendum in France, the UMP swore that the Bolkestein directive had been withdrawn, and the socialists said that it had been consigned to the dustbin of history.
Not only did both parties lie, but they are now making things worse for themselves in at least four respects.
Firstly, there is the country of origin principle.
We are giving free rein to the Court of Justice, which is the inventor of this concept in its judgments in the 'Cassis de Dijon' and 'SÃ€ger' cases.
We can hardly imagine that it is going to sacrifice its own creation.
The second point relates to the protection of employees.
Labour law, which is a national competence, is being made subordinate to compliance with Community law, with no treaty and no ratification.
How far are we prepared to go in substituting commercial law for labour law?
Thirdly, there is the issue of monitoring service providers.
We are putting the Member States in an untenable position by preventing them from exercising any control.
What can they possibly know about the working conditions in a Polish company that they know nothing about?
My fourth point relates to the services covered.
The scope of the directive has once again been extended, and will now affect some 6 000 occupations, and perhaps even more, given how ambiguous the text is.
In conclusion, I think that, in this compromise that was wanted by all 25 Member States, the Court and the Commission are gaining an enormous amount of power to complete the internal market, without worrying about the social dumping that is crushing our workers and will continue to aggravate unemployment.
The people have been deceived on the accession of Turkey and duped on the VAT affair, their rejection of a super-State has been scorned, and now they have been betrayed on the Bolkestein directive.
Quite frankly, how many of us are now able to look the electorate in the eye?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not least in the light of the widespread interests of the system of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those of Padania, we feel that the aims - in relation to the Commission's original project, which was already just as dangerous - of imposing one regulation on all of the Member States of the European Union are still very dangerous, because they lead to cut-throat competition in the services sector, which, let us remember, represents 70% of the GDP produced within the European Union.
It is reasonable to wonder whether, on such a sensitive issue as this, the remarks made by civil society have really been heard and taken on board, and whether the dangers of social and economic dumping have actually been eliminated from this new, sugar-coated version of the Bolkestein Directive.
Unfortunately, everywhere you look these days, unscrupulous entrepreneurs are competing unfairly, to the detriment of the system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which, unlike these entrepreneurs, work fully within the law.
This is the outcome of liberalisation, which both the Commission and the European Court of Justice wanted.
We are against this bureaucratic centralism of the European Union.
(HU) Mr President, along with many other MEPs from the new Member States, I did not vote for the Services Directive at first reading last year.
At this vote, however, I will support it.
At that time, I did not support it because I wished to send a warning that in the newly unified Europe it is not permissible to disregard the interests of new Member States when passing important new legislation.
That warning has served its purpose.
Indeed, that is what helped Council to make progress for instance in the much-debated areas of criminal and labour law that hampered free provision of services.
I should like to underline that the new text requires each Member State to review those of its current statutes that prevent the free provision of services.
All these are steps in the right direction.
In the proceedings since the first reading, the involvement of the new Member States and of MEPs was more actively sought.
I am confident that the end of the often difficult and bitter debate about the Services Directive will help the Union leave behind that period of crisis, add new impetus to the internal market and give a chance to small and medium-sized enterprises to create more jobs and contribute to the faster economic growth of the Union.
Yet we also need to learn from this process.
We have to work harder to restore the trust between old and new Member States.
To that end, there must be a stop to the scaremongering that the new members' cheaper labour and services will threaten the social model of the older ones.
This is unfounded, and is a betrayal of the principle of free competition that forms the basis of the Union's economy.
The new members opened their markets for goods and capital long ago, and that was not always easy to do.
Now it is the turn of the old members to open their markets to services.
The Service Directive that is about to be born is a step forward.
We would have preferred to take a bigger step, but everyone gave up something.
Now the Services Directive has to meet the tests of practicality and of the European Court of Justice.
I wish it a lot of success in both.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the hard work and determination of our rapporteur Mrs Gebhardt, and thanks to the mobilisation of the European trades union movement, at first reading Parliament removed the main dangers from the initial version of the Services Directive, the version put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein.
In particular, Parliament managed to remove from the directive all social services, including social housing, healthcare, audiovisual services, transport and temporary employment agencies.
Likewise, the directive on the posting of workers and labour law could not be affected, thus removing the main dangers of social dumping, and the country of origin principle was also deleted.
Nevertheless, two major problems remained: firstly, not all services of general economic interest were removed from the scope, due to opposition from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; secondly, the new version of Article 16, whilst removing the country of origin principle, was not clear in establishing the country of destination principle.
These problems have not been solved in the Council's common position, which, although it has indeed incorporated the essence of the conclusions from Parliament's first reading, has taken a backward step on several other points, in particular social services and labour law, as the European Trade Union Confederation has underlined.
Everyone has acknowledged the need for clarification of these points, and of others, such as the effects on criminal law, the direction taken by the Commission's guidelines and the need for future harmonisation, and you have made a statement to that effect, Commissioner.
It would, however, have been more logical, given that the codecision procedure has not been completed, to adopt amendments to clarify these elements within the articles themselves.
Unfortunately, I note that the PPE has neutralised the second reading by rejecting all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur during the debate in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
In a way, this group has deprived the European Parliament of its right of amendment, and I find that deplorable.
The French Socialist delegation has therefore tabled a number of amendments, because it feels that the compromise is not satisfactory in its current state, and that it leaves the door open to too many uncertainties with regard to the Court's interpretation.
I think that, when it comes to distinguishing between liberalisation, on the one hand, and social and fundamental rights, on the other, the role of the legislature is to clarify, and not to leave the door open for case-law.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago the founding fathers were already considering the possibility of having the freedom to provide services throughout Europe, in order to create the internal market.
In the service sector, which makes up a major proportion not only of our economy, but also of our employment and our competitiveness, a revamping and revision were not only logical, but essential.
I should like to make two comments. The first is political in nature, and is that the Bolkestein proposal, which was presented by an old Commissioner to an old Parliament, was unacceptable, and many of us here fought against it.
Today, following the huge amount of work that has been achieved, we are a very long way away from the Bolkestein proposal.
My second comment relates to the background: this text reaffirms the principle of the free movement of services, whilst maintaining the prospect of further harmonisation within the Union.
I am delighted that the current draft incorporates 90% of Parliament's requirements, by excluding from its scope non-economic services of general interest, certain social services and healthcare services.
To conclude, I would like to stress that the examination of this text has been an excellent example of the democratic exercise of Parliament's powers and has allowed it - whatever the view of the extreme right and left of the House may be - to demonstrate its maturity.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Parliament has done a huge amount of work on this directive and that this text bears very little relation to the directive proposed by the Commission two years ago.
However, as we have just heard in this House, the fact that the European Council changed a number of important sentences after first reading means that the second reading does not go far enough, which is a pity.
Thus employees, our fellow citizens and consumers no longer really see the need for a directive on services.
It is difficult for them to understand today that liberalisation is taking place without there being anything precise on social services and health services.
There is still too much vagueness, too many grey areas, in this compromise proposed by the Commission and the European Council.
(NL) Mr President, Parliament is about to vote on the European Services Directive, probably for the last time.
It seems like a fait accompli because the largest groups have already given me to believe that they intend to support the compromise and not table any amendments.
They seem to think the directive in its current form is so perfect that they are prepared to waive their democratic right to submit proposals for improvement.
My group is less enthusiastic.
The Services Directive continues to form a threat to the quality of the services and the achievements of workers across Europe.
The text remains unclear and open to different interpretations.
In addition, improvements made at previous reading are now at risk of being undermined by, for example, the fact that the Posting of Workers Directive is being cut down to the bone.
For this reason, my group will be voting against the Gebhardt report.
Mr President, I have been told by some people that this is one directive that UKIP can vote for. It is about free markets.
It is about helping small companies trade across national boundaries. It is going to be good for business.
Well, we have been here before, haven't we?
Because we joined a common market that led to a single market, and what has the result of all that been?
Well, it has been regulation, cost and missed opportunities overseas.
Just last month, there was a poll of a thousand British businesses.
Sixty per cent of them said that they want the UK to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union to a simple free trade agreement and no more than that.
But this was not just a cry from a few Poujadists.
I will quote Michael Spencer, the Chief Executive of ICAP and recently voted the most powerful man in the City of London, who said that people in business are fed up with the volume of costly regulation the EU is producing.
In the City, people are becoming more and more sceptical about the value we are getting from it all.
It is clear that British business now recognises that the cost of directive upon directive upon directive produced by institutions like this is now having a negative effect.
The single market is not fit for the 21st century global economy and I believe that it will be British business that leads us out of it.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, if this directive on services is adopted in its current form, which is a poor compromise, we might cynically observe that we have at least partially complied with the Treaty of Rome.
Given that the Treaty was signed almost 50 years ago, this is a rather meagre result.
It is an indictment of politicians that, in the discussions on the directive, fear of international competition and fear over what are referred to as social standards prevailed over visions of a Union prospering from the free movement of people and services.
It is also an indictment of politicians that they have forgotten that competition is one of the instruments of economic development and that social standards are the fruits, and not the seeds, of prosperity.
I firmly believe that by removing one of the pillars of the directive, the country of origin principle, a populist and indeed cowardly move, we have thrown away any chance of decisively improving the citizens' standard of living.
We have thrown away the chances of improving the provision of services, of cutting prices and of creating new jobs.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will, on this occasion, be devoted to a short assessment and a few tributes.
The European Parliament has joined forces in order to draw up the directive on the internal market in services.
It bears its hallmark.
This is a victory for the European Parliament, a victory over European moroseness, a victory over fixed ideas, a victory for the European model, which is all about balance: the balance between necessary reforms and the preservation of the acquis that bring us together.
The directive actually opens up the internal market in services and makes it compulsory for the Member States to do away with any obstacles to the free provision of services.
This is a major prospect in terms of growth and employment for all.
At the same time, the directive preserves existing Community laws, does not permit any breach of social rights, rules out the liberalisation of public services and takes account of the public interest.
This compromise - as I can testify, insofar as I have followed its development since summer 2004 - stems from the proposals made by my political group and from the agreements concluded within the group between what, at the outset, were differing national and ideological positions.
The statement that Mr SzÃ¡jer made just now testifies to this.
This directive has its origins in dialogue, which is the very substance of our parliamentary life.
That is why I should like to begin by thanking not only our principal overseer, Mr Harbour, but also Mrs Thyssen, with whom I worked hand in hand, Mr Karas, Mr SzÃ¡jer and Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Gebhardt, who has mastered the matter from start to finish and who has been so kind as to take me, the inexperienced MEP that I am, into consideration, and Mrs McCarthy and Mr Whitehead, whom I should certainly not like to forget.
Outside Parliament, my thanks go to Mr McCreevy, who has fulfilled his promises to Parliament since the start, and also to Mr Bartenstein, who has played a decisive role.
I did nonetheless hear some incredible remarks made just now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is better to let well alone.
The common position represents 95% of our text.
Mr President, would we really be exercising our power if we entered into a conciliation procedure, which we know will result in our having no directive?
The role of Parliament, our right, is, on the contrary, to shoulder our responsibilities.
That is why the French members of the UMP are going to vote in favour of the common position, by choosing what is truly important.
(FI) Mr President, two years ago I voiced my concern in this House that in some countries the debate on the Services Directive has also brought to the surface feelings of xenophobia and a call for economic protectionism, neither of which are a credit to this Community.
The Prime Minister of Luxembourg recently wondered why we are now more afraid of people coming from the east than of the missiles that were in position there 20 years ago.
We have nevertheless achieved a compromise, through discussion, and one with which we can live, since this directive will finally open up the market in services, albeit only partially.
This directive appears to protect highly educated professionals and exposes less well educated professional groups to competition.
Doctors and pharmacists remain outside its scope, but carpenters and hairdressers are included in it.
Fear and prejudice, however, will be dispelled with time, because practice will eventually overcome theory.
Furthermore, in the future the directive will obviously be made more workable and open as far as all the citizens of Europe are concerned.
We need to learn that we on this continent cannot successfully compete with other continents if we do not even have the courage to compete amongst ourselves.
- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to welcome Mrs Gebhardt, who has drafted this elaborate document.
Some of us have proclaimed it a great achievement that we were able to reach a compromise.
I partially agree with this.
Nevertheless, I think that our objective has yet to be achieved.
Our objective is to liberate the market, since its potential is crucial to the economic growth of the Community and to job creation.
Today it is stagnant.
The proposed directive may boost the emergence of new services by laying the legal foundations.
The good thing is that the directive's second part clearly defines the actions that may not be directed against service providers.
However, I do not agree with the decision to reduce the type of activities list to such a great extent, as the target countries are still given the opportunity to create barriers to service provision.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberation of the services market presents an opportunity for choice.
Therefore, we must ensure that high-quality services at competitive prices are available throughout the Community.
The Services Directive should guarantee that.
However, this one does not yet do that.
Mr President, I recognise that this compromise is something of an improvement on the Commission's original proposal.
I also recognise that it is necessary and desirable to remove the remaining barriers to the cross-border provision of commercial services.
However, I believe that we should, in the process, provide legal certainty - and I mean 'certainty' - to providers of essential public services and, more importantly, provide reassurances to the many citizens who depend strongly upon locally-provided social services.
Verbal assurances given in good faith, I fully accept, are not what will be used by judges in the event of court challenges in the future.
It is the text of a directive that will be important.
That is why I have signed a number of amendments, such as Amendment 31, which make it absolutely clear that it would be Member States who define services of general interest in their territory.
I would ask colleagues to accept that this is a reasonable amendment and should be adopted, amongst others.
Mr President, I believe that the Services Directive is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will adopt in this Parliament.
I should like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy, Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour for all their work. It is definitely a step in the right direction.
The directive will make Europe more competitive and thereby create jobs and give better value to its citizens.
People are saying that we are pulling the wool over the eyes of our citizens.
On the contrary: if we do not make changes in our economy, as we are doing today, then we really will be pulling the wool over the eyes of our citizens.
Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that we are living in a globalised world and Europe must become more competitive if it is to compete on a global scale.
About 50% of all world trade is now in emerging economies and if we want to compete with them and hold on to the European social model, we need a vibrant economy to invest in the sort of services that we feel are important for the citizens of Europe.
This directive is a step in the right direction; it is the sort of reform we must make at a European level if we want to hold on to the values that we believe are right for our citizens.
I very much welcome this directive.
(SV) Mr President, the Council's common position is a victory for reason.
Competition within the services sector will be intensified, at the same time as the national independence of the Member States is respected.
That is a good compromise.
The June List is opposed to national protectionism, bureaucracy and the remnants of the guild system in Europe.
Such restrictions impede competition, development and growth within the services sector.
The June List welcomes the fact that the Council, in common with Parliament, chose to reject the country of origin principle.
It would certainly have facilitated increased competition within some services sectors, but the disadvantages were out of all proportion.
The country of origin principle would have forced the Member States to give up national self-determination in some of the most important areas of social life.
It is self-evident that the laws, rules and traditions that apply within a country have come about through a due democratic process and must be observed by all who operate in its territory.
The June List welcomes, then, the Council's common position on the Services Directive.
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year began with demonstrations against the Directive, and is ending with a triumph for parliamentarianism.
We have not stood in each other's way, we have not allowed ourselves to be used; instead, most of us have surpassed ourselves and taken on responsibility for the European public.
This European law is a triumph for Parliament and for dialogue, and should encourage all parliaments.
We are legislators, not governments.
We have shown leadership and cut the Gordian knot.
Long may this continue.
Freedom to provide services is a fundamental right; today's decision represents an important step in dealing with this freedom.
This decision has also dispelled many prejudices about the EU.
First of all, the Directive is a triumph for the European system of social market economy, in which the market is not played off against social security.
We must realise the four freedoms consistently but, equally, we should involve the public to an increasing degree.
Secondly, we have held dialogue with the social partners.
We have made ourselves part of the negotiations in the Council.
In this connection, I am obliged to Minister Bartenstein and Chancellor SchÃŒssel for taking our side.
This has enabled us to achieve more market, a stronger internal market, and also growth and employment, and to ensure social security.
I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, however, especially those who refused from the outset to support efforts to achieve a qualified majority at first reading, because a compromise is always harder to champion than an individual position.
We have simplified many things, provided legal certainty and presented a model of parliamentary work to the public.
(Applause from the right)
(ES) Mr President, I think the speeches so far have made the position quite clear: a large majority of this Parliament is going to vote in favour of the text adopted, and there is therefore no reason to fear that the proposal for a directive will be rejected.
It will not therefore be necessary to go to a conciliation procedure.
This is thanks not only to the great work by Mrs Gebhardt, but also to the great work by Commissioner McCreevy.
I would like to congratulate both of them very warmly.
I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for his statement on behalf of the Commission on the exceptions for employment, social and criminal law, which, as he has said, were necessary because they are laid down in Union law, but which also clarify the situation.
Despite what some sceptics have said, this represents great progress.
For example, we cannot say, as some Members have done, that we cannot look to our electors. On the contrary.
On the contrary, my electors are delighted that Parliament has played this role at this time.
Neither can we criticise the excess of legislation.
Without legislation, society cannot be organised.
Those of us with knowledge of what is happening in the developing world, for example - where countries have no legislation - know that legislation is necessary.
Through the legislation that we have adopted, Parliament, the Commission and the Council are going to provide European society with a system of freedom, in the provision of services, which, at the same time, is going to safeguard the high level of working, social and also environmental conditions that we have at the moment.
I believe that the three institutions have made a great effort.
The amendments that are going to be approved in the field of comitology were necessary.
I am also delighted that both the Commission and the Council have taken them up, and we hope that the subsequent development of this Directive, by means of the comitology procedures and by agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will enable it to be fine-tuned and improved and enable any difficulties that it may present to be cleared up.
In conclusion, Mr President, I believe that this is a great day for the European Parliament, for the Council, for the Commission and for all of the citizens of the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, the leap taken today by the Brussels grand coalition, largely excluding its members in the new Member States, went nowhere near far enough.
It was in the right direction, but simply fell short.
It is true that the establishment of one-stop shops will help to concentrate administrative formalities, at least.
Another improvement is that small or medium-sized enterprises can no longer be forced to maintain a permanent establishment in another Member State.
When we celebrate in 2006 the fact that restrictions on foreign service providers have to be justified and national measures against them proportional, however, we are actually celebrating the achievement of something that should have been taken for granted by 1994 at the latest.
We have forgotten along the way where and why we started work on the Services Directive - we were aiming to kindle palpable momentum for growth and thus provide real momentum for employment.
The failure follows a familiar pattern.
Alliances of employers and inter-branch organisations rail against change, against competition and market opening.
In a way scarcely seen in any other debate, risks have been exaggerated out of all proportion and opportunities played down.
The organised scaremongering about Eastern European workers has done its worst, and the losers are the unemployed throughout Europe.
Even the Commission has to ask itself why it lacked the courage to defend its protÃ©gÃ© against the attacks by demagogues.
It is now called upon to follow implementation in the Member States attentively, so that new burdens are not imposed on SMEs, in particular, through the national back door.
- (SK) The directive we have in front of us now only contains a fraction of the original text, as almost all areas, including the main principle of country of origin, have been deleted.
We have cut out medical and social services and services of general interest, as well as all references to the temporary posting of workers.
These are to be addressed separately on a sectoral basis.
However, the question remains as to when and if at all.
An empty directive may do no harm, but at the same time it can do no good.
This directive, I would say, is completely useless and does not resolve anything in its current watered-down form.
The country-of-origin principle means that a small business from Bratislava may apply Slovak law when serving a customer in Vienna.
However, the host Member State will insist on the application of its own legislation if, for example, it is in the interests of public policy, public safety, health protection, environmental protection, etc. This wording of the directive leaves the application of the original principle to the discretion of officials.
It has been proven that the old Member States benefit from cheap and high-quality labour from the ten new Member States, and our nurses, au-pairs or IT experts have proved their worth.
However, they are afraid that a nurse providing her services as a small business would generate too much competition and are disguising ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not repeat one by one the thanks Mr Toubon expressed to all MEPs, but they echo my sentiments.
I believe, as Mr Karas said, that we have seen a great convergence of the positions of all MEPs, and that MEPs have played a positive part in helping to allay the fears on the part of the countries of origin.
The fact that they have been allayed is at least partly attributable to the opening up of a path towards the completion of the internal market for services.
These negotiations, on which Parliament exerted particular influence, also demanded a great deal of our staff and, as has already been pointed out, Parliament showed itself to be influential and a driving force, but at the same time conciliatory as an institution.
Mr Harbour, our shadow rapporteur, described this as a good day for European citizens.
It only remains to say that the path of reality that this Framework Directive brings to European citizens has yet to be trodden, and the Member States must tread it carefully and constructively, as the Directive lays only the foundations for the future completion of the European internal market for services.
The country of origin principle has become the principle of freedom to provide services.
The internal market must be completed but, as the Bruegel institute recently made clear, it also needs to be highlighted even more strongly by Member States, civil society actors, and even the Commission and Parliament, including for the purposes of public understanding.
This represents another great challenge for us.
Personally, I consider the criticism levelled by some respected Members of this House that too many tasks would be transferred to the European Court of Justice in the course of the follow-up to be rather petty as, in any case, the main responsibility under a framework directive remains with the Member States.
I address to the Minister, as Council representative, my appeal for the Council to face up to this main responsibility, in particular.
(HU) Mr President, it is good to be a member of the European Parliament today.
It is good, because we can report great results.
It is a great achievement that after the logjam of the Constitution, and before the closing of the fifth phase of EU enlargement, we will have succeeded in creating the free movement of services, likely with a huge majority.
Do you remember?
A year and a half ago, the case of the Polish plumber was the embodiment of a xenophobia that is condemnable in all its forms.
A year and a half ago, we saw no hope for an agreement between employer and worker, between old and new Member States, between left and right.
It is an enormous achievement that today MEPs are categorically rejecting discrimination.
Today discrimination between old and new Member States is gone.
It is an enormous achievement that we are creating new opportunities for all 476 million inhabitants of the Union.
It is an enormous achievement that we are creating a legal opportunity for those who at present are compelled to work in the black-market economy.
And it is a great achievement that workers with rightful grievances have another option than lawsuits that go on for many years before the European Court of Justice in Luxemburg to validate their rights.
It is an enormous achievement that employers and employees, small and medium-sized enterprises, big businesses as well as consumers will benefit, and come closer to meeting the Lisbon objectives set by us all.
It is a considerable achievement that Parliament has succeeded in formulating the political message of the Directive, and similarly, that between the two readings many have decided to switch to supporting the proposal after all.
If Member States transpose the law properly, ten years from now we will be able to look back with pride and say that we did what our country and what Europe demanded.
Thank you for your attention, and congratulations to all participants for their contribution.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is impossible to say everything that needs to be said in the space of a minute, so I shall select what is possible.
Firstly, I am convinced that the adoption of this directive in its current form can help Europe.
The directive helps to get rid of the dead wood and to overcome obstacles and barriers that have hindered unification of the services market and the initiative of professional service companies, both inside and outside national borders.
At the same time, however, the directive provides guarantees and enhances the prospect of a structured, Europe-wide market, where freedom of movement is possible not only for competition, crushed as it is by cost competition and the risk of social dumping, but also for good rules and practices, which are aimed at safeguarding inalienable principles and interests, such as those relating to the guarantee of universal services, of general interests - including in areas of economic importance - of business quality objectives, of environmental protection, of safety and of basic social safeguards.
To conclude, Mr President, I hope that, in future, we will have not just more Europe, but a better Europe.
(PL) Mr President, let us be honest and say that the Bolkestein Directive was better, as it truly opened up the services market, and that the objections expressed in this House run contrary to the spirit of solidarity in the European Union.
However, this very difficult compromise clearly is of some value, and is better than having no directive at all.
That is a fact.
Are there any causes for concern?
Well, to call a spade a spade, the large number of exceptions are a problem.
I would hesitate to call this a success, and would also refrain from saying that this is a historic moment.
Let us wait to see what happens in practice.
These exceptions may create a situation where the ubiquitous Polish plumber becomes an unwelcome guest.
To conclude, the Devil is not as black as he is painted, and the Polish plumber is not as terrible as has been suggested, even by some Members of this House.
(PL) Mr President, the Services Directive is not simply a legislative document about services.
It is not simply a step towards liberalising services making life far easier for European service providers.
The services directive is, first and foremost, proof.
Or proof to all Europeans that we can work in common in a united Europe, and that this brings notable benefits for the average citizen.
It is proof that together, we can achieve important things in the European Union and that, based on our combined experience, it is possible to achieve a widely accepted compromise.
Work on the Directive has proved that we can overcome divisions along national, party and historical lines and draft a balanced legislative document for the 450 million-strong consumer market which serves the interests of both service providers and consumers.
I am satisfied with the current proposal for a compromise, although I had expected a greater degree of openness and I had expected the country of origin principle to be retained.
Many people criticise the Directive for being too liberal, too social.
However, in my opinion, thanks to the hundreds of hours of work that went into it and the involvement of many people, the Directive has become a compromise legislative document for a united Europe where, whilst opening up and liberalising the services market, we are also ensuring that consumers and service providers obtain an adequate level of protection.
In the Member States, including Poland, the Directive provides much hope for better job opportunities, which is something that many service providers and consumers have been eagerly waiting for.
I am convinced that, as representatives of the citizens of Europe, we have done our duty and we can today vote in favour of the Directive with a clear conscience.
It is an important step towards the integration of the single market, although a lot of work remains to be done in order to open it up completely.
It is also a milestone which implements the principles set out in the Treaty of Rome, which we have not managed to implement any sooner, and whose 50th anniversary we will be celebrating next year.
Work on the Services Directive has been particularly important for the new Member States.
During the first reading, we saw many examples of national selfishness, protectionism and opportunism, but we were also able to work out a common denominator that serves the interests of all the European Member States.
(NL) Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that I wish, first of all, to extend warm thanks to Mrs Gebhardt and all those of my fellow Members with whom I have worked on this directive for so many months, because thanks to this cooperation, and thanks also, of course, to the mobilisation by the trade unions and NGOs, we now have before us a Services Directive in which labour law, collective labour agreements, social rights and consumer rights are fully respected.
We should be pleased with this outcome.
I am also pleased that quite a number of sensitive areas, namely social services, health services and temping agencies, do not fall within the scope of this directive because they, of course, need stricter rules if they are not simply to be at the mercy of the free provision of services.
I am grateful for the fact that Parliament has closely followed the Council's common position in this.
Those Members who have said that there are a number of ambiguities in the Council's common position are, of course, right, Mr President-in-Office, and along with a few fellow Members, I would have wanted to eliminate these by means of a number of amendments.
I still believe that our job as legislator is about producing clear, intelligible legal texts that are not open to interpretation.
The content of these texts, seeing as it touches upon subjects such as the autonomy of labour law and the definition of excluded social services, is not unimportant, and I share the rapporteur's sense of regret that there was no willingness at all on the part of the Council to put this right with amendments.
Whilst I do believe that the legal meaning of the Commission's interpretation is limited, I am very grateful to the Commission for its interpretation nevertheless, because I think, Commissioner, that the interpretation has a very strong political meaning - one of commitment by the Commission, about which my fellow Members and I are sure to remind this Commission and its successors.
It is up to us, therefore, to provide more legal certainty for social and health services in future legislation.
(NL) Mr President, some people have called this a birthday present to mark the Union's fiftieth anniversary.
If I were to get that sort of present from my friends, then I think I would look for new friends.
Whilst I do not want to take anything away from all the work that has been done, I have voted against for the first time, and I am afraid that I now cannot support the compromise either.
Unfortunately, feelings of fear, conservatism and protectionism have pervaded the whole of this debate.
This compromise adds little to what is already enshrined in the Treaty.
This may, in itself, not be a good enough reason to vote against, but what is is the fact that this directive appears to create grounds of justification for exempting public services from the rules of fair competition.
I find this a very dangerous precedent and moreover - legal clarity was mentioned a moment ago - the definitions used are remarkable for their legal ambiguity.
The reason why I see this debate as being pervaded by hypocrisy is that when Western Europe bought the Eastern European businesses in the early 90s, there was no discussion whatsoever.
Mr President, this is an incredible missed opportunity for Europe.
(EL) Mr President, the directive we are debating today is a success for Europe, a success for development and a success for the workers.
It is very important that, after a very long period of debate, the right balance has been struck and thus we have, on the one hand, the opening of the services market and the facilitation of investments by eliminating bureaucratic, legal and technical obstacles and, on the other hand, full respect for workers' rights - as the European trades union accepted in February - and, at the same time of course, exemptions for certain particular sectors.
The OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says in one of its reports that 2.5 million new jobs which will be created thanks to this directive.
It would be a pity, while safeguarding workers' rights, not to take advantage of this opportunity.
We would be failing in our duty towards the citizens, especially the workers.
The Commission's initial proposal gave rise to objections and misunderstandings.
It is particularly positive that this procedure is closing with very broad agreement in the European Union.
We have unanimity in the Council and we have an overwhelming majority of members in the European Parliament who support the Council's common position.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the liberals and the socialists have together all arrived at a common approach and this proves that Europe can still dialogue, compose and arrive at solutions needed for the citizens, specially for the most financially and socially weak.
I think that we should all be very satisfied that the European Parliament had a particularly important role in this successful procedure.
(MT) Why has the discussion about this directive turned out to be successful?
For two reasons, I would say.
Firstly, we have not treated workers like numbers; rather, we have placed workers' and other people's rights above all other considerations.
The second reason is that we have removed obstacles to the movement of persons not by playing workers off against each other, but by attempting to make use of this freedom of movement to enhance workers' rights.
We have not made it easier to offer services on the worst possible conditions, nor have we encouraged workers to do so.
This vote should send out a strong signal that there should no longer be any exploitation, nor any attempt to exploit foreign workers by offering poorer conditions.
Nor should workers in a particular country be pressurised, through this stratagem, into accepting poorer conditions.
Moreover, workers should be given full information about conditions being offered to other workers.
I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Harbour and also Commissioner McCreevy for the excellent work that has been done.
(DA) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor.
At last, the preparation of the services directive is coming to an end.
At last we can let out a sigh of relief after more than 12 years of fun and frolics and at last we can look forward to an internal market in services, which may be one that has had a limb cut off, but it is better than nothing.
I would like to use my brief speaking time to put the spotlight on the problems involved in having an amputee of a directive.
Gaming was removed from the scope of the directive.
What happens, however?
The Commission, with Mr McCreevy at the fore, is in the process of investigating the pools monopolies of no less than 10 Member States.
Health services were likewise excluded from the scope of the directive, yet less than a month ago the Commission put forward an ambitious plan relating to patient mobility.
In other words, the consequences of having a watered down directive are that we get legislation in dribs and drabs rather than getting clear and precise rules relating to services for all the industries and areas of the EU.
I find this vexatious, but I will nonetheless vote 'yes' today, because if you cannot get what you want you must want what you get.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, under the moniker of Bolkestein, or should that be Frankenstein, even the European trade unions protested against the original proposal for a directive inherited from the Prodi Commission.
Now, after more than two and a half years of negotiating and searching for a compromise, I can raise my hand in favour of the proposal before us, and I am a former trade unionist.
Mrs Gebhardt, and those who contributed to achieving the final outcome, must take great credit for the fact that an acceptable directive has emerged from the original mess.
I should like to say that while I am not satisfied, it could have been worse.
I am pleased to observe, however, that with everyone's good will, this directive will be a success.
The proposal that we have adopted is not without its faults but in life - and especially so in political life - one cannot have everything.
My gratitude for the outcome goes to the European Parliament.
To many dissatisfied Czechs this may seem like window dressing, yet I remain optimistic.
- (LT) I believe that today Parliament will demonstrate its maturity in moving the Lisbon reforms forward.
Mrs Gebhardt and Parliament have already done a great deal of work on this Directive since its first reading.
We still remember assertions in the press that the whole Directive had been turned upside down.
Sad, but true.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the Council have shown their respect for Parliament and, therefore, today we have a text which represents the opinion of more than 90% of its Members.
We must ensure feedback.
We are the ones responsible to European citizens for the reliability of common decisions and preservation of a true European compromise.
Parliament will set a good precedent and give a sign of welcome to European businesses and consumers.
I urge all Members to approve the directive by a 70% vote; it is time to liberate the potential of the sector, which ensures our wellbeing, from a bureaucratic grip and take a firm, even if a small, step forward.
(PL) Mr President, today, after two years of difficult negotiations the Services Directive will be finally adopted by the European Parliament.
It is a good day, not only for the Polish plumber, but also for European consumers and enterprises.
The service sector accounts for 70% of the European economy.
That is why it is so vital to open it up to competition and to give companies the opportunity to freely source and provide services throughout the whole of Europe.
Of course, the compromise reached is by no means ideal and does not meet all of our expectations.
During the discussion, there were many misunderstandings and ideological disagreements, there was too much propaganda on the subject of social dumping and too little thought was given to the interest of Europe as a whole.
Rational fear of competition from other Member States has also meant that rational arguments and elements of economic logic were not given sufficient consideration.
Meanwhile, the liberalisation of the services market will result in growth in GDP of all the Member States and is a powerful stimulus for the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
Although the draft Directive debated today is not perfect, it is an important step forward and I call for it to be adopted without amendment.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Europe is to support growth and employment, it needs to expand the market and eliminate the excessive bureaucratic red tape that exists in this sector.
However, this must not prejudice workers' rights or lead to exploitation or social dumping.
Despite the fact that, after a hard-fought parliamentary battle, a series of socially important services have been excluded from the original directive, the text on which we are about to vote remains ambiguous and still does not clearly set the boundary between this directive and labour law and national social safeguards.
Despite this morning's reassurances, it is for these reasons that we call for the directive, when it is actually implemented, to respect national conciliation practices and not to bypass sector-wide collective agreements.
Above all, we call for the application of the directive to be strictly monitored, so that the rules protecting employee and consumer rights and health and safety at work are not breached.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, back in the last parliamentary term and part of this one, I worked on other directives and initiatives regarding the implementation of the internal market, alongside Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour.
It is only right that I formally congratulate Mrs Gebhardt this morning, because, in addition to the Supplies and Services Directive, we also worked together on the Professional Qualifications Directive during the last parliamentary term.
The directive in question, which, as has been pointed out, is a fundamental part of the implementation provided for by the treaties on the internal market, is also, in the end, the outcome of other legislative activities that we have carried out with Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour.
This fundamentally important directive will certainly bear the name of Mrs Gebhardt, whom I should like to congratulate on the skill with which she has managed, not now but back at the stage of first reading, to bring the directive in question to a successful conclusion in such an important sector as this.
I am not sure whether it is clear to everyone that the legislation that we are adopting is aimed at harmonising the national systems and not at imposing itself on them: this is a concept that, in my view, should be clear to everyone.
While we prepare to take another step on the road to completing the internal market, it must be acknowledged and clearly pointed out once again - having heard a name that no longer exists still floating about in this Chamber - that, in comparison with the national self-interests represented by the Council and with the other kinds of self-interest represented by the Commission, the European Parliament is the institution that succeeds in resolving highly significant issues.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority in the European Parliament considers that the Bolkenstein directive has not existed since last February.
The initial proposal has in fact been improved and some of its dangerous provisions have been abolished.
This was done after a hard battle by the socialists and the left.
The neoliberal spirit, however, remains in the Council's common position, in that crucial issues about European workers' rights are not clarified.
In addition, services of general economic interest are not exempted from the scope and, in the article at issue about the principle of the country of origin, the principle of ambiguity prevails.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities will be called upon to plug the loopholes by creating, as it has done in other sectors, liberal case law which favours undertakings on the pretext of completing the internal market.
We tabled amendments together with the French and Belgian socialists and we shall support any which can further improve the text.
However, over and above the texts themselves, which are governed by this deliberate ambiguity, there is reality and this reality is determined by unemployed, poor, disillusioned workers.
Do not ignore them or, at the very least, do not make fun of them.
(SV) Mr President, a major step in terms of principle is being taken in the European Parliament today.
As I see it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are perhaps those who have been best able to keep the compromise alive.
I wish to extend a special thank you not only to Mr Harbour, who I think has made a major contribution, but also, of course, to Mrs Gebhardt.
The European Parliament has conjured broad support out of a political conflict.
The Services Directive is desired by many.
I would point out how very strongly the right of establishment features in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Sweden's new government is now trying to simplify the rules in the labour market and make it more profitable to work.
Additional impetus is now being given to these efforts by this directive, which makes European markets more accessible.
Companies will now encounter fewer obstacles in one of the world's largest markets with great opportunities for growth.
According to some estimates, some 600 000 new jobs will be created.
For the Swedish labour market, with 70% of jobs in the services sector, this means big improvements.
What, however, the Services Directive provides is a basis. It is a first step, and not the last.
Certainly, much more might be wished for, but I believe that the other steps will also be taken when the time is ripe.
The unduly large number of excluded areas - for example, health - are, of course, still covered by the rules of the Treaty, something of which the Commissioner too is, fortunately, aware.
The work in this area continues, then.
I would thank everyone who has contributed.
I would also thank the Commission for its efforts to improve matters for companies and consumers - efforts that will hopefully benefit people by leading to better quality at lower prices in the case of certain services.
Mr President, today is a good day for the European Union.
The process to reach an agreement on the Services Directive has not been an easy one.
While no political group in Parliament has got exactly what it wants, we have managed to reach a workable compromise acceptable to the vast majority of Members.
Most importantly, this Parliament is sending a strong signal today to the Commission and Council to move forward and make this directive a reality as soon as is practically possible.
For that reason my group has taken the approach not to amend the directive at this stage, in recognition of the fact that it would not be helpful to reopen the debate in Parliament or Council.
The implementation of the Services Directive will give the sluggish EU economy a much needed kick-start at this stage.
The services area is crucial to Europe's economic growth and prosperity, contributing nearly 70% of GDP across Europe.
Businesses and consumers alike should benefit from the creation of a more open common market for services.
At the moment services account for only 20% of trade between Member States.
The directive aims to remove many of the barriers to cross-border trade and services and to reduce the red tape that businesses, especially small to medium-sized enterprises, encounter when they try to expand across borders into new EU markets.
Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises with the capacity to grow have been particularly disadvantaged by the costs attached to administration and legal requirements in the past.
They can look forward to the benefits of this directive, which dramatically reduces that burden for future cross-border trade.
This directive is of huge importance to my own country because it is a net exporter or goods and services.
Irish companies and service providers will now, I hope, take advantage of the simplified environment for providing services across the European Union.
The Services Directive will facilitate growth, job creation and increased economic activity in the services sector across the EU, while ensuring social and worker protection.
As Parliament's last speaker in this debate, I wish the Commissioner well in ensuring that this directive becomes a reality without delay.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would briefly like to thank you for a very interesting and constructive debate.
The European Union's common goal is to improve our economy in terms of its productivity and competitiveness, and to increase employment.
The establishment of a more viable internal market in services is very important if we are to attain these goals.
I would like to thank you all.
I eagerly await the forthcoming vote.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 a.m.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
(PT) As far as UNICE (the European employers' association) is concerned, the agreement reached in the Council on the Bolkestein Directive is an 'important' and 'promising' step forward.
The Directive must therefore be 'correctly and quickly transposed and implemented' so that UNICE and its national Members - in Portugal, the Portuguese Industrial Association (AIP) and the Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) - 'will contribute actively'.
So say the representatives of the major economic and financial groups.
They see this 'step' as a fresh opportunity to exploit the workers and for economic domination.
The Directive will serve to undermine the national sovereignty of Member States as regards defining, protecting and funding public services and as regards defining standards on how services as a whole should be provided.
It will also strengthen the power of supranational bodies such as the Commission and the Court of Justice over the Member States.
The accent will be placed on competition, which will have disastrous consequences for workers' rights and for the services provided to the people.
This is an unacceptable proposal, which must be rejected.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the role of the social democrats (the Socialist Group in the European Parliament), who, by means of their 'tactical' chicanery, helped to water down the objectives and the scope of the proposed directive before us.
They originally proposed the directive, made (cosmetic) amendments to it, only to reaffirm support for what they previously claimed to have rejected.
(HU) The Directive is undoubtedly an important step that will make it possible to move beyond the theoretical principles of the Treaty of Rome and provide the practical conditions for the free movement of services.
It is my hope that by putting into action one of the four freedoms, it will be possible to eliminate the bad practice whereby Member States have prevented, through numerous methods, the implementation of that principle.
At the same time, in view of the amendments concerning exclusions, it is questionable which areas shall in practice fall outside the Directive on the free movement of services, and whether in its present form it fulfils its original purpose.
I think Parliament has missed a great opportunity to stand up for a proposal that would effectively promote improved EU competitiveness by creating a unified internal market.
On the other hand, I find it commendable that the Directive fully respects the rights as regards collective bargaining and the signing, broadening and implementing of collective agreements, as well as the right to strike and to take industrial action in accordance with the regulations of Member States governing industrial relations.
In sum, I think that although we cannot be completely satisfied with the result, since the list of exclusions and limiting conditions is perhaps too long, the Directive nevertheless covers a wide spectrum of economic activities and will impose a certain discipline on EU members.
I consider it also of great significance that thanks to the Directive, enterprises will be better informed, more knowledgeable and less dependent.
(EL) The directive on the liberalisation of services promotes the reactionary ambitions of European capital.
It strengthens the monopoly of services markets with particularly unfavourable repercussions on the quality, security and cost of services.
It gives monopolies the facility to enjoy 'low cost' services from service providers in other Member States.
It takes advantage of the single internal market to reduce the price of labour and exploit it, thereby reaping excessive profits.
It promotes the liberalisation and the penetration of big business into a series of public services and utilities.
It throws into doubt rights which have been hard fought for.
It exerts pressure on the working class in every Member State, by discriminating between workers, in order to reduce employment relations to the lowest common denominator.
It introduces legislative changes at the expense of the working class and its rights.
It accompanies reactionary changes to labour law which are already being processed in the wings of the tripartite association between the ÎU governments, the plutocracy and the reconciled trade union forces.
The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class and the grassroots class to step up their fight against the entire anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU and of the governments of the Member States, to help to change the power ratio at political and trade union level and to make their action more effective, in order to satisfy the modern needs of the working, grassroots family.

A new framework strategy for multilingualism (vote)
- Before the vote on paragraph 20:
(ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment:
'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.'
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)

The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (vote)
Voting time
Mr Rack has the floor for a point of order.
(DE) Mr President, if I have understood correctly, the President should preside over the vote.
He has more than a dozen deputies.
If he is really unable to attend, one of these deputies should at least be present.
No, Mr Rack.
It was I who was responsible for chairing Voting Time.
The reason I was slightly late was that I was at the airport receiving the Emir of Qatar, and there was a slight delay on the journey there and back.
The next item is the vote.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Welcome
I would like to welcome Mr Olexander Moroz, President of the Verjovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, who is in the gallery, and the delegation accompanying him.
(Applause)
We wish Mr Moroz a happy stay with us and we hope that he will be able to lead the parliamentary work in his country through the difficult situation it is facing at the moment and towards a democratic, prosperous and stable future in which he will always be able to count on our friendship and support.
I would also like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Algerian Parliament - headed by Mr Abderrezak Bouhara, Vice-President of the National Council - which is currently visiting our Parliament.
We hope that Mr Bouhara's meetings with members of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, as well as with other Members of this House, will help to strengthen our many links with the Republic of Algeria and will enable us to make progress in the common quest for peace, prosperity and democracy for the countries located on both shores of the Mediterranean.
(The formal sitting was opened at 12.05 p.m.)
Formal sitting - Qatar
Ladies and gentlemen, your Highness, I would like to welcome the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hammad bin Khalifa al-Thani.
I would also like to point out that we have a visit from the President of the Parliament of Ukraine, who is in the official gallery.
It is an honour for us to welcome you today, as the first Head of State of a Gulf country to address the European Parliament.
In fact, this is the first time we have had the pleasure and honour of receiving a Head of State from the extremely important region of the Gulf.
You have been a pioneer in your region's process of democratisation.
You have promoted a written Constitution, approved by means of a referendum, which guarantees a whole series of democratic reforms, including, of course, recognition of freedom of expression and opinion, the granting of universal suffrage to all adults, men and women, and the creation of a Parliament that will be elected in elections to be held next year.
Furthermore, your Highness, you have played an important role on the international stage.
You and your country.
A small country with just 200 000 citizens, as well as more than 600 000 immigrants.
A country that organised the conference in Doha that launched the WTO round that is still taking place.
It is the only Arab State that is currently a member of the United Nations Security Council.
It is a pioneer in the granting of financial aid and the sending of troops to the peace-keeping force in Lebanon.
Its troops are there together with our troops.
It has provided significant impetus in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict between Palestine and Israel, being one of the very few Arab States with trade relations with Israel.
You also took an important decision, which has had great worldwide repercussions, ten years ago now, in 1996, when you authorised broadcasting by the television channel, Al-Jazeera, significantly transforming access to news and information in the Arab world.
That channel now broadcasts in English and contributes to dialogue and understanding amongst civilisations.
Perhaps we too will one day recognise the importance of a channel in Arabic and English and perhaps we will also one day have a European television channel broadcasting in Arabic.
Your Highness, we are extremely interested to hear what you have to say to us this morning.
We wish to hear your views on the development of democracy in Qatar.
We would also like, however, to hear your ideas about how we can promote peace in Palestine.
And peace and stability in Iraq.
And how to reduce the tension with Iran.
Throughout my term in office - which will come to an end soon - I have insisted on the importance to Europe of our relations with the Arab and Islamic world.
I believe that this is one of the most important geostrategic challenges facing us Europeans: our relations with the Islamic world, which must go much further than our relations with our immediate neighbours, the countries of the Mediterranean.
This Parliament is therefore pleased that the negotiations have begun on a trade agreement between our Union, the European Union, and the Member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Let us hope that these negotiations can conclude shortly so that we can have relations with Qatar and its neighbours with greater strategic and political content.
This makes your visit to the European Parliament today all the more significant and relevant.
Your visit, your country's visit, is important to us for many reasons, and furthermore it is taking place on a symbolic day, because, also today, the United Nations working group on the Alliance of Civilisations has just presented its recommendations to the Secretary-General, Mr Annan, in Istanbul.
This is a good time for you to be here amongst us in Strasbourg, in the heart of Europe, so that your views and the views of the Arab world can bring us closer together and make it possible for us to move forward into the future in a more united fashion than has been possible in the past.
Thank you for your words, your Highness.
I am sure that they will have helped to create greater understanding of the views of the Arab world, of the Islamic world, on issues which are of common interest, to both Europe and yourselves.
It has been an honour for the European Parliament to receive you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

Services in the internal market (vote)
That concludes the vote.
Voting time (continued)
We shall continue with the vote.
Explanations of vote
The next item is the explanations of vote.
(ES) Mr President, the European Union's fundamental motto is 'United in diversity'.
Since its origins we have been trying to build a common area, and not just an economic area but, above all, an area of life opportunities and freedom.
We are doing so amongst people and nations that have many things in common; I am not just referring to the strategic, political and social interests that we share, but also to our values, habits and ways of looking at life.
We have a common cultural background based on Greek thought, Roman law, Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance and even globalisation.
At the same time, however, there is no question that we still have cultural differences and special identities and, in particular, our own languages.
This diversity, though it could be seen as just an obstacle, is in fact a source of great wealth and vitality.
Although it has not been approved, I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal that the European Union Treaty be modified, so that there can be Community legislation in the field of respect and protection for languages, particularly minority languages, as well as the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Multilingualism.
I have also voted in favour of promoting the learning by all European citizens of at least two other languages in addition to their own, since I believe that that is the best way to bring about mutual understanding, co-existence and unity.
(DE) Mr President, on the subject of multilingualism, I welcome the adoption of this report by Mr Joan i MarÃ­.
Indeed, I voted in favour of it, albeit with a number of reservations, which I still have.
I believe that neither the European Commission nor Members during the vote in this House - the majority, at least - showed sufficient courage on a number of amendments.
Multilingualism is a precondition for tolerance and acceptance, and, in the interests of understanding within the EU, more must be done in this field.
It is a fact that Parliament decided the Commission should study the issue of the creation of an agency and present a report to Parliament on this, and it is equally true that the Commission has been found wanting in this regard.
This omission must be rectified.
The procedure in this House is that a report is presented before the relevant debates are held and decisions taken.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good news that the new framework strategy for multilingualism has been adopted.
The individual Member States will be responsible for implementing this policy.
Some Member States are currently carrying out changes to their education systems.
The teaching of foreign languages, as a means of both communication and recognising cultural diversity, forms a substantial part of these changes.
We must give unequivocal support to the European Indicator of Language Competence if we are to make the best possible use of individual systems of current language knowledge in educational planning.
The motivation for teaching foreign languages is also increased by the transparency of language examination and certification, which is of benefit to those who have them in their future careers.
The report represents an important contribution towards strengthening the teaching of foreign languages, improving the competitiveness of workforces and enhancing communication between the citizens and the European institutions.
This a further reason why I voted in favour of this report.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report.
Amid all the euphoria about multilingualism, we must not forget the deficits that ever declining results of PISA studies have revealed.
The number of non-nationals in school classes should be limited to 30% as a matter of course, however, in order to facilitate integration, maintain quality standards and reduce the potential for cultural conflict.
In my opinion, therefore, sufficient command of the local language before the start of normal education and, if necessary, increased linguistic support, for example in the form of an additional year in kindergarten or pre-school, should become the norm in the EU.
(FR) Mr President, I would add my reservations to those of my colleague, Mr MÃ¶lzer.
There are some excellent things in this report, in particular the fact that it points out that English teaching does not need to be subsidised by the European Union.
It includes an extremely ambitious position, which is aimed at making all sixty or so minority languages official languages, but this is somewhat to the detriment of the 21 national languages of the Union, some of which are already, to some extent, under great threat: Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Hungarian and Slovenian are not languages of international communication.
Even the status of Italian, German and French is of some concern.
It is somewhat illogical for the report to propose making savings on the grounds that these official EU languages are not necessarily regarded as working languages in all of the delegations, and this so as to release funds for the benefit of regional languages.
Yesterday, we had the rather regrettable example of the Head of a State that has recently become fully independent, who felt obliged, rather than to speak in his mother tongue, to speak in English, even though he had been a student in Strasbourg!
That does not bode very well, in my view, for the development of multilingualism in the European Union.
I voted for the Joan i Mari report on a new framework strategy for multilingualism, although I have some reservations as regards some proposals and amendments that have been adopted.
I feel that the European multilingualism strategy should cover the teaching and promotion of 'European world languages', a term that applies to Portuguese, which is the third most widely spoken EU language in the world (behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian).
Owing to its uniqueness and to the fact that it is spoken by some 200 million people in eight countries spread over five continents, the Portuguese language should be one of the EU official languages.
The report fails to acknowledge this, as it ought to.
Portuguese is the most durable link between the continents, as it is a means of communication, the raw material used by great poets and writers, and has a dignity born of eight hundred years of history.
in writing. I will be supporting this report with a degree of reluctance.
It seems to me that the endless addition of further languages to the cocktail of the EU's official languages is not necessarily of benefit to the efficient working of the institutions.
I agree that it must be possible for MEPs to speak and listen in their own languages, but that is not necessarily true for Commission or Council officials.
We now have the anomalous situation whereby Gaelic will be available for those from Scotland, Spanish for those from Gibraltar, but not Welsh for those from Wales.
Yet, if we are to add new languages, I would plead that amongst these must be the language of one part of my constituency, namely Cornish.
It is a minority language, but its potential speakers are at least as numerous as those speakers of Maltese, an official language of the Community.
in writing. (SV) Multilingualism is important for freedom of movement within the European Union.
We have therefore voted in favour of the report as a whole.
However, we have voted against certain proposed wordings, including those concerning language legislation for the EU, the setting up of an Agency for Linguistic Diversity and/or Multilingualism and the establishment of an interinstitutional EU working party charged with bringing about an amendment to the EU Treaty with a view to creating a legal basis for the concept, 'respect for linguistic diversity'.
As always, the European Parliament's tendency to grow like Topsy enters the picture.
We would point out that the Member States are exclusively responsible for the organisation of teaching and for ensuring that the content of education systems is fully respected.
Consequently, it is the responsibility of each Member State to make sure that people are given a proper linguistic education.
in writing. - (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Joan i Mari on his important and timely report on a new framework strategy for multilingualism, to which I lend my full backing.
I welcome the proposed measures to promote multilingualism in Europe.
The existence of various languages in Europe is a characteristic that is peculiar to the process of European integration and a key component of European culture.
The learning of various languages, which is the objective known as 'mother tongue + 2' established in the Lisbon Strategy, should be encouraged with a view to facilitating communication between people from different countries and to fostering acceptance of the differences between them.
in writing. I voted for this report and warmly welcome measures to protect and enhance the use of minority languages.
However, encouraging multilingualism should not spill over into the excessive (and unnecessary) provision of interpretation and translation into regional languages.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report before us because multilingualism is a subject that is close to my heart and because I feel that the EU should send out a loud and clear message promoting linguistic diversity in its territory.
As regards the European Indicator of Language Competence, mentioned in the report, I shall reiterate the arguments I put forward in my written statement on the issue.
The adoption of an Indicator of Language Competence is needed to redress the lack of verifiable data on the EU citizens' language skills.
This Indicator must not, however, be restricted to the five most widely spoken languages in the EU.
Among other factors, we must take into account the profile of other European languages around the world.
This is a key aspect of the issue, and one which the EU must incorporate into its policy of openness towards, and cooperation with, the rest of the world.
For this reason, my vote in favour of Amendment 4 is a way of emphasising the call for the Commission to set out a specific timetable for extending the Indicator to all of the official EU languages, as I proposed in my written statement.
In the new framework strategy for multilingualism, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken on board my contribution to the recognition of the strategic importance and global relevance of European world languages.
Around the world, 350 million people have English as their mother tongue; Spanish is the mother tongue of 280 million people; Portuguese is the mother tongue of 230 million people, and 125 million have French as their mother tongue.
These figures and the geographical spread of speakers of these languages are indicative of the importance of European languages with a worldwide profile.
These languages enhance our capacity to sustain and strengthen direct relations and contacts with other parts of the world, without the need for an intermediary.
Turning to another aspect of the issue, I am aware that those opposed to the European promotion of multilingualism cite cost as one of the reasons for eliminating it or replacing it with one working language, or just a few.
It is undeniable that it costs money.
It must be remembered, however, despite the financial arguments that are trotted out, that of the costs incurred in the construction of modern Europe, this one is in a very good cause, the promotion of our tradition.
Multilingualism certainly costs less than war, and is a powerful cultural activity.
in writing. Multilingualism is an important concept.
We need to recognise the uniqueness of the European Parliament in having simultaneous interpretation in 21 different languages, soon to be 23.
However, if we are going to achieve the aim of all EU citizens having competence in their mother tongue plus two other languages, we need support at Member State level.
In Scotland, fewer people are choosing to study foreign languages at school and university.
We must reverse that trend.
I am pleased that all 10-year olds in Scottish schools are learning a foreign language.
Their efforts should be encouraged and supported.
The Scottish Executive support for Gaelic medium education should also be commended.
in writing. - (FR) The desire to make the granting to certain countries of the generalised system of preferences - that is to say, privileged access to the European market for their exports - dependent on those countries' complying with the minimal rules of the International Labour Organisation, is a good thing.
However, as is usually the case with this type of resolution, I fear that we are still at the stage of pious hopes.
Despite the clauses demanding respect for human rights and the basic 'social' rights with which the Europe of Brussels peppers its international trade agreements, I do not believe that it has ever punished any violation of these rights or enforced these clauses.
It agrees to trade with China and has supported its entry into the WTO, despite what we know about the working conditions in that Communist country, about the existence of Laogai camps and forced labour, about the political repression and lack of freedoms, and even about the systematic violation of the right of ownership, by the large-scale counterfeiting and copying that is practised there.
The problem here is one of credibility, and, on this point, Europe has none.
in writing. More trade union activists are murdered each year in Colombia than in the rest of the world combined.
In 2005, 70 trade unionists were killed, while 260 received death threats, 56 were arbitrarily detained, seven survived attacks in which explosives or firearms were used, six were kidnapped, and three disappeared.
The Commission has taken great pride in touting its credentials in matching GSP benefits with rights standards.
Even the ILO itself has stated that Colombia is not in full compliance with ILO core labour standards, which should be necessary to afford GSP+ benefits.
Ratification of an ILO convention is not the same as implementation, as trade unionists in Colombia will readily testify.
I therefore welcome this resolution and the statement made by Commissioner Mandelson during the debate and urge the Commission to review Colombia's GSP+ status.
Otherwise a country which murders its trade unionists will continue to appear to be rewarded for doing so.
in writing. I welcome this vote.
In far too many countries that get GS preferences there are repeated violations of workers' rights.
The Commission must through regular and transparent evaluation ensure the implementation of the relevant ILO conventions.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to explain why I voted in favour of the proposed recommendation for a directive on services in the internal market.
I should first like to say that I am convinced that it is a good thing that after three years of protracted negotiation the European institutions have reached a decision on progress towards liberalising the free movement of services.
This will lead to the creation of more than half a million new jobs and will support economic growth in our countries.
Although the directive in its final form does not correspond entirely to my original idea of the liberalisation of services in the EU internal market, it will still bring added value to all stakeholders, and this is why I voted in favour of it.
It will allow traders and small and medium-sized enterprises easier access to the markets of the other Member States.
The compromise reached in the Council is a very fragile one, however, and there is no point in putting it at risk.
For this reason I did not vote for certain amendments relating to sensitive issues, such as compliance with labour or criminal law, the definition of social services and screening obligations.
These issues will certainly form the subject of future debates.
(HU) As an MEP from one of the new Member States, I have fought hard for the rights of our businesses and our workers, and have put questions to the Commission on several occasions both orally and in writing concerning the protection and respect of workers' rights.
In the process, we have often come up against legal, political and economic problems.
We have frequently been accused of social dumping, of lowering the standards for safety in the workplace and other similar absurdities.
By now the majority of the issues - including the SoKo Bunda and Pannonia affairs involving Hungarian workers in Germany - have been resolved, court decisions have stopped the German authorities' action and there are even lawsuits for damages underway.
The acceptance of the Services Directive today is a giant step in the direction of clarifying the various uncertainties.
It is a compromise, which means no one is really fully satisfied, but it is a good compromise that will advance our cause, namely the achievement of the fundamental freedoms of our Union, the free movement of services.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt's report, mainly because I come from a border area, where these difficulties are experienced on a daily basis.
I therefore believe that these are positive measures, which will specifically benefit border areas.
I rather regret the years of controversy that have surrounded the draft Services Directive with which we are dealing today and which, in the end, has received very strong support even in this House, support that I feel is well deserved.
I hope that, in future, pro-active and positive proposals will prevail over controversies.
- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the freedom to provide services is one of the four freedoms of the European Union guaranteed by the EEC Treaty.
Treaty prohibits restricting the establishment of nationals of one Member State in another Member State and creating barriers to the free movement of services.
Fellow Members, it has been two years since we started working on this document enabling the freedom which has been our fundamental right for as long as 50 years.
The principle of country of origin (a prerequisite for the free movement of services), services of general interest, healthcare, social and other services have all been excluded from the proposal for a Directive.
Lithuania was the only country to abstain in the Council's voting for the Directive.
I believe that it will not be long before we see that implementation of the Directive will not fulfil our expectations.
Consequently, I oppose this Directive, just as during the first reading.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many advances have been made in comparison with the initial text presented by the European Commission, the directive on services in the internal market that has been submitted to the vote today differs from the European Parliament's first reading.
I therefore voted to reject the common position.
Indeed, services of general economic interest are still part of the scope of the directive, as are some services of general interest.
The scope of the exclusion of social services of general interest is also far more limited.
The fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Charter now only feature in a recital.
Finally, the text remains ambiguous as regards the exclusion of labour law.
While the written statement presented by the European Commission provides some of the necessary responses to these issues, which I consider to be essential, it does not have any legal value, and, in the event of a legal dispute being brought before the courts, the Court of Justice will be unable to take it into account.
It would have been different if this statement had come from the Council, as colegislator with Parliament.
Mr President, the deal brokered here, which has achieved such a large cross-party majority, has shown Parliament at its best.
We have looked at and reviewed Commission proposals, made sure they are workable and politically acceptable across our countries, and got a solution which I am sure will bring huge benefits to the EU economy.
I am particularly pleased with the last-minute adjustment that was made to this deal on the issue of comitology.
It was only a few months ago that we signed an agreement with the Council to give Parliament enhanced rights of scrutiny over the implementing measures that will flow from this directive.
It was unacceptable for the Council initially to say that the new deal would not apply to this directive.
Part of the deal was that it would apply to all new legislative measures which empower the Commission subsequently to adopt quasi-legislative implementing measures.
That has now been accepted, fortunately, as part of the deal, which means that no implementing measures of a quasi-legislative measure flowing from this legislation can come into force if Parliament rejects them.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adopting the modified version of the draft Services Directive.
In other words, I was against rejecting it.
I am generally an optimist, and that is why I think that it will contribute to cutting red tape, increasing economic growth and creating new jobs.
Let us be honest, however, and admit that the original version of the Directive, put forward by the European Commission three years ago, was much better and could have made a better contribution to achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
The current directive has been significantly watered down and it is difficult to describe it as a great success.
It seems that some old Member States are afraid of the free provision of services and of competition with new Member States, using fear of social dumping as a justification.
This attitude is difficult to comprehend, as I imagine that we all want Europe to become more competitive and dynamic.
(DE) Mr President, I am convinced that the proposal for a Services Directive on which we have voted represents the achievement of a good compromise between freedom to provide services on the one hand, and the need to impose restrictions in the interests of workers and of small and medium-sized enterprises on the other.
Indeed, that is why I have voted in favour of this report.
It is now up to Member States to monitor compliance with the provisions.
Only then will we be able to count this Services Directive a complete success.
I would appeal to the Council Presidency, to the Council - which is now absent - to put pressure on Member States to indeed prepare the appropriate monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of the Services Directive.
in writing. - (FR) The adoption by the European Parliament of the Services Directive enables general provisions to be established that will make it easier for service providers to exercise their freedom of establishment and that will facilitate the free movement of services, the high quality of which is guaranteed, and also excludes the risk of social dumping contained within the initial concept of the country of origin principle, which has been removed.
The scope of the directive has been considerably reduced and excludes, in particular, health services, non-commercial public services and certain commercial public services.
Service activities represent 70% of the European Union's GDP and offer significant growth and employment potential.
Looking back, I should like to point out that the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, was strongly advised to stop the initial text, which was presented, at the time, by the Prodi Commission.
This matter shows the growing influence of the European Parliament, for which this is a great political victory, and symbolises the concept of the social market economy as it is expressed in the draft Constitutional Treaty for Europe.
We must now turn our attention to the Member States, which are responsible for transposing this text into national law in a fair, equitable and sincere manner.
in writing. I voted, as one of UKIP's MEP's, for most of the amendments put forward by the EUL/NGL and Greens/EFA, because, within the limits of their understanding of the dangers of supra-nationalism, these amendments nevertheless recognised, and sought to obviate, the harm, which a lack of democratic, national control over the provision of services can wreak upon ordinary people and especially upon the less well off.
in writing. We voted for most of the amendments put forward by the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups because, within the limits of their understanding of the dangers of supra-nationalism, these amendments nevertheless recognised and sought to obviate the harm which a lack of democratic, national control over the provision of services can wreak upon ordinary people and especially upon the less well off.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion to reject the Council common position on services in the internal market.
The vote at second reading was cast on a backwards-looking text in comparison with the vote at first reading.
There remain too many uncertainties regarding the application of the country of origin principle.
The text in no way clarifies the ambiguities that remain concerning the protection of public services and consumers.
Even more serious is the fact that, even though labour law comes under national powers, the Council has just subordinated respect for labour law to Community decisions, insofar as respect for labour law will now be subject to the judgments of the European Court of Justice.
The European Union is turning its back here on its initial ambition to create a united European area.
With the downwards harmonisation of social, environmental and consumer protection rules, the European social model has been jeopardised.
in writing. - (FR) The French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have refused, this Wednesday 15 November, to endorse the report on services in the internal market, in other words the Services Directive.
Indeed, despite the very important advances made by the PSE and the Socialist rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, at first reading - not least the rejection of the country of origin principle - Parliament has not obtained any guarantees from the Commission regarding a draft framework directive on public services.
With this being the second reading of a text whereby there is no final vote on the complete text, we endorsed the amendment tabled by several groups (the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance) aimed at rejecting the text.
Furthermore, we tabled several amendments aimed specifically at guaranteeing respect for the freedom of the Member States to define what they mean by social services of general interest.
As Mr Poignant pointed out on behalf of the French Socialists, 'the definition, formulation, organisation and actual funding of services of general interest, whether economic or otherwise, must remain a duty of the Member States and of their regional and local authorities'.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the amendment aimed at rejecting the Council common position on the Services Directive.
The directive is unsatisfactory because it introduces more confusion and legal uncertainty and further weakens the amended proposal adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, which I voted against.
This is particularly the case as regards labour law and the social and public services that have been excluded from the scope of the Services Directive.
Above all, however, the Council text gives the Commission the power to oversee the application of the directive.
While the country of origin concept has disappeared from the text in the text amended by the Commission, it has not been replaced by the country of destination or host country concept.
I find this very harmful, all the more so because it will be the European Court of Justice that settles any disputes that may ensue.
It is therefore a liberal Services Directive that has been adopted this 15 November.
Three years of debates will not have made it possible to avoid a conclusion with dangerous consequences for political and social Europe.
This is a harsh blow to European integration - one that it scarcely needed.
in writing. - (PT) The adoption of this directive, which has just taken place, is an extremely worrying development.
We are bitterly disappointed at the rejection of the proposal to reject the Council common position that our group tabled and to which we put our name.
What happened today was tantamount to a capitulation, on the part of the two biggest groups in Parliament, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in relation to their positions at first reading last February.
They did nothing to promote the agreement that they had made and voted for, following the protests and demonstrations in Strasbourg.
They have now returned to some of the most damaging aspects of the original, notorious Bolkestein Directive.
What they are seeking is the liberalisation of services, including in the area of public services, thereby caving in to pressure from the large economic and financial groups, which have seen this 'step' as a fresh opportunity to exploit the workers and for economic domination.
Not only will it undermine the sovereign right of States to define, protect and fund public services, it will also remove their ability to define funding standards and to protect services as a whole. In so doing, it will strengthen the power of supranational bodies such as the Commission.
We believe that each country should continue to have the sovereign right to make decisions on the public services they want, their public property, their form of funding and organisation, and on the rights of workers and end users.
Despite the significant progress made in relation to the European Commission's initial text, the text on services in the Union that has been proposed today at second reading does not offer guarantees that are sufficient to prevent any risk of the European social model falling apart.
Certain sensitive social services, such as social housing, family support services and public health services, which were initially excluded from the scope of the future directive at first reading, have thus been reintegrated by the Member States.
The legal vacuum accompanying, in particular, the abolition of the PPO has not been removed, leaving it to the arbitration of the Court of Justice judges - and not to the legislator - to define the future characteristics of European policy via the case-laws that this situation will most certainly generate.
It is clear, in this context, that the Commission's written statement, which is aimed at clarifying some of the gaps in the text, such as the exclusion of labour law, does not present any real legal value, and that makes its influence and usefulness particularly uncertain.
For all these reasons, I voted to reject the proposal for a directive on services.
in writing. - (FR) If the new version of the Bolkestein Directive had not already suffered from serious shortcomings, particularly that of not being fundamentally different from its predecessor, one reason alone would have prompted us to reject it: the suspicious consensus between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, what is more, their adoption of the compromise drafted at the Council.
The real revolution would have consisted, among other things, in explicitly stating the priority for a Member State to apply its national law, and particularly its national labour law and its national social, criminal and fiscal laws, in its territory.
That is to say the country of destination principle, as opposed to the country of origin principle.
This would not have prevented service providers from another Member State from being able to offer services in another country; this would have simply meant there being fair competition with national operators.
The revolution would have consisted in agreeing to the Member States' being able to introduce conditions regarding access to certain activities, such as the situation of the labour market, or reasons justifying territorial planning.
They do not have this possibility.
After competition with the rest of the world and competition among businesses, Europe is now establishing competition among European workers, whether self-employed or salaried, and thus competition among social systems.
It is heading for disaster.
in writing. (SV) The June List welcomes the Services Directive and believes that services companies, irrespective of the country they come from, should not be discriminated against in any EU country.
The key issue in the debate on the Services Directive has been that of whether the country of origin principle should underpin the directive or whether the host country's legislation should apply in full.
The country of origin principle affects significant, but strictly limited, areas such as construction, installation activities and consultancy services.
We welcome competition in these areas but believe that it should take place on conditions that are fair to all the parties.
We believe that Swedish rules should apply on Swedish territory.
It is therefore gratifying that, in its common position, the Council rejects the country of origin principle.
The Council's position is mainly a victory for those views that the June List represents.
Competition within the services sector will be intensified.
At the same time, the national independence of the Member States will be respected in that the country of origin principle does not form the basis of the directive.
It is a good thing that the national monopolies on services will not be affected and that national labour legislation, collective agreements, union rights and legislation on social security remain untouched.
The Council common position largely takes account of the fundamental amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading.
The exclusions are clearly explained and relate in particular to fields such as healthcare services and audiovisual services.
The country of origin principle has been deleted, and labour legislation and social agreements in the countries concerned have been respected.
Market access for our enterprises has also been facilitated by the dismantling of many arbitrary barriers.
In addition, Commission opinions have provided greater clarity.
Consequently, the overall result of the negotiations can be considered a success for Parliament, but also for economic and social policy.
Of course, every compromise has its weaknesses, and some of the Council's amendments are not quite clear, but it would be wrong to question the overall result - which is on the whole very positive - by reopening the debate in the Council.
in writing. - (FR) The Services Directive has just been adopted, by a clear majority.
This is to the European Parliament's credit.
This is a victory for the European Union.
Why?
Services represent over half of the European economy, and are the main source of jobs.
The free provision of services features among the founding principles of the Union, and the creation of a genuine internal market in services is key to economic growth in Europe, and thus to the creation of jobs.
The text adopted today in Strasbourg commits us to this path, while providing the necessary guarantees regarding the safeguarding of public services of general interest and the continuity of our social acquis and of our labour law.
By excluding the country of origin principle, it prohibits social competition and constitutes an effective barrier to social dumping.
It does away with the unjustified protectionist obstacles, while permitting the Member States to apply their national rules when the public interest warrants it.
The scope of the text has also been reduced, with the exclusion of sensitive sectors such as the audiovisual sector, the health sector, part of the social services sector, the gambling sector and even the notary sector.
This is a good compromise, which will take Europe forward in line with the interests of its population.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against this directive because I feel that, despite the improvements obtained in the parliamentary debate and under the pressure of the trade unions' and citizens' involvement, it remains profoundly liberal.
No prospect of genuine harmonisation, aimed at benefiting consumers and workers, is envisaged in return for the fearsome deregulation of the services sector in Europe, which is mainly aimed at benefiting businesses.
As for public services, while the Commission refuses to make progress on the framework directive on services of general interest, the Services Directive helps to weaken public services, some of which will suffer its effects in the same way as simple commercial services.
Finally, the 'prohibited requirements and requirements to be evaluated' in Articles 14 and 15 make it impossible or, at least, extremely difficult, to carry out any public regulation in the services sector.
There will be a maximum price for basic services; a minimum number of employees in order to guarantee the quality of certain sensitive services; territorial planning, for example for the opening of supermarkets; and so many rules that were considered until now to guarantee respect for the general interest and that are now regarded as so many unacceptable barriers to freedom of establishment and to the freedom to do business.
in writing. I consider that the closed list of services of general interest is too limited and will leave many services in limbo.
Are they in or out?
We have no framework directive on these areas, which are essential in combating poverty and encouraging social cohesion and are of particular importance to women.
They are key EU policies.
The Commission statement this morning cannot bind the future Commission which will be holding office when the directive comes into force.
The statement has no legal standing before the ECJ, which will now be making decisions that Parliament chose to duck.
We have seen in today's vote that the majority of this House prefers not to make clear statements on labour rights and the protection of public services.
How will they explain to their councillors at local and regional level that they are weakening their role in determining the provision of services of general interest and safeguarding the public interest?
Parliament has achieved positive changes in the original proposal.
We could have done more.
in writing. - (FR) Despite a few improvements, despite a few additional sectors being excluded from the scope of application or, rather, of annoyance, of the first version of the Bolkestein Directive, this text, in its new draft, remains fundamentally unacceptable.
It remains an open door to social dumping and to unfair competition among workers.
It does not, in fact, resolve any of the problems raised by the original directive.
It does not exclude public services and does not safeguard the right of the Member States to determine the way in which these services are defined, organised and funded.
It denies the legitimate, economic, social or other requirements that these very Member States can impose on access to an activity, and only acknowledges the possibility for them to invoke 'overriding requirements of the general interest', a vague concept that the Court in Luxembourg will take it upon itself to interpret in the most restrictive way possible.
It subordinates respect for the labour law of the Member State in which the service is provided to respect for Community law and, more specifically, for the free provision of services principle laid down in the Treaties, a move that amounts to denying the application of this national law.
Several million Europeans rejected this ultraliberal Europe, which scorns men and nations and prioritises market laws, financial interests and sacrosanct competition.
Listen to them before it is too late!
I voted in favour of the amendment to reject this directive. The directive is a step back in comparison with the vote at first reading because it leaves the application of the country of origin principle open and in no way excludes public services - SGIs, SGEIs - from this 'free competition', with the result that they will become very destabilised.
The European Commission explains that the text does not clearly establish which law will apply and thus that private international law, which is closely related to the country of origin principle, will apply most of the time.
The room for manoeuvre that the Member States have to act on the social field will be extremely reduced.
In spite of the formal progress made, little by little, the liberal reality will impose itself with this text, and our social model will be jeopardised.
in writing. - (FR) In an attempt to obtain the consent of the people of France during the referendum on the European Constitution, the 'Yes' camp, particularly within the UMP, made them three promises: that the Bolkestein Directive would be withdrawn; that VAT would be lowered for the catering sector; and that the plan for Turkey to join the EU would be abandoned.
The people of France are finally going to end up with Turkey, the Bolkestein Directive and an unchanged VAT rate.
The compromise on which we are voting today is a seemingly watered down version of the original text, which includes, as a double whammy, full powers for the Commission and the Court of Justice to re-establish the initial text.
How can Mr Toubon say that, by adopting this compromise, he hopes to 'avoid the worst'?
The worst would therefore mean there being no directive, but that was precisely the promise made to the people of France in 2005 by the UMP and the Head of State!
in writing. - (FR) It is without enthusiasm that I am voting today in favour of the Services Directive.
This text has been far too distorted and manipulated.
Crucial provisions such as those on the posting of workers have disappeared, and I regret that.
We were told that these provisions have been removed in order to prevent social dumping, but there is no truth in that.
Those provisions would have clarified the ground rules and controls within the European Union regarding businesses and workers.
Equally, we very much celebrate and welcome the fact that the country of origin principle - which was accompanied with the necessary safeguards - has disappeared.
Yet, how can we, at the same time, look forward to taking a great step forward for the internal market?
What do we offer our businesses and our citizens?
Not, at any rate, the clear rules that they need in the internal market.
Too many lies and fears have marred the debates surrounding this matter, to the detriment of the internal market and the integration of our Europe.
With this directive, we have missed a great opportunity to integrate ourselves more.
Let us learn lessons from it for the future and let us not make the same mistakes.
in writing. I welcome the Gebhardt Report and effectively the adoption of the Services Directive.
Parliament has played a significant role in allowing freer movement of services across EU borders without undermining social services, trade union rights or environmental laws.
Parliament will have to monitor the implementation of the Directive closely to ensure that the commitments made in the Chamber by the Commissioner are adhered to.
in writing. The Services Directive will have a profound impact on the lives of workers and consumers, lowering the standard of service provision and increasing the risks of social dumping.
It gives exclusive prominence to the freedom to provide services across borders, whereas freedoms such as social rights and collective bargaining are excluded or dismantled.
The directive puts downward pressure on wages and provides companies with numerous loopholes which they can exploit to pay less than the minimum wage.
It provides an incentive to service providers to establish themselves in low-wage, low-tax countries, and encourages a race to the bottom in relation to wages and employment conditions.
Regulatory requirements are an integral part of the functioning of all services, and the need for such requirements increases with the amount of private-sector involvement.
The directive challenges the right of Member States and local authorities to regulate services.
Finally, Parliament has capitulated to the Commission and the Council in its refusal to uphold its already inadequate first reading position.
Unfortunately I was unable to vote on this occasion due to the hospitalisation of my son.
in writing. - (MT) I voted in favour of this directive for two reasons.
Firstly, we have not treated people like numbers, at the service of the market, but, rather, we have placed workers' rights above all other considerations.
The second reason is that we have removed all restrictions on the movement of persons, not by playing workers off against each other and thus having a contest that is won by those who offer their services on the worst conditions, but by showing that we want to use freedom of movement to enhance workers' rights.
This vote should send out a strong signal that no one should continue to abuse foreign workers by offering worse conditions than those offered to local workers.
Nor should it be admissible to pressurise local workers into accepting lower wages and conditions through such methods.
Over and above this, workers should be given full information about conditions being offered to local and foreign workers and should not be left bereft of information.
Lack of information leads to suspicion and antagonism, just as is happening, for example, at the Malta Drydocks.
Savings on expenditure should not be achieved by abusing workers' rights, but by raising the quality of services.
This is what the directive should accomplish.
The Coalition and the European left as a body voted against the amended Bolkenstein proposal adopted by the European Parliament because it will bring the position of workers under pressure and is a serious blow to social Europe.
The compromise between the European right and the socialists moderates but does not eliminate the neoliberal logic and huge negative social impact of the proposal.
With its ambiguities, it leaves the door open to further unfavourable interpretations, by both the Commission and the Court.
The reworded Commission and Council proposal adopted today by Parliament without any amendments strengthens all these dangerous ambiguities.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities systematically protects the undertakings that provide services in its case law, using the principle of the country of origin.
It always rules against the rules of the host country, with the argument that they hamper the activities of the undertakings in question.
The dangerous relocation of undertakings to countries with minimal social and environmental legislation is strengthened with the adoption of the directive.
The fight by the European left against social dumping will continue even after the vote on the directive, both at national and at European level, in cooperation with the trade unions and non-governmental organisations.
in writing. - (FR) I did, of course, vote in favour of the Services Directive. The fruit of broad compromises, it is an amended, revised and revisited text that opens up the services market in Europe.
I voted in favour of this text, as did the vast majority of Parliament - as did almost four-fifths of its Members.
The opening up of the services market will be positive for our economies; it will help in the fight against illegal labour and will guarantee better social protection for all European workers.
According to the OECD, the directive is going to create two and a half million jobs in Europe and, until proven otherwise, is going to create jobs; this is still the best social policy there is!
Demonisation is the tactic used by those who are deprived of it: it is, I might add, amusing to note that, in the Socialist camp, only a last handful of diehards, including the French-speaking Belgians, are still rejecting this compromise, which has been accepted by everyone, including the trade unions!
Parliament and the Council have played their part and proved those who constantly demonise this text wrong.
This text, in its current form, preserves the best parts of the European social model and recognises the specific nature of services of general interest.
The colegislators have put an end to the lies and given Europe a chance of growth!
in writing. - (FR) In line with my vote on the Services Directive at first reading, I voted to reject the common position.
Indeed, the Council has not taken up all of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
I had to reject the Council common position because it clearly excludes labour law and social services of general interest.
That is why I co-signed and voted in favour of three amendments tabled by the French Socialist delegation providing for the clear and total exclusion of labour law and social services of general interest from the scope of the Services Directive.
Indeed, it is a question of protecting Europeans' fundamental rights.
These must not be governed by the rules of the internal market.
Although the Commission statement clarifies its aim on several points, it is not enough because it has no binding force.
I finally voted in favour of the amendments aimed at completely excluding services of general interest from the scope of this directive.
in writing. - (PT) It has taken 50 years for the EU to achieve the free movement of services enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
It is now about to become a reality.
The EU is taking another step in the right direction with the Services Directive, which will facilitate the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in the EU Member States offered by the internal market.
Controversial since its beginnings as the Bolkestein Directive, the final text is rather less forthright.
I believe, however, that this report has struck the right balance between the crucial need to open up the services sector to competition, whilst preserving the European social model.
I voted for this Directive because I feel that Portugal has much to gain, as it will accordingly derive maximum benefit from the internal market.
Adopting the directive was the right thing to do if only because a series of administrative and legal obstacles imposed by the national, regional and local authorities have been removed.
Portuguese companies, and in particular SMEs, will be the main beneficiaries.
Furthermore, the adoption of the Directive will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy aimed at more growth, more jobs and greater freedom for consumers to choose services.
Although the Council's common position on the Services Directive, on which we are to vote today, may be an improvement on the original Commission proposal, a few aspects of it still remain unacceptable.
The document creates legal uncertainty.
It is, for example, left unclear what legislation applies and to what extent Member States can impose national provisions.
The possibility for upward harmonisation has not been included.
Moreover, the review clause leaves the door open to the reintroduction of the country-of-origin principle and to the addition of services currently outside the directive's scope.
Services of general economic interest fall within the directive's scope and since there is no framework directive for services of general interest, this directive is at risk of forming a horizontal framework for services of general economic interest.
I also regret the fact that the list of social services that fall outside of the directive's scope has - having originally been indicative - been changed into a limitative list.
In addition, the absence of any reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is disappointing.
I am, finally, particularly disgruntled at this House's capitulation in respect of the maximum enforcement of the achievements that were attained at first reading.
As a result, the future of a democratic and social Europe is being undermined.
in writing. I welcome the vote today on the Services Directive and support the compromise reached.
in writing. (PL) The only benefit of the present compromise on the Services Directive is the fact that its adoption will not worsen the basis on which the services market operates.
That is the only reason why we can support this compromise in today's vote.
The European Court of Justice will provide the litmus test for this Directive, as it will certainly, be called upon frequently to rule in disputes concerning the Directive's contradictory contents.
On the one hand, we have the stipulated freedom to provide services.
On the other hand, this Directive does not apply to the fields of vaguely-defined public and social services and temporary work agencies.
It has no influence in terms of regulating labour legislation and collective agreements and its scope is limited in terms of the work carried out by posted workers.
As a result, no real barriers to the provision of services in the EU will be removed when this Services Directive is adopted.
It is a compromise that has been achieved entirely at the cost of the new Member States, who have a competitive advantage on the European Union market, especially in the services sector.
None of the social reasons put forward for introducing these above-mentioned exceptions and restrictions fulfil their declared social objectives.
They are merely evidence of economic chauvinism on the part of the trade unions and other interest groups in the old Member States.
Hitherto, the debates on the draft have been the greatest example of European hypocrisy that we have witnessed during this term.
The European Parliament and, with it, the entire European Union, is pretending to introduce the principles of a common market to the services sector.
