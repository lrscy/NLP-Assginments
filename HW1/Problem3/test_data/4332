I think that the charter may be used as an indicator of this development, so that if we regularly - once a year - review the charter, we might acquire a sense of this development.
Mr President, Matti Wuori' s report has shown that the political campaign against censorship through violence must become a joint campaign within the framework of European foreign policy.
After all, freedom of opinion and independent journalism are the backbone of democracy.
It is important, therefore, to ensure that such information is recognised as freedom of opinion and a basic prerequisite for individual fundamental freedoms, and for collective and social basic rights.
We can only achieve this in practice if censorship through violence is abolished.
Yet many journalists continue to risk their lives or freedom in defence of the public' s right to information.
What is the European Union doing?
It has established deeper partnerships with countries which continue to practise censorship. It is very important that in the partnership and cooperation agreements and at the summits which take place in this context, these are used as instruments to make this a central political theme, and not merely a footnote, in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
I would like to ask the Council and the Commission whether they are prepared for the issue of press censorship to be anchored more centrally in European policy in order to give fundamental rights, human rights, social and collective rights an opportunity to develop.
Mr President, the report was excellent, as was the Belgian minister' s speech, as were Commissioner Patten' s and Commissioner Vitorino' s speeches.
However, there is one problem.
The European Union' s policy on human rights is rather schizophrenic: while we get ten out of ten for reports on ideas, declarations of good intentions, we barely scrape through and we demonstrate cowardice when it comes to applying them.
A great deal of cowardice.
We can make claims and demands on Moldavia, Latvia, Lithuania, certain African countries, certain former central American colonies, but when Mr Bush was here, who opened their mouth, who said a word about the death penalty?
Mr Schroeder? Mr Blair?
Mr Chirac?
Mr Jospin?
No-one said a single word!
This pragmatism colours all our positions, even this report.
Although Mr Wuori has produced an excellent report, I should like to ask him, why Amendment No 10 Mr Wuori?
Why, when it comes to Turkey, delete the passage stating that the Kurds must be allowed to return or that the European Court decision on Cyprus must be applied?
What has changed in the meantime?
Mr President, the Italian radicals of the Bonino List support the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, to consolidate the legal and other value of Parliament' s report on human rights, not least because we would like to be able to have, at last, a forum for condemning, describing and recording unbelievable incidents completely unknown to the vast majority of you.
We would like to be able to tell you about referendums which have been illegally denied in Italy on subjects of fundamental importance for the Italian citizens; we would like to be able to tell you about referendums in which tens of millions of voters voted and won and were then betrayed some months afterwards by the Italian parliament; we would like to be able to tell you about electoral lists illegally presented at the elections of our country and illegally accepted; we would like to be able to tell you about an electoral campaign which illegally excluded subjects, parties, movements, policies and proposals from the possibility of being chosen by the Italian electorate; we would like to be able to tell you about all these things.
There is no genuine forum protecting human rights and the civil and political rights of the European citizens.
We feel that democracy is under threat, not just outside the Union and not just in Italy, but in the Union as a whole; we also feel that the institutional mechanisms of the European Union itself and the inappropriate division of powers therein make it an increasingly a democratic, if not undemocratic institution.
We call for a forum in which all this can be discussed.
There is a committee ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, we are dealing with a novel report by Mr Cornillet which, as he himself recognises, is limited and incomplete due to a lack of resources, which he has tried to substitute through personal effort and this is worthy of recognition.
It is difficult to analyse what is happening in each Member State and, above all, know the facts and circumstances which affect each country in the light of our recent Charter of Fundamental Rights and, therefore, we must continue to study the procedure in depth.
I would like to thank him expressly for his sensitivity to one of the most fundamental rights of human beings, the right to life, which, together with freedoms of expression and movement, is being persistently violated by ETA in an area of European territory, the Basque Country, and in Spain as a whole.
Unfortunately, terrorism has warranted a specific mention with a new section which refers to the right to life and the intensification of the fight against terrorism, based on the legal instruments agreed at the Tampere Summit to combat it, such as, for example, the arrest order, which we are creating at the moment.
Another aspect, which the Socialist Group in particular should reflect on, given that they do not even accept its application in places where the governments are of its same colour, is that mentioned in points 119 and 120, which recognise the right to vote of citizens of third countries, not only in local elections, but also in European elections.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not start building the house from the roof.
When we have still not been capable of laying the foundations of genuine integration, which include education, housing, healthcare and the mutual respect for our cultures, there is still much to be done in the field of immigration and asylum.
And false demagoguery will only hinder the resolution of such a serious problem.
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that it seems to me absurd to hold a joint debate in this House on the human rights situation in the world and in the European Union.
My group said this in the Conference of Presidents and was only supported by the GUE/NGL Group.
Furthermore, Mr President, I would like to ask you to note that I find it incredible that we are organising a debate in this way, because it seems that human rights in the world are more important to us than human rights in the European Union.
The comparisons are odious and I am not talking about the victims of a lack of human rights, but we should be more concerned with dealing with what is exclusively in our hands.
I would like to say to Mr Cornillet that I am grateful for his effort and his work, and I would like to ask him to consider the possibility that in the coming months, and based on his experience, we should seek amongst all of us, calmly and serenely, a method which will allow us to work in the future, taking account of his extremely valuable experience.
His experience has been valuable because this is the first year that we have produced this report, after the declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I would like you to take this into account, Mr Cornillet.
In my last few seconds I will speak not about methods but about content.
Mr Pirker, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, we do not want to put forward a common immigration policy.
We simply want recognition that Mr Cornillet' s report clearly demonstrates that the people most affected by violations of human rights are minorities and, especially, asylum seekers and immigrants.
If human rights are deteriorating in this respect, we must put forward solutions and conclusions which reflect it.
That is what we want.
Mr President, anyone who believes that apartheid has been abolished is wrong.
It still exists as a caste system in India and neighbouring countries.
European human rights policy has wrongly been silent up to now on this blatant injustice.
In India systematic discrimination has deep historical roots and is completely integrated into the social system.
A hundred and sixty million people from the lowest caste and chained in the dungeons of cultural and religious tradition.
There is legislation against the system, but social practice pays no attention to it.
A dalit or untouchable is without prospects from birth and is doomed to a lifetime of humiliations and an existence on the fringe of society.
Dalits are regularly abused by the higher caste.
Women are raped and no one can attain justice.
There is systematic inequality of opportunity.
There is absolutely no question of social mobility, one of the characteristics of a true democracy.
India is not only the largest, but also the most undemocratic democracy in the world.
There is no cultural or religious justification for the structural violation of universal human rights.
In India itself awareness of the inhumane character is slowly dawning, but there is a great reluctance to change among those who benefit from the system.
The caste system is a culturally constructed form of political and economic exploitation.
A massive consciousness-raising campaign must be launched and Europe must put this crude form of racial discrimination on the international agenda, to begin with at the forthcoming World Racism conference in Durban.
It is not an easy task, but we must have courage, as Mr Michel said, before he disappeared.
We must not as if the whole caste system is itself untouchable.
Apartheid is only unchangeable if we resign ourselves to it and we must therefore not do so.
I should be glad to hear the responses of the Commission and the Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the adoption last year, in Nice, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights represented a step forward for human rights in the European Union, it constitutes only a minimum standard for the protection to which every citizen is entitled.
Unfortunately it is still inadequate to combat the distress suffered by thousands of individuals, whether they are refugees, immigrants or illegal immigrants, in particular where women and children are concerned.
At no time are the countries concerned, whether European or not, called to order or condemned for the violations that they have committed.
Proof of this lies in the reports that have been tabled here today. However good they may be, and for that we can thank the rapporteurs, they still do nothing more than list the many cases in which fundamental rights are giving cause for concern.
Human rights and fundamental liberties are universal and inseparable.
They must not recognise any boundaries, whether of nationality or of gender.
We must reaffirm this argument, strongly and vigorously These rights will only become a reality if everyone is aware of their existence, but also only if everyone has confidence in those who are responsible for applying and respecting them.
It is therefore essential to enforce those rights, but also to make them visible and accessible to everyone.
If we are to be constructive, we must set up a dialogue with all those involved in the recognition, promotion and defence of fundamental rights, particularly those who are closest to the least-favoured individuals, those who are the victims of discrimination.
Another key factor lies in ratifying international instruments and translating them into everyday life: the right to move around freely, to live with one' s family, to be a citizen.
Whatever a society is like, it can only flourish in peace, and there can be no peace without justice.
Apart from these generalised speeches in favour of human rights, nothing will happen without the political will to achieve real equality of rights for all men and women who have a share in wealth and in the construction of Europe and European citizenship.
Instead of fussing about the structures that the European Parliament might give itself in the future, we ought to equip ourselves with the means to ensure that human rights and fundamental liberties are respected, including social and political rights, without which the principles of a state under the rule of law and of democracy will no longer have any meaning.
Mr President, I cannot fail to stress the positive aspects of the Wuori and Cornillet reports on human rights in the world, for a number of reasons: most importantly, the reference to the human rights clause in the conclusion of trade or other agreements, and then the request, which has been made on a number of occasions in the past as well, for closer involvement of Parliament in the coordinated, consistent monitoring of Community action in respect of the violation of rights.
However, I must also point out the considerable vagueness and haziness, particularly of Mr Cornillet' s report, regarding the violation of rights in different countries, especially where the subject is controversial and the governments responsible are not identified.
I would not like this House to have to face, once again, the dilemma in which we can only ever take moral decisions where our values or political affiliations are not called into question.
Mr President, it would be appropriate for me to begin by congratulating Mr Cornillet on the excellent report with which he has provided us.
I have seen, in the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, how much commitment, hard work and quality he put into the report, in terms both of its structure and its content.
Respect for human rights is a requirement of the society we live in, which we must value and pass on to future generations, without distinction on the grounds of colour, gender, language, religion, opinion or other beliefs, or of national or social origin.
The adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Parliament and its proclamation in Nice were an innovation and made this a seminal text in the field of human rights.
It is now up to the European Parliament, in cooperation with the national parliaments, to ensure that the Member States and even the European institutions respect fundamental rights.
The Cornillet rapport closely follows the structure of the Charter and divides fundamental rights into six separate chapters, as has already been pointed out, and rightly so, by Commissioner Vitorino.
The report first of all states the importance of respecting human dignity by affirming the right to life, specifically by stepping up the fight against terrorism, by banning torture and inhumane treatment, slavery and forced labour.
The report then examines freedoms, specifically in the protection of private life and personal information - and I hope that both the Community and the Member States adopt the necessary measures to protect the public from intrusions by illegal communication interception systems, such as Echelon. It examines respect for freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and improving European citizenship and justice, which involves speeding up judicial processes.
The slowness of justice is in itself a factor for injustice: by the courts not resolving the problems put before them in due time, the feeling of being able to commit crimes with impunity spreads.
My country, Portugal, is no exception and suffers unacceptable delays within its judicial system.
This Europe of ours must be a model in this field. It must set an example.
The European Parliament is an essential actor in the design and practical application of the Union' s policy on human rights.
Its influence in ensuring that treaties are amended with those rights in mind is becoming increasingly evident.
We must therefore pay close attention to the human rights situation in Member States when shortcomings are revealed in our systems.
In my home town of Lyons I am confronted every day, in the most graphic terms, with the suffering of refugees and with trafficking in human beings, particularly in women.
We must therefore harmonise our legislation and adopt a legally restrictive instrument, so as to guarantee real protection for the victims of trafficking in human beings.
We ought to be able, without any problem, to extradite those who traffic in human beings, and to confiscate the profits from their criminal activities, using the proceeds to create a European compensation fund to be used to help their victims.
We ought to be able to give a humanitarian right of residence to the victims of trafficking in human beings and domestic slavery, and we ought to be able to guarantee that people who are arrested and held at police stations are given immediate access to legal and medical assistance and, where necessary, to an interpreter.
We ought to be able to obtain, as a matter of urgency, better protection for unaccompanied minors, in particular by offering them, as quickly as possible, the assistance of a tutor or legal adviser.
I should also like to ask for a certain amount of consistency in this Parliament.
If the Community' s policy on immigration, which is the subject of a report currently being examined at the committee stage, were to be based solely on the selfish economic interests of European countries, it would not really guarantee all the fundamental rights that we are defending here today.
Mr President, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights has gained in importance through the rapporteur' s proposal to use it as a touchstone to test the human rights situation in the Union.
Although the charter itself was only supposed to relate to the actions of the Union, that is, the European institutions, the Member States themselves are now being tested.
But a critical test is more than a shopping list.
In order to expose violations, it is important to quote chapter and verse.
We regard that as effective where the rest of the world is concerned, but "to name and shame" our own Member States we call undesirable stigmatisation.
We are using double standards and that must change.
A group of renowned experts should conduct research into the concrete observance of human rights in the Member States and Parliament must then draw the political conclusions.
That concludes my administrative shopping list.
My group will support the report of Mr Cornillet.
It contains a number of important declaration.
For example, in Paragraph 58 it argues that the Aznar protocol, through which the individual right to apply for asylum is restricted, must be scrapped.
Paragraph 109 calls for a guarantee that everyone in the territory of the Union is given access to health care, that is, regardless of their residential status.
This also applies to the right of children to education.
Combating this divide deserves our support.
Mr President, the author of the Cornillet Report has listed many areas in which, even within the territory of the European Union, human rights are totally or partially flouted.
We shall be voting on several proposals which might represent a certain amount of progress.
Even in those cases, however, we are anxious to express our reservations, insofar as these are recommendations, which the countries concerned will either observe or not, as they choose.
Yet in matters concerning commercial law, the legislature knows how to be more stringent.
In its explanatory statement, the report refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights which was proclaimed at Nice, where much praise was lavished on a text which combines civil and political rights and economic and social rights as if they formed a consistent whole.
Yet what are proclamations on employment rights worth, when company bosses have a 'divine right' to hire and fire?
What is the point of having the right of residence, when the report itself admits that 11,8 % of the population of the European Union are living below the poverty threshold, and therefore do not have the means to provide themselves with suitable housing?
We shall be abstaining on the whole of this report, because declarations of good intentions are not enough to constitute a policy that will benefit the lowest and most oppressed strata of the population.
Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Wuori on his report, a very exhaustive report ranging from arms dealing, homosexuality and the rights of minorities to asylum, child labour and capital punishment.
Perhaps indeed a little too exhaustive.
Perhaps in future we should prioritise more and coordinate the timing of such a report better with the annual meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
One positive point at least is that attention is paid to the press and to press freedom.
Journalists are still being persecuted and murdered all over the world and the recent developments in Russia are particularly disturbing.
Independent journalists are attacked, dismissed and even physically eliminated.
The independent television station NTV was taken over by the state corporation Gazprom, which also forced a prominent daily newspaper to close.
I particularly welcome Mr Wuori' s idea of nominating a special parliamentary representative to follow up the specific violations of human rights on which we debate and vote here every month.
Identifying violations is one thing, monitoring them and doing something about them and especially encouraging the Council and the Commission to take up the matter is another.
Allow me to say that the Swedish presidency somewhat disappointed us on this point.
The assertive action of the Belgian government in the Pinochet case, but also in Central Africa, awakens high expectations among those arguing for a more pro-active human rights policy in the European Union.
Especially now that the United States has been voted off the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Europe must play a leading role.
If the Council and the Commission really do take steps in the direction of a more consistent and more coherent human rights policy, they will definitely find a convinced ally in the European Parliament.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Wuori on this magnificent report.
I believe his report is up to the challenge of responding to economic globalisation through a proposed globalisation of political and social human rights, since they are indivisible, and democratic principles.
The essential thing is to know whether the European Union has the instruments to implement that globalisation of rights and, above all, whether it is prepared to use them.
Take, for example, the European Union' s role in the United Nations and the Geneva Commission, which is often weak and even contradictory.
Also, what can be done within the World Trade Organisation which, by the way, is going to meet in Qatar, a world leader in human rights, as the whole world knows.
Also, in the use of the democratic clause with third countries, in which the European Parliament should have a clear role, regulated by the Treaty, and, of course, in bilateral dialogue and in the use of the code of conduct on the export of arms, a code which is still nothing more than a proposal and a suggestion and which does not stop Member States from committing aberrations by selling arms to countries which systematically violate human rights.
The rights of peoples are also human rights.
In this regard, I believe that collective rights cannot be forgotten either, starting with the right to self-determination.
I would like to fly the flag here by asking the Government of Morocco to fully respect the rights of the Saharan people who live in its country' s occupied territories.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Wuori and Mr Cornillet on their reports and the excellent work they have done.
However, I regret that Mr Wuori' s report does not refer to the situation of one of the most violated fundamental rights and the most forgotten: the right to education, to receiving essential basic training as a means for escaping the underdevelopment and poverty which so many children and adults are condemned to living in because they are not guaranteed this fundamental right.
In fact, according to Unicef data, 130 million children have never been to school and a further 150 million have started primary education but have left it before becoming fully literate.
In sub-Saharan Africa, furthermore, the figure for children not attending school is increasing, rather than decreasing.
This is in spite of the objectives set by the World Conference on Education for All at Jomtien, in 1990, or at the World Education Forum which took place in Dakar in 2000.
Given this situation, we cannot close our eyes, nor ignore the lack of political will of the European Union and its Member States when it comes to translating the rhetoric of great declarations into budgetary contributions.
If we say we are going to defend human rights, we must also defend the right to education at all costs.
With the same vigour with which we defend the right to life or the right to non-discrimination or the right to freedom of expression.
Let us not forget that human rights are indivisible, inalienable and universal.
Mr President, does a peasant suffering from AIDS have the right to access medicine and treatment that he cannot afford?
Does a child born in poverty have the human right to receive basic education and appropriate vaccines to protect him from killer diseases?
Does a peasant farmer devastated by natural disasters such as drought, pests and soil erosion have the right to our assistance?
Do millions of people living in misery for political reasons in isolated countries like Palestine and Iraq have any rights?
What do we mean when we talk about human rights?
I urge every colleague concerned with human rights to visit, unannounced and informally, any peasant in any poor country and ask him about our views on human rights, political freedom, economic freedom, religious freedom, free access to education and health services.
That peasant will look at you in bewilderment and plead: "All I need is a supply of fresh water to my house.
All I need is a source of energy so that I can light my house and cook the next meal".
Internal conflict and civil war resulting in violation of human rights will continue to impoverish the poor until we help them to do the following.
Firstly, to have a stake in their rural economies.
They need to own their own land, their home and their farm.
And secondly, to acquire the technology to break the cycle of dependency on us and seize the opportunity to be self-sufficient, self-reliant through their own local enterprise.
When the poor have an economic stake, then civil society and democracy will take root.
These people will see the need for law and order and political representation.
Then you will see the courts replacing the bullet - and that is when we will see human rights.
Mr President, unfortunately I was not in the chamber when the content of the human rights report was being discussed.
At that moment, we had a problem outside with a small group of people who do not agree with the situation in the Turkish prisons.
This was why I was not in the chamber.
However, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, for his report, as he offers a good approach with this report.
I am particular impressed by its structure.
We have already talked about this.
It is quite right to link this report with the human rights charter.
This is certainly the right decision and was undoubtedly a tremendous challenge, and there will have to be a great many further amendments.
We all agree on this.
In terms of its content, however, I should also like to comment on what we have witnessed around Parliament today.
In his report, Mr Cornillet has addressed the situation of prisons in the European Union.
I should simply like briefly to remind us all of one thing: we often visit other countries and criticise the accession countries, especially about conditions in prisons.
Conditions in prisons in the accession countries are unacceptable, in our view.
Yet reading through Mr Cornillet' s report, it is apparent that we have a great many problems with our own prisons in our own countries.
This should not merely be noted down by you on paper: the governments in the European Union must take steps to address this situation.
In any event, some thought must be given to this issue as well.
Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Wuori, for his excellent report.
Slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, but now it is estimated that people are being sold from their countries at a rate of four million a year, and the number is growing.
The global markets are so free that human bodies now have a market value.
The violent trade in human organs focuses on the poor.
Some poor people positively rise from their graves, in a manner of speaking, when their organs are transplanted into living people.
The problem is also that human rights violations have become ever more profitable and, in a society of greed, it takes money to protect human rights.
We therefore face the sort of problem that results from greed.
The most widespread is the numbing of the human brain in the name of business.
The global mass entertainment of television creates a false world, a virtual world, where every kind of business or trade flourishes and the importance of democracy is diminished.
The international sex trade has acquired an excellent tool in the Internet. Legislation lags behind because many people think the freedom of the Internet should not be restricted.
I suggest that we establish a European body to make rules for the protection of privacy in the information society era.
The notion of human rights will not work where they are being violated both mentally and physically.
Mr President, the annual report on human rights in the world shows a good grasp of what is currently at stake.
However, the European Union must state more clearly the action it intends to take in three areas.
First of all, history shows us how difficult it is to ensure that human rights are respected in countries where economic development does not exist or is extremely poor.
This evidence should be given greater emphasis.
This means that we should create a global-development methodology, bringing together converging criteria, centred around a principle which I shall refer to as the 'evolutionary principle' .
Secondly, the report points the finger at a number of countries which do not respect human rights.
If we are to avoid falling into the trap of having one law for the rich and another for the poor, and in order to ensure that any action taken by Europe has credibility, we should place greater emphasis on the inseparability of human rights within and outside the boundaries of a state.
Finally, we must acknowledge the special responsibility of those countries which have achieved a high level of democracy and development but which, instead of setting an example, cynically continue to disregard human rights.
The developed countries must set an example to the developing countries, and not the other way round.
Our action will be on a long-term basis.
We must insist, loudly and clearly, that human rights are a universal value and do not depend on circumstances.
With that in mind, it is absolutely essential that Europe should think about setting up a programme of project study and development in the area of human rights, which will take our political will into account.
That is the price that Europe will have to pay in order to gain credibility.
Mr President, given the small amount of time available to me, I am not going to waste a single second on rhetoric or demagoguery and, therefore, I am going to concentrate on issues which, from my point of view, are more significant.
I would firstly like to say that I completely agree with Commissioner Vitorino when he says that the European Union should first teach by example and then preach.
I also wish to congratulate Mr Cornillet on the excellent work he has done, despite a lack of resources.
His work clearly reflects the fact that within the European Union there are still groups and people who suffer discrimination, whose fundamental rights are not properly respected.
I therefore believe that we must make greater efforts in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, as well as Article 13, after Amsterdam, since those groups mentioned in Article 13 are still suffering discrimination and a lack of respect for their fundamental rights.
I am referring to issues as regrettable as racism, which still takes place in the Member States; discrimination as a result of the sexual orientation of certain groups, specifically homosexuals, who still suffer legislative discrimination in certain Member States; the protection of disabled people; women, that vast group that suffers discrimination; and immigrants, which this report reveals to be the new group which suffers the greatest discrimination.
Unlike some speakers, I would like to say that I am in favour of recognising the right to vote of immigrants, who only then will enjoy sufficient respect for their rights.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Wuori for his sound and critical report.
Sound and critical, for he does not shrink back from pinpointing any sensitive areas in EU policy.
One of those areas concerns fact that a number of international Union agreements still do not contain clauses for deferring an agreement in the event of a serious human rights violation.
I should like to quote China in this connection, candidate for the 2008 Olympic Games.
Commissioner Lamy has been hard at work concluding an agreement with China, also mainly within the WTO framework.
But this coming Thursday, a widely supported motion will be discussed which will ask the Olympic Committee not to give China the Olympic Games in 2008, precisely in the light of human rights violations in Tibet, among others, and on account of the dubious way in which the country treats its flora and fauna.
In fact, I support Mr Wuori in his opinion that our Parliament should be involved in the suspension of relations with third countries on account of irresponsible behaviour in terms of human rights.
Moreover, our Parliament has been the initiator in this field on more than one occasion.
I would refer to EU measures in the past against Nigeria and at present against Sudan and Burma.
However, I should like to take the opportunity of drawing your attention to another point which, in my opinion, was neglected in the report, namely the freedom of religion.
I will give you three examples.
One is close to home, namely Turkey, where Syrian Christians are still being put behind bars if they actively profess their religion.
The Netherlands has a community of 12 000 Syrian Christians from Turkey who have fled to Western Europe over the years.
Surely that is very worrying for a country that would like to join the European Union.
Then there is Vietnam, where over the past few months, Buddhist monks have increasingly been arrested on religious grounds.
We will be discussing a resolution on this very topic on Thursday.
And what is, as a matter of interest, the state of play with regard to the trade agreements with Vietnam?
Then there is the continuous threat in respect of the Christians in Indonesia, especially on the Moluccas.
That problem has also been highlighted in this House on several occasions, but what is the latest on the trade agreements, and what exactly is going on in that country in terms of human rights?
I wish that next time we could address this point in isolation, and that is the message that I should like to drive home.
Mr President, it is a tragedy, in the Europe of the 21st century, that there are so many serious problems with violations of human rights, as we have heard in Mr Cornillet' s excellent report.
If human rights are to be respected in practice rather than merely in declarations, we need to defend them vigorously against the hated dark, reactionary forces which hamper dialogue and freedom of thought and conscience.
The Union should, once and for all, find policies and ways and means of wiping out all forms of discrimination based on sex, ethnic origin, colour, religion or sexual orientation.
No cultural tradition can gain recognition if it puts itself above fundamental human rights and equality of the sexes.
We urgently need to wipe out xenophobia, fundamentalism and racial violence and to crush phenomena such as slavery, trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of women and children which stigmatise our civilisation.
We also need to create the mechanisms needed to monitor and apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to give moral and financial support to organisations fighting for human rights, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims.
Mr President, when Europe' s leaders go on state visits, they take weighty political baggage with them.
The focus is on economic relations, trade agreements, financial assistance, and so on.
Ecological issues are seldom dealt with, while human rights are a peripheral issue.
Yet human rights and the rule of law are the foundation of our society.
My experiences with Asia, from India via Nepal to Korea, show that our commitment to human rights awakens great hopes among citizens there, among the disadvantaged, the excluded, the persecuted, and families and children.
They invest their hopes in our resolution and active involvement on the ground, although we must include the NHO, our competent partner in dialogue, at a much earlier stage in this process.
Their hopes are also awakened by our partnership agreements with the human rights clauses.
These agreements are suspended if massive and systematic human rights violations take place.
This is an effective way of bringing pressure to bear.
The more resolutely we address specific problems, the clearer it becomes that human rights are not a Western but a universal concept.
Our approach does not constitute impermissible intervention in the internal affairs of states, but necessary action against racism, torture, exploitation and the death penalty.
Commissioner, the European Union must take on a far more pro-active and leading role on human rights issues at international level.
Was enough achieved at the 57th Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, for example?
The EU Member States were united in their support for the United States' initiative to put the ongoing human rights violations in China on the agenda.
However, there was no support from Africa or South America in the overall vote, although we certainly have traditional alliance partners there.
In advance of important decisions, the European Union therefore needs a far better coordinated strategy so that our commitment to human rights is much more successful in future.
I welcome today' s debate and the European Commission' s long-awaited communication on human rights.
I particularly welcome the commitment to give real substance to the human rights clauses in our trade and partnership agreements with third countries - something we badly failed to do with Mexico.
I also welcome a number of the specific country statements in the draft resolution, including our strong call for the dismantling of paramilitary groups in Columbia.
I share our strong statement of support and solidarity for human rights organisations and defenders, who risk their lives daily in conflict situations around the world to defend principles, which we hold dear.
I have three specific points I want to raise in the context of the debate.
Firstly, whilst I welcome the commitment in the communication to appeal to European enterprises to do more to respect human rights, reflected in paragraphs 55 and 92 of our resolution, I have to say to the Commission that I am disappointed that the Relex DGs appear to have opted out of the draft Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility.
I ask them to revisit that before it is too late.
Words should be followed by action.
Secondly, I welcome, and I call for wider attention to, paragraph 108, concerning human rights abuses against disabled people.
The organisation Disability Awareness in Action has recorded over 2,000 such abuses within Europe and they should be dealt with by human rights monitoring organisations and by the Commission.
Finally, I welcome paragraph 16 which calls for a review of the way we deal with human rights issues in Parliament.
Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their fine and excellent work.
At the same time, I would like to agree with Mrs Maij-Weggen' s view that religious freedom has been addressed in a far too limited manner.
This issue concerns the deepest values of millions of people and the whole basis for their lives.
In Egypt, a neighbour of the EU, converting from Islam to Christianity is punishable by death.
The Coptic Christians feel like second-class citizens.
The Christian minority in Turkey continues to shrink.
Why are an increasing number of people of the Christian faith moving from this country?
The European Parliament played an important part in ensuring that Syrian Christian priest Yusuf Akbulut was acquitted of all charges in the State Security Court in Diyarbakir at Easter.
There is much to do in this area.
Three hundred thousand people have left the Moluccas - most of them Christians.
They are persecuted by Muslim Jihad fighters.
Compulsory conversion has taken place with over 1 000 people being forced into a faith and view of life other than their own.
I would also like to say that the French act on religious freedom leaves a great deal to be desired.
There is considerable concern among many Protestant and evangelical Christians around Europe regarding the implications of French legislation on religion.
What a poor - and I mean poor - example this is for a large number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic, as these countries are about to adopt new legislation.
We must be careful to ensure that we do not create an intolerant Europe where only one faith is acceptable.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the fact that we are running late, I shall be very brief, but please allow me to state how important this moment is for me.
As a former Member of this Parliament, between 1994 and 1999, it is naturally a great honour to be here in this totally new hemisphere, back in this institution which is so familiar, and be able to take the floor.
On behalf of the Council, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Wuori and Mr Cornillet very warmly on their sterling report, and I should also like to thank all the speakers for their contribution to the debate.
From now on I will confine myself to answering the very specific questions that have been raised.
To Mrs Frassoni, who is no longer here, but I shall say it anyway, I should like to assure her that the presidency will naturally make every effort to ensure that all the necessary conditions are in place so that a resolution against the death penalty can be tabled at the United Nations General Assembly.
To Mrs Boudjenah, on the subject of Tunisia, I should like to say, briefly, that the Council takes the view that it really is a pity that a country which has made such remarkable social and economic progress should be denied the credit that it deserves, simply because those who are in charge are apparently incapable of understanding that, to us and to their own population, elements such as freedom of expression and freedom of the press are essential, and it is precisely this situation which is preventing the European Union from pushing further ahead with the Tunisian model, which would be worth doing if only the situation with regard to human rights and the treatment of the human rights league was considerably better than it is at the moment.
(NL) To Mr SchrÃ¶der, I should like to say that during this presidency, human rights will not, under any circumstances, be a footnote.
One of the honourable Members has already alluded to the fact that Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Michel, has already left.
I can reassure that Member: Mr Michel has not simply disappeared, he left to catch a plane to Madrid where crucial discussions will be held concerning the presidency.
For the rest, I should like to assure Parliament that during the next six months, the fight against the trafficking in human beings in general, and the fight against the trafficking in women and children, in particular, will be one of our key priorities.
I should like to thank Mr Johan Van Hecke for his kind words regarding our presidency, and I hope that we will be able to meet his expectations.
I have to say that the aims are rather ambitious, but we will do our best.
Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr SacrÃ©deus, it goes without saying that, in our view, freedom of religion is one of the fundamental rights and freedoms.
We are running out of time so I will just say that, on behalf of my colleague, Chris Patten, who had to leave because he is attending at the same time another parliamentary meeting on Latin America and on my own behalf I would like to thank all participants in the debate.
The Commission is taking note of all the remarks and is looking forward to the resolutions that will conclude these debates as guidelines for our reflection and further action.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Parliament on the broad consensus that has been expressed on the new methodology of the report on Fundamental Rights in the European Union, and express my wish that the approach which has been launched by Mr Cornillet will be retained for the future.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
You have been almost excessive in your brevity.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Bonn Conference on Climate Change
The next item is the joint debate on the oral Questions Nos B5-0327/2001 and B5-0328/2001 by Mrs Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to the Council and the Commission, on the Commission' s strategy for the Bonn Conference on Climate Change.
Mr President, I apologise for my lateness.
Human rights seem to have been taking up quite a lot of time, and quite right too.
I want to express Parliament' s concern that the Kyoto Protocol may falter and fail, leaving the world without any coherent network of obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
We in the European Parliament offer our full support to the Commission and to the presidency in their endeavours to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol survives and comes into force.
We would like to use this brief debate to explore what Europe can do to lead the world in the absence of American leadership and in what ways the Members of the European Parliament who attend the Bonn Conference can speak for the people of Europe and actively participate in the proceedings.
We very much appreciate the work of the Dutch Minister, Mr Pronk, in seeking to find a way to solve the unresolved issues left over from The Hague, and we would appreciate it if the Commission could give us its view on how successful he has been to date and whether or not the work he has done has now cleared the way forward.
But the big question for us is whether it will be possible to show that the European Union, and the other major parties to the Protocol, are prepared to take decisions without the United States.
Here the attitude of the new Japanese government is crucial.
Without the votes of Japan and Canada the Protocol cannot enter into force.
We gather that the omens are not good and that Japan probably, and Canada certainly, lack the political will to go ahead without the United States.
If Japan is prepared to go ahead, then there is the suspicion that the Japanese may want to re-write the crucial proposals within the protocol, notably using the year 2000 perhaps rather than 1990 as the base year for calculating greenhouse gas emission reductions.
One of my colleagues, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who will be leading Parliament' s delegation to Bonn, wishes to move an oral amendment on this point to the resolution we have tabled, since the problem with Japan has really only come to the fore in the period since we tabled it.
Our resolution reiterates in paragraph 3 our basic expectations about the action that will follow ratification of the protocol.
But as Europeans we must make a sober assessment of what this will mean for us if it were to happen and still more if it were to happen without the United States.
First and most crucially: money.
As the protocol stands, financial contributions from individual parties will be based on each party' s share of CO2 emissions.
It is not difficult to see that the United States, with 39% of the total 1990 emissions, would pay the lion' s share.
The question that occurs to me, which should perhaps have been asked earlier, is how the Clinton government ever thought it could persuade Congress to sign up to the Treaty.
Perhaps greater honesty at the outset might have helped provide a more realistic atmosphere.
Without the United States the burden will fall on Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and Australia.
The finance available for measures to reduce CO2 emissions in poorer countries will be greatly reduced without US participation.
The strain on the Europeans will be greater.
Are we prepared for this, I ask?
Secondly, if we ratify Kyoto alone or without the United States it will mean taking certain actions that are going to be painful.
We MEPs who follow these issues recognise that.
Every year, every month, far into the night, we deal with directives designed to reduce emissions, but we also know that in most instances when we encounter the Council or their representatives it is extremely difficult to get the Member States to agree to these proposals in their original, very demanding form.
We now face a situation where, according to the European Environment Agency, only the United Kingdom, Germany and Luxembourg reduced their greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 1998.
All the other countries of Europe increased them.
So how will Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Sweden and France, meet the Kyoto targets?
Or will we, as the United States suspects, not be willing to take the actions that will give reality to our ambitions?
We hope that the Bonn Conference and the Belgian presidency will be able to move the Europeans on from words to action.
Finally a word on the participation of the EU delegation in the Bonn conference.
We are tired of being a Greek chorus in this tragedy.
We are tired of coming on to stage when the main action has taken place to lament or celebrate what has happened and to offer philosophical reflections on the sad state of mankind - "ÃÃÃ¬Ã¯Ã© Ã§ ÃŽÃÃ«Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã¡" indeed!
This is unsatisfactory because we should ourselves be reckoned as protagonists since we will have to adopt the legislation that will flow from Kyoto and we will have to explain it to the people of Europe.
We may not want to be negotiators ourselves, but our ambition is to play a full part in the meetings with the European Union delegation that decides how Europe will act.
We are not content to remain as a chorus.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Jackson for the question she has raised and the remarks she has made concerning this very serious issue indeed about which we are all concerned.
On behalf of the Council, I can only reiterate our commitment, as referred to in the Council conclusions of 8 March and 7 June 2001, to reach an agreement at the resumption session of the Conference of the Parties No 6 which is soon to take place in Bonn.
This agreement is to safeguard the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol, is to lead to an actual reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, and is to help reach the broadest possible participation of the industrialised countries. In that way, the conditions can be created for the Protocol to be reinforced and to be entered into force by no later than 2002.
We therefore confirm our commitment to try to achieve this.
All these objectives remain unchanged and the European Union is prepared to negotiate with all partners in Bonn on the unresolved issues in a constructive manner.
Although the Council recognises that the European Union and the United States do not see eye to eye concerning the Kyoto Protocol and the ratification thereof, despite this, the Council welcomes the pledge, made by President Bush during a recent meeting with the EU Heads of State and Government leaders, that the United States will not block the Kyoto process, and will cooperate during the forthcoming session of the Conference of the Parties in Bonn in a constructive manner.
During the high-level consultation of 27 and 28 June last in Scheveningen, the European Union managed to establish fruitful contacts with different partners on climate negotiations.
And the European Union was delighted to note that the international community continues to strongly support the Kyoto Protocol and its swift implementation. That is despite the United States' refusal to ratify the Protocol.
As was apparent in Scheveningen, there is a strong sense of urgency with regard to this matter and also a high level of awareness of the fact that the outcome of more than ten years of international negotiations can surely not be put on the line.
Since the Council is of the opinion that your presence is definitely significant, the Council has invited eight MEPs to take part in the Conference in Bonn.
The specific conditions for this participation, about which you may not be happy, are explained in a letter from the Council to the European Parliament of 18 November 1998.
However, given the wish of the participants for more and regular information, a wish that was underlined by Mrs Jackson, but which certainly reflects the feeling of many among you, the presidency intends to organise informal meetings with the MEPs during the conference at regular intervals, thus allowing an exchange of ideas to take place about the progress and the state of affairs.
Mrs Jackson, I am aware that this may not satisfy you entirely, but on the other hand, it does mean that you will be able to do more than just sing or lament on the sidelines or behind the scenes.
President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would like on behalf of the Commission to thank Mrs Jackson for raising such an important issue in the House.
As the President-in-Office has already said, in Gothenburg, the heads of state and government confirmed that the European Community and the Member States are determined to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
The Union' s summit reaffirmed the European Union' s aim of bringing the Protocol into force by 2002 and asked the Commission to prepare a proposal for ratification before the end of 2001.
Regrettably, the Bush administration continues to oppose the Kyoto Protocol.
At the European Union/United States Summit in Gothenburg, President Bush acknowledged the science underlying climate change and the global importance of this issue.
The United States has indicated that while they will participate actively in the resumed COP6 in Bonn, their basic position, opposing the Protocol has not changed.
We will build upon this indication that the United States does not intend to obstruct the Kyoto process.
To facilitate this, we have agreed that there will be further high-level contacts with the United States on this subject.
The resumed COP6 in July will pick up the threads of the conference in The Hague and try and bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.
To achieve this, the European Union will take a positive attitude while, at the same time, being realistic about what can be achieved.
The new consolidated texts by the Chairman of COP6, Mr Pronk, are clear and concise and provide a good basis for the Bonn negotiations.
However, the texts still contain a number of important sticking points for the European Union, notably on funding for developing countries, compliance and supplementarity.
These need to be resolved.
In the end, we will strive for an overall package where compromises on one side are balanced out by gains on the other.
We must also take into account the specific importance of Japan and Russia for the entry into force of the Protocol.
The Commission welcomes the strong interest of the European Parliament in the global problem of climate change and the participation of Members of the European Parliament in the Community delegation to the resumed COP6.
As in The Hague, the Commission and Council, the President-in-Office has explained, have proposed that the European Parliament be represented by eight Members.
In accordance with the institutional rules for their participation, the Members can attend plenary meetings, and the Commission will regularly provide information on those negotiations which are not open to observers on a regular basis to all Members of the European Parliament present at COP6.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak first of all about precisely this issue of whether or not the European Parliament delegation should participate in the European Union' s coordination meetings.
I wish to state that I was far from satisfied with the way in which the Secretary of State answered the legitimate questions asked by Caroline Jackson.
The European Parliament' s delegation is not asking for privileges. It is asking for its legitimate right to participate actively in the Bonn conference and not simply to play spear-carrier, as we did at the Hague Conference.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is more than just another environmental dossier. It has become an issue that truly symbolises the international political agenda.
If the Kyoto Protocol fails, the interpretation will be clear: States and politicians move rapidly and effectively when it comes to promoting the advantages of globalisation, but they are incapable of reaching agreement on minimising the less pleasant aspects of our social model.
The current situation could not be worse.
On the one hand, action is more urgent today than it ever has been and the measures announced recently by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change leave no room for doubt on this matter.
On the other hand, it has never been as difficult to take action as it is today: the decision by the United States has dealt a harsh blow to international efforts over the last ten years.
These factors, urgency of action, pressure from the public and the withdrawal of the United States make the Bonn Conference critical.
It will really be the moment of truth for the Kyoto Protocol.
Our position is perfectly clear: it is crucial that we limit climate change and the Kyoto Protocol - and none other - is the most appropriate political instrument for achieving this objective.
Let us, therefore, go to Bonn with the aim of concluding an agreement with as many countries as possible on the 'left overs' from Kyoto so that the Protocol can be ratified and implemented in 2002.
In order for the negotiations to be successful, in particular with Japan and Russia, we will clearly have to be flexible, but in a way that respects the integrity and the spirit of the Protocol.
I should like to say one last word about economic issues.
It is true that, in the short term, implementing the Protocol will result in economic costs to European businesses.
Nevertheless, these costs, as we read only this week in the Commission' s report, will be much lower than was initially thought.
I am, in fact, convinced that in the medium term, the Kyoto Protocol will make the European economy more competitive as a result of the technological transformation that we will achieve earlier than elsewhere in the world.
Mr President, the applause from all groups for Ms Jackson' s speech shows that in Europe, there is consensus on climate policy.
There is obviously some sort of consensus in public opinion in the USA as well, but public opinion in the USA is different from Europe' s.
This is why I believe we should not only be talking to one or two parliamentarians or government representatives; the Europeans should actually be thinking how they can influence public opinion in the USA, and indeed in Japan, if the Japanese decide not to go ahead.
The task of managing climate change is so enormous that going it alone will be extremely difficult.
That is precisely the issue which arises here.
Even if the others do not go ahead, are we prepared to continue the course agreed at Gothenburg, which I support?
Making a verbal commitment is easy.
Agreeing to take on these burdens is simple and costs nothing.
However, translating this into reality will be an immensely difficult task.
My fear - I admit this quite openly - is that the Europeans, or many Europeans, will hide behind the US.
In truth, we are a long way off meeting the standards set in the Kyoto Protocol.
We all know that.
The Commission feeds us a never-ending stream of fresh statistics.
We face a Herculean task - I just want to make this clear.
Despite these difficulties, however, let me say that for the first time since the Second World War, Europe now has the opportunity to take on political leadership at world level.
We should grasp this opportunity with both hands, well aware that this is not a simple task.
Incidentally, it is a noble task, not a dirty job, which Europe should address, and if others do not join us until later, we should accept this with good grace.
My third comment relates to the text itself.
I cannot stop myself from saying this: I must point out that what we are demanding, namely "halting" climate change, is sheer nonsense, of course.
I have no idea how this slipped into the text.
There has always been climate change, but this time, we are making our own contribution to it, and that is exactly what this is all about.
I would like to start by paying tribute to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, the Commissioner for the Environment.
I do not think any of the parliamentarians have any doubt at all about her passionate personal commitment towards trying to secure a positive outcome from the talks in Bonn, and I would also like to say a word of thanks to my Liberal colleague, Prime Minister Verhofstadt, for the emphasis he placed this morning on saying that the problem of climate change is the greatest single challenge facing the planet.
One thing that this whole issue has brought about - if it was needed - is a great awareness that this is a very small planet upon which we live and that mankind is very capable, through its industrial practices, of changing our environment.
Even the United States now recognises this, although they have yet to come up with an alternative in any practical form to the Kyoto Protocol.
There are great opportunities for, and advantages in, addressing this problem by using technology which is in the process of being developed or has been developed to change our practices and reduce global warming.
This offers great benefits to society, and economic opportunities for those of us who take a lead, but why are we not able to pursue this more effectively?
One problem is vested interests - the classic example being the fossil fuel industries; another is weak political leadership by all of us - we are all responsible for this.
We back down over taking decisions which will be unpopular in the short term with our electorates.
I wish to see harmonised environmental taxation at a European level - the objective being not to raise more money but to change practices and priorities and ensure that industry at the same time is able to compete on a level playing field.
We have had the problems - we have experienced the problems with fuel duty in Britain and elsewhere whenever politicians try really to apply taxes which benefit the environment in this way.
The odd thing of course, in Britain' s case, is that harmonised energy taxation on fuel duties would also probably reduce our taxes.
I have just returned from a visit to Cyprus - one of the accession countries - where I find out that not only is there no fuel duty on the use of petrol but that petrol is actually subsidised.
So, my question to the Commission is this: when it comes to practical forms, when it comes to actually dealing with what I hope will be a positive outcome from Bonn, how does the Council pursue harmonised energy taxation at the same time as dealing with enlargement, which makes the possibility of unanimity so much more difficult to achieve if it we were actually to have harmonised environmental taxation of a sort which is worth having.
Mr President, over the past two years, more wind-energy capacity has been installed worldwide than nuclear energy.
Despite this, Messrs Bush and Blair are trying to breathe new life into nuclear energy.
Along with a clear majority in the European Parliament, my group believes that nuclear energy should not, and cannot, play a role in solving the climate problem, not even in the "clean development" mechanism.
On all other scores - I repeat, all other scores - the Greens can accept a compromise in Bonn.
That compromise must aim to keep Japan on board.
Even a higher reduction target for Europe is to be considered.
The Commission has recently published a study which shows that a reduction target which is twice as high as the current one is not a problem for us economically speaking.
Europe must now seriously look into renewable energy and saving energy.
A further development of solar energy is desperately needed to provide electricity to the last two billion people on this earth.
Providing two billion people with electricity generated by fossil fuels would spell an uncertain climate death to us all.
A weak agreement in Bonn is better than another fiasco.
The 1987 Treaty of Montreal protecting the ozone layer was also a weak agreement, but over the past fourteen years, it has been tightened up on every occasion.
We could adopt the same approach with the Kyoto Protocol.
Mr President, there is great unanimity here on our position regarding climate issues, which I believe is extremely important.
We must use this unanimity to put maximum pressure on those countries which are now deciding the future of the Kyoto Protocol.
In practice, we risk some sort of collapse in climate negotiations, a collapse which would risk setting us back several years.
The worst thing is that those causing the collapse, particularly the US, have no alternative to offer.
Therefore, everything must now be done to save whatever can be saved.
The European Union itself has a credibility problem because, as previous speakers have said, many of our Member States will not meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, either.
We know that these requirements in themselves are insufficient to combat the problem of climate change.
What we see in practice when we meet the Council of Ministers, for example in conciliation on combustion plants and national ceilings for emissions, is that no-one is prepared to take the decisions which need to be taken.
By the time a decision was to be made in Gothenburg on a strategy for sustainable development, many of the most important points had been removed.
Of course the EU' s credibility would also increase if we showed by our actions that we are prepared to meet the targets we set ourselves.
I believe this is important ahead of the meetings which we are about to have with other countries in order to decide the future of the Kyoto Protocol.
I would like, first of all, to compliment Mrs Jackson for raising this oral question.
It has already been mentioned that the Conference for Climate Change will be held in Bonn from 16-27 July 2001.
We know that the US Government and the European Union could not reach agreement in the Netherlands before Christmas on setting a timetable for the reduction of the use of greenhouse gases.
Equally, it is very clear that the US Government is getting cold feet on the Kyoto Agreement.
This is very disappointing.
There is clear and unequivocal scientific evidence that demonstrates the effect of climate change.
Surely, the US and the European Union governments can agree on one item, and that is simply that the use of greenhouse gases depletes the ozone layer which results in higher sea levels and more coastal erosion, and affects the living environment of island communities.
I am calling on the European governments which will be represented in Bonn to use this conference as an opportunity to tell the US that this is not good enough, and that the full provisions of the Kyoto Agreement must be implemented: under the Agreement alone, the US Government would be required to cut emissions by approximately one-third by the year 2012.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question that at this time of disappointment and rejection for the European Union given the attitude of the United States towards compliance with the Kyoto commitments, the European Parliament must unequivocally reaffirm and reinforce its commitment to making progress on the reduction of CO2 emissions through the ratification of the measures proposed in the protocol.
Having agreed in 1997 on an international strategy for reducing polluting emissions, we cannot accept such a drastic and important change in approach towards the situation, which gives credence to arguments which, under a scientific veneer, intend to postpone the intensity and force of specific actions.
Furthermore, I believe that this proposed resolution is a necessary gesture by the European Parliament towards the Member States as an expression of the renewal of a political will in each of them to combat climate change and to intensify the establishment of the mechanisms necessary for the ratification of the protocol.
At the next climate summit in Bonn, the Member States will have to respond to the key points which were left unresolved at The Hague.
I believe it is essential that at least the leader or 'vice-leader' of the parliamentary delegation should be accepted as part of the European Union' s negotiating team.
Therefore, and in order to take the next step of negotiating with other countries a rapid ratification of the protocol, it is so important that this Parliament should unite in supporting the present proposal, renewing, as I have said, the European Union' s will for international leadership in the field of the environment and as a gesture towards the Member States, so that they do not forget or delay the implementation on a national level of the measures necessary for the ratification of the protocol.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said in this House a number of times, and it is not unimportant: there is wide unanimity across the political divide on this issue, and you must support it in the forthcoming negotiations in Bonn.

That is not all: for many European issues, we have to battle against public opinion, but in this debate, we have the backing of a huge majority of the public opinion which is urging governments to take further steps in Kyoto.
That means that on the eve of Bonn, we have to propose a number of measures at the Conference, but also at Community and national level.
As has been said a few times, we can, and must, as Europe, play a global role in this debate.
This role suits us without a doubt, and largely discredits others, of course, including Mr Bush and his administration.
We must also try to bring the others on board, that we must definitely do, but not by putting concluded agreements at risk.
If the Protocol is adopted with unlimited trade in hot air or unlimited use of coal pits, the effect on the climate will be limited.
I should like to add one point to the debate.
I do not think there is room for complacency.
We have not yet ratified the Protocol either, nor have we completed any clear, concrete plans of action.
I would therefore urge the Belgian presidency to tackle this issue with both hands.
In what form will we be trading our emissions?
Will this be done among States, or also among businesses?
And how will the trade among sectors be regulated?
And also, what is the latest on the national plans of action?
What are we going to do about them, and have any budgets been earmarked in this connection?
I should therefore ask the Belgian presidency to address this matter properly in the next couple of months.
Although some sceptics still doubt the phenomenon of global warming, nobody can doubt the cooling of relations between the EU and the US over its refusal to recommend ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
The intergovernmental panel on climate change has no doubt that there is global warming taking place and that greenhouse gases, in particular CO2 emissions, are largely responsible.
Even the US National Academy of Sciences advising President Bush largely concurs with this finding.
The EU is now determined to go it alone, but the biggest culprit, the US, with 4% of the world' s population and 25% of global emissions, still will not co-operate.
Sadly, to date, only Romania has ratified the Protocol.
Japan and Canada are now getting cold feet without US involvement.
In my country, the UK, under a Conservative Government, we made a dash for gas, since natural gas produces far less CO2 than coal.
We went on to see it rapidly reversed by the new Labour Government, anxious to preserve jobs in the mining industry.
Mercifully the UK is still online to meet its Kyoto commitments.
We are already witnessing in European winter resorts in the mountains the effects of the rising snow line, but the long-term prospects are far more frightening.
At some point, there is a danger of thermal runaway as the polar caps melt, reflect less sunshine and cause a rapid increase in atmospheric warming.
This threatens flooding around the globe and other climatic changes causing economic devastation with huge migratory pressures on peoples, not to mention potential wars over water supplies.
What is the solution?
I believe that all nations must subscribe to policies of sustainable economic development and invest in renewable energy sources.
This also means reopening the controversial nuclear power debate, which I support.
We must also look at using market-based mechanisms, such as tradeable emission permits.
The Kyoto 5% targeted reduction by 2010 from 1990 levels may not go far enough.
We may also have to look again at carbon sinks.
I believe that the US must reconsider its position and come back to Bonn with some really good proposals.
I congratulate my colleague, Mrs Jackson on her continuing interest in this critical area for the future of mankind.
Mr President, the world needs a powerful, political signal.
Kyoto should not remain an empty pledge.
Political leadership is now required to win over the world.
We need to display the necessary flexibility in this respect.
First of all, with regard to the United States and Japan.
We have to abandon the emphasis on domestic action.
We must work towards a science-based approach of the 'sinks' problem.
Secondly, with regard to the developing countries, climate changes impact greatly on the developing countries.
The effects are being felt in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the island states.
We desperately need a warm-hearted approach to developing countries, and a fund that allows for adjustments being made.
We must realise that if the United States does not take part, the incentive for the developing countries will actually be taken away, for it is precisely the United States that wanted to realise a large proportion of their duties outside of the US.
The European Union now has to assume this role, and do more for the developing countries.
Needless to say, the developing countries will in time need to be included in system of CO2 reductions, but then on the basis of equal emission rights.
Thirdly, we must commit ourselves to taking domestic action seriously and not to promoting nuclear energy.
We must now take swift action and launch a credible and reliable system for the trade in emission rights, and within Europe, we must set up a research agenda to make the transition to a low-CO2 economy possible.
Mr President, the EU delegation did not show itself to its best advantage in The Hague.
Indecisiveness and dissension contributed to the failure of The Hague.
Parliamentarians could play a role if they gain permission to attend the delegation meetings as observers.
As the President-in-Council stated a moment ago, we sang and lamented behind the scenes, but to no avail.
Therefore, we now want to be admitted in the delegation as observers, and we believe that this can strengthen the unity within the European Union.
Mr President, there is a great temptation in politics to consider everything to be a matter of negotiation which can be agreed on amongst people.
So that we might remember what we are dealing with, I will reiterate a few facts about climatic warming.
I would like to remind you that there is now ample scientific proof regarding this matter, and that climatic warming is a hard fact.
There is just one party we have to negotiate with, and that is nature, which does not make compromises. It just is.
The latest time series analyses of seawater temperatures say the same as what we have known about air temperatures for a long time.
During the last hundred years the seas have warmed up by 0.6 degrees, and the trend is accelerating.
In terms of average temperatures this is a very great change.
Glaciers are melting; 85% of them are receding at a very fast rate, as much as several tens of metres a year at their worst.
The Andean ice caps are in danger of disappearing altogether.
The polar icecaps have shrunk by 25% in the last three years.
In northern areas of continents the permafrost is melting at a dramatic rate, especially in central Siberia and Alaska.
This also has large-scale effects on the exploitation of natural resources in these regions.
If we allow global warming to continue, the dreaded, worst-case scenario in northwestern Europe may well take place. Warming could divert North Atlantic sea currents, causing northern Fennoscandia to have a far more severely cold climate than it does now as a result.
As the glaciers melt, the so-called Atlantic pump will cease working and the warm Gulf Stream coming up from the tropics and its extension, the North Atlantic Current, will stop flowing.
This could result in the whole of northwestern Europe becoming colder, which palaeo-oceanographic studies show could happen suddenly, with catastrophic results.
The same facts reveal themselves in every direction.
Just recently the Red Cross confirmed what other aid organisations have been saying: experience of an increased number of natural disasters shows that the change can be put down to global warming.
Unless we act quickly and, furthermore, put pressure on others also to act quickly, these new phenomena will increase exponentially.
Bonn needs to be a success.
Mr President, a thank-you first of all to Mrs Jackson for the initiative behind the debate we are having here today.
I think that climate change is one of the best documented of any of our environmental problems and, at the same time, the biggest threat to the environment and to future generations here on earth.
That is why the US administration' s rejection of the Kyoto protocol is, of course, also completely irresponsible.
I think we have to acknowledge that Mr Bush and his administration have shown themselves to be just as primitive and populist as might have been feared.
However, that attitude in the United States ought, of course, only to give an edge to Europe' s responsibility for global environmental development, as Mr Da Silva too pointed out.
We must stick by the Kyoto Protocol at the conference in The Hague.
We must ensure that the Member States and the EU are in the vanguard of efforts to get the Protocol ratified so that it can, if possible, come into force next year. With that in mind, we must naturally try to make Japan stick to this solution.
Like Mrs Van Brempt, I would warn against entering into a sub-standard conciliation or agreement with the United States.
Experience has shown time and again that when the United States has ended up with what, in our eyes, is a really bad agreement, it fails to honour it when the time comes to implement it.
On the contrary, we in Europe must ensure that our climate change programme is implemented effectively.
As quite a few people have mentioned, we also have problems here in Europe. At the moment, we are seeing a clear negative trend in the area of transport, for example.
We must work to ensure that, given the future we are now confronting, the United States does not obtain a competitive advantage from showing the kind of irresponsibility we have seen so far.
I hope that the Bonn conference may nonetheless be a decisive step towards meeting the enormous challenge we are all facing.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, combating the catastrophic effects of climate change is the most important environmental policy challenge of our time. Indeed, I would go as far as to say that it may even be the single most important challenge overall, also beyond the parameters of environmental policy.
There is thus a great deal at stake in Bonn.
It is important, then, for the European Union to present a united front, and so I appeal to the Council and the Commission to include the parliamentary delegation in its activities and ensure that the head of our delegation, at least, is involved in coordination at EU level, as we are keen to support the Council and the Commission' s position.
Naturally, this is only possible if we are genuinely informed in detail.
The main problem, of course, is the USA' s position.
This has already been pointed out several times.
It is not enough merely to agree that the USA' s position is unacceptable.
Since gentle persuasion and appeals have not achieved very much, we must now consider how we can exert even greater pressure.
The European Union should make climate protection and the Kyoto Agreement its key priority in relations with the US.
Many of our positions differ from those of the US Government or Congress, but climate protection is the major problem, and that should be made clear.
This is why I was rather disappointed when, after Gothenburg, the message was: there is a difference of opinion, and that was it.
The EU must make it quite clear that while we may have different opinions on other issues and still carry on with the agenda, this specific topic is a priority for the EU.
Perhaps we should go as far as to make concessions in other areas in order to ensure that this priority is genuinely asserted in practice.
If the Americans are then prepared to ratify Kyoto and engage in practical cooperation in Bonn, we too should be flexible. Instead of promoting the EU' s purist doctrine, e.g. on nuclear energy, we too should be prepared to compromise.
However, a precondition is that the Americans actually commit themselves to ratifying Kyoto and pursuing the climate protection process in a positive way.
Thank you very much, Mr Liese.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission inform me, I believe with very good reason, that they have been enlightened by your speeches.
To end the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution, presented in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0329/2001). We shall examine Questions to the Council.
We only have 40 minutes.
I must reach a consensus with you for the functioning of this Question Time, because otherwise we will be in an impossible situation.
If the first Members on the list of questions speak too much, the others will be deprived of their right.
We initially have ten questions which are going to be taken together by the President-in-Office of the Council.
If we have supplementary questions, you will appreciate that that would amount to thirty questions and that there would not even be time to hold Question Time.
I am therefore going to apply Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure, which gives the President the authority to organise the debate on exceptional occasions.
If you need it, you can speak for a minute and a half instead of a minute; but please do not, each of you, ask for the floor three times with the subsequent replies.
Please do not refuse this request, ladies and gentlemen.
It is absolutely rational and necessary.
I heard your ruling, but Annex II to the Rules of Procedure says that each Member may put a supplementary to any question.
We have been economical.
We get one answer, but we should each get a supplementary.
Yes, I agree, but Rule 19 refers to such exceptional situations as today' s.
It is therefore necessary to apply the Rules of Procedure in a rational way.
If you continue raising points of order, not even the first ten questioners will be able to put their question or receive a reply.
Mr President, I would simply like to propose a rational solution to the problem.
I believe that we effectively have the right to respond to the President-in-Office' s intervention and afterwards each of us should have the right to a supplementary question.
Mr President, I propose that we all have the right to a second brief intervention which would compensate for that hypothetical supplementary question which we would otherwise have the right to.
The debate will be brief but we would conserve our rights under the Rules of Procedure.
Even with Rule 19, I have flexibility.
Therefore you can put the question again for one minute and the supplementary question, and you will have a maximum of one opportunity each; after half a minute, the microphone will be turned off.
This is my final interpretation of Rule 19.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1 to 10 will be taken together.
Question No 1 by (H-0516/01):
Subject: The Laeken Declaration The December 2000 Nice European Council approved a Declaration on the future of the Union.
The declaration calls for a wide-ranging and searching debate on the European Union' s future.
Not only the Member States but also states applying for accession, national parliaments, the European Parliament and the general public are all to be involved in that debate.
The European Council has thus improperly and in absolute disregard for the subsidiarity principle, bypassed the democratic legitimacy of the constitutionally established regions.
The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel recently repeated his intention to allow MEPs to sit also as members of the Belgian Parliament.
We welcome what Mr Michel has to say about the closer involvement of members of parliaments, provided that he also includes the elected representatives of communes and regions.
Will the Council, in deference to the subsidiarity principle, include the constitutionally established regions in the plans it is drawing up for Europe' s future?
Question No 2 by (H-0518/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration In view of the increasingly important and prominent involvement of the sub-state levels in the various EU decision-making procedures, the broad debate on the future of the Union which is taking shape mainly around the Laeken Summit should also provide answers to institutional issues relating to the involvement, from the legislative and judicial points of view, of constitutional regions (sub-state entities with their own legislative powers guaranteed under the Constitution of the State to which they belong) in the development, implementation, monitoring and assessment of EU policies.
Is the Council therefore intending to amend the Treaties (Part Five, Section 4) in such a way as to grant these regions the right to appeal direct to the Court of Justice when their prerogatives are under threat, as the Member States are able to do?
Question No 3 by (H-0520/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration It is expected that during the Belgian presidency the Laeken Declaration on the future of the EU will be adopted.
A number of Member States, including Germany, Austria, Belgium and the UK, have established mechanisms for the participation of their regional or federal bodies in Council proceedings.
Given that the autonomous regions of the Spanish state, the German and Austrian LÃ€nder and the Belgian regions possess significant powers of their own which are in many cases affected by Community decisions, does the Council support the view that the regions could be directly represented within itself?
Question No 4 by (H-0522/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration With the declaration to be made at Laeken on Saturday, 15 December, the federal state of Belgium intends to make its contribution to the debate on the future of the European Union.
In that respect, the positive stance adopted by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt on the joint political declaration by seven constitutional regions is particularly pleasing.
At the end of May, he received the regional president of Catalonia, the minister-president of Salzburg, the first minister of Scotland, the chief ministers of Flanders and Wallonia and the ministers for European/federal affairs of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, who are pressing for the role of constitutionally recognised regions in the European Union to be strengthened.
Does the Council support greater Treaty-based involvement for constitutional regions in the European project in view of the added democratic legitimacy they bring to the construction of the European Union?
If not, why is it opposed to the greater Treaty-based involvement of constitutional regions in mapping out the future of Europe?
Question No 5 by (H-0524/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU.
The IGC also recognised the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its Institutions.
This formula opens the possibility of a form of convention with representatives of national parliaments, the European Parliament and the governments of the Member States.
Contrary to the principle of subsidiarity no reference was made to the constitutional regions.
Will the Council - following the democratic principle of subsidiarity - involve all the parliaments of the constitutional regions when it chooses a form of convention?
Question No 6 by (H-0525/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration According to the Declaration in Annex IV of the Nice Treaty the debate about the future development of the EU should address, inter alia, the following question: How to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of competences between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity?
The present idea of subsidiarity in the EC Treaty is commonly interpreted as regulating only relations between Union and states.
This interpretation has to be broadened as outlined in the resolution of the European Parliament of 26 October 2000 on better lawmaking.
Will the Laeken Declaration propose to amend the Treaties so that they specifically include recognition of, and respect for, the political and legislative powers of the Member States' internal political units in their executive, legislative and judicial relations with the EU Institutions?
Question No 7 by (H-0526/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU.
It also recognises the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its Institutions.
In December 2001 the Belgian presidency will be concluded by a contribution to this debate, the Laeken Declaration.
Will the Laeken Declaration recognise that a further democratisation of the European decision-making process calls for a more radical reform, with legislative power vested in two chambers, the European Parliament and a reformed Council that would subsume some aspects of the present Committee of the Regions and would strongly enhance the role of the constitutional regions?
Question No 8 by (H-0560/01):
Subject: Laeken Declaration Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration that calls for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU.
Following a report to its Gothenburg meeting in June 2001, the European Council at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001 will agree on appropriate initiatives for the continuation of this process.
According to the Declaration the process should address, inter alia, the following question: How to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of competences between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity?
Will the Council - following the principle of subsidiarity - refrain from infringing the competences of the constitutional regions?
How will the Council establish and monitor this respect for the competences of the constitutional regions?
Question No 9 by (H-0531/01):
Subject: Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam on subsidiarity Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam, on subsidiarity, states: -It is taken for granted by the German, Austrian and Belgian governments that action by the European Community in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity not only concerns the Member States but also their entities to the extent that they have their own law-making powers conferred on them under national constitutional law.'
Similarly, Declaration No 23 attached to the Treaty of Nice, on the future of the Union, states in its third paragraph: 'In 2001, the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, in cooperation with the Commission and involving the European Parliament, will encourage wide-ranging discussions with all interested parties' ; and, in its fourth paragraph: 'the European Council, at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001, will agree on a declaration containing appropriate initiatives for the continuation of this process' .
What approach will the Belgian presidency take to Declaration No 54 attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam, on the principle of subsidiarity and the entities having exclusive powers?
What does the Belgian presidency believe to be the best means of resolving potential conflicts arising from decisions of the EU institutions where such decisions clash with the exclusive powers of those entities?
Would the correct solution not be for the European Court of Justice to be given the power to rule on any appeals lodged by those constitutional entities and for the Treaties to legitimate the power of those entities to defend their interests in court at Union level?
Question No 10 by (H-0547/01):
Subject: Recognition of the political and legislative competences of constitutional regions and nationalities What proposals does the Council intend to make to ensure that the planned 2004 reform of the Treaties includes the recognition and underpinning of the political and legislative powers of internal units within the Member States (nationalities, federal states, autonomous communities or constitutional regions) in their executive, legislative and judicial relations with the EU institutions?
In a declaration attached to the Treaty of Nice, the Conference of Representatives of the Member State Governments expressed the wish for a broad and more profound debate on European Union' s future to be initiated as a first step in a preparatory process which will culminate in the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
The joint declaration of the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission of 7 March last, confirmed this objective and called for a debate in which all sections of society need to be involved more than ever.
The report by the presidency, submitted to the European Council in Gothenburg, describes the vast range of initiatives which have already been launched in Member States and candidate countries, and also by the institutions of the Union.
This report notes the numerous initiatives that have been taken in various Member States, involving different regional bodies.
It also lists the events organised as part of this debate by the Committee of the Regions.
The various questions raised, which are all on the subject of the role of the regional bodies in the process of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, are concerned with two types of problem. On the one hand, there are the detailed rules for implementing the preparatory phase which precedes the next Intergovernmental Conference, and on the other there is the issue of the role of the regional bodies in the construction of the Union.
As far as the question of the detailed rules concerning the preparatory phase is concerned, it is too soon yet to take a decision on the content of the Laeken declaration.
Most of you, I know, heard what was said by our Prime Minister, and that will have lifted a little corner of the veil.
However, most of the canvas which is currently covered by that veil has still to be painted.
That being the case, all I can tell you is that it is too soon.
However, it is obvious that the preparatory phase will have to take its inspiration from the various contributions which will be made by the European Council in December, and from the discussions and contacts which the Belgian presidency will be having with all the parties concerned.
In that respect I can assure you that the presidency has the firm intention of examining every aspect of the question, including those mentioned by the honourable Members, so that the detailed rules for implementing preparations for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference will provide the optimum response to the initial requirements set out in the Nice Declaration.
(NL) By way of response to the questions which are related to the content of the role of regional bodies in the future fabric of the Union, I can only remind you of the attention which previous Intergovernmental Conferences have devoted to this issue.
That was particularly apparent from the establishment of a Committee of the Regions, composed of representatives from regional and local communities, a committee which, as you know, plays an advisory role.
It would be premature at this stage to give you a detailed response to this issue of content on behalf of the Council - for I am talking on behalf of the Council - but I am certain that this point will be addressed in due course.
I shall listen to your supplementary questions with interest.
I hope there will be time for a supplementary answer.
Mrs Neyts-Uytebroeck, or Annemie, if you will allow me to use your first name, we should not pull the wool over each other' s eyes.
I simply want to say to you that, of course, I understand that you are replying here on behalf of the Council.
But all of the ten EFTA parliamentarians present here naturally want to promote the regional process in the European construction, because we are all MEPs from pro-European regions.
We fear that if the constitutional regions are not represented well in the European decision-making process, a gradual aversion to Europe will grow within those regions, because we will feel that our regions cannot have their say, that they are suffocating, as it were.
That is why I should like to ask you, as the driving force in a discussion which is about to start, how you will try to actively involve those regions in the decision-making process and how you will ensure that the Council actually makes a statement in this connection in the foreseeable future.
Mr President, Bart, please accept my apologies, for I am not all that familiar yet with the procedures.
I was under the impression that I would listen to all the additional questions first and then respond to them all in one go.
But your plea for constitutional regions is, of course, not falling on deaf ears, if I can put it that way.
In a previous political life not so long ago, I was, in fact, Minister in the Government of one of those constitutional regions. I therefore identify with your plea entirely.
You have also undoubtedly listened carefully to our Prime Minister.
You can therefore count on it that I, on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, will do my utmost to broach this subject. But there are also fourteen other Member States, and it will therefore be important for the constitutional regions to bring harmony among themselves as well.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, this morning we heard the Belgian Prime Minister.
I agree with the basic tenet of his clear and intelligent speech and I hope that with the prospect of the Laeken Council, his action will serve to override the total failure of the Nice Conference.
I must say, however, that in his speech, as in the answer that he has just given to our questions, for which I thank him, I noted the absence of any explicit reference to the political recognition of national and cultural diversity which, together with statehood, is a fundamental element of the European character.
Within this diversity, the stateless nations that we represent have genuine historical and linguistic roots, as well as demographic and economic importance on a par with those of the Member States.
We would like to see acknowledgement of our political, civic and democratic realities, together with the executive, legislative and judicial powers that distinguish us, so that we are able to participate in the European Council, just as we also acknowledge that federal states, LÃ€nder and constitutional regions that have a different nature but similar powers must participate.
We would like to see these realities incorporated into the Laeken Declaration.
We would like these realities to be included in the future Constitution.
We hope, in any event, that our governments and our parliaments will participate in the convention drawing up the proposals for the European Union' s constitution.
Our Prime Minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, was unable, in his speech, to include every aspect of the real situation in the European Union about which he is concerned, but I can tell you now that the safeguarding, deployment and development of cultural diversity, and indeed of linguistic diversity, are in his mind as they are in mine, and I believe that we all regard them as fundamental values.
This determination to safeguard cultural diversity will certainly be expressed, probably in the first section of the Laeken Declaration, which will deal with the principles and values that we have in common.
I can assure you, therefore, that cultural diversity, and the desire for cultural diversity, will certainly be included as one of the basic principles of the European Union, and it is a principle to which we are all very much attached.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor.
This is the first chance I have had to speak to the House, because your Assembly only verified my credentials last Monday.
Could I just remind you that have taken over from the Basque MEP, Mr Gorka KnÃ¶rr, who was elected to the Basque Parliament on 13 May and has now become its Deputy Speaker.
Madam Minister, I myself am Catalan, a Catalan from Roussillon, in other words a French national, and I applied to be included in a coalition in the Spanish State, a Basque-Catalan coalition, and that is why I, the Catalan, have taken over from Mr Gorka KnÃ¶rr, the Basque.
As you know, Madam Minister, Catalonia is more than just a region.
It is a nation, a nation which has always been a courageous defender of liberty and has always been concerned with solidarity values.
Catalonia is a deeply Europhile nation, and yet today that nation has some difficulty in finding its place in this institution.
It cannot be content with the makeshift role which it has been granted in the Committee of the Regions, a committee whose powers, as you know, are extremely limited.
This is why, knowing your position and your history, I hoped, and indeed still hope, that your presidency will enable progress to be made on this issue, not only the issue of Catalonia, but also the issue of all the other nations without a State of their own.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Mayol on his arrival here in this House.
I am able to speak from experience.
Mr Mayol, you will find that your mandate is an absolutely extraordinary one, but one which is nonetheless worth the trouble.
I hope that your years here will be fruitful, pleasant and interesting.
You will certainly have to work hard, but something tells me that you are not afraid of hard work.
So, once again, my best congratulations!
Actually I do know a little about Catalonia.
I do not speak Catalan but I can understand it, which is something at least.
The problem you have raised is obviously even more complex than the issue of constitutional regions within the boundaries of a single country.
You are talking about a nation which straddles two countries, if you will allow me to put it so cavalierly, both of which are anxious to maintain their territorial integrity.
I am happy to leave you with the responsibility for the prospects which you have opened up.
On the other hand, I completely agree with you when you emphasise the fact that the Catalans love their nation, their language and their culture, but that at the same time they are very European, very open to the world outside.
I can tell you that we are not unaware of the fact that the Prime Minister of Spanish Catalonia was one of the first people to launch the movement in favour of constitutional regions.
If I know him, and I know him well and have confidence in him, that movement will certainly not come to a halt, and as long as it keeps going it will be skilfully conducted. Mr Pujol and the other Prime Ministers will see to that.
To that extent I believe that the debate will progress in the right direction in the years to come.
The President-in-Office of the Council is very receptive to the points we are making but her colleagues in the Council, generally, have very little to say about subsidiarity in a way that pleases us.
This is the kind of thing that makes an increasing part of the population of Scotland recognise that being a Member State is a much better idea than being a constitutional region.
However, things standing as they do, I would ask the President-in-Office if she would be prepared to discuss with colleagues the oddity of the structure of the Committee of the Regions which, instead of representing the regions in some proportion to their size, represents the states according to digressive proportionality.
Denmark, which is already a Member State, has twice as many Members in the Committee of the Regions as Scotland has.
Even Luxembourg has more!
I do not know the difference between the regions of Luxembourg intimately, but I dare say they are less than the difference between the regions of Scotland.
The debate is getting more complicated with each speaker and you will understand that I cannot possibly go into that issue.
However, I do know that within the Committee of the Regions the representatives of municipalities, cities, provinces, and constitutional regions find it increasingly difficult to build a common platform from which to develop their action.
The Presiding Officer of the Scottish Assembly is one of my very great and dear friends and so I am familiar with the problems you have referred to.
However, I cannot possibly give a detailed answer to your very precise questions.
I believe that the issue of subsidiarity and its meaning in practice is central to the whole debate on the future of Europe - not only in terms of the rights of nations and regions within the Member States, but also in terms of citizenship.
I represent Wales which has a new national assembly, just two years old.
It is a developing body that wants to play a full part in and have strong links with the European Union and help build the Europe of the future.
Would the Minister agree that involving this kind of regional level of government is crucial in terms of developing citizenship and bringing Europe closer to the people - a problem that we are all familiar with in all our constituencies.
If this is something that needs to be done on a European level in order to bring Europe closer to people, how will this be reflected in the work of the Council?
As you will appreciate, this is a real debate.
In my first answer I said everything I could say as President-in-Office.
The rest is very much my personal point of view as a member of the Belgian Government.
I hope that you will make this distinction, especially as this is now a more spontaneous debate, which I like very much.
I believe subsidiarity is a very important notion but it is also a very difficult one because it is not very precise.
It is more precisely defined in the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam than previously and is perfectly usable.
The local and intermediary levels are essential in bridging the gap between citizens and authorities.
These levels and authorities have a very important role to play.
In light of recent developments, as in Denmark and Ireland, this awareness has grown and will be better taken into account than perhaps in the past.
Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU.
It also recognises, importantly, the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions.
In December 2001, the Belgian presidency will be concluded by a contribution to this debate at the Laeken Declaration.
Will the Laeken Declaration recognise that a further democratisation of the European decision-making process calls for a more radical reform with legislative power vested in two chambers: the European Parliament, and a reformed Council that would subsume some aspects of the present Committee of the Regions and would strongly enhance the role of the constitutional regions?
I will have to limit my answer to reminding you that the Laeken Declaration will be more about the right questions and indications of directions, than about formulae and definite answers.
Hopefully it will only be the start of the more formal preparations for the IGC.
Any answer now to your question would be quite premature.
All I can tell you is that we are very conscious of all these aspects, and that we are not the only ones who are conscious of them.
I would be very surprised if the issue was not addressed in the form of a question.
But do not expect answers yet, it is far too soon.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian, Austrian and German Governments included declaration No 54 in the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to refer to the influence that European issues have on the internal bodies of the States, above all in the regions with exclusive competences.
The European institutions, and above all the Council, constantly take decisions which sometimes encroach on the competences of the constitutional regions or the regions with legislative competences in Europe.
Conflicts of competence are created and, in this respect, I would like to ask the opinion of the Belgian Government in relation to the possibility that these regions with exclusive legislative competences may be given the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
I would also ask your opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Communities' capacity to pass judgement on these conflicts of competence between the Union and the regions with legislative competence.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, I shall tell you what I can in reply to your question about how we organise our work. I am sure that you are not unaware, precisely because of the protocol to which you referred, that a certain number of Councils of Ministers will be presided over by ministers of regional and/or community governments.
This has already happened in the case of the informal Tourism Council which took place last weekend in Bruges, and it will also happen in the case of the Education and Scientific Research Councils, and some of the other Councils too.
You can see, then, how we deal with questions of this type.
As far as the possibility of access to the Court of Justice is concerned, I know that this is something that the constitutional regions are asking for.
Sometimes I have the impertinence to wonder whether they are fully aware of the scope and the possible consequences of a positive reply to their requests.
You yourself have pointed out that if the regions had direct access to the Court of Justice in disputes about competence, it would seem almost inevitable that the Court would one day be called upon to give a ruling on the internal constitutional organisation of the Member States themselves.
I would ask you to think about that.
It is not possible for me to reply to your question.
It is a very delicate question, and a very controversial one.
Any reply would be quite premature.
However, if you will permit me I would like to ask you think about what I have just said.
Mr President, I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that it is not permitted in all States for governments of the constitutional regions to participate in the meetings of the Council of Ministers and, therefore, we are unrepresented, as is the case with the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.
I believe that this is a genuine problem for Europe and we must deal with it.
We cannot be taking decisions in the European fora on competences which the laws attribute to regions which are not present to defend them.
As a final comment, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, I would just like to say that this is an arrangement that we came to in Belgium, between Belgian governments, governments with an 's' , always governments in the plural.
I would ask you to refer to your own governments, because that is where I believe this type of question should be resolved in the first instance.
Mr President, I do not represent any region; as you know, I represent the pensioners of Italy and Europe.
Before tabling my question, however, I would like to express my admiration at the President-in-Office of the Council' s willingness to answer so thoroughly all the questions she has been asked.
I paid close attention to the Swedish presidency and I was practically frozen stiff by the coldness with which the Swedes habitually responded 'This is not my responsibility' .
I am therefore genuinely satisfied, having listened to the Belgian President-in-Office speak this morning, by his openness to pensioners' affairs, and I am truly satisfied to have seen the practical undertaking by the Belgian presidency to respond to every question, even the most difficult ones.
I have exhausted the time available to me and so I will not be able to table my supplementary question.
I will do so on another occasion.
Mr President, The President-in-Office of the Council said that we want recognition of our national realities and of our constitutional powers.
I wish to reply that these realities are indeed part of European diversity but this is not simply a label to hold on to; it is also the powerful political reality of my country, Galicia, which should be fully recognised, just like those of the States of the borderless Union of Europe, of which we are all a part.
Question No 11 by (H-0545/01):
Subject: Public access to Council documents Now that the Council has enacted the Commission proposal, what is the timetable and the procedure for the public to begin accessing the Council' s documents?
To Mr Newton Dunn' s question, I can answer as follows.
First of all: the Council is impressed with the progress made in terms of openness and transparency since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, particularly with the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
The Council would point out to the honourable Member that this Parliament and Council Regulation of 30 May 2001, pursuant to Article 19, will not enter into force until 3 December 2001.
Until such time, requests from the public for Council documents will be dealt with as before on the basis of Council Decision 93/731/EC on public access to Council documents.
Each of the three institutions involved will therefore need to make the necessary arrangements to guarantee that the new Regulation is actually in force as of 3 December 2001.
In accordance with Article 15, they shall establish an interinstitutional committee to examine best practice, address possible conflicts and discuss future developments on public access to documents.
As far as the Council is concerned, the competent bodies are currently looking into the measures that need to be taken in order to fully implement the rights of citizens which they have acquired on the basis of the new Regulation.
I can add to this that it is this presidency' s ambition, wherever possible, to be able to conclude all agreements before this Regulation enters into force, but as I have said before, we cannot do this on our own, and I hope we will receive the necessary support.
I must say I think most Members will think that a six-month delay is exceedingly disappointing, but it is nice to hear something positive.
Can you indicate to us what the possible obstacles are?
Does anybody have a veto on this date of 3 December or can you give us a guarantee that it is actually going to happen?
You are not going to tell us at the end of the Belgian presidency: I am so sorry it slipped; somebody got it in the way!
Can you guarantee it is going to happen or does someone have a veto?
I am afraid I cannot guarantee that.
I would be a fairy if I could.
I can only tell you that we will do our utmost.
We will take up where the work left off to see to it that the directive enters into force on the set date, 3 December 2001.
Question No 12 by (H-0550/01):
Subject: Equal treatment of Turkey in regard to accession aid The European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 decided that Turkey is a candidate State on the same terms as the other twelve candidate States.
Turkey was therefore promised certain aid during the often long and difficult process entailed by membership negotiations.
The forms of aid currently available to all candidate countries include funds such as ISPA and SAPARD.
Turkey, however, has not benefited from those.
The country has been refused the aid promised at Helsinki on the grounds that the EU did not have the financial resources available.
Is it not time for the Council to ensure that the Helsinki summit decisions to treat Turkey on an equal footing with the other twelve candidate countries are now honoured and that the channels are opened for that country to obtain the aid it was promised, particularly in view of the fact that the Commission recently decided to refund 11.6 billion euro to the Member States?
The European Council in Helsinki, having decided to grant Turkey the status of a candidate for accession, asked the Commission to submit a single framework for European Union financial aid to that country for the pre-accession period.
The Commission submitted its proposal to the Council on 27 April this year.
The main objective of this proposal for a financial framework is to guarantee that financial aid will be granted in accordance with priorities defined by the accession partnership and to bring the existing financial instruments together to form a single instrument, in order to optimise its effectiveness.
The European Council in Gothenburg, which made it quite clear that the accession partnership is the kingpin of the pre-accession strategy, invited the Council to adopt this single financial framework between now and the end of 2001.
The Council has begun the procedure of consulting the European Parliament, and is encouraging Parliament to give its opinion as soon as possible.
Concerning the funding under the ISPA and SAPAR programmes, to which the honourable Member refers, this is structural aid and aid for agricultural development which is only granted to the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe to meet their specific needs as transitional economies.
However, that does not mean that Turkey has missed out on the aid promised in Helsinki, on the contrary.
The financial preaccession aid for Turkey has been doubled in 2000 and 2001 compared to the average annual amounts which were allocated in the 1996-1999 period.
In view of normal budget procedures, we should aim to continue to grant this aid for the remaining part of the current financial perspectives. That is until 2006, as you know, and applies to all candidate countries.
I should also like to point out that the EU' s general budget contains a new component, entitled 'Preaccession strategy for Turkey' , in which the resources are increased in the light of this.
As this budget line comprises different budget resources, the financial aid programmes for Turkey can be completed with greater efficiency.
As you know, the European Parliament has approved this approach in its opinion on the framework regulation for Turkey.
I would like to thank the Belgian presidency for its answer and at the same time welcome Belgium as the country holding the presidency of the Council of Ministers in the European Union after the Swedish presidency.
Many of us, including myself, see Belgium almost as our second home in that we live in Brussels during the week but go home, in my case to Sweden, at weekends.
I would like to address the issue of Turkey.
It is clearly the case that Turkey has not understood the difference between, on the one hand, the Eastern and Central European countries which were considered for the ISPA and SAPARD funds and, on the other hand, Turkey, which was not considered for these.
Is the legislation insufficiently clear with regard to Turkey?
Turkey also feels that it wants to be treated well and fairly.
I would like to advise you to clarify why Turkey was not considered for these particular funds.
I would like to thank the honourable Member for his kind words and express my appreciation for the Swedish presidency with whom I have enjoyed an extremely pleasant and fruitful partnership over the past six months.
Question No 13 by (H-0553/01):
Subject: Belgian presidency and Afghan women Considering the subhuman conditions in which over 11 million women in Afghanistan are obliged to survive, will the Council consider encouraging the creation of an international Afghanistan committee in coordination with the UN?
Mrs Izquierdo RÃ³jo, we were fellow members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs during the previous legislative period.
It is therefore a great pleasure for me to be able to reply to the question that you have so judiciously raised.
As I pointed out in my previous replies to questions on the same subject, the Council entirely shares the honourable Member' s concern about the disastrous position in which large sections of the Afghan population now find themselves, and in particular the disastrous position of women and children.
In view of the difficulties in Afghanistan at humanitarian and political levels, and in particular in view of the negative attitude which the Taleban persist in taking, both as regards the UN and as regards women, the Council is not entirely convinced that the setting up of an international Afghanistan committee in coordination with the UN, would be likely to really improve the situation of women in Afghanistan.
Nevertheless, the Council will examine closely the advantages and disadvantages to which such a committee might give rise, as soon as this issue is raised within the UN, and provided that the rules for putting such a proposal into practice have been studied in minute detail.
In the meantime, the Council will be continuing the projects which it has decided on with the aim of helping Afghan women.
On that point, the Council would also refer the honourable Member to the replies which it has already given to previous questions on the same subject, and in particular to Questions H-0032/01, H-0052/01, H-0170/01, H-0088/01 and, more recently, Question H-0481/01.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for this reply and, as a supplementary question, I would like to know whether you approve of exerting international pressure both against the Taliban regime and against the States that support it, specifically Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Are you prepared to work during the Belgian presidency so that progress may really be made in relation to this disastrous situation?
My reply was in response to your specific question about an international committee.
As far as international pressure is concerned, i.e. the sanctions and embargoes which have been ordered in respect of Afghanistan, obviously the Council takes the view that these must be continued, and as far as possible reinforced, because we are dealing here with a regime that is completely inhumane.
As you indicated, the discussion on the role of certain advisory committees has been launched.
On 19 July 1999 the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision to the Council with the aim of abolishing the Council advisory committee for medical training, together with some other advisory committees established in conjunction with sectoral directives for doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, pharmacists, general care nurses and midwives.
The Commission' s purpose was to simplify the committee system.
The Council has had some discussions on this proposal, but has not come up with any conclusions yet.
In addition to the examination of this proposal, no further measures of the type indicated in the question are envisaged in the Council.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her willingness to go over time and take extra questions.
I wish her well during the presidency and hope that her relationship with the Members will be as open and blunt as it has been this afternoon.
Specifically on my supplementary, there is a major concern about the medical councils in the Member States and, in particular, for my own country, Ireland, with regard to ensuring minimum standards of training and qualification for doctors and other people in the medical profession.
As we move towards enlargement of the European Union, with the accession of new Member States, and extend freedom of movement opportunities to countries outside of the accession countries to deal with shortfalls of medical personnel across the European Union, we consider that experts in the field from the existing Member States must be included in any such consultation process.
I have taken note of your remarks.
I am sorry, but I really have to go or I will miss my plane but I will forward them to my colleague who is responsible for this matter.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 15 to 26 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Macro-financial assistance to Yugoslavia
The next item is the report (A5-0244/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2001) 277 - C5-0231/2001 - 2001/0112(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I wish to recommend that the plenary adopt the proposal for a Council decision providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the in the version originally put forward by the Commission.
We know that there have been some discussions in budget areas of the Council which are aimed at introducing restrictions, but we take the view that at the present political time, it is right to approve the amounts originally envisaged in the proposal.
There is an obvious reason for this: I think that having made it clear for so long that assistance would be available from the European Union if the people of Serbia and Montenegro threw off the yoke of dictatorship, we should keep our word.
Particularly after the events of recent days, which have culminated in Milosevic' s extradition to the International Court Tribunal in The Hague, it is important that the European Parliament and the European Union signal that in response to these internal factors, the funds will be released, so that the people in a country like Yugoslavia can see that fostering democracy and human rights is genuinely worthwhile.
For this reason, Commissioner, conditions should be created so that this can happen as quickly as possible, and I know that this is your intention too.
This macro-financial assistance is not directly linked to a specific programme. It is an initial injection which is designed to help set things in motion.
In this context, it should also be made clear that this assistance must not be tied to overly complicated conditions.
We are proposing a number of amendments to you.
These proposed amendments are designed to enhance control and also call for the involvement of other donors, although we do not view this as a condition. I believe that these are all positions which, ultimately, will not lead to obstacles and delay, but will enhance clarity, strengthen the control options, and also make it clear that we want assistance to be provided speedily.
As you know, this House did not create any difficulties when it was a matter of applying for urgent assistance for this area. As I am sure you recall, through the participation of other committees too, such as the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we signalled our willingness to proceed as quickly as possible and introduce the necessary amendments.
Let me also make one general political point.
In recent years, we have repeatedly engaged in grand theoretical debates about the developments in Yugoslavia. Yet in terms of our commitment, whether in the field of prevention and civil crisis management or, indeed, through threats and the use of military capabilities, we have generally acted too late.
Our policy has always been 'too little, too late' .
This has led us into the situation which we have witnessed in recent days in Macedonia.
This misguided approach, which ultimately forces us to make even greater sacrifices and provide even more assistance - because we failed to act in time, and because we could not implement the concept of prevention and civil crisis management due to the international community' s total fragmentation of responsibilities in this region - has resulted in major political failure in key areas.
By providing these resources, we want to make it clear once again that this is not due to us, and that as the European Parliament, we are willing to do everything possible as quickly as possible. However, this is also an appeal to the Commission and the Council to make the necessary political decisions in a different way in future.
I recall that two months ago, I was castigated and accused of being irresponsible when I spoke about the possibility of war in Macedonia. People ignore the facts for as long as they can, because they are too cowardly to tell the truth to the public at home.
Afterwards, it all becomes far too expensive for everyone, and the costs again include human lives.
For this reason, we call urgently once again for rapid assistance to be provided so that peace, democracy and human rights can be restored to this region.
It was indeed an extraordinary gesture on the part of the Serbian Government to hand over Mr Milosevic to the International Court of Justice.
This also required courage.
During an earlier attempt to arrest Mr Milosevic, when he was still living in his own house, it was already evident that the army and the police were in opposite camps.
In a way, therefore, I think we should pay our respects to Mr Djindjic and the way he acted, although his motives may well have been inspired by opportunism.
I am also delighted that we have been able to agree internally on the fact that financial assistance should be subject to the extent to which steps are taken in the direction of rule of law, including cooperation with the Court.
In my opinion, Parliament had a clearer take on this than the Council, which did not want to make this aid too conditional.
In this respect, we share the position of the United States and I believe that that in itself was a very good move.
Mr Milosevic has now been extradited by Serbia and Yugoslavia.
All we need to do now is to wait for the international community itself to cooperate with the International Court of Justice.
The SFOR has to deliver the goods now, for the cooperation of SFOR and the political powers behind it, have so far been lacking.
That is ultimately extremely painful and disgraceful.
There is really no cause for any further complaint if SFOR fails to do what it should do in its own province, namely to arrest Messrs Karadzic and Mladic.
In that connection, I would also appreciate it if the European Parliament' s message in this respect were driven home to the Council and to all those others who, under the United Nations, carry joint responsibility for the actions of the SFOR, of which we are right to have high expectations.
Thanks to the excellent services of Mr Korakas, we recently found out that we in Europe fail to see eye to eye in this respect.
It appears that a vast majority in the Greek parliament has signed a declaration which states that it is very regrettable that Mr Milosevic has been taken to the so-called Court of Justice in The Hague.
Mr President, there is a great deal to be done before the community of values with that parliament can be restored.
This confirms that there are many differences within our Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to support Mr Brok' s motion on the approval of macro-financial assistance to Yugoslavia. I also believe that it is absolutely vital, given the country' s high level of debt, to provide an above-average level of lost subsidies here, i.e. above-average compared with the usual practice.
I fully support the Commission on this point.
One condition for cooperation, as has been mentioned, is cooperation with The Hague.
This has always been the position of this House and also our group.
There is no question that a great deal has been achieved through Milosevic' s extradition.
This is a positive development.
Yet positive developments can sometimes leave a stale after-taste.
Firstly, it was all too clear that Milosevic was handed over in exchange for the funds pledged by the donors' conference, not so much in exchange for direct assistance from the European Union.
It was not a pretty sight. There are two sides responsible: those who demanded this step, but also the government in Belgrade, who was too hesitant at first.
Secondly, it is interesting that particular pressure was applied by the Americans: the Americans, who persist in rejecting the notion that international courts could actually have jurisdiction over their citizens.
This is an interesting point, and the European Union should bring pressure to bear on the Americans to recognise the international courts and their jurisdiction over American citizens at last.
Thirdly, it does not resolve the issue of Yugoslavia' s critical examination of its own history.
There are many individuals, such as those responsible for the destruction of Vukovar, who are still at large.
This debate must continue in Yugoslavia.
Fourthly, it is conceivable that the fragile balance established in Yugoslavia will undergo hard tests and could even be destroyed.
On this point, I would like to make a comment about the future of the country.
Over recent months and years, we have all witnessed what is often an antagonist mood towards Yugoslavia itself. Yet Yugoslavia has an important role to play in the region' s reconstruction, and thankfully, it now has responsible and sensible leaders who can set it on the right course.
However, we must be patient here and help Yugoslavia fulfil its tasks in the region.
Together with my group, I identify three key points in this context.
Firstly, the critical debate in Yugoslavia about events in the country over recent decades must continue.
Secondly, there must be reconciliation with its neighbours.
Here, in particular, the extradition of a number of war criminals would undoubtedly help.
Thirdly, and this is my final point, the economy must certainly be reconstructed, and we must give our support to this process.
If we are able to link these three elements together, we will be able to look back in five or ten years' time on the successful history of EU policy in Yugoslavia.
Mr President, Commissioner, the economic relations between the EU and Yugoslavia are of a special kind.
For a long time, there were no relations.
After October 2000, the EU promptly made EUR 200 million available to Yugoslavia by way of emergency aid. This just illustrates that even the EU can work quickly and efficiently.
Last week, the EU showed itself in its best light at the donor conference.
We are now discussing here in Parliament macro-financial assistance to the tune of EUR 300 million to cover budget shortages, including a considerable gift in the sum of EUR 120 million.
In my view, the assistance we are discussing this evening is representing the end of a certain era, namely the transition from autocracy to democracy.
This aid is welcome and appropriate at this stage, but in my opinion it also has the feel of a one-off gesture.
It may also be useful to indicate that special conditions apply, of which I should like to mention two.
As Mr Brok has already stated, it is not the case that the approval and spending of these funds are subject to very special conditions, but sound cooperation must be established with the political and safety committee because the EU' s aid to Yugoslavia must be granted in a politically coherent fashion.
That also applies to the assessment of that aid.
Subsequent to this macro-financial assistance, it will have to be carefully examined, particularly on a political plane, if this form of aid is required in future.
My group has reached the conclusion that it is important for the EU to be quick off the mark, efficient and generous, whenever that is useful and needed politically speaking.
It is about being able to transfer resources quickly and efficiently, not being afraid to take the lead and not being frightened to be dependent on other donors.
But we must also be able to change strategy quickly and efficiently.
That is why, in my view, it is important to support this kind of aid in the anticipation that it will probably be the last time that aid will be granted to Yugoslavia in this form.
Mr President, I can only speak for a majority of my group on this issue.
We support the Commission' s proposal and the report.
I do not think there is any need to repeat several of Mr Swoboda' s criticisms which I agree with.
Mr Brok' s remarks about the need for a preventive peace policy and civil crisis management render my own outline comments superfluous.
Of course, it is quite correct to say that far more rapid and concerted action is required.
However, I believe that there are also very different sides to this policy which have various drawbacks.
Mr Brok, in your proposed Amendment No 2, you state - quite rightly, in my view - that financial support can be provided to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as far as it proceeds towards a well-functioning legal state, including cooperation with the International Court Tribunal in the Hague.
However, if at the same time a violation of rule-of-law principles is extorted, in effect, above all by the USA but apparently also by the German Chancellor, this policy is more likely to discredit the rule of law and democratic development in the long term.
I see these contradictions in other areas too.
Macedonia has been mentioned.
For many months, we have courted the KLA, without any decommissioning of arms taking place.
KFOR therefore shares the blame for developments in Macedonia and the outbreaks of fresh conflict.
In Kosovo, we pursued a policy which was designed to prevent ethnic cleansing; today, we witness other completely unacceptable instances of ethnic cleansing in the wake of the NATO campaign.
In my view, this is incompatible with a preventive and sustainable security policy.
I believe that the time has come to move away from a policy which contains the conflicts and limits the damage to which it has itself contributed.
It is time to expect and demand democracy, the rule of law and the protection of minority and human rights not only from our political opponents but also to practise them even when they stand in the way of our own power-political interests.
I think that the positive developments in Yugoslavia have genuinely achieved a great deal, but changes in NATO and EU policy are long overdue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly unstable situation in what remains of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, and, it has to be said, in the Balkans as a whole, makes it necessary for us to extend the aid that we provide to the countries of that region, not only for this year, but no doubt for a long time to come.
It also makes it necessary for us, and this should be a matter of priority, to come face to face with the reality of our failure and to ask ourselves what is the cause of it.
The cause is simple.
The European Union was only pretending to follow the logic of peace.
In reality, it was merely using humanitarian speeches to cover up the real logic, the logic of war, a war which was in the interests of several powers and which was intended to destroy Yugoslavia, which is what happened in just a few years.
We can only understand this if we think along geopolitical lines.
Although this is the only means of understanding the reality of power relationships between nations, in other words diplomacy itself, we are still obstinately refusing to carry out a geopolitical analysis.
Yet this would reveal the truth, a truth which is glaringly obvious, in other words that there are three powers pursuing converging interests in the Balkans.
First there is Germany, which has never got over the fact that, after both the First World War and the Second, it was to some extent against its interests, or at least against the interests of its European expansionism, that the country of Yugoslavia was created as a single entity. As soon as Germany was reunified in 1990, it played an important part in breaking the stranglehold of Serbia, its old enemy, so as to be reunited with its Slovenian and Croatian allies, and let us not forget, with two precious Mediterranean coastlines.
In the same way, Turkey easily regained the connivance of Albania, and its military arm, the KLA.
To some extent urged on by the whole of the Muslim world, Turkey has reconquered some very old, very ancient positions in Balkan Europe, and it has obviously done so against the interests of Europe, but in the interests of the United States which, like any empire, knows very well how to divide and rule, and has profited and continues to profit from stirring up very old conflicts and fanning the flames of very old quarrels in what we can only call Greater Turkey, which is in the process of installing itself in the Balkans, to the great detriment, of course, of Greece.
To put it in a nutshell, Europe has worked against itself, and in my view this is a further sign of its failure to conduct a rational diplomacy.
Thank you very much. I appreciate the passions stirred up by the issue of the Balkans, specifically Yugoslavia.
However, my objective here today is rather more modest.
Of course we must react to the events of recent weeks as a European Community, offering a significant message of support to the Yugoslavian authorities and supporting the stabilisation and economic reform efforts made by that country.
I especially welcome the efforts made by this House, and in particular Mr Brok.
The acceleration of the process has been complex in recent weeks and this makes it difficult for the different committees to express their points of view on the proposal we are discussing today.
As I said before, our objective is limited.
It is important, but it is limited, given the difficult economic and financial situation of Yugoslavia, which requires the international community to offer significant financial support.
The Yugoslavian authorities have implemented important economic reform programmes, which have been welcomed and accepted by the international community.
You have referred to the fundamental issue of the Conference of Donors.
This Conference has shown support for the economic transition and recovery programme, produced in collaboration with the World Bank and also with the European Commission.
The good news has been - and Mr Lange has referred to it - the existence of sufficient funds to finance everything that was intended.
It has even been possible to exceed the USD 1 250 million which was envisaged as aid for Yugoslavia.
What contribution is the European Community making at the moment?
We are cooperating via two channels.
The first channel is EUR 230 million, in 2001, which is the Community aid for reconstruction, democracy and stabilisation in the area, the so-called 'CARDS' aid.
However, as well as this, we have proposed 300 million in macro-financial assistance with a very specific aim, that is the reduction of the balance of payments deficit.
Of course, we intend to extend the mandate which allows Yugoslavia to receive EIB loans.
To this end, the Commission made its proposal, referred to by Mr Brok, of 23 May, trying to react, as he said, quickly and to persuade the Council of Ministers to accept.
As he has also said, there has been a certain change in the Council of Ministers, lending more weight to loans and less to donations, a change which we in the Commission do not agree with.
I would like to expressly thank Mr Brok for his support for the Commission' s position.
However, we are talking about a proposal for macro-financial assistance.
And every time we have given this sort of aid, we have done so with certain conditions within the European Union and I do not believe that there is any argument for changing that model.
We are talking about aid which is complementary to aid implemented by other international institutions and bilateral donors, aid which is intended to prevent the external financial restrictions suffered by that country.
That means that we are working in conjunction with the Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
We are referring to 2001, although it may be considered for future years, but, at the moment, we are talking about the restrictions for 2001 and next year.
This type of aid, as you know, is conditional upon certain economic policy demands and is proposed within a stand-by programme of the International Monetary Fund for one year.
As I said before, our proposal was 120 million in donation and 180 in loan, the latter for 15 years under conditions similar to those for other countries.
The basic agreement in the Council has reduced the donation to 75 million, leaving the rest for loans.
We consider that, given Yugoslavia' s high level of debt and its other difficulties, and coherence with other types of similar modernisations which we have carried out in the past, the Commission' s proposal is coherent with our practice.
We will therefore continue to insist in the Council that the conditions we have proposed be approved.
Mr Brok' s report proposes a series of amendments; I will later provide you with a note which explains our exact position.
Our view of the amendments is as follows, to put it very briefly: first, it is not necessary to include the references to CARDS in this particular case, since we are talking about another type of aid, and not about CARDS aid, which is of a different nature.
Certain amendments do not therefore seem acceptable, such as Amendments Nos 1, 11, 15 and 19.
Secondly, the political conditions.
Macro-financial assistance is not the correct instrument for imposing political conditions.
We can therefore accept Amendment No 2 if its wording can be changed.
We have no problem with the references to the assistance which the Union is already carrying out, the approval of the Fund programmes, the reform of external aid, the margins of the Guarantee Fund and the multiannual financial aid package for Yugoslavia; Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 are therefore acceptable.
We have greater difficulty with the problem of the references to the distribution of the burden.
