We must not forget about the street children and the children of migrants, who are also exposed to violence.
The rights of the child must be the EU's main priority.
I welcome the initiative to set up a confidential hotline.
I have expressed my agreement with the EU strategy in the area of children's rights by casting my vote.
The strategy is dealt with in an excellent report by my colleague Mrs Angelilli, which provides a great deal of useful information.
We have to realise that we are still lacking the legal basis.
As part of a long-term strategy, it is therefore necessary to adopt concrete measures in the area of the rights of the child and implement them as quickly as possible.
Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty will make the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding.
Its Article 24 deals expressly with the rights of the child.
In the days ahead we are going to face several challenges: reducing cyber-crime as quickly as possible, putting an end to paedophilia and the sexual abuse of children and minors, and establishing rules for international adoption, which must be in the interest of the child not the adults.
All forms of violence must be prohibited.
Now is the time to transform words into actions.
The EU must listen to the children: they are the foundations of tomorrow's society.
The European house must be a safe house for children.
If we have happy children, we will have a happy society.
In the context of the debate on building a European strategy on the rights of the child, I think we should give priority to the concept of the 'interests of the child', not in opposition to the idea of rights, but to complement them, and also as a guiding theme of the strategy.
Threats to the rights of the child, in the wider world and throughout Europe, vary in nature and degree.
While in some places it is a priority to combat poverty and its causes or take action against the use of children as soldiers and for sexual exploitation, in other cases we need to safeguard the right of access to health, protection against sexual abuse or trafficking of children, or the right to be adopted in a timely manner and in accordance with transparent rules, and reinforce the role of the family.
In all cases, however, the criterion should be 'the child's best interests'.
That is the standard, the criterion, that should be used to assess the usefulness, necessity and merit of any decision, legislation or action.
I therefore believe that the most important thing in devising this strategy is to establish this concept, to which the lists of rights must be subordinate, as they are not always reasonable, achievable or appropriate.
in writing. - (FR) This report has the great merit of clearly defining the rights of the child, but above all of condemning almost exhaustively the dangers children are exposed to: from exposure at an early age to depictions of horror, pornography and violence in the media to honour crimes, forced marriages and genital mutilation on cultural or religious grounds.
Without actually mentioning the words 'Islam' or 'Islamism', terms that are strictly taboo because political correctness and fear of reprisals totally prohibit any form of comment on this religion, and still less any criticism, the rapporteur still manages under cover of more general comments to condemn within the rules all the discrimination that the practice of Islam engenders.
Thus, the banning of girls from taking part in some tuition and sports such as swimming, and all the traditional practices that are barbaric and damaging for young girls of the Muslim religion, are condemned.
We are delighted by this.
This report is a first step towards the beginnings of freedom of expression and clear-sightedness.
We will vote in favour.
in writing. - (SV) One paragraph was a cause of concern to all groups.
In paragraph 127 of the original report there was a proposal which called on all the EU Member States to ban the wearing of headscarves and the hijab at school.
As private individuals we can sympathise with the basic idea, that is to protect the right of children to play freely, take part in school gymnastics and also, as minors, to enjoy a certain protection against the coercive power of parents.
However, a complicated and sensitive question such as this can hardly be resolved at EU level.
The nations of Europe balance the rights and responsibilities of children, parents and the State in the light of their own history and political situation.
We entirely agree that the EU should create a good framework.
In a reasonable perspective paragraph 127 falls outside any such framework.
in writing. - I was pleased that the committee and the ensuing report took on board a strong focus on family and recognised the family's position in relation to children.
I also welcome the strong defence of children in relation to trafficking, institutionalisation, pornography and disability.
However the report ties EU policy into the UN International Convention on the Rights of the Child which changes competence for children from parents to the state.
Although not explicitly referred to it is a seismic shift of great concern.
Despite the positive elements of this report, like those mentioned above, the report was regrettably used to promote the sexual and reproductive rights agenda (which for the UN Convention includes abortion) which was particularly incongruous because we are dealing with children and the protection of children.
Though I very strongly support all protections for children I found myself unable to support this report.
in writing. - (NL) Despite the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was signed by many Member States, there are still too many breaches of the basic rights of young people and children.
Therefore, the Commission's initiative to present a European strategy is very welcome.
Even though children's rights remain a competence of the nation-states, both the Commission and EP rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, have highlighted a number of urgent points, such as the combating of all forms of violence and of the poverty and discrimination affecting children, and also respect for the rights of immigrant children.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has managed to add the following points to the report: greater attention to the right of children to participate in decisions that concern them, recognition of a children's ombudsman, prohibition of child labour, equal pay for equal work for those under 18, recognition of the rights of refugee children, and the right to a clean and protected environment.
I am delighted that Parliament has allocated debating time to this subject, and I fully endorse this report.
I was unable to support the report on the strategy on the rights of the child, because the Left has succeeded in having as many as five references included to these so-called rights and to reproductive health which, among other things, implies the availability of abortion.
in writing. - I am in favour of the EU promoting the rights of the child.
One recent example I would again draw to the Commission's attention is discrimination against children's right to travel with airlines withdrawing facilities for unaccompanied minors to fly.
If they did the same for the disabled or any other similar group there would (properly) be an uproar, but apparently the EU thinks it is perfectly in order to remove children's rights in this arbitrary way.
At the same time there has been some controversy over paragraph 127 calling for 'Member States to ban headscarves and the hijab, at least at primary school'.
I voted against the paragraph because of both the ambiguous wording and the fact that I believe this is too important an issue to be dealt with as a peripheral part of such a report.
Nevertheless I would be disappointed if such a practice was to become common in Europe's primary schools.
in writing. - I am the strongest defender of the need to give children a good upbringing in a strong, loving and secure family environment, to protect children from harm and abuse, to give them moral guidance and a first class education, and the best of opportunity in their lives.
I believe that the role of the state in this is a limited one - it should not seek to abrogate the rights and duties of parents, of the churches and of schools.
I certainly, therefore, see no reason for the EU to get involved.
I regret the deletion of the call for a ban on headscarves and the hijab at least at primary school - what hope is there of proper integration into our mainstream western societies if such dress is allowed?
I regret also the inclusion of language relating to adolescent sexual 'rights' - a further erosion of the very concept of childhood.
For these and many other reasons, I voted against the report.
in writing. - (FR) Based on the excellent report by my German colleague Doris Pack, I voted for the European Parliament resolution on adult learning in response to the Commission's Communication 'Adult Learning: It's never too late to learn'.
Education and training, particularly adult lifelong learning, are critical factors for achieving the Lisbon Strategy's objectives of raising economic growth, competitiveness and social progress.
Whether in terms of competitiveness, the social inclusion of adults, or the challenges associated with demographic change, this initiative, which dates back to 2001, is good news for the European Union and its citizens.
Concerning learning, and more generally, the issues associated with enterprises, I suggest handing the matter over to the social partners who, we constantly need to be reminded, have the legal instruments for constructing European social law under the current treaties, in Article 137 and subsequent articles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon currently in the process of being ratified.
in writing. - I voted for this report because the scale of current economic and social change, the rapid transition to a knowledge-based society and demographic changes resulting from the ageing population in Europe are all challenges which demand a new approach to education and training, within the framework of lifelong learning.
I voted in favour of the report by Doris Pack on 'Adult learning: it is never too late to learn', because I consider that adult learning, through the acquisition of essential skills, is crucial for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of greater economic growth, competitiveness and social inclusion.
On the other hand, and to complement this I also agree with the viewpoint that lifelong learning is fundamental for facing the current challenges of economic and social change, the rapid transition to a knowledge-based society and demographic changes resulting from an ageing population.
It is important to pay more attention to adult learning.
The adult learning agenda needs to be pushed forward.
Adult participation in education and training is not sufficient if the EU wishes to reach the benchmark goal of 12.5% participation in adult learning by 2010.
However, it is necessary to ensure the quality of adult learning, paying special attention to the various dimensions of quality in learning, principally the development of educators, quality assurance mechanisms and teaching methods and materials.
As the report says, adult learning is a vital component of lifelong learning and a very complex sector.
Adults need to connect learning to their knowledge, experience and cultural background.
Finally, it is important to emphasise gender equality with regard to programmes relating to lifelong learning, so that both men and women can derive equal advantage from the possibilities offered by such learning, and to make use of all available tools to ensure equality between men and women in measures for preparing adult education policy, in cooperation with the European Institute for Gender Equality.
in writing. - (SV) We have a high degree of confidence in the Member States' ability to deal with questions concerning the very important issue of adult education.
It is important that the education departments of the Member States have sufficient funding to develop adult education.
One way to make financial resources available to them is to reduce contributions of Member States to the EU budget so that they have more money available for investment in social provision, education and welfare.
We observe once again the failure of the federalist majority in the European Parliament to respect the exclusive competence of the Member States in the organisation of education and the content of training systems.
This own-initiative report from the European Parliament should never have been written and cannot be seen as anything more than a job-creation scheme for the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education.
The report on which we are voting relates to adult education, in other words to a matter which is acquiring immense significance throughout the European Union, but which has become something more than that in my country - it is a beneficial trend and passion for thousands of people.
This is not always dictated by purely commercial considerations.
May I draw your attention to one aspect of continuous adult education that is linked to both modern demographic and civilisational challenges and the inheritance of the old order.
The socialist system enforced a specific educational model which, in the sphere of humanities, was saturated with propaganda and ideology, and in other spheres reflected a detachment from world trends.
For these reasons, adult education in the new Member States is both a chance to make amends for the weaknesses of the socialist model of education outlined above and at the same time a genuine opening up to the world.
In the sphere of knowledge of foreign languages, readiness to take the risk of retraining and changing jobs and the promotion of European educational standards, this is an obvious precondition for mobility and the chance of finding employment - which explains the broad interest in continuing education among my peers from Central and Eastern Europe.
In her report, Mrs Pack calls for education to continue throughout a person's working life, without restricting study to the school years only.
I agree with the assertion that the current rate of economic and social change is enforcing a need for constant, long-term personal development.
It is also a fact that adult education has a beneficial impact on adults' sense of their own worth, helps to foster better social integration and builds intercultural dialogue.
in writing. - I feel that the report's goal of ensuring Member States reach a 12.5% target for participation in adult learning by 2010 will improve not only the EU's competitiveness, but will also allow for greater social inclusion and intercultural awareness: exactly what is needed for the year of intercultural dialogue.
The greater use of technology and proposals to increase childcare facilities will improve opportunities for everyone to truly benefit from education.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (DE) It is counterproductive on the one hand to stop one's own population from learning, and on the other hand to come up with plans for a 'blue card', because owing to the increase in atypical relationships and greater competitive pressure, a good basic and continuing education is now no longer any kind of protection against unemployment.
Enough well-educated people have been rejected by companies simply because the latter are searching for the cheapest McJob graduates or are merely wanting to offer more unusual employment contracts.
As a matter of principle, the lack of skilled workers used as a pretext for this should be removed.
If this is not possible preference should be given to a seasonal model.
Further mass migration can then be prevented.
Despite the discrepancies displayed in the EU targets, efforts and programmes in the lifelong learning sector still deserve our support.

Situation in Kenya (debate)
The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission concerning the situation in Kenya.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am very pleased that today the European Parliament is going to discuss the situation in Kenya and also debate the proposed resolution on the current situation there.
The mere fact that the European Parliament sent the Election Observation Mission under the leadership of Mr Lambsdorff, and its own delegation led by Mr Mulder, gave a very important sign that the European Parliament is interested in the situation in Kenya.
The elections in Kenya, as we know, took place on 27 December.
The high turnout of the Kenyan voters is proof of the commitment of the Kenyan people to the democratic process and of the trust in that process.
The European Union Election Observation Mission was present at the actual location and was led by Mr Lambsdorff.
It warned of numerous irregularities in the counting and recording of the votes during these elections.
These irregularities are causing serious doubts about the actual outcome of these elections.
As we know, after the results were published, violence broke out in the capitol Nairobi and other parts of Kenya.
Supporters of the opposition leader, Mr Odinge, clashed several times with the security forces and also attacked the followers of President Kibaki.
Shots were fired by the security forces into the masses.
According to Louise Arbour, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the security forces responded "with excessive violenceâ.
At least 600 people lost their lives and almost a quarter of a million people were displaced - all this in Kenya, a country to which refugees from the neighbouring countries, Somalia and southern Sudan, usually flee.
It has affected the economy not only of Kenya itself, but also of the neighbouring countries, especially those without their own access to the sea.
That is a tragedy.
At the same time it is a great blow to the process of democratisation and a blow to the whole continent of Africa, where Kenya was regarded as exemplary.
The European Union condemned the violence in Kenya.
We appealed to Kenyan leaders to try and answer the doubts about the regularity of the elections, but first of all to establish a dialogue and find a political solution.
Naturally, we responded to the humanitarian needs of the Kenyan population.
The European Union saluted the mediation by President Kufuor of Ghana, who is presiding over the African Union.
We also expressed our support for a group of eminent African personalities led by the former United Nations Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, which should arrive in Nairobi shortly.
In the meantime, President Kibaki has appointed his government without consultation with the opposition leader, Mr Odinga.
The latter has called for mass demonstrations in Kenya in three days' time.
On a more positive note, the Kenyan Parliament had its first session yesterday.
The opposition candidate was elected President of the Parliament.
This was encouraging in the sense that certain democratic rules have still been observed in the country and that the opposition still has a voice.
As for the European Union, it is perfectly clear that normal business with Kenya will not be possible until a political compromise is found.
The compromise must lead to a permanent solution which will uphold the will of the Kenyan people, gain the trust of the Kenyan people and return Kenya to stability.
In the name of the European Union, I can say that everything that has followed the Kenyan elections has represented a great disappointment and that the situation is still worrying.
However, this cannot be compared with the disappointment felt by the people of Kenya themselves, people who took part in the elections en masse in the hope of a better future.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the European Commission is deeply concerned at the serious crisis Kenya is experiencing.
Furthermore, the day after the elections, when we saw the warning signs of the chaos following what happened particularly during the counting of votes, we mobilised and established contacts with the authorities on both sides - the outgoing majority and the opposition.
I should also tell you regarding this that I had no trouble getting in direct, personal contact with Mr Odinga.
On the other hand, since then and despite repeated attempts, I have never been able to make direct, personal contact with Mr Kibaki, which is surprising considering how easy it was to contact him in the past.
This is fairly indicative of the unease that reigned.
The post-election violence, which has caused the deaths of more than 600 people and the displacement of more than 250 000, has obviously highlighted the frustration and anger felt by the Kenyan people about the profound problems of socioeconomic inequality and corruption undermining Kenyan society, with the risk of confrontation on ethnic lines.
But these elections have also highlighted the democratic aspirations of the Kenyan people.
These aspirations have been flouted by the irregularities that occurred on election day, which cast serious doubt on the validity of the official results.
We fully share the conclusions and declarations of the European Union's election observation mission, led by your fellow Member Alexander Lambsdorff, whom I would really like to congratulate for the excellent work he did, to the point that the international authorities outside the EU, which started off in a slightly less categorical position, in some ways a slightly less objective position, ended up supporting Mr Lambsdorff's observations and conclusions and endorsing them.
The Commission's position with respect to the political situation in Kenya could not be clearer.
Kenya's political leaders urgently need to size up their responsibilities and immediately and seriously commit themselves to finding a political settlement.
Without such a commitment, the European Union will undoubtedly have no other option than to review its relations with Kenya, which until now, it has to be said, have been excellent.
Kenya is a country that was felt to be on the right track in terms of governance, human rights and democracy, and it was also playing an important role in regional stability.
We need to remember these things.
Seeking a political settlement is therefore the responsibility first and foremost of the Kenyan leaders.
It requires an immediate halt to provocation and violence in the streets, but also in the media and in public posturing.
It is crucial for President Mwai Kibaki, and the opposition leader Raila Odinga, to agree to compromise by recognising that the election result is not correctly reflected in the exercise of power and responsibility, and that there must inevitably be power sharing to avoid the continuation of the political crisis.
This power sharing could be an interim solution until, for example, new elections could be held.
Finally, it is important for the Kenyan political class to recognise the pressing need to solve the basic problems at the root of this outburst of violence, whether they are the constitutional organisation of power, the political governance of the country, or the serious discrimination and socioeconomic inequalities.
The Commission and the European Union as a whole fully support the African mediation launched by President Kufuor and continued by Kofi Annan, thanks to GraÃ§a Machel and Benjamin Mkapa.
They call upon President Kibaki and Raila Odinga to cooperate fully with the aim of finding a political settlement.
I spoke at length with Desmond Tutu at the start of the crisis, during his mediation mission.
I also had a very long discussion with Kofi Annan, who indicated that the most appropriate thing would be for African mediation to accompany a process of rapprochement.
I have promised the Commission's support for this mediation, whether politically or financially.
Whatever the case, we should be pleased that the speaker of the Kenyan parliament was elected properly last night.
We should take this as a sign of respect for the constitutional framework, from this point of view at least.
However, the next few days will be crucial.
We will be monitoring the situation closely and will remain in constant contact with the African mediators.
We will adapt our relations with Kenya, including as regards cooperation, to reflect changes in the situation and the actions of both sides.
All options are currently on the table.
There needs to be European and international dialogue so that what we do has the maximum impact.
It seems that the international community is currently on the same wavelength, that there are no longer differences in approach, political tendency, or even strategy.
This is important.
It was not necessarily the case at the outset, straight after the elections.
I think this is something we have now achieved, and it is a good thing.
As for the humanitarian situation, the Commission has reacted very quickly.
Following the assessments by experts from ECHO and our partners in the field, the Commission has released initial emergency aid of 5.5 million euros to cope with the needs of displaced people for water, food, shelter and healthcare.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, as has already been said, Kenya has been an important example of democracy and stability in the region since 2002.
In recent years, the country has made great political and economic strides.
The Kenyan elections have shown that the vast majority of Kenyans prefer democracy to dictatorship.
They have shown that they have more faith in elected representatives than in the military.
Nevertheless, these alarming outbursts of violence have occurred, and there is now a humanitarian crisis that has already left hundreds dead and more than 250 000 refugees.
This will not be without consequences for the country's economic situation.
What is to be done?
It is important for the European Union to offer its full support to the panel of 'eminent African personalities' appointed by the African Union and headed by Kofi Annan.
If the past can teach us one thing, it is that we must not think that we - Europe - can solve Africa's problems.
African problems require African solutions, and I welcome the European Commission's support for this.
Mr President, our group fully supports the resolution.
I do have one more thing to get off my chest, however: something that our group considers extremely regrettable.
This is that, one day after the elections - that is, at a time when the outcome had been decided and, as the Commissioner has said, irregularities had already abounded - the European Commission transferred more than 40 million euros to the government in budget aid.
It did not even await the findings of our own observation team - which, incidentally, were published just three days later.
This political decision cannot be justified on the technicality that the payment had already been delayed once, until after the elections, and that it was just the third in a series of payments.
This payment could have and should have been deferred.
This was an extremely unfortunate decision, all the more so because the Member States themselves had already suspended their aid.
This must not happen again.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, additional proof that the majority of the Kenyan people did not support President Kibaki is that in the parliamentary elections, which were held at the same time as the presidential elections, Mr Odinga's opposition party won more than twice as many votes as Mr Kibaki's party.
As we know, this enabled Mr Odinga's party to win the post of speaker when Parliament opened yesterday in Nairobi.
Meanwhile, 22 of Mr Kibaki's ministers, who aspired to be MPs, were defeated at the elections.
President Kibaki is, in my view, responsible for a great deal, not only because of the electoral fraud.
His five years in government have led to frustration, disillusionment and deception.
It is true that the economy has grown by 6%, but more than half the population is still living below the poverty line.
Also, several cabinet ministers, appointed by Mr Kibaki in a clear act of provocation, have been linked with cases of corruption.
This President, who is fraudulently seeking to remain in power, is also responsible for another serious matter: his action has caused a resurgence in inter-ethnic conflict, a spiral that may be difficult to contain.
As if this were not enough, as you know, two weeks ago the Chairman of the Kenyan Electoral Commission stated no less than that he did not know who had won the presidential elections.
In view of all this, in my opinion it makes perfect sense, as paragraph 11 of the joint motion for a resolution of Parliament states, to demand that new elections be called if it is impossible for an independent institution to organise a clean, transparent and credible recount of the votes cast in the 27 December elections.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the Council, the Commission and also to my fellow Members here in the European Parliament.
There is great unity among the institutions.
This makes me personally very happy and I say this also on behalf of my team of more than 150 election observers, at least 50 of whom have been stationed in Kenya for over a month. Our unity here is a good sign.
Some of these observers - I want to state this here - are now on their way to Pakistan, or have already arrived there, where the next difficult election is pending.
Election monitoring is sometimes a difficult and dangerous job.
I should like to thank these people most sincerely for their commitment to this.
Whatever you stand for, Europe is the common value.
We can be proud - as the Commissioner has just said - that other monitoring missions have subscribed to our judgment, for instance the Commonwealth Delegation and the International Republican Institute from the United States.
I believe the work of the monitoring mission has therefore established a basis for a joint effort in which the European Union, Africa and the United States all pull together in order to reach a solution to the crisis in Kenya.
In its resolution the European Parliament will highlight the paths it considers appropriate.
As chief observer, I have not taken part in these consultations myself.
The neutrality of our mission must, in my view, be unequivocally preserved to the end.
To the end means until our final report, which we are presently compiling, is submitted.
Together with the professional work of our observers in the field, the resulting neutrality was our strongest asset.
Neutrality and professionalism also include the fact that we work only on the basis of proof.
In our conclusion we discovered that there is scepticism about the result of the presidential election.
As a monitoring mission, we have never said that a particular candidate has won the elections.
What we have said is that it is not possible to establish who the winner is.
I would like to quote something in English from the Kenyan election observers, who write as follows:
'In our view, considering the entire electoral process, the 2007 general elections were credible in as far as the voting and counting process is concerned.
The electoral process lost credibility towards the end with regard to the tallying and announcement of presidential results.'
That statement comes from the national Kenyan observers, who stationed between 16 000 and 20 000 people there.
It is entirely consistent with our findings.
I now wish to say something that applies to me, to the team and to everyone: we are hoping for a rapid settlement of the crisis, an end to the violence and for the refugees to return to their homeland as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Prime Minister, Commissioner, Kenya is more than just the problem of President Kibaki's electoral abuses.
We are dealing here with a humanitarian crisis for the civilian population.
The most dramatic situation seems to be happening in Eldoret, in the Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Langas.
There we are dealing with numerous murders set against a political and ethnic background.
Many Kenyans have been driven out of their family homes, which have then been burned down.
On 1 January 2008 more than 3 000 people were taking refuge in the parish of Langas.
The refugees are deprived of food, clean water and sanitation.
On 2 January this year the Catholic Missionary Service News Agency, MISNA, reported that between 7 000 and 10 000 people were taking refuge in the cathedral in Langas.
What is needed is not only political mediation, but also action to guarantee that no outburst of ethnic and religious hatred will be permitted.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I think that in view of the current situation, the European Union should make an effort to assert its credibility as regards the observation missions it sends to these countries.
For if it is observed quite seriously, as was the case, that the result is clearly fraudulent, that the president cannot be considered the legitimately elected president, the European Union should then be consistent in its policy and start, at the very least, by not recognising the president, in this case Mr Kibaki.
Secondly, the EU should propose and ensure, as rapidly as possible, that new presidential elections are held that will enable the president to be properly elected, honestly this time.
Sadly, we have precedents, notably in Ethiopia where the President also used force to get himself into office, despite the evidence of fraud followed by much repressive violence.
The European Union's acceptance of this fait accompli helps to undermine the value of sending observation missions.
What is the point of sending European observation missions with the seriousness and commitment of all our colleagues in this area to make conclusions that are unanimously recognised by everyone, if in the end we lie low and a few months later accept a coup by a president who will not even listen?
Would we accept this kind of situation in our own countries?
Obviously not.
Therefore we cannot, in terms of the democracy and electoral processes we support, have double standards, one applying in the European Union and the other fluctuating in line with peoples' interests in these regions.
The Kenyan people, I believe, want to get to the bottom of this situation and are calling for new elections to make things perfectly clear.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are certainly all agreed that the events in Kenya are tragic and that there must categorically be an end to today's continuing violence.
The crisis in Kenya is fundamental and in my view not merely political in nature.
To all intents and purposes, it can also have an impact on the situation in Africa's neighbouring countries.
It is true that there are rabble-rousers in Kenya trying to invoke hatred between ethnic groups in order to gain power.
But if, for example, you read the free Kenyan press these days, it is very heartening to see how many journalists are constantly striving to stand up for unity in the country and for unity among the Kenyan people and are turning against the fragmentation of society.
The problem primarily is that it has not been possible to allow broad sections of the Kenyan population to have a share in the Kenyan economic boom and that violence is able to spread on this basis.
In the context of our development cooperation, we should rather emphasise the fact that a real attempt is being made here to bring about change and in particular, to carry out a practical campaign against poverty in Kenya.
I also think that holding discussions about the cancellation of budget support for Kenya is a problem, because this fuels anxiety about the future in Kenya.
I specifically welcome the fact, Commissioner Michel, that the EU is clearly on the side of Kofi Annan and other mediators from the African Union in helping to resolve these processes in Kenya and with African politicians.
- (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to commend the high level of activity among the citizens of Kenya on election day.
The elections were characterised by high rates of participation and patience on the part of citizens, regardless of the long queues and technical problems in certain districts.
The situation regarding the production of presidential election results was, unfortunately, entirely different.
The requisite transparency was not achieved.
The many breaches and discrepancies in information cast doubt upon the election results announced.
Unfortunately, the impression has been given that the results were produced according to the principle that it is not how you vote that is important, but rather how we count the votes.
If it is not possible to carry out a reliable and transparent review of the votes, then the presidential elections in Kenya should be held again.
After the announcement of the election results the already tense atmosphere unfortunately turned violent.
The most urgent priority now is to stop the violence and avert a humanitarian crisis.
The European Union must support the mission led by the African Union and Kofi Annan to mediate between the President and the opposition, in order to stop the violence and find a solution to the political crisis.
If necessary, the European Union ought to be ready to continue this mediation.
Certainly, the European Union must grant Kenya the humanitarian aid needed to relieve the situation of the many thousands of displaced persons who, because of violence, have been forced to abandon their homes.
Humanitarian aid should, however, be provided in such a way that it really reaches displaced persons and there is proper control over the way in which funds are used.
From this viewpoint, the European Commission's decision, one day after the elections, to transfer 40 million euros of budget support to the Kenyan government without taking into account the criticisms of European Union observers regarding the conduct of the elections, is questionable.
Budget support unfortunately does not ensure rigorous control of the use of funds, and the provision of such assistance to a president and a government that have reached power in questionable elections ought to be carefully evaluated.
I call on the European Commission to assess this case and to inform the European Parliament of the measures taken to prevent a recurrence of such a situation.
Mr President, clearly we need to identify the fact that Kenya is a country where most people are actually subsisting on a couple of dollars a day.
There is massive discontent and deprivation; a whole army of discontented people, as we have seen, has been engendered by the situation there, because what they realise is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Kenya has widened - and that in the context of that 6% growth in GDP which others have mentioned.
Kenya is a low-income, low-resource economy.
It is also a country which, tragically, is mired in patronage and in corruption.
And what we see is that, as we speak here today, people are storing up food, and people are out on the streets again in Nairobi and in other parts of Kenya.
Therefore I would add my voice to those that have said that the EU must suspend budget support to Kenya until a political resolution to the present crisis has been found.
Of course, it is unacceptable that that EUR 40.6 million was sent the day after the election criticisms were made.
I am very encouraged that Commissioner Michel intimated in our committee on Monday that budget support would be reviewed immediately.
I would like to hear some more detail of that.
Instead of channelling money through line ministries in Kenya, we must look at ways of doing it through project support, which also ensures that the poor of Kenya are not damaged by such an action.
In my view we need to be much clearer about the need to place aid conditionality on good governance, as is clearly stated under the Cotonou Partnership Agreements, and we have not done that.
We have, I am afraid, turned a blind eye to many of the serious accusations about corruption in that country.
Finally, the perpetrators of those irregular election results that the observers have reported to us must be held to account and must not be allowed to get away with it.
I also say that the European Union must play its part in monitoring the mediation process.
We have been at the vanguard of asking for these considerations to be made, and I would like the Council and the European Union to be stronger and more consistent in its approach, and make sure that Kofi Annan is given all the support he needs from Europe, and that a new Election Commission can be put in place as soon as possible.
(ES) Mr President, we Europeans cannot just say that we are very concerned but we very much hope that things will return to normal, because a return to normality at the price of accepting the fraudulent victory of Mr Kibaki is not a solution that we can accept.
In too many African countries, rigged elections have robbed citizens of all faith and hope in the democratic system.
Another case of this, this time in Kenya, would be lethal for the democratic hopes of Africa.
The solution can only come from strong external pressure.
Without strong external pressure the two leaders will not reach any kind of agreement, and we need to tell Mr Kibaki clearly that his Government is illegal and act accordingly.
Otherwise, our electoral observation missions would be pointless.
We have talked about the responsibilities of the African people, but we should also remember our own responsibilities.
For too long we have closed our eyes to what was going on in Kenya.
For too long we have sung the praises of that country as an example of democracy, forgetting the social inequalities and the corruption that was rife throughout the country: 16 billion dollars in aid have been received by that country since independence and there have been just four presidents.
Kenya is paying very dearly for the protection and support that we have given to its poor governments, without denouncing them.
We cannot close our eyes this time.
(NL) Mr President, today has seen further serious police violence against demonstrators.
There have been further deaths in Kenya.
Can there be an end to this tension without renewed presidential elections?
I doubt it.
At all events, an independent investigation into this electoral fraud is required, the outcome of which must be respected by all parties even if it means new elections.
Kenya is running tremendous risks.
It is in the interest of all Kenyans, of the region and even of the EU itself that the unrest is brought to an end.
To reject dialogue now would be irresponsible.
Moreover, one thing is clear: further budget aid to an undemocratic government such as this is out of the question.
Kofi Annan has been taken ill, and rarely has a bout of flu come at a worse moment.
Nevertheless, the EU must lose no time in fully supporting his mission and offering technical and financial assistance where necessary.
Naturally it is the African leaders who must mediate in the first instance but, if the situation threatens to escalate further before Mr Annan's arrival, the EU itself will have to be ready to join with the African Union in sending a high-level delegation to Nairobi without delay.
Kenya must not become another Somalia.
It is not yet too late.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Borrell Fontelles that, if any good has come out of the post-election situation in Kenya, it is that it has revealed that the so-called Kenyan success story is built on a foundation of straw.
While it is true that the thirst among ordinary Kenyans for democracy is strong and that Kenya has been going through a great economic boom, it is equally clear that for years a government overseeing that economic boom has failed to ensure that the whole of its population has benefited economically and socially.
We now know that there is deep-rooted social and economic disarray in the country and that for years the Government has operated on a basis of corruption and economic mismanagement.
The concept, as Mrs Kinnock rightly says, of good governance and respect for democracy are prerequisites for European Union aid.
But, contrary to what other speakers have said, that does not mean that we should abandon the country.
It means we should rechannel our aid through agencies and organisations that can get money to the poor, the neediest and the weakest in Kenya.
Clearly, if the election results are not properly monitored and respected, we cannot continue to channel money through the Kenyan Government.
We have to send a clear message: good governance is a prerequisite for assistance from the European Union.
Mr President, this situation, as all the others have said, is very tragic: it resembles very much what happened a few years ago in Addis Ababa.
I doubt whether a solution can be found without new elections.
But, ideally, a solution should now be found through dialogue in Kenya, preferably supported by the African Union.
But, so far, we have seen very little progress.
Time is short: the fabric of the country is disintegrating as we speak.
We cannot be bystanders if the situation is not resolved.
To suspend aid is a must under the present circumstances.
Moreover, if reconciliation fails, the EU has to step in to offer its services to mediate.
Is the Council, is the Commission prepared to do that?
In the longer-term perspective, I would submit that we have to seriously reconsider not only our development cooperation but in particular our governance programme, and in particular help political parties to become real parties and, in addition to that, strengthen the institution of the Kenyan Parliament, because that is a key problem right now.
Mr President, as someone who has visited Kenya previously and in particular the slum areas in Nairobi, I am familiar with the corruption that was in place even prior to this election.
I condemn the tragic loss of up to 600 lives, and the critical humanitarian situation which has ensued after the 27 December elections in Kenya.
I call on the relevant authorities and stakeholders to do their utmost to bring peace to Kenya and ensure that human rights and the rule of law are respected.
It is most unfortunate that Kenya, being one of the most stable and economically-developed nations in East Africa, has now descended into such chaos, as this will most likely have detrimental knock-on effects on its neighbouring countries.
The EU election observation mission concluded that the lack of transparency and adequate security procedures severely undermined the credibility of the presidential election results.
Today, Mr Odinga's opposition party has called once again for nationwide protests regarding the outcome of last month's presidential election.
These opposition rallies are due to last for three days, despite a government ban.
Such protests could lead to further bloodshed.
Many of the killings seem to have been based purely on ethnic differences, the most horrendous of which was the brutal attack on a church near the town of Eldoret, which is thought to have left more than 30 ethnic Kikuyu dead.
I urge Mr Kibaki to respect his country's democratic commitments as enshrined in Kenya's national Constitution and the guidelines of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights.
I call on the Presidency of the EU and the European Commission to monitor closely the mediation mission that will be led by Mr Annan later this week and, if required, to ensure an immediate continuation of these mediation efforts by a high-level EU delegation, possibly a joint EU-AU initiative.
- (DE) Mr President, I should like to follow up on the question from my colleague Glenys Kinnock to Commissioner Michel.
What are the main points?
How can we visualise this?
In what direction is budget support being modified?
One extra question: I assume that arrangements are already in place in the current budget support system for support to be suspended in such a situation as that which prevailed in Kenya after the elections?
(NL) Mr President, we all agree that what has clearly gone wrong in Kenya is the presidential election procedure.
What have gone relatively well, however, are the parliamentary elections, the elections for members of the national parliament.
I agree with Commissioner Michel that yesterday's developments in the Kenyan Parliament are encouraging: the speaker has been elected - the parties and the opposition have been sufficiently powerful to push through the elections for the new speaker.
I therefore believe that the European Parliament must do everything possible to support parliamentary democracy in Kenya and strengthen it where possible.
The budget aid that was granted exactly one day after the elections has drawn criticism from many quarters of this House.
I would like to ask the Commissioner the following question - even though this is probably not officially allowed.
Would he be inclined to make future decisions to grant budget aid dependent on the European Parliament's opinion?
In my view, it is not for a small group of officials in the European Development Fund Committee to take such a decision; instead, the Commissioner should first seek the European Parliament's opinion.
I would like to have a clear answer to this question.
- (PL) Mr President, the example of Kenya shows what a breakdown in democratic standards can lead to, and how important it is for elections to be free, transparent, honest and fair.
People who have lost elections, regardless of whether they lost in honest rivalry or whether they were cheated by those who organised the election process, should nevertheless not pursue violence and destruction.
Randomly hurting people, including women and children, has nothing in common with acceptable forms of struggle for one's rights.
The only hope for an effective solution to problems of this type lies in convincing the rulers and the opposition that the overriding aim of politics is not to acquire or hold onto power; the aim of politics is the good of the people.
A return to normal for Kenya must therefore begin with a suspension of violence and destruction.
I appreciate that this is the aim of mediators from the African Union, and the European Union should support this process.
I would like to thank Commissioner Michel for making such a declaration.
- (DE) Mr President, it is not only recently that the extent of corruption in Kenya has become evident and as a result, many Member States - actually all Member States - have stopped budget support in the last few years and even switched over to project aid.
This is actually one of the points of criticism I would like to address to the Commission, since the Commission has apparently not made the Member States aware of these concerns and has carried on with the budget support.
I, too, am now in favour of continuing the support in an appropriate form, but not in a form that would give the previous structures the opportunity to administer the money via budget support.
I am also very much in favour of in future supporting the institution that has now been authorised, in other words the Kenyan Parliament.
We cannot automatically assume that all Members of Parliament behave properly and that there is no prevailing corruption.
I have no illusions about this.
Nevertheless, we should channel a large proportion of support into Kenya's political institutions, into promoting its Parliament and our colleagues' capacity for work.
Then we shall have the opportunity to enable these newly-authorised colleagues to govern Kenya more effectively in future than the current government has managed to do.
Mr President, I think it is generally accepted that the recent presidential elections in Kenya were flawed.
I think that is a great pity because Kenya is a country that has been politically stable for many decades.
Sadly that has changed in the last two weeks and we have seen over 600 people killed and 250 000 people have been displaced.
Unfortunately, again, that violence is ethnic in nature.
The question now is, what can the international community and ourselves do to bring political stability back to Kenya before the situation deteriorates further?
Constructive political dialogue between both sides must be a key priority, and I would agree with other speakers that yesterday was a positive day in the Kenyan Parliament.
Without political engagement, however, there will be no agreement, and the European Union is urging its political talks.
I am delighted to see that Kofi Annan and the Presidents of Tanzania and Uganda will be there shortly to try and broker some sort of deal.
Many of the people who have been displaced have gone into Uganda, which means there have already been effects on the regions surrounding Kenya.
With regard to aid and the European Union increasing its level of financial support for humanitarian programmes in Kenya, I would be interested to hear Commissioner Michel's answer on how exactly that money will be spent and to make sure it has been spent correctly, as raised by previous speakers.
I think we all should remember - and particularly the Kenyan people and the politicians should remember - that history has shown, time and time again, that, where there is a political vacuum, that vacuum can often be filled by extremists, but the people of Kenya deserve better.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Mr Borrell warned that we must not limit ourselves simply to expressions of concern.
I agree, and in those terms I would like to answer Mr Wijkman's question: Is the European Union prepared to assist in the search for a solution?
The viewpoint of the Presidency is that it must be prepared to actively assist in the search for a solution.
But what solution?
Mrs Martens emphasised the need for an African solution to African problems.
I agree with that too.
In other words, the European Union is not the one who should be forcing its own solutions to problems of this kind - on the contrary.
However, it is necessary for it to give active support in the search for a suitable solution with other parties in the international community, especially with those whose values we share and which were referred to by Mr Lambsdorff.
In this sense, the Presidency will endeavour to give strong support to the eminent group of African personalities led by the former Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Annan.
In our judgement, it will also be necessary to continue with humanitarian aid, in an appropriate manner of course.
Mr President, allow me to thank all the esteemed Members of Parliament for their contributions.
We will certainly relate them faithfully to our colleagues in the Council.
We are very pleased that the general standpoint of the institutions is very similar.
We will follow the development of events in Kenya very closely.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I will first quickly mention not the 30 million but the 40.6 million euros that constituted the payment, several months ago, of the second tranche of the 120-million-euro programme known as 'Poverty Reduction Budget Support'.
The payment decision had been delayed to await the results and recommendations of the third review of the PRBS programme by the International Monetary Fund.
These results have been known since early November and in November, on the basis of the International Monetary Fund's favourable opinion, the Commission approved in principle the payment of a sum of 40.6 million euros by letter to the Kenyan Finance Minister.
However, taking account of the electoral context and the risk of the government using this payment for electioneering, the Commission decided, in consultation with the Member States, not to make the payment before the elections but after they had taken place, by the cut-off date of 31 December for financial commitments in accordance with the applicable procedures.
That is why, technically, the payment was made on 28 December.
I understand the upset this is causing, but just to remind you, it was only from the evening of Friday 28 and Saturday 29 December that the irregularities started to appear, when the transmission of the results from the last 49 constituencies, out of a total of 210, were subject to abnormal delays and, as you know, it was only on Monday 1 January, on the basis of the weekend's events, that the EU election observation mission reported in its preliminary analysis that the elections had not met international standards.
Therefore, it was technically too late to prevent or block the payment of this sum of 40.6 million euros.
Secondly, I would like to mention - because it is important from the point of view of the argument - that I agree with many of the things that have been said, but that there are also things I do not agree with at all.
When someone suggests that the technique or method of budget support is a method or technique on which there are no conditions or controls, that is obviously wrong.
I would just like to draw attention to the fact that before we suddenly suspend budget support we should first check that the proposal, made by Mrs Kinnock and others, to convert budget support into project support, is feasible quickly, or as quickly as budget support allows, so as not to put the people in an even more catastrophic situation of deprivation.
Indeed, it is easy to affirm principles, but we still need to make sure that the results and consequences of implementing them do not help to make the situation even worse.
That brings me to two thoughts on budget support.
Budget support is controlled.
There is evidence to be provided, and it is no less transparent than the project support system.
Of course, Mrs Kinnock and others, it goes without saying that if a settlement is not reached quickly between the parties to restore calm and, I hope, to agree on the possible organisation of new elections, as Mr Wittmann wishes, budget support, which to some extent qualifies the countries it is used for as meeting certain standards, certainly will not be able to be used any more and it will be necessary to find other means of providing support.
However, I do not agree that we should just suspend development aid to Kenya.
We always need to remember that behind this aid there are people who benefit from it.
I wanted to clarify this and I believe it was important.
A last response, finally, to two other points.
Do elections need to be organised straight away?
I think it would be desirable for the parties to reach an agreement.
We can express all the wishes in the world, but believing that elections will be organised immediately without agreement between the parties is unrealistic.
Care also needs to be taken not to encourage situations to develop that make the people's difficulty and misfortune even worse.
This is something we should not lose sight of, and I think we need to act with great caution.
I am in favour of elections, provided that they come out of a settlement.
We will fully support the African mediation and, of course, as the Council said, the Commission is available for a mediation mission.
I made contact with Kofi Annan and had a long discussion with him.
I told him we were available - including the High Representative - for mediation work.
Clearly what is now hoped for is that it can primarily be African mediation.
It seems to me that this is something we cannot lose sight of.
In closing, my last comment in answer to the question Mr Mulder asked, if the European Development Fund were budgetised, as Parliament and I are asking, budget support - for example the amount, technique, controls, verification and monitoring - would be done automatically, which would greatly simplify the procedure.
You cannot imagine how much easier and more efficient my life would be if I depended much more directly on Parliament's choices, options and control over the use of my budget.
As things stand, I am afraid that this will unfortunately not be possible, but clearly this is a subject I would like to discuss.
The question you ask proves once again that the budgetisation of the European Development Fund would be a considerable advance on the level of effectiveness of our support.
I have received six motions for a resolution1 submitted in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 17 January 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
1 See Minutes.
I contribute to this debate with a degree of sadness.
Five years ago in December 2002 I was part of the European Parliament's Election Observation Mission to Kenya led by Baroness Nicholson.
That election was conducted within International Guidelines that gave the result an integrity that validated a result that gave a victory to the opposition.
Having had the opportunity to meet with Mwai Kibaki, the incoming President, we all felt, alongside the conviction of the fairness of his election, that Kenya's future looked brighter with a new era of more efficiency and less corruption beckoning.
Now like at the end of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' the pigs have become men and the men pigs.
The regime that offered so much promise has become as corrupt and inept as its predecessor, in the process destroying the hopes and future of millions of Kenyans.
I welcome the robust statements of the EU's Chief Election Observer.
I hope the Commission will encourage reconciliation amongst the disputing factions and threaten strong measures if there is any failure to agree.
in writing. - As a former European Parliament election observer for Kenya, I am deeply concerned by the turn of events following the election in December.
The fact that Kenya has for years been seen as the most stable country in that part of the African continent makes developments doubly worrying.
Kenya, like my country, is a member of the Commonwealth.
I support the proposal put forward by the Commonwealth observation team that independent Commonwealth judges be put in place to review the election results.
Our own EU election observation team suggested that an independent audit of the results take place.
I am convinced that the Kenyan people would have confidence in such an audit being carried out by Commonwealth judges.
Our immediate priority is to see Kenya return to a state of normality, by which I mean a peaceful society in which the democratic process is not in doubt.
The news today that the security forces prevented opposition politicians from staging a protest rally does not bode well.
I urge the EU to do all in its power to work with other international organisations to ensure that Kenya can recover both its normality and its democracy.
EUROPOL (debate)
The next item is the report by AgustÃ­n DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the European Police Office (EUROPOL) - C6-0055/2007 -.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would first like to thank Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra for the report he prepared regarding the Council's decision in favour of establishing the European Police Bureau, Europol, on the basis of the proposal put forward by the Commission.
At this point in time, the Council is still debating the draft of said decision and, in these debates, the Presidency will refer to or take into consideration the above-mentioned report by the Member of Parliament.
Especially in the area of personal data protection and democratic control, the Presidency will take into consideration or strive to take into consideration doubts expressed by the rapporteur.
The shaping, final shaping, of the Council's decision by June 2008 is one of the priority tasks of our Presidency.
The aim of the decision, which will replace the Europol Convention, is primarily to improve the operative and administrative function of Europol, thereby enabling it to respond more rapidly and more effectively to new challenges.
I must emphasise that the German and Portuguese Presidencies have already achieved an important advance in this matter, on the basis of which sections one, two, three, six, seven and nine have been finally shaped.
These are the sections on foundation and tasks, data processing systems, common information processing provisions, organisation, confidentiality matters and other provisions.
Therefore, the Presidency will from now on concentrate primarily on the remaining sections regarding relations with partners, security and data security, budgetary provisions, i.e. monitoring and evaluation, and transitional and final provisions.
In deliberations on the open sections, pursuant to the Council decisions of June last year, the Presidency will devote special considerations to finding appropriate solutions for the following issues: firstly the issues of removing immunity from Europol officials working for common investigation units; secondly the principle of rotation and the possibility for those employed by Europol and participating in common investigation units to receive instructions from the head of the unit; and thirdly the question of budgetary neutrality.
The expert groups have already started deliberations on the issues mentioned, and the Europol working group and the committee are also continuing deliberations according to article 36.
The two key elements of all these deliberations will be the improvement of Europol's operational capacity and the consideration of the principle of budgetary neutrality.
The Presidency is aiming to reach an agreement on these questions as early as the first quarter of 2008.
The Presidency will also closely follow the course of events relating to the implementation plan.
This plan defines all the key points which should be resolved if the decision on Europol is to be enforced from 1 January 2010.
The initial debates on all such implementation measures are scheduled to start in the first half of this year.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Slovenian Presidency, whom I thank, has just said that the Commission's proposal, of December 2006, which aims to replace the Europol Convention with a Council decision, is one of their priorities, and that they hope to secure political agreement as soon as possible.
Obviously I offer them my full support because I believe the operation and administrative functioning of Europol will be clearly improved by it and that, as the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers pointed out in June, the ability to operate effectively is a key aim of the reform of Europol.
I also thank most warmly the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera, for the quality of his report and I would highlight the quality of the amendments proposed on the basis of his proposal, which has, however, been subject since then to many modifications, mentioned by the Presidency, following discussions during the German and Portuguese Presidencies.
The Commission is going to look at how these amendments can be taken into account.
Among the amendments, the Commission notes the proposal from Mr DÃ­az de Mera that Parliament's democratic scrutiny of Europol could operate by Europol being funded from the general budget of the European Union.
I also support the idea of Community funding referred to in Amendment 6, which relates to Recital 5.
I also support Europol having a Community footing, requested in Amendment 5.
Generally speaking, I am very interested in the amendments tabled on the role of the data protection officer, such as Amendment 9, and those concerning data protection.
There are many, but I would particularly like to mention Amendments 13, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24 and 25, and can agree with the objective.
On the role of Europol officials in the coordination of joint investigation teams, I would point out that this coordination role was not supported by the Council.
It was discussed at length, and in view of legislation that now applies to joint investigation teams, the Member States can still, in the arrangements they make between participating Member States, set up a joint investigation team, and specify and limit the role of Europol officials.
Therefore, on this point, we need to continue discussions to reach a good compromise.
Consequently, at this stage, making a provision of this kind in the proposal for a decision on Europol would unfortunately not be sufficient to grant a wider investigation coordination role to Europol officials, legally and systematically - a role, ladies and gentlemen, that I would personally like, of course.
I agree with Amendment 15, which proposes establishing a special relationship between the national unit and the competent national authorities.
These, then, are the comments I wanted to make on this report, and I thank the rapporteur once again.
I hope that the vote by Parliament can take place this week, so we can all give Europol excellent prospects for the near future and the possibility of a new status very soon that will enable it to function better.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, I would also like to thank you for your words and for your support.
I would like to start by asking for a commitment from the Council to this House for the decision that we are debating to be reviewed by the European Parliament no more than six months after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.
As an MEP I strongly defend the broadening of Parliament's powers, especially those which, in the foreseeable future, will give this House the essential capacity as joint legislator in such important matters as are those concerning the area of freedom, security and justice.
However, I also believe that Parliament cannot make its work dependent on the anticipated entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, or suspend it on this basis.
Our work therefore needs to continue.
We need to continue with the process that is underway and use it in two ways: to be more effective in the fight against crime and to decisively claim the powers of the European Parliament.
Crime is dynamic and is constantly changing, therefore Europol and the other EU instruments to protect the safety of its citizens need to adapt more quickly to the changing times.
The Convention of July 1995 is obsolete, so it is crucial for the Europol Decision, with its numerous advances, to enter into force quickly in order to provide better protection for EU citizens.
Keeping the system of protocols for amending the Convention is an absolutely anachronistic process.
The new proposal that I am putting forward for debate introduces substantial changes.
Firstly, by means of a Council decision based on Article 34(2) of the EU Treaty, it puts forward a much more flexible instrument.
Secondly, the proposal puts forward significant fundamental changes such as converting the Office into a European agency, which will mean giving its staff the status of EU officials and financing it from the Community budget, which is desirable.
Another significant change is the extension of the scope of Europol's power to cover non-organised crime.
The independent Data Protection Officer is another important step forward in terms of monitoring and guarantees.
The work done by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has fulfilled two objectives.
First amending the Council's proposal in order to give Europol a specific framework for the protection of personal data and, with this in mind, I would like to highlight the need for the Council to adopt the proposal for a framework decision on this as soon as possible.
Secondly, giving Parliament greater control over Europol's activities; in order to do this, we have proposed creating of an ad hoc committee made up of members of this House and of national parliaments, involving the European Parliament in the process of appointing and dismissing the Director, as well as other measures aimed at ensuring budgetary control over the new agency and its programme of work.
I sincerely believe that the proposals adopted in our parliamentary committee improve the Council's original document, which otherwise makes a great deal of changes.
This is why, President-in-Office of the Council, I ask for your support for our report.
I would like to finish with sincere thanks to my colleagues from all the political groups for their valuable contributions, and, in particular, I would like to mention the negotiating efforts of Mr Moraes, Mr Alvaro and Mr Fava, and the contributions of Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Catania.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets is positive about the Commission's proposal to lead Europol out of its interstate position and into communitisation.
If Europol is therefore soon to be funded entirely from the European budget, Parliament's budgetary rights must also be protected by the structures.
The Committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective amendments.
I also hope that the list that Commissioner Frattini has just read out is not exclusive, because I noticed that a number of amendments were not included.
We have all, however, got it straight that part of the administration would again be financed by operational resources.
We now call upon the Council to sit down at the table with us immediately and come to a mutual agreement on the financing of Europol, because one thing is certain: everything we decide tomorrow applies only under the proviso of the result of the Council negotiations in accordance with Article 47 of the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I expressly support the proposal that the Council has put forward for integrating Europol into the framework of the European institutions, on several grounds.
Firstly, because we will have a new legal foundation, which will save us lengthy ratification procedures and therefore make it possible for Europol to adapt quickly and flexibly to new situations, and secondly, because not only will the protocols be adopted, but jurisdiction will be extended to encompass preparatory data and data on procurement of funds, because the operating appropriations are being increased, because the funding comes from the EU budget and therefore greater independence is established for Europol as well and better monitoring opportunities are provided for us as Parliament and last but not least, because in future, data protection will also continue to be safeguarded at a very high level.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very realistic amendments, particularly as regards the tasks of the mixed committee, the immunity of Europol employees in their operational commitments, the role of Parliament in appointing the Director and also particularly as regards data protection.
He has done an excellent job here on Parliament's behalf.
If all these proposals are accepted, Europol will become more effective, more flexible and more manageable.
I have no sympathy for the Liberals' proposal to postpone all these measures to strengthen Europol to provide more security in the interest of citizens until the Treaty comes into force.
We need security now, which means we need Europol now.
We have to do the work now and then we shall certainly deal with the subject once again - should it be necessary - after the Treaty has come into force.
I would therefore ask the Liberals to reconsider their proposal and if possible withdraw the amendment.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist group welcomes the adoption of the Europol report and the proposal to convert Europol into an EU agency.
After an extremely long period of waiting we are finally in a position to make Europol into a concrete and effective tool in combating organised crime, as well as many other dangerous types of crime which are now manifesting themselves at European level - I am thinking, for instance, of the action that Europol will be able to take on money-laundering.
Our group wanted to strengthen the supervisory powers specified in the proposal into genuine parliamentary supervision, not just restricted to budgetary powers, of course, and we wanted to strengthen the provisions on personal data protection and data security, particularly in the absence of a good framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, which is still taking its time in coming.
We cannot, however, ignore the fact, as pointed out by Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a, that meanwhile the context has changed: the signing of the Lisbon Treaty creates the prospect that in the near future police cooperation will be subject to co-decision by the European Parliament and thus to our full responsibility, to qualified majority voting in Council and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
This is why we are asking the Slovenian Presidency for a formal undertaking to put a review of the dossier before the European Parliament within six months of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Finally, the Socialist group still believes that it would have been more appropriate, on a matter as sensitive as this, for the rapporteur to have withdrawn to a certain degree, in view of the events that saw him involved in politics in his country.
Our group has, however, decided not to leave out his contribution to a dossier that we believe to be of strategic importance for the process of European integration.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, before I begin I should like to thank MrÂ°DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra for his constructive and outstanding cooperation.
Our teamwork, including with colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has been very good despite, incidentally, the isolated case where the Socialists criticised the rapporteur.
We have no misgivings at all about the expansion of Europol, which was founded in 1994 as the European Drug Unit and was converted into Europol, as we now know it, in 1999.
This is necessary to protect our population in the fight against organised crime, which does not stop at borders, whether these be sea, land or air.
In the same way, Europe's officials must be able to take action and deal with it.
It must be equally clear, however, that there are certain ground rules in police work.
Immunity of Europol officers, as is regulated in the codicil, does not make sense.
This has to be said.
It does not make sense that Europe's police officers should have more powers as Europol officers than others do.
Nor does it make sense that there are no parliamentary controls over police cooperation.
After all, we want to create an efficient authority, which can also be called to account for any mistakes it may make, and not the Sheriff of Nottingham!
The same applies to the judicial scrutiny of Europol.
It is inconceivable that a police authority in Europe should be able to act without its actions being subject to judicial review.
As a result we Liberals (our colleague Mr Pirker has perhaps misunderstood this) have introduced an amendment, whereby a revision clause is to be adopted, as Mr Fava has already stated, so that the European Parliament is able to deal with this once again six months after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force.
As for the rest, we - that is the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, at least - also expect a clear statement from the Council here that this revision clause is being considered and included in the negotiations.
In the face of a structural majority, we would not wish to make use of Article 53 or Article 168 of the Rules of procedure, that is, referral to the Committee, because we, too, believe that we need Europol now and that its expansion should not be delayed.
However, when forced to, we must act in this way.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, on his report.
As we know, we are living in a Union in which citizens can travel freely, but coordination at EU level in the sphere of justice and home affairs nevertheless needs to play a more central role.
Organised crime is tending to become more internationalised, and the onus is thus on the EU to enable Europol to assume an active role in halting the illegal flow of drugs from non-EU countries.
Europol must endeavour to stamp out the illicit trafficking whereby many people are being smuggled into the EU - more often than not against their will - to work in the sex industry, for example.
Ireland will soon be holding a referendum on the European Treaty, and I should like to place it on record that we shall continue in the future to play our full part in the European justice and home affairs sphere - just as we have done up to now.
And that we shall not exercise the option of saying no unless a problem arises as regards domestic legislation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, sincerely for his work.
He had already produced a really good piece of work, and was then very constructive in the way he dealt with the amendments tabled by Members.
My group can therefore endorse his report.
I would like to make it clear to the Council, however, that support for the DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra report is not synonymous with support for the Council decision, because there are still some differences between the two, particularly regarding data protection.
The report rules out the unrestrained use of databases, as data may only be used for specific purposes, must be subject to judicial control in the Member States, and may only be processed on a case-by-case basis.
My question is whether the Council would like to respond to those amendments.
Commissioner Frattini has just set a good example by going into the specifics of the report, enabling us to see exactly what the Commission stands for.
I thank him sincerely for this.
I now hope that the President-in-Office can make it clear what the Council thinks of the European Parliament's additions.
Not everyone in my group is a staunch supporter of a strong police force, but any improvement in judicial and democratic control can count on our strong support.
Therefore, we support the conversion of Europol into an agency, with the associated increase in budgetary control.
We are also in favour of greater judicial control; and so I consider the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to be extremely sensible, and shall give it my support.
As Mr Alvaro has just said, admittedly rather cautiously, we can have another look at this in six months' time.
As far as I am concerned, we shall not only look at the proposal, but also modify it.
My question to the Council is this: do you plan to accept this proposal?
If so, what difference do you believe it will make as regards control by the Court of Justice, including over Europol?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also think that we need to have a transnational police force that can specifically tackle international crime, which today is no longer confined within national borders.
Only a few days ago the Italian Parliament's anti-Mafia commission went to Germany, where it found that an enormous amount of the financial resources invested in Germany have been obtained through a mechanism that directly involves Sicilian and Calabrian criminals.
I believe that this is emblematic of the real need to combat crime on an international basis, and one way to do so is by putting in place European police resources.
I believe that Europol can accomplish this job, but I have some doubts about whether transforming Europol into an agency can immediately salvage it.
We have a duty to evaluate Europol's activities from 1994 to today, and I believe that we will probably also need to review its specific mission, because I think that its priorities ought to be tackling drug trafficking, money-laundering and transnational Mafia organisations.
I believe that there are also still some problems regarding the need to fully recognise Parliament's powers.
Parliament should have supervisory powers - this is the case for all national parliaments, which have supervisory powers over the national police - and I believe that the European Parliament should have supervisory powers over a European agency whose key tasks are policing and combating international crime.
I also believe that we need to have some clarifications on data protection.
I am extremely worried because the proposal, as it has been adopted and probably will be adopted in the future by the Council, has serious deficiencies which put the individual data of European citizens at serious risk.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the rapporteur was, I understand, the Director-General of Spain's police between 2002 and 2004.
This means, I assume, that one of his last tasks before leaving office was to deal with the immediate aftermath of the terrible bombings in Madrid.
I, therefore, accept the sincerity with which he now puts the case for extending the powers of EUROPOL in order to deal with new terrorist threats.
However, I will not need to remind him that my country, too, has had a long history of facing up to terrorism and, like his country, that consisted for many years of a threat from separatists, which, in recent years, has been matched by the new threat of Islamic extremism.
What I am saying is that my country is very grateful for help and cooperation from its neighbours where necessary, but, in the final analysis, it must be able to act exactly according to its own methods and procedures and on its own initiative.
But what is being proposed here is not just a further encroachment of EUROPOL into areas that should be left under the control of Member States.
Worse still than that, the Commission wants to change the legal framework governing EUROPOL so that any extension of EUROPOL's powers does not have to be ratified by Member States.
The rapporteur concludes his statement by saying that we must ensure EUROPOL enjoys maximum democratic legitimacy.
Once again, we see that the EU, as it seeks to take powers from Member States, even in matters of policing, has a very strange idea of democratic legitimacy.
Madam President, whatever the desirability of combating terrorism and organised crime - and it is desirable - it is clear to me that this expansion of the role for EUROPOL and the change in its legal basis and title are about something quite different.
They are, in fact, about giving the apparatus of statehood to the EU.
States naturally and properly have police forces.
Now the EU is to have its own right to have European police officers, funded from the EU budget and staffed by EU officials.
In truth and in fact, they will be EU policemen doing the bidding of the EU and roaming across Europe, meddling in the work of national police forces, particularly since their competence to initiate and lead inquiries is to be extended beyond organised crime into ever increasing areas of criminal law.
Then, to crown what for me is that absurdity, these EU policemen are to have immunity from national constraints and their actions put beyond the reach of judicial review.
That causes me to reject these proposals.
They are but the latest manifestation of super statehood for the EU - all under the framework of the Constitution and none of it with the consent of the peoples of Europe because of the conspiracy amongst EU leaders to subvert democracy and refuse referendums.
(PT) Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, in 1998 the European Parliament rejected all the initiatives presented to it when consulted on matters of detail relating to Europol.
It did so out of consistency as long as Europol continued, in the intergovernmental context, without being subject to democratic and jurisdictional control.
Now this initiative has come in response to what we have constantly been requesting in this plenary, with the aim of converting Europol into an EU agency, financed from the Community budget, and strengthening our role of democratic control.
Despite this proposal being a subject of deep controversy in Council, I think that we should not accept any further postponement.
The European Parliament has an obligation to show its support for the Commission's initiative to make Europol an EU agency.
Europol's current legal framework, an international convention, moreover impedes any process of updating or modifying powers, with delays of years.
Indeed, the increase of new threats to security, such as terrorism, which poses new challenges to Europol, requires a new approach.
Hence the importance of this decision, which should not only place Europol on an equal footing with Eurojust and the European Police College but also make it more efficient in operation, extending its mandate to crimes that are not strictly related to organised crime and introducing greater flexibility into its mechanisms.
At the same time greater transparency and democratic and jurisdictional control must be guaranteed.
I therefore support the excellent report that Mr DÃ­az de Mera has produced, and the important amendments he tabled, notably regarding data protection.
I would like to pay tribute to Mr DÃ­az de Mera and express my solidarity for the excellent report he has produced and for the person that he is, especially as some Members tried unfairly to diminish his work, raising national struggles that have furthermore already had a full response from the Spanish Supreme Court of Justice.
- (PL) The main task that the European Police Office faces is that of improving efficiency of action and cooperation between the authorities in Member States as regards preventing and combating international organised crime.
The agency's mission is to make a contribution to the sphere of law enforcement in the European Union with reference to this form of crime.
This is becoming increasingly important in the face of the new forms of crime which are constantly appearing and the threat of terrorism.
Life is forcing us to expand Europol's powers and also to adapt the principles on which it functions through the introduction of more flexible mechanisms.
With the agency proposed by the rapporteur, however, there is an urgent need for the introduction of clear principles for the democratic monitoring of Europol and personal data protection.
- (EL) Madam President, in its proposal for the establishment of a European police force, the Commission is seeking to transform Europol from a body based on inter-state agreement into an institutional body of the European Union.
This, in my view, shows how wide ranging Europol's enforcement operations are and is proof of the overall strengthening of the European Union's enforcement framework and mechanisms.
Two things grow quickly in the European Union: the profits of companies and of capital, and aggressive enforcement mechanisms.
We have filled all our respective countries with police forces and enforcement mechanisms and now this is happening at EU level too.
This development also expands Europol's field of activity and includes all punishable acts in its sphere of competence.
It acquires the right to intervene even in the Member States themselves in relation to international events of major significance with consequences for public order, such as international demonstrations.
Alongside the vast SIS II and VIS monitoring systems etc., the Europol information system will be used to file personal data relating to workers throughout the European Union as well as data relating to political, trade union and social activities and personal convictions.
This data will be exchanged not only between the security services and secret services of the EU Member States, but also with private individuals, such as independent assassins operating in Iraq.
The claims that the transformation of Europol is purportedly a democratic development are self-deceiving or at best naÃ¯ve.
Why?
Because there is no real possibility of controlling the inaccessible citadel of Europol or of restricting its enforcement activities.
Furthermore, many people have commented on the immunity of Europol police offers and the inadequacy of any national control.
For these reasons we are firmly opposed to the proposal.
(SV) Madam President, we have created a single market with free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
Almost everyone has agreed to participate in Schengen.
In practice all border controls in the EU have been abolished.
From a liberal point of view, this is a gigantic step forward.
We no longer need to stand with cap in hand in front of officials when we want to study, work, travel or seek health care in another EU country.
However, freedom has its downside.
When border controls disappeared, the scope for organised crime increased enormously.
This eased the way for the drugs trade, the exchange of stolen goods and trafficking.
Sometimes this expansion in organised crime is used as proof that the EU is needed.
That is grotesque.
The expansion is facilitated by the EU, a price we are obliged to pay for increased freedom and prosperity.
How high is that price?
Well, police resources have to be increased perhaps by 1-2% of GDP at national level in order to roll back this phenomenon.
Such an increase in national resources is the most important and perhaps the only way to restore an honest, decent Europe.
The rapporteur wants to transfer power over the police to Brussels.
Europol should become an EU body financed from the EU budget.
He makes light of questions of integrity and democratic legitimacy.
We must therefore say no to this report, focus on the expansion of national police resources and let Europol remain a cooperation body subject to intergovernmental procedures.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report proposes nothing more and nothing less than to give the European Police Office, Europol, a new status by modifying its existing legal bases.
Indeed, the intention is to replace the Europol Convention concluded in 1995 between the Member States with a Council decision converting the agency from an intergovernmental body into a European Union agency financed from the Community budget and applying the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities.
The reasons given for this radical change of status are the extension of the mandate of Europol's activities beyond just organised crime and the Member States' inability to meet these new and very extensive objectives adequately.
These objectives will obviously be better met at European Union level, the Council assures us.
But this is all smoke and mirrors.
The reality is that we are already engaged with the requirements and application of the Treaty of Lisbon, which transfers almost all of justice and home affairs policy to a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers.
Until now, these fields of judicial and police cooperation have required unanimity.
The reality is that our national and European leaders are in the process of imposing on us institutional reforms that all work towards a more deeply supranational and bureaucratic model.
It is these same reforms that are in the Treaty of Lisbon that were rejected by the French and Dutch in the referendums of May and June 2005.
The people have been duped, misled and treated with contempt.
Europe cannot be built contrary to its people and contrary to national realities, and it is high time that our pro-European political class realised this and finally left Europe to construct itself from the nations' and people's rights to identity, sovereignty, freedom and security.
- (EL) Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Budgets and also as an MEP who comes from a region on the European Union's external borders, I would like to make three observations:
Firstly, turning Europol into a Community agency requires that we receive more value for money from its work.
We want this Community Europol to have a greater presence in places where we need it - in the Balkans, combating the organised mafia - and not in staffrooms or offices.
Secondly, within the Community Europol framework, the national police forces must gradually overcome their distrust of each other.
The Member States' police authorities must learn to cooperate above and beyond borders and national priorities.
The transformation of Europol into a Community agency allows for this.
Thirdly and most importantly, we have devoted much time to the institutional dimension of this file.
I wish to offer my full support to the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, who chose a practical and realistic solution.
We cannot paralyse the entire procedure until 2009 while we wait for the perfect institutional solution, nor can we carry on theological debates when issues are pressing.
The time for action is now, and now we must act.
It is within this context, then, that I express my full support for the approach mapped out by the rapporteur, and I hope that this debate will be the first stage in the formation of a genuine European Community police service capable of dealing with problems.
- (EL) Madam President, once again we must salute the development of this large police body known as Europol.
We have been doing so since 1992.
The records of its performance have not been bad.
I have the impression that the new form which we are attempting to give it will create problems, bearing in mind that the British police will be operating in Paris and Greek police officers in Berlin.
We will see how to get around this, but there is always the problem of distrust between police authorities.
I salute Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra's very careful work.
If we need to restrict Europol's activities to terrorism issues, then among other crimes it must try to find real terrorism, rather than develop a mechanism which, instead of hunting down terrorism, hangs like a noose, stifling the human and political rights of European citizens.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the change in the legal standing of Europol, which we are now discussing, is not a step in the right direction.
Europol is functioning well at present and does not need any changes to its status.
Police work is the domain of the Member States and the main responsibility for the work therefore rests, logically and rightly, with the national governments, which are controlled by the national parliaments.
This approach is already implicitly respected even in Schengen cooperation, in which the Czech Republic has been fully involved since the end of last year.
Police cooperation at EU level is therefore, logically, subject to an inter-governmental approach.
The Commission now wishes to abandon this correct and logical approach and, in fact, re-shape Europol into a new agency that is subordinate to the European institutions.
However, an agency format is not suitable for Europol and will not bring any benefits.
The national interior ministers will have less and less control of Europol there will be no advantages in terms of the fight against crime.
In my opinion, to start with there should be proper and democratic ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which also has a bearing on Europol's legal basis: only after that can negotiations begin on a possible amendment of the legal basis.
For this reason I will be voting against this report.
Madam President, just to show that the PPE-DE Group has a lot of diversity, I completely disagree with the previous speaker and would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report.
I think this report is very good and I think it is good for three reasons. The first reason is that it expands the powers of EUROPOL.
It brings it into the Community budget, it creates an agency, and it extends its mandate beyond organised crime.
I think that is a very important step forward.
The second reason I think it is good is because it calls for more flexibility.
You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that, if an organisation is established in 1995 and its conventions are amended three times from 2000 to 2003 and those changes enter into force only in the year 2007, the organisation is not working.
It is not flexible enough.
We need more flexibility and I think that is what this report proposes.
There is nothing more conservative in this world than an interior ministry or a police establishment and I think we have seen it with EUROPOL.
The third point is: I think that this is a good report because it increases supranational and communautaire elements and it decreases intergovernmental elements.
It increases judicial scrutiny and democracy - and if there is one area where you have to work together, it is this.
The more free movement you have, the more Schengen you have, the more international crime you have, the more we need cooperation on a European level and I think this report is a good step in that direction.
(ES) Madam President, a small clarification.
As our Socialist coordinator said, we Socialists still think that the rapporteur is not the most suitable person to produce reports on judicial and police cooperation.
It is true, as Mr Coelho said, that the Supreme Court has closed the case, but it is a question of ethics and political dignity.
I will explain: I should make it clear that the rapporteur refused to cooperate with the Spanish legal system and was fined for it.
This was not a trivial matter: it was the trial of the terrorists accused of the worst attack that has been perpetrated in the European Union.
We therefore think that, for the sake of consistency, a person cannot refuse to cooperate with the legal system in Spain and then lecture Europe on how the Member States should cooperate with each other in police and judicial matters.
Madam President, what we have heard in this debate is the usual confusion between cooperation and integration.
I very much support those who have expressed concern at the EU efforts to expand EUROPOL's powers and competence.
Of course we need good cooperation between police and security services.
I happen to believe that we have always had that good cooperation at the operational level, but it can always be improved.
Indeed, in my experience at EUROPOL - and I am probably one of the few Members of this House who has been to EUROPOL on a number of occasions - most of its activity is bilateral, which gives the lie to this idea that it has some other great role.
The need for cooperation is very different to the involvement of the European Union institutions, which is merely part of the EU's wider agenda of political integration.
Madam President, I wanted to add my voice to that of my colleague, Geoffrey Van Orden, and my previous colleague from the Czech Republic, from the ODS.
I disagree with Mr Stubb.
I am also nervous - and I do not think it would be supported by many of my constituents in the United Kingdom - about the idea of turning EUROPOL into a kind of supranational fledging European Union FBI-style organisation.
Like all colleagues, I am, of course, in favour of intergovernmental cooperation in police, intelligence and security matters, particularly when we face growing problems from international organised crime, international terrorism etc. EUROPOL already has quite an extensive remit in areas like people trafficking as well, but we do not need to extend the powers of EUROPOL.
It should be an agency charged with acting as a gatekeeper in terms of exchange of information and also building up more confidence between our national police forces and our security and intelligence services.
There is a lot of mistrust between some of the Member States' traditional law enforcement agencies.
Europol should be acting as a kind of coordinator and not be given special rights.
I would particularly object to any idea of EU policemen being able to go into our own Member States with powers of arrest.
Madam President, I cannot resist the temptation of answering my two colleagues Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock.
We are not trying to create some kind of a US FBI type of organisation here, we are simply trying to have police cooperation which works better, which is more effective, which is more transparent, which is more flexible and which simply works.
That is what we do not have today, that is what we are trying to do.
I do not want to get into the internal UK debate and scaremongering, that we are creating some kind of FBI with some kind of superpowers, with European police coming into your house to arrest you.
That is not what we are trying to do.
We are trying to get the third pillar cooperation of police to work better.
That is all.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Allow me just a comment or two on this extremely interesting debate, which I am honoured to attend.
My first comment relates to the Council's attitude towards amendments, of which there are many, although I cannot represent the Council's opinion here just yet.
As was said in the introduction, the Council is still deliberating on this decision and it will resume deliberation within this framework after the amendments.
However, I can maintain that as the Presidency we will strive for a detailed and mindful debate of all the amendments to be approved.
We will also strive for the greatest possible number to be included in the text of the decision.
I cannot guarantee more that this.
As we know, approval of a decision at this moment in time still requires the consensus of all the Member States.
This leads me to the following comment regarding the revision clause.
There is no Council opinion on this either, but I think that, in the name of the Council, I can express a certain doubt about building into the text of an act such as this mechanisms which should automatically be activated in the period after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into effect.
The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet come into force.
Its enforcement is in the hands of the national parliaments and in at least one case in the hands of the voters.
It is my opinion that by building such a mechanism into acts of this kind, we will not facilitate the approval of acts such as this; what is more, we will not facilitate ratification procedures that are currently taking place.
I also think that this question received a satisfactory solution in declaration No. 50 attached to the Treaty of Lisbon.
- (DE) Madam President, because I had the feeling that the Minister had misunderstood this, I just wanted to take the liberty very briefly of pointing out the fact that the revision clause does not in any way jeopardise or influence ratification of the Treaty, but simply guarantees that after ratification, Parliament will once again deal with the Europol report.
After consultation with other permanent representatives, it does not seem to me that this threat is seen as general.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the contributions that have been made.
I will be very brief.
Firstly I will give a general reply to all those who have expressed doubts about the need to strengthen Europol, those who have spoken about the will of the people and the concerns of citizens.
I would like to say that if there is one subject on which the vast majority of European citizens expresses fear regarding the free movement of criminals and asks for more security, it is this very subject of police cooperation.
If there is one subject on which the more is said, as Mr Stubb noted, the more the movement of persons is liberalised, the more need there is for European coordination and action on transnational crime and thus the concept of a European agency is certainly not that of a bureaucratic body, but of a fast, effective operational tool.
This is why I am convinced - and this is not only because I put forward the proposal - of the need to adopt this decision speedily, as the Slovenian Presidency wishes.
Regarding the amendments, I have already mentioned the amendment tabled by Mr Alvaro.
I would like to remind you that the idea of having a regular review of the smooth operation of current 'third pillar' initiatives is something permitted by Declaration No 50, which has just been mentioned.
What does this say?
It says that the Commission, on a case-by-case basis, when the situation is appropriate, following entry into force of the Treaty, shall propose the review of instruments currently falling within the third pillar in order to change them into instruments over which Parliament has full co-decision powers and to which the procedures which Parliament in my view rightly wishes for apply.
Thus the instrument already exists for this purpose.
It is perhaps the imposition of such a restricted time frame to this instrument that poses some problems for me personally, but I also wonder, and I have no preconceptions on this point: is it advisable to plan a review of an instrument such as the Europol decision, which has not yet entered into force?
I ask the question because you know that if we were to adopt this decision before the end of the Slovenian Presidency - in June 2008 - it would enter into force in January 2010.
So can we already plan to undertake to review an instrument when its operation will begin in January 2010?
I would not be opposed to arguing, when it is in operation, if problems emerge that are linked to insufficient democratic monitoring, that that would be an excellent reason for the European Commission to apply Declaration No 50 and change the instrument from the third pillar to the new system.
One of my reasons for giving this example is to say that we cannot close the door on Parliament's need for democratic monitoring, but it is perhaps the manner and time frames of this strict compulsory review procedure that pose problems for us.
Madam President, before you start counting the time, I would like to ask you to take the following into consideration: please give me the two minutes that I am entitled to so that I can respond out of courtesy to all of my colleagues, the Council and the Commission, but also, Madam President, I earnestly ask you to give me some separate time to answer the very serious, unjustified allusions that have been made about me.
May I count on your understanding, Madam President?
Thank you very much.
I am very grateful to almost all my colleagues - and I emphasise the word 'almost' - for their contributions, and I very especially take them on board.
I would like to say that the concerns that have been expressed here are not only the concerns of the rapporteur, but that they are also the concerns of the House.
It has been very gratifying for me to hear how well disposed the Council is and the wise words of compromise and also clarification from Vice-President Frattini.
I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, those who have honoured me with their support as well as those who have honoured me with their criticisms.
You should not forget that I have been a Member of Parliament for seventeen years, and still am, and I was the Director-General of Police for the Kingdom of Spain for two years.
I was.
That is how I am able to see both sides of the coin.
President-in-Office of the Council, I would therefore like once again to highlight the issues that concern us: we cannot fight crime on our own.
Crime is transnational.
Crime goes beyond borders, and our police forces, which are national, need to have in Europol an instrument to support and strengthen them.
Not one that interferes or overlaps with their work, but one that supports and strengthens them.
Guarantees are very important to us.
It is very important to us to support and strengthen Europol, but with three criteria: confidence, control and guarantees.
This is naturally what has been made clear in our report and in the contributions of fellow members.
Data protection in the Framework Decision in the third pillar as soon as possible is important to us.
It is extremely important to us that Parliament has control and it is very important to us to decisively and determinedly fight organised crime together.
Now, Madam President, due to the allusions, I would like to answer the second, much more unpleasant, question.
Mr Moreno does not respect judicial decisions.
The Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain and the Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain said these exact words in reference to my case.
I do not know if they translate well, but they said these exact words, 'no crime whatsoever'.
However, some people, such as Mr Moreno, have not had and do not have the intellectual and moral integrity to apologise for spreading something that they should not have spread.
What Mr Moreno has done here is to intoxicate Parliament comme d'habitude with issues that do not have anything to do with the report or with the heart of the matter.
He talks about morality and lack of dignity.
It is immoral and undignified not to respect judicial decisions and, on top of that, to throw them back in the face of a colleague who does have dignity and morality.
I will not say that Mr Moreno is undignified and immoral, but what I will say is that he has behaved in an undignified and immoral way.
What I will say in his defence is that I would like to think that they are not his own ideas, but that he has behaved, not like a messenger boy, but rather that this time he has had the brazenness to act as the messenger boy.
Why?
In order to unjustifiably discredit and perhaps in the vain attempt to get a few column inches in the Spanish press.
(FR) The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
Situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (debate)
(FR) The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
President-in-Office. - (SL) The assassination of the former Prime Minister and main opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, aggravated the already complicated situation prior to the elections in Pakistan.
In addition, it had a negative effect on the process of gradual transition to a more democratic system in Pakistan.
Benazir Bhutto was certainly one of those who could have contributed to progress in areas of economic development, reduced corruption and more freedom for the media.
Ever since the introduction of a state of emergency on 3 November last year, The European Union and the European Parliament have emphasised the need for stability and appealed for reconciliation and the reintroduction of democracy.
Stability in Pakistan is certainly in our strategic interest.
That means that we are supporting the struggle of the moderate majority of Pakistanis against the violent minority of extremists.
Our interests - the interests of the European Union in Pakistan - are also closely associated with our priority tasks in Afghanistan and the wider region.
They are associated with our fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and with our fight for the respect of human rights, and all this was emphasised many times in our messages to the Pakistani authorities.
President Musharraf will probably come to Brussels next week.
That will be a unique opportunity to pass on our message.
Together with our international partners we have also established contacts with other major parties in Pakistan.
The key message of the Council of the European Union is that to conduct free and honest elections open to all in Pakistan next month is of crucial importance.
The Pakistani government must strive to provide appropriate political and security conditions for carrying out such elections.
In addition, all the parties must accept the decision of the Electoral Commission that the election of 18 February should be carried out with dignity and restraint.
We are also inviting the Pakistani authorities to use the extended period up to the elections to improve the conditions for the elections in accordance with international standards.
Primarily, the authorities must guarantee to do everything in their power to prevent electoral fraud and intimidation and to ensure transparency for free operation of the media, and guarantee to release political prisoners.
All this would contribute to a democratic and transparent electoral process under appropriate security conditions.
As we know, the European Union will dispatch a full election observation mission.
We are hoping that these elections will be followed internationally in their entirety.
At the first meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council at the end of this month, foreign affairs ministers will discuss the Pakistan situation in detail and debate the options the EU might have for assisting the successful continuation and strengthening of the democratic processes in that country.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is nothing less than a national tragedy and came as a shock to all of us.
Mrs Bhutto was, I think for all of us, a symbol of a moderate and liberal Pakistan.
She enjoyed popular support and she also had the courage to challenge extremism and terrorism.
It was perhaps, unfortunately, this very courage for which she ultimately paid with her life.
Her murder is a loss for the millions of Pakistanis who had placed hope in her for democracy and a better future.
Her death is also a loss for Europe and the world.
It is unfortunate that disturbing news from Pakistan has become all too common, nearly every day.
Hardly a week passes without a major terrorist attack, and some 700 Pakistanis have been killed by suicide bombers over the past six months.
I believe we can draw a lesson from Mrs Bhutto's death, and that is that Pakistan needs a functioning democracy, the rule of law and a strong civil society to address the country's mounting challenges.
You will recall that the country was placed under emergency rule on 3 November.
This, of course, greatly undermined confidence in the democratic process in advance of parliamentary elections.
Emergency rule was then lifted on 15 December, but only after new media restrictions had been imposed and most of the senior judiciary replaced.
A number of judges and lawyers remain in detention to this day.
They should be released without delay.
The outpouring of anger following the murder of Mrs Bhutto led to civil unrest and ultimately the decision to postpone elections from 8 January to 18 February.
These elections should now be held as planned, without any further delay.
I think Pakistan has to move ahead, and the way forward is to organise democratic and transparent elections which result in a broad and also a credible popular mandate for new governments, both at the federal but also at the provincial level.
We should jointly pass this message to President Musharraf when he comes to visit Europe next week.
Some players are trying to draw political capital from the Bhutto assassination.
Let us not forget that it is, ultimately, extremist forces who are interested in destabilising Pakistan and who are responsible for this despicable act.
They should not be allowed to succeed.
A credible investigation into the murder can help to calm the waves, but only if everybody keeps a level head.
Let me add that Scotland Yard is doing a commendable job in trying to help in this respect.
President Musharraf spoke of the need for national reconciliation when he addressed the nation on 2 January.
I think this is indeed what is required.
The opposition has to be taken on board in coping with the current situation.
Significantly, all major opposition parties will participate in the forthcoming elections.
But, regrettably, Pakistan has a history of lack of trust in electoral outcomes, which could lead to further political polarisation.
Naturally, the chances for national reconciliation will greatly improve if President Musharraf and the relevant authorities do whatever is necessary to ensure that these elections are held in a fair and transparent manner.
Because these elections are so important, not only for Pakistan but also for the region, I decided to deploy an election observation mission (EOM) with the aim of contributing to democracy and stability in the country.
If the elections had really been held on 8 January as originally planned, we could only have fielded a limited observation mission.
However, in view of the time that is now available until the elections, in consultation with the Chief Observer, Mr Michael Gahler, who is a Member of this Parliament, I decided to upgrade the mission to a fully-fledged election observation mission.
We are all very much aware of the important role this mission is likely to play in the coming weeks.
I continue to be very concerned about the conditions in which these elections are held and the potential for this to lead to a critical statement from the EOM if steps are not urgently taken to address these concerns.
Key problems, including lack of confidence in the election administration, lack of transparency in the results process, and the lack of an effective complaints and appeals process in which stakeholders have confidence, are all present in Pakistan.
Concrete steps could still be taken by the state and the electoral authorities to improve the conditions for elections.
I understand that both EU Heads of Mission in Islamabad and the election observation mission on the ground have already outlined the key improvements that are necessary.
I think we should make every effort to stress these points with the Pakistani authorities, including with the President, when he visits Brussels soon.
I also remain concerned about the security situation in Pakistan, particularly in the light of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but also recent bomb attacks in Lahore, Karachi and, of course, the North-Western Territory frontier province.
We urge the Pakistani authorities to do all they can to provide a securer environment in which the elections can be held, and we will carefully then assess the security situation in the light of the deployment of EU observers.
President Musharraf has taken off his uniform as promised.
I hope that this will result in progress towards stronger civilian institutions and sustainable democracy in Pakistan.
But it is also important that Pakistan continues to make progress in fighting poverty.
The Commission has, therefore, significantly increased its development cooperation funding to Pakistan for the coming years, including in the field of education.
And I remain committed to this approach, which I also see as a contribution towards fighting extremism.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, once again, following the debate and the resolution that we adopted in December, we are discussing the situation in Pakistan in Parliament.
Since then a whole series of events have taken place, as the Commission and the Council have reminded us.
First the state of emergency was lifted, then came the subsequent freeing, although as the Commissioner reminded us, it was incomplete, of various lawyers, magistrates, judges, journalists and representatives of civil society.
This was followed by the assassination of the former Prime Minister Mrs Bhutto, which brought considerable instability to the serious process of dissolution that society is going through in Pakistan, and the subsequent postponement of the electoral process to the upcoming dates in February.
Of course there is also the forthcoming visit and appearance before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs on Monday of the President of Pakistan.
The first thing that I would like to do, Madam President, on behalf of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is express our strongest condemnation of this savage terrorist attack, which really only affirms what the previous rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera, said to us: that terrorism is a phenomenon that affects all of us equally.
Before I conclude, Madam President, I would like to leave two questions on the table for the Commission and the Council.
I acknowledge the efforts made by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in giving a positive response to Parliament's request for an electoral observation mission in the light of this situation.
However, she mentioned her concern about the conditions in which the elections are held.
Commissioner, do you think that, given the levels of violence, fear and instability in that country, which is key to the stability of Central Asia, among other things because it is the only Muslim country with nuclear weapons, do you think that the best possible conditions are in place to carry out this process?
Finally, Madam President, the Commissioner referred to a credible investigation.
The family, both her widower and her son, as well as the Pakistan People's Party and Mrs Bhutto herself before she died, in a communication that she had with the UK Foreign Secretary, expressed their desire for this investigation to be conducted by the United Nations.
Do the Commission and the Council agree that there needs to be an independent investigation to shed light on this terrible assassination once and for all?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I join the Council and the Commission in the condemnation of the murder of Benazir Bhutto.
This Parliament has always condemned terrorism wherever it occurs and we will continue to fight for the right of politicians to express their views and to campaign in safety.
In going back to Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto knew the risks and, whether you consider her to be brave or foolhardy, you have to respect her commitment to her party and her country.
In her memory and the memory of others who have died in this election period, I believe it is beholden on all of us - Europeans and Pakistanis from President Musharraf downwards - to do everything we can to assist Pakistan.
As Mr LenarÄiÄ said, the key to this must be the continuing battle against terrorism.
We have seen that terrorism is a threat in Pakistan as much as it is in Europe or the USA.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has reminded us that hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in shootings and suicide bombs in Pakistan, so Europe must continue to fully assist and support the counter-terrorism operations in Pakistan.
Some colleagues here might suggest we should leave Pakistan be and have little to do with it, but I firmly believe the contrary.
As 27 strong democratic nations, we need to work collectively to support the economic, social and political developments in Pakistan.
Again, I agree with the Council: the release of all remaining political detainees will be crucial to this process, as will ensuring free, fair, transparent and safe elections on 18 February 2008 and a safe and satisfactory run-up to that date.
In addition to what the Commissioner said, I think the election will mean that we need to have 90 million voters with proper access to news coverage of all sides of the debate.
It means making a safer environment for the media.
Pakistan has become the most dangerous Asian country for the media: at least six journalists were killed in 2007, some 30 seriously injured, over 100 arrested and countless harassed.
We need an end to the censorship of the print and broadcast media and to restrictions on what they can say and do without interference from the military or civilian authorities.
The ban on the TV news station GEO News needs to be lifted and the government television channel PTV needs to be more balanced in its news and the information it conveys to the public.
All arrangements for the actual voting, the counting and the reporting of the results need to be above board and clear to everyone, but most especially to the voters of Pakistan.
A mark of democracy is also whether incumbents can accept defeat and whether political transition from one party of government to another, if it occurs, can go smoothly.
All of these will be crucial factors in whether or not the elections can be counted as a true record of the will of the people and whether or not Pakistan can start to emerge from the long shadow cast by that assassin's bullet on 27 December 2007.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too, of course, would like to start by expressing my great sorrow at the tragic death of Benazir Bhutto.
Benazir Bhutto was a laureate of the Liberal International Prize For Freedom, which we presented her the first time she was Prime Minister.
It is true that she is - she was - only human, and as such was not perfect.
We did wonder at one point later on whether we had actually done the right thing.
At that time, I put this question to Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani human rights activist, who is now entrusted with a special mission on behalf of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
She told me that we did absolutely the right thing, as Benazir Bhutto had set a genuine example in Pakistan in a number of respects, particularly as regards the role of women in Pakistani society.
It is a known fact that Benazir Bhutto was killed by violent terrorists, but who their backers were remains an open question.
I do not believe that reconciliation is possible in Pakistan unless this matter is clarified by an impartial investigation.
I do not know whether this means acceding to the family's request for a UN investigation, but at all events there must be guarantees of impartiality, as President Musharraf has not exactly shown a great deal of respect for the judicial authorities, even the highest in the country.
I would also like to say that I have been receiving reports from Pakistan of the recent rounding up, arrest and charging of thousands of PPP militants.
This, too, has to stop if we wish the elections to take place under reasonable conditions.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would very much like to join my voice to that of my colleagues in thanking both the Council and, indeed, the Commission in particular, for the practical steps that have been outlined in terms of helping to support the electoral administration process and to try and improve the quality and hopefully the outcome as well, of those elections should they take place.
We also welcome the commitment to further financing for development, not least in education, because there are many of us in this House who believe that investment there will prove at least as powerful, if not more powerful than investment in weapons, which seems to have been a priority for some external bodies in their support for Pakistan over the last few years.
We hope that the international community in general will support the efforts of the European Union in these lines.
Like others here, we also want to express our sympathy for the family of Benazir Bhutto, but also for the families of all the bereaved in Pakistan killed in outrageous attacks and indeed through military action.
We would agree that we do need stability, both for the people of Pakistan and indeed, given that it is a nuclear state, for the international community as well.
But, as others have said, I do not think it is enough to try and develop people's confidence in the electoral system and its outcome.
The judiciary is another key democratic institution.
It needs to be functioning and to be independent.
People need to feel that they will have a fair trial, that they will see an end to detention without charge, an end to secret prisons and, indeed, a commitment from whatever government comes into being after the elections, to continue the inquiries into the disappearances that have also taken place in that country.
We also agree that freedom of the press is vital, but we would also ask that some of our Member States cease contemplating extraditions to Pakistan at the moment until we can be sure that there is a fair and independent functioning judiciary.
(NL) Madam President, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a tragedy for Pakistan and shows the immensity of the problems facing the country.
We are talking about a country that has 165 million inhabitants, is in possession of nuclear weapons and is engaged in a fight against terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
Naturally, it is of the utmost importance that political stability is achieved in Pakistan as soon as possible and that President Musharraf plays a major role in this at this time.
Nevertheless, we must not turn a blind eye to the many major shortcomings in Mr Musharraf's policy.
For example, his government's approach to the problem of terrorism has been much too lax.
In large parts of the Afghan border region, for example, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have a free rein, and far too little is being done about this.
By declaring a state of emergency on 3 November, Mr Musharraf also revealed a rather casual attitude to democracy.
In addition, worryingly, fingers had already been pointed at him after the first attack on Benazir Bhutto on 18 October.
The same happened after her actual assassination.
His possible role in this must be clarified as soon as possible, because otherwise public confidence in the government will evaporate, and that can only play into the hands of Islamic extremists.
Madam President, The Economist stated recently that Pakistan is the world's most dangerous nuclear arms state.
Regrettably, in my view, President Musharraf's commitment to fully eradicating Islamist terror has always been lukewarm at best, and his control over the ISI or intelligence services, who allegedly are in bed with Islamists, is tenuous as well.
Add to that the combustible issues of Kashmir, Baluchi separatism, Al Qa'ida and Taliban activity in the North-West Frontier territories and tribal areas causing mischief for NATO in Afghanistan, and you have a country on the point of implosion.
Just as Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan offered the country a glimmer of hope, so her despicable assassination, whose culprits must be identified and punished, has taken the country back to the brink of catastrophe.
A return to democracy is as difficult as ever.
The assumption in the EU and the USA is that Musharraf, for all his autocratic tendencies, represents the safer bet in the war on terrorism.
Pakistan's experience of democracy in the past 60 years has been troubled.
Perhaps it is time now to abandon the hope that Western-style multiparty democracy can embed itself successfully in Pakistan, which has always been dominated by a tiny Ã©lite.
It is more akin to a feudal hereditary monarchy, a fact underlined by the instant elevation of Benazir Bhutto's 19-year-old son to the leadership of the Pakistani People's Party, who will no doubt do very well at the imminent 18 February elections.
The apparent choice for the West between Pakistan and India is also a false dichotomy.
It is a hangover from the Cold War.
India, as a strategic ally, is the best hope for progress, prosperity, peace and stability in South Asia.
India's values are the EU's values - secular democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Let us start supporting those who share our values before we try to persuade those who do not.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament South Asia Delegation warned the Government of Pakistan of weaknesses in Benazir Bhutto's security measures as early as November.
Sadly our fears of terrorist attack were proved correct.
Benazir Bhutto will continue to be a hero both for the people of Pakistan and for the international community.
Her absence among the candidates calls the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections into question.
The crisis in Pakistan is also an opportunity to guide the country towards the road of democracy.
The Pakistani people have not elected General Musharraf as President.
However, he now has the opportunity to choose whether to go down in history as a military dictator or a democratic president.
As a statesman Mr Musharraf must surely understand that democracy must be the winner in elections, even if he will personally have to lose power.
And we will want to ask Mr Musharraf this himself next week at a meeting of the international committee in Brussels.
We in the European Union must persist in our dialogue with Pakistan.
That is precisely why, as the committee rightly said, we must send our own observers to the elections of 18 February.
Events in Pakistan must not be a matter solely for the USA.
A transparent international investigation into the assassination of Mrs Bhutto, the full restoration of freedom of the press and free and fair elections in Pakistan are also an essential issue for the European Union.
We will not achieve our targets by playing the by-stander.
We have no alternative but to pursue an active policy in relations with Pakistan.
Madam President, I echo completely the statements made by colleagues, but I want to say something more about the person rather than the situation.
There is a saying in Finnish that war is not dependent on one man.
That might be so, but the war between democracy and extremism might be very dependent on one woman.
I think of the former, and now murdered, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs Benazir Bhutto.
I had the pleasure of meeting her and working with her and was deeply impressed by how warm, intelligent and brave she was.
I am so proud to say that, to me, she was a friend and a political ally.
So much has now been said and written about her that you might ask what more can be said.
I think that I can share something that you did not, perhaps, know.
Her last big project for democracy, human rights and women's rights was the creation of an organisation called Muslim Women for Democracy and Human Rights.
Together with other brave women like Asma Jehangir from Pakistan and Dr Shrin Ebadi from Iran, she created an organisation to encourage Muslim women around the world to stand up for the rights that the Koran gives women, according to Benazir Bhutto, but that had been denied for centuries.
She was elected by the world's leading Muslim women democracy activists in May 2007 to be the first chairwoman of this new organisation.
Benazir Bhutto wanted the organisation to comfort Muslim women, to give them legal advice and practical help and, above all, help them to form a network of Muslim women around the world to build a world of peace, where different religions could live in peace and with respect.
She said, 'I want to build a Pakistan where a Jew can go to the synagogue, a Christian to the church and a Muslim to the mosque, all without any fear'.
Her dream was that the new organisation could help this dream come true all over the world, both in the West and in the Muslim world. I think that the best way to honour the memory of this brave sister for democracy is to support the organisation that she created as a sign of hope, even after she is gone.
- (DE) Mr President, Benazir Bhutto is said to have told her son: implementing democracy in Pakistan is our revenge on military rule.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to ensure that Benazir Bhutto's legacy is not just a mandate to her son, but to us all and to the international community to ensure that the conditions for democracy are established in Pakistan and that we help to establish them.
The situation there is not good, as many speakers have already said.
And the way in which this attack on Benazir Bhutto was dealt with is truly alarming.
I would also ask that we ensure that there is an international investigation into this assassination.
Scotland Yard may already be doing some preparatory work on this, but I think it would be good if this investigation were to take place by order of the UN.
Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you have said that stability in Pakistan is in our interest.
Very well, but we are only looking, as ever, at the minority of terrorists.
When you are in Pakistan, you will hear that the military system creates instability and President Musharraf is making a substantial contribution to the worsening situation.
Last year he was here in Parliament.
We outlined all our main criticisms to him.
Nothing has improved and a lot has got worse and therefore I really don't understand how it is that he can come here to this Parliament again next week.
Civil society in Pakistan sees this as covert complicity in that when it comes down to it, the West accepts both the military system and MrÂ°Musharraf himself.
I believe we should make this very clear next week.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Pakistan is now truly an extremely dangerous place, the central tangled knot where all the threads of terrorism are interwoven.
At the same time, however, the country is the West's main ally against terrorism.
There is no escaping this contradiction, just as no end will be possible to the war in Afghanistan without resolving it.
Current European policy is not in a position to resolve very much, at least until it acts in support of the United States' policy.
We can and must ask President Musharraf to restore the constitution and hold proper elections.
The message of the strange, tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto is, however, that we are impotent, and this is because terrorism in Pakistan lies behind the structures of the State, and actually stems from the secret services which - let us not forget - built the Taliban and to this day support and assist them.
Now, however, we should ask President Musharraf to carry out a purge and we should ask the United States, which has very close relations with those secret services, to clarify those relations to us, because if Osama bin Laden is still alive, it would be thanks to those services, unless he has already been killed.
What is more, I would like to remind you that Benazir Bhutto spoke of this in an interview for Al Jazeera on 2 November 2007, and also named bin Laden's assassin, Omar Sheikh, whom President Musharraf in his latest book claims was a former agent of the British MI6.
In view of all this, I believe that a request for an international commission of enquiry into the death of Benazir Bhutto would be the right decision on Europe's part.
Mr President, firstly, I should like to give condolences to the family and friends of Benazir Bhutto.
Her loss is not just Pakistan's but is a loss to the whole world.
I am very proud to have known her personally.
She invited me to join her on her return to Pakistan, and it was very much a heart-wrenching moment for me when I received her New Year's greetings days after she had been murdered.
I remember Benazir as a very strong charismatic woman, asserting her right to rule as the first elected female leader, at the age of 35, of a Muslim state.
I believe she will be remembered as one of the great figures of our century - a leader who inspired both women and men beyond South Asia and represented, above all, hope for a better future for Pakistan.
Benazir's death has caused upheaval in her country, and I believe the only route to stability will be if questions that are being asked about her assassination are answered.
Many people, not just in Pakistan but also those I represent in the West Midlands, want to know who the real culprits are.
Therefore, I ask the Council to strongly support the calls for international investigation by the United Nations into the murder and I ask the Council and the Commission to inform this House what their position is on this.
Benazir Bhutto fought for a democratic Pakistan and a peaceful transition to civilian rule.
Her fight cost her her life.
Let her death not be in vain.
We need to continue this cause, and I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is sending a strong electoral observation mission.
However, if this observation mission is to have credibility, it needs to indicate now to the Pakistani authorities the benchmarks the election observation mission will be using to judge whether the forthcoming elections are free and fair, and this includes an all-party participation in the review of the electoral rules and procedures and an impartial system of conducting elections and verifying election results that is totally transparent.
But, above all, I would really like to emphasise the need for all press restrictions to be lifted and freedom to assemble for political rallies and campaigns, which, in the last few weeks, have been opposed.
Mr President, the tragic death of Benazir Bhutto has left us a legacy, and that is an important legacy: to believe in what she believed in, and this was the power of the Pakistani people to rule by democracy.
In a recent poll as early as November of last year, 70% of people in Pakistan confirmed that they wanted all the restrictions lifted on political rallies; that they were against the banning of political events and opposed the detention of the Supreme Court Chief Justice.
This is the silent majority of Pakistanis who want to live in peace and democracy, and if we are looking for stability in such a volatile country, we can only find it through a political process of reconciliation and democracy.
I welcome the Commission's appeal to send an observer mission to this election but I have two questions for the Commissioner: one is, we have heard various reports of voting lists being destroyed around the country and how can an election take place in this environment?
Secondly, President Musharraf has also banned independent exit polls on this election.
I press on the Commission to make a very strong case before the Pakistani authorities to allow independent confirmation of the results of this election.
Mr President, the target of the assassins was not simply Benazir Bhutto, but all of those who are committed to the principle of democracy.
We should be backing the moderate majority in Pakistan who seek to uphold democracy, and Mr Tannock is wrong to say that all in Pakistan reject European values, as 800 000 British people of Pakistani origin could tell him.
I welcome Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's strengthening of the EU electoral observation mission and recognise our important role in building confidence in the electoral process.
Through her and through today's debate, I call on Pakistan to lift all restrictions on political campaigning, to release remaining political detainees, to publish in advance the location of all polling stations and to ensure that all results are posted immediately in public.
We should welcome the lifting of the state of emergency, President Musharraf's retirement as Army Chief of Staff and the invitation to my own country, the United Kingdom, to assist in the investigation of Mrs Bhutto's death.
Militant extremists are not simply a threat in Pakistan: they are a threat to us all.
Mr President, on 14 November in this House, I stated that the biggest threat facing Pakistan internally is the terrorist threat.
The abhorrent assassination of Benazir Bhutto is proof of this, if it was required.
Extremists hit that day but they must not be allowed to win the day.
We called for President Musharraf on that day to end the state of emergency, to reinstate the constitution, to reinstate the Supreme Court and move towards free and fair elections.
He has done all of this, albeit not necessarily perfectly, and he has relinquished his army role as well.
