In certain cases it will be necessary to use penalties, but we must always try to ensure that the law does not apply the most serious penalty if the objective can be achieved by means of the least serious one.
This has been suitably taken up by Mr Koukiadis in his report and I would like to thank him for that.
I therefore believe we are left with a balanced report, a report which reflects the constant concern of the Commission and of this Parliament that Community law should not be a flatus vocis, that it should be an effective law, and there can be no effective law without penalties, without the possibility of demanding compliance with the law by means of relevant actions in the event that it is violated.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I am confident that a vast majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of the text of his report.
Mr President, I too would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur.
It is a very timely and well-produced report on what, as has already been said, is a very complex and sensitive issue.
Although it is complex it is an issue to which we have to take a practical approach.
There have been times in our committee when we have been presented with initiatives from the Member States, where they want us to introduce penalties, but we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot respond as they would like.
Bearing that situation in mind, when it comes to the IGC, the Council and Member States will appreciate the good sense of what is being proposed here.
I was also struck by the idea presented to us - at the enlightening hearing with experts when Mr Koukiadis was preparing this report - that the Community should and must have the wherewithal to protect its own property in the widest sense.
That is what we are talking about: property in its widest sense.
But there is one point I would like to make and underline.
If we are to give the Community power in this area of competence - and we should - then it should also be underpinned by the sort of balance achieved by the Community itself signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights.
If we are to have some competence, albeit limited, in the criminal field, this must be balanced by measuring that legislation against something fundamental and basic that guarantees our citizens' human rights.
Mr President, at this late stage of the evening there is not much to be said, especially since we all agree on the virtues of the report and its underlying point.
I just want to quickly address three principles.
First of all, it is obvious that criminal law and criminal sanctions touch the liberty of citizens more closely than any other branch of the law and therefore, being absolutely certain that there is a valid constitutional basis for the use of criminal law is vital to liberty as a fundamental matter of the rule of law.
One of the things that the report and its explanatory statement do is to show exactly to what extent there is a basis.
Secondly, in a democratic Community, it is essential that the citizens' representatives get to vote on the question of whether the criminal law should be extended.
That alone would cause us to regard Pillar III as a very suspect basis for any kind of intervention in the criminal law.
It effectively excludes the democratic representatives of the citizens in this Parliament beforehand and in the national parliaments afterwards.
Therefore it is excellent to discover, as Mr Koukiadis shows, that it is a matter for the Community Pillar.
I should to like to underline the point in paragraph 7 about subsidiarity and proportionality.
Again, it sends a message to the Member States to improve their criminal law in an appropriate way and to allow sensitivity to local traditions in law.
That is absolutely vital.
Those are three important principles in an excellent report.
I welcome Mr Bolkestein back from his brief sojourn in Scotland, where he was very welcome.
.
I will be brief.
As Mr MacCormick said - and I welcome him back to Strasbourg after our two meetings in Edinburgh - we all agree.
Mrs Wallis raised the issue of the signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights.
That is a very good point.
Some have proposed that instead of having this Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now in existence and which will probably be part of the new Constitution - although some disagree about that - we should merely have signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights.
There is a risk in the present situation that there is a sort of competition between the two instruments.
That debate has taken place, but the decision - as Mrs Wallis knows - was finally taken to have a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The question now is whether it would be useful to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights, in addition to having that charter.
I am wary of duplicating instruments, so I wonder whether Mrs Wallis' suggestion is a good one.
However, it is certainly worth considering.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.10 p.m.)
Cohesion policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports on cohesion policy:
A5-0267/2003 by Mr Mastorakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission 'Second progress report on economic and social cohesion': regional trends, debate on future developments [COM(2003) 34 - 2003/2095(INI)]
and
A5-0188/2003 by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on structurally disadvantaged regions (islands, mountain regions, regions with low population density) in the context of cohesion policy, and their institutional prospects [2002/2119(INI)].
Mr President, I can represent Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, if you wish, and speak on his behalf.
I should like first to thank the two rapporteurs, both Mr ?astorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, and congratulate them on their work and then make a number of comments on the two reports.
As far as Mr Mastorakis's report is concerned, I should like to comment on three points.
First, on the fact, as stated in the report, that we cannot fall below 0.45% of GDP in future cohesion policy.
As Commissioner Barnier has also pointed out in the past, Parliament considers that if Community funding falls below this point for cohesion policies, these policies, especially in view of enlargement, will cease to be reliable and efficient.
My second comment concerns Objective 2, which will obviously have to be simplified so that actions have greater visibility and better results for citizens, which is why we prefer a new Objective 2 with thematic actions.
And finally, a third comment to do with Mr Mastorakis's report and Structural Fund procedures.
They need to be simplified.
It is becoming clear and I think it has also been understood by the Commission, which has from time to time organised seminars with local and regional authorities on the subject, especially in the run up to the new programming period, that we need to pool our thoughts as to how these actions can be made more efficient by simplifying them.
Now to the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz on regions with a permanent structural disadvantage, such as island regions, mountain regions and the ultra-peripheral regions with low population density in the north.
I should like first of all to welcome the recent development in the Constitutional Convention, which has extended the concept of economic and social cohesion by adding the term 'territorial cohesion'.
Hopefully, this added term will form an adequate legal basis so that we have something more specific and more tangible in the future for these areas.
Nonetheless, Parliament feels there is still a need to clarify Article 158 of the Treaty on island areas.
As you know, there is a division of opinion as to how this specific article should be translated.
It is translated in different ways in different languages.
It needs to be clarified once and for all so that the provision for island areas is valid.
Parliament also feels that, over and above structural actions, the article referring to state aid, namely Article 87, also needs to be amended so that the areas we are talking about today are also included in the areas needing special treatment.
Apart from all this, Mr President, Parliament - I think absolutely rightly - maintains in the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz that, within the framework of the new Objective 2, about which I have already spoken with reference to the report by Mr Mastorakis, a special thematic action is needed to cover these areas.
Parliament also adds that, for these areas with a permanent geographical handicap, there can and should be a higher percentage of Community co-financing in future through the Structural Funds.
Debates on these areas have been held in this Parliament for a great many years.
The Commissioner recently ordered studies on the subject.
It started with mountain areas and then moved on to island areas.
I truly hope that today's debate, and in particular the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz on structurally disadvantaged regions, really will give us the opportunity we have been seeking for years to change something and to send a message to the residents of these regions that we are taking a substantive approach to their problems, because these regions, as the Commission studies have, I think, demonstrated, are indeed at a permanent disadvantage by reason of their geographical position, which prevents them from enjoying the same competitive conditions as other regions in the European Union.
The time has therefore come, Mr President, for action rather than words.
Mr Hatzidakis, I did actually allow you to speak for longer just now. The speaking time would of course be deducted from Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz if he were to appear.
Mr President, may I point out that it is pronounced Duin, as in Duisburg.
I know that it can sometimes be problematic, but I will take the liberty of pointing it out at this stage.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the words of thanks voiced by previous speakers to the two rapporteurs.
I believe that we have now taken another major step forward in this ongoing debate, thanks in particular to Mr Mastorakis's report.
I should like to comment on the two reports together.
It will be clear to the Commission too that there are several demands that Parliament repeatedly underlines - including in the report - and I assume that a consensus could be reached here on the following: that we do not want renationalisation; that 75% of GDP is a good yardstick and that 0.45% of GDP is a minimum if we are to be able to implement a viable European structural policy.
I should now like to say something on the outstanding points, which are also mentioned in the reports.
Many people believe that a new Objective 2, whatever it looked like, could solve their problems.
We have to be more honest and cannot say to each region: you will also get in under Objective 2, once it is restructured in some way.
That is why we wish to make various proposals, and these are also reflected in the reports.
The first concerns the regions that will suffer from the statistical effect, the current Objective 1 regions.
For these, we need to launch a new programme - let us call it a 1b programme - that is generously funded, but above all - this is very important to the regions and we must take it into account - that has a legal framework that is comparable to Article 87, and which will enable them to use the aid to meet their region's specific needs.
The second concerns the disadvantaged regions, which take centre stage in Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz's report.
Here we do not need a new Objective 2, but a very special instrument for these regions, which properly takes into account the special problems that we of course wish to acknowledge.
We should not try to lump everything together here.
The third proposal is for a real Objective 2 for those areas undergoing structural change.
Here I would, however, make a strong plea in favour of ensuring that in this case the Member States are given as much freedom as possible to use the funds as they see fit.
This triad is important.
It is conveyed clearly in the Mastorakis report as it stands, which is why we will of course be voting in favour of it.
A few changes are probably needed to the PomÃ©s Ruiz report to achieve this, and we hope that we will be adopting those today.
Thank you, Mr Duin.
When Germans have French names or names that look French, they are often pronounced quite differently in Germany.
I would therefore apologise, Mr Duin, for my earlier mistake.
Mr President, I too would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Mastorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, for drafting very successful reports.
Economic and social disparities between the Member States have lessened, but inequalities within the Member States have persisted and even deepened.
The report reiterates Parliament's stance on pursuing an inclusive Community cohesion policy.
After enlargement a large share of regional and structural aid will go to the new Member States. That is inevitable.
We must not, however, pit regions in difficulties in the present Union against poor regions in the new Member States.
Through united efforts we can take care of both.
Our group supports the main arguments in the reports.
I am not going to go over the content of the reports again here, but I would like to highlight the importance of a few matters.
The reports call for combining regional policy with other policies.
With regard to economic, agricultural, transport and competition policy, for example, regional considerations should be taken into account more.
When the Union enlarges, the need to reform regional policy will intensify.
Our group backs the Commission's aims to simplify and clarify regional policy and urges them to accomplish this.
At the same time, we have to make improvements in result orientation and programme quality, and the role that the regions play alongside the Member States and the Commission must be strengthened.
This will demand determined work on the part of the Commission and the Member States also.
The new programming period can no longer afford the burdensome levels of administration that frequently afflict the current regional and structural policy, and the delays and apparent messing around that is associated with it.
It is important that the special features of regions suffering from permanent geographical handicaps are recognised and identified and that solutions are sought for them.
Islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated regions all have the same kind of problems.
There are many in our group who have been active in trying to solve the problems of island and mountain regions.
I myself know best the sparsely populated regions of the north.
Development in the Union's northernmost region is overshadowed by long distances, a low density of population, a cold climate and an ageing population as a result of people moving away in droves. The same region nevertheless holds many great opportunities.
I am grateful to Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for proposing that sparsely populated regions in the north should be taken into account in the Union's constitutional treaty.
Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz's report has increased cohesion.
We understand one another better now.
The problems in the various less favoured zones can be solved through good levels of cooperation as part of the Union's cohesion policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as early as the year 2000 I expressed regret in this House that, although the poorest regions and Member States had been catching up thanks to EU support for regional development, the gap between the least and most developed regions in the Community had barely narrowed.
The inequalities in regional development continue to exist.
This conclusion can also be drawn from the report by Mr Mastorakis, whom I should like warmly to congratulate.
Despite the best efforts of those responsible for regional policy at European and national level, the challenges that we face today in the year 2003 are not diminishing.
They are becoming even greater if you consider the stagnant economy and the sharp increase in unemployment in many European countries.
A very great burden is placed on economic and social cohesion even today.
The enlargement of the European Union to include ten more countries from central and eastern Europe will not only increase regional disparities and thus place an even greater strain on cohesion, but, as the expiry of the current support period from 2000 to 2006 approaches, the debate on the shape of future regional policy from 2007 is also coming to the fore.
In my opinion, the assessment of the criteria for measuring the development status and thus the eligibility of a region is a priority issue.
Factors in regional development such as the rate of industrialisation, the level of poverty and social exclusion, the level of unemployment, the potential for research and development, the training capacity, the sustainability of development and the development of environmental protection, all need to be taken into account in the assessment alongside the present single criterion of GDP per head of the population.
It is of particular concern to me, as it is to other Members from Objective 1 areas, that these special regions do not fall out of the highest support bracket because of a change in the arithmetic due to the accession of the new Member States.
For them the principle should apply that they can claim the same financial support and rights to subsidies as they did before enlargement.
I also support Mr Mastorakis's statement in his report about the shape of future Objective 2 areas, that is how they and the Objective 3 measures for disadvantaged groups are to be restructured, and welcome his comments on how eligibility for these measures will be determined.
Mr President, this year's Athens Treaty is being hailed as historic, but we all know that it is only now that the work of integration begins.
Integration means establishing social and economic cohesion in an EU of 25 and, if you will pardon my saying so Commissioner, you still have not given us your blueprint for achieving this, although it is high time that you did so.
There is no trace of even a strategy in the Second progress report on cohesion.
It seems to me that you think that distributing money here, there and everywhere will somehow keep everyone happy.
No, Commissioner, we cannot afford to do that anymore, because if we do not manage to bring about economic and social cohesion in this EU of 25 the whole edifice will come tumbling down!
We need root and branch reform of the Structural Funds and we need clear guidance on what our aims are when spending the money.
Where those aims are concerned, we were of course taught a hard and painful lesson in the last two summers: last year we had floods; this year it was fire.
Commissioner, I think it is clear that at long last we have to be guided by the GÃ¶teborg conclusions: that sustainable development has to be at the heart of the Structural Funds; that social and employment policy aspects on the one hand and economic aspects on the other have to be given equal weight, and that EU money should only be deployed if this is the case.
In too many places we have simply squandered EU funds, and this is no longer acceptable in an EU of 25.
It is true that specific geographical characteristics do bring with them particular development requirements, but unlike many Members of this House I do not think that geographical characteristics are a disadvantage in themselves, but that poverty in these areas is much more of a disadvantage.
I only have criticism for the attempts being made by many Members here to protect their vested rights and secure their own stipends, when surely the actual aim has to be economic and social cohesion.
I protest against any attempts to introduce new criteria here that do not relate to poverty and unemployment, which cause people real suffering.
That is why I believe that it is right for the Commission to stick to its goals and, particularly in areas where there are difficulties, for the poverty criteria to be the decisive ones and not the geographical characteristics.
Only then, with these sound principles, will it be possible to tackle different kinds of difficulties, for example the problems of restructuring in many areas, including in wealthier countries, the restructuring difficulties in agriculture, female poverty and the depopulation of urban areas.
These things too should be taken into account and we have a whole series of instruments to enable us to do so, for example phasing out and subsidies.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will finally table a clear blueprint for achieving sustainable development through the Structural Funds.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must look at all the factors in the analysis that compelled both the European Commission and Parliament to discuss this major issue, and I am referring here to the processes that have led to enlargement.
A few years ago, I submitted a document to President Prodi on the relationship between enlargement and the repercussions that it would have in certain regions of our Community, in particular in southern Italy.
Since the war, we have witnessed a strange phenomenon: whilst, previously, history revolved around hostility between East and West, now, as if by a strange twist of fate, we are dealing with a European Community where the problems are between North and South, and always between a rich and prosperous North and a poor South.
Therefore, enlargement has been a factor in our considerations, and our conclusion is that a war between the poor must be avoided, given the consequences of such an occurrence.
I am writing a report on European public finances in 2003 and it shows that we are facing problems of increased GDP in some countries and falling GDP in others.
Even countries that, a few years ago, more or less balanced their budgets, now find themselves near to negative projections.
How, then, should we manage these Structural Funds?
The rapporteurs do well to give broad guidelines in their reports.
I believe that we need to ensure that Objective 2 is not too all-embracing; we need to ensure that the Member States can manage Structural Funds that have been obtained in the first stage properly and coordinate them more effectively in the next stage.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for producing such a clear report. It highlights the need to take account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy, over and above the purely economic and social aspects.
This policy must be founded on the principle of solidarity, in order to reduce the disparities between regions, and to establish the principle of the equality of European citizens, regardless of where they live.
Moreover, we should provide our fellow citizens with equal access to high-quality public services, which are the very social fabric of the regions of Europe. We should also recognise the special character, the quality of life and natural resources of the people of structurally disadvantaged regions, together with their heritage and their know-how.
I agree with the rapporteur that it would be a mistake to concentrate all our financial support on the new Member States, and to neglect the currently eligible areas.
We must remember that enlargement will increase regional disparities.
I welcome the proposal to supplement Article 158 of the EC Treaty. This will mean that more account will be taken of the structural handicaps of islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas, in proportion to the severity of the difficulties experienced.
These regions were sidelined under previous programmes.
It is essential that they are now recognised in terms of accessibility, communication, infrastructure, financing and access to public services. This is vital if an exodus to the cities and the ageing of the population is to be prevented.
The Endelave declaration was signed during a fact-finding visit made by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities to this location, an island of 183 inhabitants in central Denmark.
This declaration addresses the specific situation of small European islands, which can function perfectly well. It seeks to allow the people of these small islands to access good-quality services, such as ferries, doctors, veterinary surgeons, schools, ministers, home-helps and libraries, as long as financial support is provided in the spirit of solidarity.
Lastly, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, I feel I must highlight the importance of increasing the involvement of Member States and their decentralised authorities in cohesion policy. These bodies are closer to, and more aware of, the reality on the ground in their region.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see the Second progress report on economic and social cohesion as a valuable, up-dated analysis of the current situation and of the possible future direction of cohesion policy in the enlarged Union.
The compromise that was reached after lengthy discussions with the rapporteur and the adoption of numerous amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is to be welcomed, and as the report now stands it should achieve a majority in the House.
I am thinking here both of the budget for cohesion policy of 0.45% of GDP and of keeping Objective 1 areas as the main focus of our support.
I welcome the threshold of 75% of GDP per head at NUTS II level being retained as the main criterion for determining Objective 1 status, provided that at the same time the so-called statistical effect is neutralised.
We are all aware that at the end of the current support period those regions affected by the statistical effect will not of course have exceeded the 75% threshold in the present EU.
Overnight, or to be more precise between 30 April and 1 May next year, a stroke of a mathematical pen will turn poor wretches into wealthy people, although they will not have a cent more to their name.
That is the so-called statistical effect.
These regions continue to require resources from the Structural Funds to consolidate and further the process of economic and social convergence, which they have begun so successfully in previous support periods.
That is why the report clearly underlines, on the basis of our amendments submitted in the committee, that particular attention must be paid to the regions suffering from the impact of these statistical changes, and that in the future too these areas should be treated as similar to Objective 1 areas with the equivalent level of support and with the aid administered in accordance with Article 87, paragraph 3(a).
Existing transitional arrangements - phasing out - do not do justice to the specific problems of these areas caught by the statistical effect.
The report, as it stands, should also find the support of the majority of this House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems clear to me, as it does to the rapporteur and to the Commission, that we cannot approach cohesion policies and Structural Funds in an ideological way.
What is needed is a very pragmatic approach, as taken by the rapporteur and, undoubtedly, by the Commissioner, too, in his work.
The future of the European Union is firmly linked to the quality and future of cohesion policies.
Only if we do not have a three-speed Europe, which is the risk we are running, will we genuinely be able to talk about a process of political integration.
For this to happen, certain conditions have to be met: it is essential that we confirm our unequivocal rejection of any renationalisation of regional policies.
As many colleagues have said, it is essential to make the 0.45% threshold a minimum threshold, in the sense that the European Union's commitment in cohesion policies cannot fall below this percentage, and it is good that, given the decisions facing the European Union on the eve of enlargement, this is being established as a political principle and not merely as an arithmetic one.
As other colleagues have said and as I would like to reiterate, we need to avoid some regions suddenly finding themselves classed as rich because of the impact on the statistics.
Therefore, better phasing-out needs to be devised for Objective 1 regions, which will be excluded following enlargement, and, above all, the permanent geographical handicap of many regions needs to be taken into account.
To this end, I believe that these permanent geographical handicaps and the need for a Community strategy which can overcome them need to be recognised in the next Constitutional Treaty.
The declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the structural disadvantages of islands has never been converted into specific measures.
I would also like to urge the Commission to make greater endeavours to simplify the regional policy implementation rules and to ensure clearer distribution of responsibilities and competences between all those involved in cohesion policy.
I would also like to call upon the Commission to continue with the endeavour that has been made thus far to lay down some priorities in cohesion policies.
Consider how important it is today to invest in the quality of knowledge, in the quality of innovation, in technological research and immaterial infrastructure.
We believe that the future of Europe should be viewed less in terms of concrete construction and much more in terms of the quality of knowledge we can offer.
In Europe, Mr President, the wealthy regions are not in danger of becoming poor. Quite the opposite: there is the danger that some poor regions will remain as such in the long term.
We want to avoid this.
Mr President, those of us who come from regions with permanent structural disadvantages have real reason to be grateful to Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for his report and the innovative ideas it contains.
I speak not only for my own country of Scotland but also from knowledge of some of the more remote Greek islands and of the north of Finland and Sweden.
However, the problems of island status, mountainous terrain and sparse population affect many areas in other Member States and in some accession countries too.
One very great merit of the report is its recognition of the effects where these problems are combined or aggravated.
I welcome particularly in this regard the proposed amendment to Article 158 of the Treaty, as also the thrust towards mainstreaming issues of structural disadvantage into EU policy more generally.
However, I would like to single out the calls for mountainous regions to be classified as agriculturally disadvantaged in relation to Structural Fund regulations, for permanent geographical handicaps to be taken more fully into account where rules on state aid are concerned and for the causes of emigration to be addressed.
In the latter context, the relevance of isolation and difficulty of access is already well known, particularly where islands are concerned.
Therefore, I wish to couple my welcome for today's reports with that of the analysis of island regions sponsored by the Commission.
Some concern was expressed in Scotland that because certain types of island were excluded from the study they might suffer where future policymaking was concerned.
However, looking to the emphasis it places on the disadvantages associated with small size and population of archipelagos and on double handicap - for example islands with mountains - it was clear there was no need for such concerns.
Indeed, the suggestions made in the study for more research and exchange of information and for innovative projects under Interreg looked to bring real practical benefits to all those whose lives are island ones.
My thanks are thus due to the Commissioner and to the rapporteur - indeed, both rapporteurs alike.
Mr President, the rapporteurs imply that ensuring social cohesion in an enlarged Europe consists of levelling out the differences between countries and regions. They do not, however, have anything to say about the inequalities within the same country, including the richest ones.
How can we dare to speak of economic and social cohesion in a society where there is an ever-increasing disparity between the income of the richest and the poorest?
How can we have the effrontery to speak of cohesion when big companies lay off workers to increase the stock market value of their shares, knowing that, in so doing, they are condemning their employees to poverty?
The policy of the various governments entails bandying about the word reform, whilst hammering workers by reducing their retirement, extending their working time, cutting their social protection, holding back their salaries and making jobs less and less secure. What is the meaning of social cohesion when governments are doing all this in order to increase the profits of big companies and increase the fortunes of shareholders?
What does social cohesion mean when governments are cutting their funding to essential public services in order to cut taxes for the richest?
It follows that, if the European Union is incapable of dealing with social inequalities, it cannot hope to eliminate inequalities between the regions because the two are connected.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both reports focus on cohesion in Europe.
In particular, they refer to structural issues that could foster such cohesion.
The reports refer to a geographical dimension that relates to mountains and islands, and also to a social dimension.
The latter represents a new approach, and relates mainly to depopulation.
We would suggest that another new Europe-wide phenomenon should be taken into account also. I refer to the ageing of the population and the shortage of productive members of the labour force required to develop the economy.
This has been noted in all the inland regions of Europe.
It is especially true of areas like my constituency. I represent Aragon in Spain.
Two-thirds of the population of Aragon live in a single city.
The region extends over 47 000 square kilometres and the whole of the interior is becoming depopulated.
The problem is not a lack of employment opportunities or a shortage of work. It is that nobody wants to go there to work.
Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to consider how to overcome that obstacle.
This really is a structural problem, because it is a question of attitude.
People simply do not wish to go and work in inland regions.
Yesterday Commissioner Barnier outlined the difficulties facing Portugal.
What were the individuals affected by the problems resulting from the fires and the heat wave to do?
Where were they to seek employment, in the large cities, on the coast?
Are we to plan for a coastal Europe, a Europe of large cities?
Or should we be aiming at a balanced Europe?
We believe it is time to bring a new factor into the equation, namely the ageing of the population.
Furthermore, such ageing is inevitable.
It is also important to tackle the shortage of productive members of the labour force and the difficulty of persuading people to seek employment in certain areas.
Mr President, I believe that economic and social cohesion will make or break the future of the European Union, the Union of 25.
Enlargement will reveal dramatically once again the complete lack of practical responses to an objective on which the European Union and the Treaties preceding it were founded.
We need only to think of a survey conducted a few years ago, which showed that Lombardy was one of the top 20 wealthiest regions while Sicily, my homeland, was in seventy-seventh place.
This shows just how far we are in practice from the objectives of achieving a proper, sound, tangible economic and social cohesion policy.
There has been no strategy, no will to take practical measures, no polycentric Europe.
Southern Italy and the Mediterranean have been left on the fringe of a genuine growth and stability strategy.
The problems are not only due to geographical remoteness, which would, alone, be grounds for huge-scale, effective measures, but there is also an incredible lack of infrastructure, a lack of planning in the areas of training, technological innovation research and improving the universities in marginal regions.
Therefore, we need to preserve the European Union's minimum intervention threshold, we need to stem the flow of people leaving mountain areas, we need to intervene in disadvantaged islands, which are disadvantaged not only because of their distance from mainland Europe but also because of inherent problems to which Europe must find an immediate solution.
Mr President, this initiative aims to drive the European Union forward by propagating the Community method to develop European policies for European regions, rather than nations, and to establish a legal basis for new structural support for enlargement countries under the proposed constitution.
However, even the rapporteur admits that on enlargement, Europe's regional income disparities will increase dramatically.
The Commissioner stresses that in the EU of 15, 48 regions - accounting for 18% of the population - had a per capita income below 75% of the average, whereas in an enlarged Union a total of 67 regions will fall below the 75% threshold - representing 26% of total population.
Yet instead of structural funds being granted to economically deprived areas, the rapporteur proposes that, on enlargement, money should be channelled to disadvantaged mountainous, remote or island regions - a much narrower definition for distribution.
So a system that is already inherently bad becomes even worse.
Individual nations know precisely where help is needed within their own domains and yet the European Union is determined to exert its authority by controlling structural support for what it considers to be impoverished regions.
If control of funding were to be returned to national governments, I am confident that the UK Government would be aware of the serious need for funding in my own region - the South-West - where we have suffered tremendously from the effects of the EU's disastrous common fisheries policy and common agricultural policy.
Funding administered by our own government would ensure that the whole transport infrastructure - rail, road and air - receives the attention it deserves for the benefit of all our small businessmen in the South-West, and all of those people involved in our vital tourism industry.
We know where funding is needed far better than the bureaucrats in Brussels.
Mr President, I have stood before this House many times over the past four years and called for revisions to the way in which European Union Structural and Cohesion Funds are administered.
Today is no different.
It is extremely rare that an instance occurs when I can say that I am in complete agreement with a member of the UK Labour Party.
This happened recently in a landmark speech by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who, as we all know, called for the repatriation of regional aid.
In essence, this is a good idea.
The current system is, as we have repeatedly seen, unworkable, and the bureaucracy is becoming increasingly stifling.
Time and again we have seen reports passing through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism highlighting the inequalities that exist as a result of a system that fails the very people it sets out to help.
I know that the idea Mr Brown mooted was not well received here - or indeed in the Commission - not least by members of his own party.
I have my doubts over just how far the UK Government will push for this idea.
I voted against the Mastorakis report in committee, not because it was a bad report but because there were references I felt we could not ignore.
Clearly, paragraph 2's stout defence of the Commission's stance in rejecting renationalisation would differ from my own view, as we have already discussed.
Nor can I support any reference to tripartite contracts: by allowing the Commission to institute such actions directly with regions, we would be allowing our nation states to be bypassed.
I have always voiced my concerns at these repeated attempts to circumvent national parliamentary scrutiny.
I shall continue to do so because I see this as a dangerous precedent, opening the door to a Europe of the regions by stealth - something I totally reject.
I conclude with a stark fact: billions of euros are still in the Commission's coffers, without a chance of being spent.
In future, what we need is a more focused and concentrated approach on coordinated priorities for funding, cross-border projects or major items of Community interest - the rest should be left to the Member States.
Mr President, the European Union's regional and structural policy must be based on genuine solidarity between the different regions of the EU.
The aim should be economic integration and an understanding of the differences arising from regional disparities.
We must take full account of the needs of the new Member States in future proposals to ensure there is effective use of aids to achieve structural reforms and that the aids have permanent effects on citizens' lives.
Although we are taking the new Member States into full consideration, the regions in the current Member States needing special support must also be included in any new plans.
I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, for having very seriously proposed that regions with permanent structural constraints should also be included in any special aid programmes in the future.
Such permanent constraints are, for example, remoteness and geographical isolation.
These regions, moreover, have a low population density and difficult climatic conditions.
It is vital that these permanent handicaps should be seen as the same kind of factor that hampers competitiveness as that which has been described regarding island regions.
Thus, the means by which aid is delivered to the outlying, sparsely populated northern regions is not the most important consideration, as long as these needs are taken account of with a sufficient sense of solidarity and equality.
I also trust that, whilst the new proposal on structural and regional policy after 2007 is being drafted during this autumn, the Commission will show a sense of fairness and also include in its proposal the regions that have a low population density which are situated in the north and where distances are long.
Mr President, cher Monsieur le Commissaire, the report we are in a quandary about approving contains a genuinely fundamental change to regional policy.
Regions with permanent handicaps must be regarded in a new way in aid policy.
I believe this fundamental revaluation to be important.
There are handicaps that are ongoing.
We in sparsely populated Finland are familiar with such disadvantages, and these were also noted in the important accession treaty for Finland, Sweden and Austria.
Mountain regions and archipelagos may also be of relevance in this connection, however.
At any event, I should like to see islands and archipelagos given special treatment.
When Finland became a member of the EU, it was difficult for us to maintain important aid arrangements.
For example, certain general forms of transport aid were examined extremely critically by the Commission.
It is not large amounts of aid we are requesting for sparsely populated areas, the archipelago and mountain areas, but such sums may be crucial to it being possible to maintain services.
An important part of the policy may also consist of countries being given opportunities to receive certain smaller sums by way of general aid and of companies that maintain services of general interest being required to ensure that such services operate.
We also need rules within agricultural policy enabling small-scale agriculture in the archipelago to survive.
That is incredibly important for the archipelago as a part of our world heritage and as something that we are trying to administer as well as possible.
The European Convention proposes similar changes, something for which we are extremely grateful.
Finally, I wish to say that the concept of territorial cohesion was really originated by the CPMR under its then chairman, Stig Ãstdahl.
I am extremely pleased that, today as well, Parliament can contribute to new and important thinking that must be of use in enabling people to live and prosper in all parts of the EU.
Mr President, the failure of the stated ambition of the European Union's regional policy to bring about economic and social cohesion presages even more unfavourable prospects for its application to the weaker Member States following enlargement.
Indeed, in numerous cases, not only has there been no reduction in the development gap, but also enlargement has widened the gap between the regions lagging behind and the developed regions.
This is true both of the island and mountain regions and of the towns plagued by mass unemployment and poverty.
For example, after 23 years of integration, Greece is still the poorest country in the European Union.
It is becoming poorer and poorer, with regions in which the per capita income is falling.
The lack of resources and constant cutbacks have not helped to strengthen the widely broadcast concept of cohesion or stabilise the level of development.
On the contrary, they have resulted in shake-ups which have exacerbated the economic and social disintegration of the regions.
In addition, the poor regions have more than doubled since enlargement.
This state of affairs, Mr President, is such that we cannot accept the rapporteurs' appraisal of the excellent results achieved during the course of the economic and social cohesion of the regions of the European Union.
Mr President, cohesion policy must take account of the special circumstances of the very small islands.
On an organisational and political basis, the EU at present deals with all the islands under the one heading, so that even very small and sparsely populated islands come into the same category as islands with many thousands of inhabitants.
I myself live on a small island, Endelave, which has 180 inhabitants and is situated an hour's sail out into the Kattegat.
Clearly, we live under quite different conditions than those prevailing in, for example, Corsica or other islands with many thousands of inhabitants.
The challenges are quite different, and we cannot be placed in the same category as the large islands.
That also applies to the Commission's analyses of the islands' special circumstances and potential.
The small islands must be eliminated from this analysis and be given their own status, with different conclusions being drawn about them and their opportunities for development.
In that connection, it is important also to recognise the union of small islands that already exists under the name of the European Small Islands' Network.
To the extent that structural development funds exist, the very small islands must also be allocated these, and national scope must be created for supporting development on the very small islands.
Their particular handicap necessitates support for development processes that can increase settlement and employment, that is to say the promotion of a year-round society on the small islands too.
The ferry connection is quite crucial in this connection.
First and foremost, it is important for the ferries serving the small islands to be exempted from the EU's tendering requirements.
The tendering demanded by the EU and implemented in connection with the ferries serving Denmark's small islands has led to large expenditure for the ferry companies, but no one has made them an offer.
It is quite grotesque that, on the one hand, we should have a set of regulations that inflicts unnecessary expenditure upon the small islands and their lifeblood, while we, at the same time, talk about development aid for these areas.
The ferries must be regarded as the islands' only highway. It is a question of creating equal conditions.
Mr President, once again, I am speaking in this House on a sensitive subject, one which myself and other Members, have spoken about at other times and one with which Commissioner Barnier is very familiar, not least because he has discussed it with us on countless occasions: the protection of islands, of some of the most disadvantaged regions in our European Union.
I notice with satisfaction that you have adopted an acceptable course, that the general approach of giving recognition to all geographically disadvantaged regions in the Union, with islands, of course, in first place, has met with broad consensus and success, and this seems to be the line taken by the Commission.
I have noted that, at least according to the intentions that have been revealed to date, this will not be restricted to a petition of principle but it will take the form of genuine aid, of the inclusion of these regions in one of the objectives and, therefore, of what is actually crucial aid for key areas.
A number of things must, however, be clarified: firstly, the rewording of Article 158.
I have tabled an amendment as a reminder that, once again, there has been a long discussion on this subject relating to the infamous translations, that has now ended, giving recognition to all islands through Article 158.
The text prepared by Mr Mastorakis could be considered to be ambiguous on this point and I have tabled an amendment to this effect.
Another point I would like to emphasise, particularly while the Commissioner is here, is that we have long been calling for the creation of a special unit for islands.
It was done for the outermost regions and I believe that such a unit would provide valuable information and, consequently, facilitate the implementation of strategic measures for this fragile sector.
I hope that the rapporteurs and the Commission will favour the amendments that I have tabled and that they can be incorporated.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the context of the debate on the future of regional policy, there is a very wide consensus that priority for the least developed regions should be maintained.
Concentrating resources on the Objective 1 regions should, therefore, constitute one of the key pillars of cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013, as is the case now. This would be in line with the principles of solidarity and redistribution.
The accession of the candidate countries to the European Union will, in statistical terms, reduce the average GDP of the European Union. Accordingly, the Commission's progress report states that 18 regions should lose Objective 1 status.
They would nevertheless benefit from the support provided under the phasing out mechanism.
The French overseas departments will not be affected. They will continue to be classed as Objective 1 in 2007, insofar as their per capita GDP will remain well below 75% of the new European Union average.
Furthermore, it would be appropriate to foster equality between regions by taking account of the permanent difficulties affecting islands, mountain regions and regions with low population density.
Community intervention of this kind would be counterbalanced by a range of territorial criteria. The latter would be used to define priorities and to determine the extent of the means to be allocated.
Nevertheless, I feel it is useful to bear in mind that the concept of ultra-peripheral regions must never be confused with that of peripheral regions, islands or structurally disadvantaged regions, regardless of any relationship of solidarity between all these regions. This is because the special legal status of the ultra-peripheral regions is due to their very remoteness from the continent of Europe.
The contribution of other European Union policies is the weakest element of the current progress report. In particular, this concerns the system of governance to be implemented so as to ensure that cohesion policy produces the best possible results in the regions concerned.
I have in mind agriculture, rural development, transport, innovation, education and training. I am also thinking of competition policy in the context of state aids to regions and tax concessions.
I would, however, like to conclude on two encouraging points.
Firstly, there is consensus on the need for real improvements to the financial systems and administrative procedures of the Structural Funds.
Lastly, I am encouraged that the suggestion that regional policy should be renationalised has lost support. Had it not, it would most certainly have brought European integration to a grinding halt.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteurs for the worthwhile work they have done.
People must be able to reside throughout Europe.
It is important also to be able to live in those areas that are most vulnerable when market forces promote urbanisation in Europe.
European policy must, therefore, also promote cohesion.
There must be a regional policy.
At the same time, there must also be a regional dimension to national policy, for every country has responsibility for there being regional solidarity within the Member States.
We must now, in connection with enlargement, have a solidarity policy, and we must bind Europe together.
That must happen through regional policy, but also through transport policy and competition policy, which are at least as important if we are to be able to live throughout Europe.
We must also have territorial cohesion. I am looking forward to a treaty in which territorial cohesion has an important role.
I think that, in the future, most of the funds from regional policy should go to the new Member States, but we must also look to the special conditions that exist in Europe if we are to be able to live throughout the continent.
I therefore find it extremely commendable that we have obtained the PomÃ©s Ruiz report, in which mountains, islands and regions with low population density are highlighted and in which attention is drawn to the special role of regional policy in Europe when it comes to aid for these areas.
To summarise, aid for mountain regions, islands and regions with low population density is therefore important.
We must be able to live in these areas.
European policy must not place obstacles in the way of development in these regions.
At the same time, it is also important for us to have a regional policy involving decentralisation and people having to take responsibility for development in their own regions.
Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Mastorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, for their excellent reports.
Cohesion policy is a basic precondition for the existence and legitimacy of the EU as a whole.
A mechanism is needed which will also boost prosperity in the most disadvantaged regions.
Cohesion policy is founded on the Treaty on European Union.
Both in the present Treaty and that being drafted by the European Convention regional and social cohesion is presented as a principle that runs through all policy areas.
When the new Member States join the European Union, they will all be in need of structural development.
The danger is that regional and structural policy funding with regard to the old Member States will decrease.
Then these least favoured regions in terms of their economy would be having to pay more for enlargement than the regions that are economically the strongest, which, on the other hand, will benefit most from it.
For that reason, funding for the former eligible areas must not be reduced.
In Finland and Sweden in particular, there are sparsely populated, remote regions, the current Objective 1 areas, for which access to markets is difficult.
That is why these regions should be considered very remote areas on a par with the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores.
A particular problem is the way the Structural Funds are currently administered, which is inefficient and bureaucratic.
This is visible in the under utilisation of funds, which is catastrophic.
In 2000, EUR 6.7 billion of appropriations remained unspent; in the following year the amount was EUR 8.7 billion, and in 2002 it was EUR 6.2 billion.
Outstanding commitments now stand at more than EUR 90 billion, or almost the equivalent of the budget for three years.
This jeopardises the credibility of this whole area of policy.
Administration must be dramatically reformed and greatly simplified.
The so-called n+2 rule, created to make administration more efficient, does not work, because the Commission accepts repeated advance payments as means of payment, even though the project itself should not even have been started.
That is why this rule too should be revised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of this joint debate on economic and social cohesion, we are analysing the Mastorakis report on the Commission's second progress report on European cohesion policy.
I would like to express my support for the ideas expressed by the rapporteur, and take this opportunity to thank him for the remarkable quality of his work.
Regional policy and cohesion policy have played and continue to play a vital role in the development of Member States such as Portugal and their full integration into the European Union.
I am delighted that some European regions, including some regions of Portugal, have left the Cohesion Fund through their own efforts.
That is without a doubt the best example of the success of this Community policy.
It should not be forgotten, however, that although major differences already exist between some European regions in terms of their levels of development, these disparities will become even more marked after enlargement.
In order to realise the full potential of its cohesion policy, thus reducing inequality in regional development, the European Union must maintain its support of current Member States at a constant level.
At the same time, it must also develop the regions containing the future Member States in a balanced way.
Faced with this double challenge, the European Union's duty is to make sufficient funds available to meet the new demands of this situation.
For that reason, the current threshold of 0.45% of Community gross domestic product must never fall victim to budget cuts of any kind.
For that reason, and because the cohesion policy has proved to be a success in Portugal, I oppose the renationalisation of this development tool.
I welcome the Commission's establishment of a transitional scheme for regions suffering from the 'statistical' effects of enlargement, losing their eligibility as a result of Objective 1 being opened up to less-developed regions.
Finally, I have nothing but praise for the creation of a new Objective 2, on the basis of regional competitiveness in accordance with the guidelines laid down at the Lisbon Summit.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs.
They have highlighted the importance of cohesion policy for the European Union, and therefore for the people of Europe. The cohesion policy is a policy of solidarity, particularly for the structurally disadvantaged regions.
Today the fundamental policies of the European Union are being called into question. The press are referring to the so-called extra costs in exaggerated terms.
It is essential to underline how vital these policies are, especially for the regions that have benefited from them to date. How far behind would they have lagged in terms of development without European Union aid?
These are the policies that make the European Union come alive for its citizens. They are policies advocating solidarity, redistribution and the creation of bridges between areas that are not experiencing the same difficulties.
I have no hesitation in saying that these policies have brought the European Union alive.
It is incumbent upon us to ensure policies like these are retained.
We must keep on the right track. It is not a question of restructuring the European budget to make it more dynamic; rather it is a matter of increasing the budget.
If the European Union wants to do more, it must provide itself with the means to do so.
I must emphasise one point in particular. It concerns our development indicators.
GDP alone is no longer a relevant criterion.
Now we have achieved a certain degree of macro-equity in Europe, it is time to refine these criteria.
Micro-economic indicators must be taken into account and this assessment should constantly inform our future action. I am now thinking in particular of the regions affected by desertification and suffering from structural handicaps in relation to employment, training, amenities, accessibility and demography.
The Commission should now have all the necessary staff in place following the reform. I trust, therefore, it will ensure that these funds are actually spent.
Mr President, as other Members have already done, I too would like to express my complete satisfaction that, at the conclusion of the Convention's work on the new Constitutional Treaty for the European Union, it was confirmed that all the effects of the cohesion policies, in terms of identity and Community strategies, would be recognised in the Constitution.
This means that we have to expect some difficulties and delays. They cannot, however, be a pretext for giving up, still less for renationalisation or even a mere resizing of these policies; that would be tantamount to trying to cure a headache by decapitation: I do not think that this is the route to take.
More efficiency and certainly not fewer resources are, therefore, the way forward for effective simplification, Community added-value for all interventions, together with coordination with other policies, beginning with transport and research policies as well as the common agricultural policy, so that the right hand does not deny what the left is doing.
The same should be true for the updated Objective 2, which cannot become a source of indiscriminate compensation, indiscriminately granted to all the regions because of the temptations that I have just mentioned.
To conclude, a few observations regarding the two specific, additional problems that we are facing: as regards the statistical impact, on which much has already been said, I agree with the rapporteur's proposals, but, regarding interventions in regions with structural territorial handicaps - islands and mountain regions - we should not forget that we are talking about structural handicaps.
In this case, cohesion policies should have a definition and objective instruments that are permanent and ongoing, not one offs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first challenge facing the future of regional policy is, of course, that of enlargement.
The disparity in the level of development between the richest and poorest regions will be doubled. We must, therefore, face up to the challenge of cohesion.
In the first place, territorial cohesion is needed to take account of the geographical diversity of the European Union, in order to ensure that all European citizens are treated equally.
Secondly, economic and social cohesion are necessary to ensure that the regions that are currently most vulnerable are not sacrificed on the altar of enlargement.
At stake is whether the people accept the reality of enlargement. The very fabric of our common project is being tested in this way.
A supportive, fair and unitary regional policy must be developed.
It must not be a uniform policy, however. Account needs to be taken of the specific regional situations.
In this regard, it is encouraging that the Convention chose to retain the content of Article 299, paragraph 2 of the treaty on the ultra-peripheral regions and make room for it in the future constitutional treaty.
This is an initial first victory. It has yet to be confirmed by the Heads of State or Government.
There is still a long way to go, and crucial questions remain to be answered.
For example, what importance should be attached to the report published this summer raising the fear that regional policy might be renationalised?
How could better account be taken of the specific situations of regions in the next financial programme?
Lastly, how can the unique and original dimension nature of the ultra-peripheral regions be translated into concrete measures in the next programming period?
Commissioner, we are all currently working towards European integration. The citizens of Europe will assess our success on the basis of the proposals that you draw up in coming months.
For my part, I trust Europe will become socially just and economically competitive. Above all, however, I hope it will become a territorially balanced Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall do no more in this debate than highlight the paradox confronting economic and social cohesion policy, a paradox which, moreover, is very much in evidence in both of the reports under discussion; I congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work.
The truth is that while, on the one hand, enlargement is the greatest challenge which has ever faced this Community policy, it is easy, on the other, to discern a lacklustre and even reluctant political will to address the overwhelming need to revitalise this central plank of European integration.
Instead of revitalising the policy, the talk is sometimes of renationalising it; instead of more resources and more solidarity, national self-interest rears its head.
Despite this atmosphere, however, I have not yet lost hope of seeing visionary and unified political responses such as those given to the great European challenges of achieving the single internal market and Economic and Monetary Union.
Back then, at the time of each of those challenges, the resources dedicated to the economic and social cohesion policy were doubled.
Now, at the time of enlargement, that ambition to deal with the enormous regional inequalities stemming from that enlargement is much needed, not least because cohesion policy will in future also have to confront the lack of cohesion still prevalent in the current fifteen-State European Union.
This lack of cohesion risks becoming even more serious as a result of the dynamics introduced by enlargement and by the probably unfair distribution of its benefits.
It makes perfect sense for the countries which will gain most from enlargement to contribute most to funding European solidarity.
This is yet another hope founded on the stance adopted by the Commission and, in particular, by Commissioner Barnier, who, I am glad to say, has never ceased to believe, come rain or come shine, in the feasibility of an effective European-level economic and social cohesion policy, endowed with a minimum level of financial resources: simpler, less centralised, more effective and with other Community policies making a greater contribution towards the aims of cohesion; a cohesion policy which must improve the way it responds to the needs of island and mountainous regions, sparsely-populated regions and, of course, ultra-peripheral regions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish everyone a pleasant beginning to the working year and let us hope it gets off to a rewarding start.
Hopefully we all realised during the summer that there is life outside Parliament too.
Now is the time, however, to ask ourselves honestly whether current regional policy meets real needs.
I do not believe the policy should continue along the current lines with only minor changes being made.
Parliament has stressed that 0.45% of the Union's GDP should be used to finance this policy.
How on earth, though, did we arrive at precisely that figure?
First we should survey the regions' needs and the most cost-effective means by which those needs may be met.
It is not prudent to commit to any fixed sum in advance.
Obviously, you can pour however much you like into something like this, but is it wise?
Naturally, we still need a responsible EU regional policy.
Is it sensible, however, to share out aid among all the regions with each one getting just a few crumbs, and at enormous administrative cost?
We should consider Britain's proposal that there should only be support for the EU's poorest regions.
In practice this would mean that only the new Member States would receive aid.
Other regional aids would be nationalised, so that EU bureaucracy may be avoided.
I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the current Member States would not lose out under the reform, as, with enlargement, aids will diminish dramatically in any case.
Naturally, the contributions of the present Member States would be reduced by the amount of reduced aids.
Any major change such as this still unfortunately comes up against a brick wall regarding policy.
Politicians' favourite occupation has always been to dole out other people's money.
Funds of money held jointly, however, should be handled even more carefully than our own, as wasting money in any way is always taking it away from the most deprived members of society.
If we are going to make the EU a dynamic area, as we said we would at Lisbon, we should understand that money does not grow on trees, not even in this age of GMOs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we owe it to those who vote for us to act honestly and in accordance with their long-term interests.
Yes, Mr Vatanen, I am afraid that you are right there!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is about nothing less than the future of European cohesion policy after 2006.
My thanks also go to Messrs Mastorakis and PomÃ©s Ruiz for their outstanding work.
Promoting economic and social cohesion must be given top priority, particularly in an enlarged Union.
The discrepancies between richer and poorer regions will be much greater in the Union of 25.
The past has shown, however, how meaningful programmes under European regional policy can make an important contribution to creating similar living conditions.
It is obvious that in the future it is precisely the regions in the acceding countries that will be in receipt of European aid, because it is in regional policy that we actually see Europe in action and catch a glimpse of European solidarity.
As a Member from Saxony, I know what it has been possible to achieve thanks to European solidarity in eastern Germany, in Saxony.
That is why I can only welcome the Commission's talk in the Second progress report of a just settlement for the 18 regions in the current Member States that would be caught by the statistical effect.
I do not need to convince you that just because the regions are calculated to be rich from a statistical point of view does not mean that their structural problems are resolved.
That is why it is not only a just but also a robust solution that needs to be found for the 18 regions concerned.
Special transitional arrangements must make it possible for them to be treated in the future if not as Objective 1 areas then at least as similar to Objective 1 areas and to have their aid administered accordingly.
Only in this way will the funds that they have received hitherto pay dividends in the long term and not prove to have been worthless.
Mr President, I am glad that Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz has noted in his report the special consideration and support needed for Northern Finland and Sweden, where the population density is extremely low and the climate is harsh, and which are a long way from European markets.
Currently these areas have Objective 1 status.
No other parts of Europe are as sparsely populated: they have an average of 4.4 inhabitants per square kilometre.
EU regional policy has contributed to the development effort in these areas by improving competitiveness and encouraging entrepreneurship.
The remoteness of peripheral areas causes high costs for marketing, trade, and transportation of goods and persons.
These factors should be taken into account when determining sufficient support levels.
As a result of the Union's regional level of activities, Northern Finland and Sweden have developed innovative solutions in the fields of eLearning and eHealth, for example.
Northern Finland can also act as an EU gateway to north-west Russia, with access to vast national resources and hence huge potential.
Focusing cohesion policy on competitiveness by fostering economic development is welcome.
However, it should not be forgotten that geographical handicaps often restrain development of the economy, production and hence employment.
Northern parts of Finland and Sweden are in unquestionable need of EU regional support and the structural disadvantages of extremely sparsely populated areas should be recognised independently of GDP.
In addition to the sparsely populated areas, many other areas suffer from exceptionally high unemployment rates and these should also benefit from common initiatives.
If they are not eligible under other Structural Funds they should benefit from the renewed Objective 2 or other similar Community initiatives.
I am very happy to note that Mr Barnier has spoken about an a la carte model for the renewed Objective 2.
This is something which should be emphasised more in future. It is also very much welcomed by the Parliament.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs and I welcome the Commission's second progress report.
The Cohesion Fund is an invaluable tool in helping less well-off Member States catch up, particularly in the development of infrastructure networks and upgrading of water supplies, in order to contribute to the long-term sustainable development of disadvantaged regions.
The enlargement countries will be greatly helped by simplification of the implementation rules.
It is undeniable that there are still marked disparities in existing Member States and I therefore support the proposal for transitional funding arrangements for Community aid in existing Objective 1 areas post-2006.
In my own peripheral Objective 1 region, after a number of years of cohesion funding to my country, the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament recently acknowledged that Third World-standard unsafe water supply existed in communities such as Carraroe in my own constituency.
How could this happen?
Whilst I acknowledge the argument for targeting major projects, when these projects skew funding away from Objective 1 areas, as has happened in my country, some pressure should be put on national governments to recognise their role and duty in the use of cohesion funding for balanced regional development.
I realise this is a domestic issue, but it helps to point out a failure in the existing cohesion policy.
The EUR 80 billion surplus in structural cohesion funding would be better used if it were returned to Member States in order to specifically target the internal imbalances in disadvantaged regions struggling with poor water supply or poor road infrastructure.
It could also fund other essential tools for job creation in areas where our agricultural and fishing industries are struggling to survive.
. (ES) Mr President, there are many values dear to the European Union as a whole.
Solidarity is one of these.
It was thanks to solidarity that the principle of cohesion came to be enshrined in our treaties.
According to this principle it is not possible to take any decision that would reinforce the position of stronger citizens, states or regions at the expense of weaker ones.
This principle of cohesion has gained further relevance in the context of enlargement.
It is worth stating at the outset that the whole House is of the opinion that Objective 1 should remain unchanged, and that regions due to lose Objective 1 status as a result of enlargement should not lose their aid.
If these regions were to be deprived of their aid they would be losing out in order to make aid available to the new Member States.
Nobody wants that to happen.
The statistical effect should not therefore be taken into account so as to retain Objective 1 as it stood.
We must all help to support the incoming countries, in a spirit of solidarity.
We are currently witnessing a very significant change. Commissioner Barnier is well aware of it.
In the draft of the new constitution there are references to economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Consequently the question arises as to whether there will be a territorial policy or not.
To put this another way, it is necessary to consider whether citizens resident in areas of low population density, mountain or island regions, and who therefore experience difficulty in competing with other Europeans on equal terms are to be covered by a Community territorial policy, regardless of their income.
The report I am presenting states that this should be the case. It argues that citizens resident in such areas ought to receive Community aid.
This is indeed significant.
It is important to bear in mind that when a farmer receives support under the common agricultural policy, that farmer is not required to declare his or her income.
Similarly, when a company is awarded aid for research and development it is not required to declare its assets.
It is all quite straightforward.
The policy on research and development is in place, and so is the common agricultural policy.
Aid is granted according to certain regulations.
The same should apply to territories.
It follows that territories should receive aid regardless of whether they are above or below a specific GDP threshold.
I trust this will be the case.
Our report on the preparatory work of the Convention is unambiguous.
In it we state that policy must not be merely economic, dealing with money.
Neither should it be simply a policy on cohesion, intent on avoiding exclusion.
It needs to be a policy on territorial cohesion.
Mountain regions, regions with low population density and island regions must receive specific aid.
I am confident that the Council, the Commission and the Commissioner will heed the report by this House rather than the report by Mr Sapir.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, I should like, first of all, to thank Parliament for this new debate on the future of cohesion policy.
Of course, my thanks go both to your two rapporteurs, Mr Mastorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, to whom I have listened attentively, and to each and every one of you.
A new debate - and it will not be the last - is therefore being held in this House at an extremely important moment, because we are just a few months away from that enlarged, reunified Europe in which - and I say it again - the economic, social and territorial divisions and the inequalities will be even greater than at present.
The Union will have one third as many additional citizens, one third as much additional territory, but only 5 to 6% as much additional wealth.
That is the reality of the enlarged, reunified Europe that will come into being on 1 May next year.
That reality makes it necessary for us to ask ourselves about the policy which we are pursuing at the moment, and which I have the honour to be moving forward together with my colleagues Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Fischler.
We have to evaluate it objectively and lucidly and imagine what it will be like during the new period from 2007 to 2013 or 2011.
The Commission will be presenting its proposals for that period in the context of its third progress report on cohesion, which I am currently in the process of preparing.
Of course, at the same time the Commission has been thinking for some months now about the future financial perspective.
I should like to emphasise, in passing, the spirit in which we are working, and in which I have been working with you for the last four years, a spirit which is inspired by a desire for transparency.
We do not have any hidden agenda.
We do not have any cards up our sleeve when it comes to the Structural Funds for the next period.
Since January 2001 the Commission has adopted and publicly presented - in the first instance before this House - several documents, including the one that is the subject of the report by Mr Mastorakis.
In that second progress report, we set out the facts and figures, and we indicate certain directions for the future, without being so ambitious as to draw up a strategy for the future.
That strategy will be contained in the third progress report on cohesion, which is planned for the end of this year.
Since the forum on cohesion in May 2001, the Commission has been frankly and openly seeking contributions from Parliament and from your committees, but also from local authorities, from associations of elected representatives and from Member States.
We have received many contributions, which are all available, in complete transparency, and are accessible via our website.
It is obvious, then, that we do not reject any proposal, any criticism or any debate.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos mentioned just now the Sapir report, which I have had occasion to refer to somewhat critically, not because I disagree with the diagnosis that it makes of the European situation and of our need to increase our efforts regarding competitiveness, innovation, research and education, but because I disagree with its conclusions, and in particular - as you quite rightly pointed out, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos - with the senseless idea of abolishing the tool of regional policy.
That being the case, I am open to any constructive criticism.
Just now Mrs Scallon herself mentioned a few ideas which I have taken note of.
Cohesion policy is not a sacred cow that we do not have the right to disturb.
On the contrary, over the past two years I have held an ongoing dialogue with Parliament, and in particular with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which will continue to be inspired, for another few weeks, by the work of Mr Luciano Caveri, to whom I paid tribute here yesterday in a different debate, and also with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
All this has resulted in real proposals for reforms.
Moreover, some of those reforms are already being implemented, even before the next programming period begins.
Nevertheless, even though we agree that cohesion policy needs revising, even revising somewhat radically, we do not agree that it should be abolished or renationalised.
I do not want only half a policy on cohesion.
Mr Karas was speaking just now about charity.
Yet cohesion policy, solidarity policy, which is something that Europe can be proud of, and which was one of the best and most practical policies of the European Union, is not a policy of charity.
Nor is it a blank cheque to be sent to the poorest countries and regions.
It is not merely a budgetary or fiscal transfer from one country to another.
This policy is the expression of something else.
It symbolises a certain concept of Europe.
For me, as for many of you, ladies and gentlemen, that concept of Europe consists of more than just a supermarket.
Cohesion policy ought to be symbolic. It is the proof of a community - and that word is important - a community of regions and of States which share with one another, while awaiting the day when it will become, I hope, a political power.
I share the opinion of Mr Markov, who was speaking just now about this concept of Europe. He talked about a real policy serving both the needs of convergence, where convergence is needed, especially in the regions that lag behind the most, and the needs of competitiveness for everyone, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that the regions exist.
Mr President, the effectiveness of this policy has been emphasised by some Members, but it has also been criticised by others.
I should like to thank Mrs Guy-Quint for reminding the House how important it is.
By contrast, I disagree with Mr Korakas, who said that this policy was a failure.
The figures which I have, and which are at your disposal, do not prove that everything is perfect, but this policy has produced results for the four countries involved in cohesion.
The GDP per head of population increased by ten points between 1988 and 2001, thanks to the efforts made by those countries but also thanks to European support.
On the basis of the figures for the Objective 1 regions which have been sent to us by Member States, I see that the average wealth per head of population in those countries increased by six points between 1989 and 2001.
These figures prove that this is a useful policy.
Once again, we need to preserve it while at the same time renewing it.
We must recognise the importance of the fact that the regions are a reality, and that this reality is relevant not only in terms of governance.
In many regions, and particularly in Objective 1 regions, there has been progress in terms of partnership, parity, evaluation, programming and planning.
That is what this cohesion policy brings with it: not just money, but also the modernisation of the way in which we work together and administer our affairs.
This regional reality is also relevant at economic and social level.
Each territory has its own specific needs, and I am often astonished that anyone can deny that evidence.
I should like to explain to Mrs Schroedter, who spoke earlier and called for the definition of a long-term strategy, that all this will lie at the centre of my thoughts and of those of my colleagues when we define our proposals in the third progress report on cohesion.
That is the main political lesson that I should like to draw from the examination of the reports by Mr Mastorakis and Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, in other words the agreement which unites our two institutions on the fundamental ambition of a policy for everyone, a policy that is territorial and visible and which serves the interests of Community priorities.
We do not have the time to go into detail regarding the proposals of your rapporteurs.
I should simply like to mention, briefly, six points which to some extent constitute the backbone of any reform which we might, together, envisage and desire.
First of all there is the priority - which will be confirmed and accentuated - given to regions whose development is lagging behind.
Naturally these least developed regions are concentrated in all the new Member States, but not only in those States.
I should like to say to Mr Berend and to his neighbour Mr Cocilovo, to Mr Markov or to Mrs Wenzel-Perillo, that I shall find a fair, Community-based solution for those regions which will suffer from 'statistical' effects.
At the moment I can envisage an Objective 1a which would respond to the special problems of those regions.
Secondly, there is agreement on the need to support the competitiveness of the regions wherever such support is necessary, with a limited number of themed priorities which are related to, and create a synergistic effect with, the major European objectives set at Lisbon or GÃ¶teborg.
On this subject, since I am talking about competitiveness in all the regions, I should like to say to Mr Duin that the new Objective 2, as I imagine it, will be well-targeted, and properly decentralised, towards the priority objectives of GÃ¶teborg and Lisbon.
In other words, some of you have criticised the 'sprinkling effect' which is still allowed by this aspect of regional policy, on the basis of regulations or policies defined in Berlin.
I believe that this 'sprinkling effect' should be limited, or even abolished, by targeting, in the context of the new Objective 2, if we retain it, the objectives and priorities of Lisbon.
Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, many of you are aware that in developed regions which are not lagging behind in their development, situations may develop which are sometimes, indeed often, extremely serious, sometimes tragic, and sometimes shameful, particularly in poorer areas, as a result of illegal immigration.
This is also true as regards the industrial restructuring linked to the market as a whole, which may have a drastic effect on industrial areas.
It also applies, sometimes, to disasters caused by the weather.
Earlier, Mr FerrÃ¡ndez Lezaun referred, as I myself did yesterday evening, to what is happening in Portugal following the forest fires that have occurred there. It will be necessary to create jobs in those areas which have been entirely destroyed by fire, because, for the people who live there, if there is no forest there is no work.
We are well aware, then, of the need for the European Union to show active solidarity in regions which are not necessarily covered by Objective 1.
A third point on which we agree is the substantial strengthening of cooperation, which is also symbolic of the European Union, particularly as regards cross-border work and projects.
A fourth point which Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz defined in his report concerns the territorial dimension of cohesion policy.
Just now, Mr Pohjamo and Mrs Kauppi gave excellent descriptions of the real situation in the northern regions - which I have actually visited - in Sweden or in Finland.
Mr Santini did the same for mountain regions. Moreover, Mr Santini, it is not necessary to explain to me what the situation is like in the mountains: for twenty years now I have been elected to represent a mountain region.
As for Mr Segni, he spoke about islands.
All this corresponds to the territorial realities in regions which have structural handicaps which mean that, in those regions, the success or even the implementation of Community policies is more difficult than elsewhere.
We must therefore take this fact into account, perhaps in the way that Mr Hatzidakis suggested earlier, or by means of an amendment, by increasing the subsidy rate.
Once again let me say that I am taking all these ideas into account, and in particular the proposals by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz.
I am also aware of the fact that, when the new proposals are being drawn up, I shall have the support, not only of this House, but also of the new European Constitution.
I have had the honour of taking part in the work of the Praesidium of the Convention, and I was very keen on the idea of introducing the concept of territorial cohesion into the European Constitution.
I hope that the Heads of State or Government will retain it.
This concept has just been added to the concept of, and need for, economic and social cohesion, a concept which it also reinforces.
Finally, the last point on which we agree is that there should be a programming, management and control system that is simpler and more effective, so that people do not always call into question, as Mr Virrankoski did just now, the Brussels bureaucracy.
I am well aware of the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that there are undoubtedly bureaucrats and technocracy in Brussels.
However, if you look hard enough you will find bureaucracy in many other places apart from Brussels.
If you find that there are difficulties in implementing the Structural Funds in your regions and in your countries, it is highly likely that the reasons for those difficulties lie partly in Brussels and in the complexities of Brussels.
Yet they are also found in the Berlin regulations which I am responsible for applying.
There are also objective reasons.
I cannot submit accurate figures on the management of the Structural Funds or submit accounts - and accurate accounts at that - to Parliament and the Court of Auditors, unless I have the means of carrying out controls.
You are also well aware, however, that some of the difficulties are due to the complexity of the national management systems.
We can, of course, simplify all that, and on this subject as well I am ready to propose substantial changes, including the submission of new ideas.
Earlier, Mr Bradbourn criticised the idea of the tripartite contract.
It is not a question of bypassing the nation states: the tripartite contract is an idea for bringing together, in the context of regional programming, Brussels, the national capital and the region.
Those are the points on which I am able to signal my agreement, in addition, of course, though the time has not yet come to talk about it in detail, to the budgetary ambition which will make this policy a reality, with a credibility threshold which I have personally set at 0.45% of the Community GDP.
There are many points that have been raised by one person or another, and even if I do not quote all of you, I have carefully taken note of your remarks.
I shall end, therefore, by referring, as Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau and Mr Marques have done, to the special situation in the ultra-peripheral regions.
Here again, I have ensured that the Commission reproduces, in its new Article 326, what is guaranteed under Article 299, and at the same time strengthens it.
I have also noted the concern expressed by Mr Karas and Mr EsclopÃ©, a concern which I share, about services of public interest and the question of whether they really exist, particularly in those regions which are in the greatest difficulty.
Finally, and this is my last word, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have another concern regarding my forthcoming presentation of the third progress report on cohesion: I hope that the debate will get off the ground very quickly, despite the European elections next year and the change in the Commission.
Let us not lose too much time in reaching decisions based on the Commission proposals.
What is at stake here really is very important.
We must try to speed up the timetable so that regions and Member States know fairly quickly where they stand.
If possible, they should be aware of the policies and the rules before the end of the current programming period.
Negotiations with the regions will then be able to start before the end of 2006 and it will be possible to launch the implementation of projects and programmes in each of the regions, particularly in those that are in the greatest difficulty, as soon as the next programming period starts in 2007, and not two years later, which I observed to be the case after Berlin.
We are not there yet, but it is a prospect that I was keen to point out to you.
For the time being, we have to carry on the debate, which is difficult because cohesion policy is being called into question and sometimes condemned.
Personally, I shall never tire of explaining it and defending it in an open and constructive manner while at the same time accepting criticisms and proposals.
In this spirit, I have paid close attention to the conclusions of your two rapporteurs and to the - generally speaking - constructive support shown by Parliament for this policy, a policy which is, and I say it again, one of the best and most practical policies of the European Union. It is not a policy of passive solidarity, but rather a policy of active solidarity which is a credit to the European Union.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
The next item is the report (A5-0263/2003) by Ingo Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between Member States and third countries (COM(2003) 94 - C5-0065/2003 - 2003/0044(COD)).
Mr President, on behalf of Mrs de Palacio, who is, owing to exceptional circumstances, obliged to be absent from Strasbourg and has asked me to stand in for her with regard to Mr Schmitt's report, I should like to give you the Commission's point of view on this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between Member States and third countries.
In November 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Communities issued a historic judgment on international air transport.
This proposal forms an essential part of the follow-up to that judgment.
In eight cases, involving different Member States and brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission, the Court ruled that the Community has jurisdiction in many matters concerning air transport.
The Court ruled that the Member States had acted illegally by negotiating and concluding bilateral agreements independently.
Insofar as the Community and the Member States currently have shared competency regarding air transport, it is up to the Community to take the initiative in international negotiations, and that is normal practice.
That being the case, there is a practical problem.
Member States have between them probably concluded around 2 000 bilateral agreements.
The Commission cannot take on the responsibility of managing all of them.
It is therefore necessary to find a way of now giving the Member States the authorisation to continue some of their negotiations within an acceptable legal framework.
The proposal now before Parliament was designed to enable Member States to carry out that task. The idea is very simple.
Member States will have to inform the Commission and the other Member States of any negotiations being planned, which will enable the Commission to verify that they comply with the measures laid down in Community law and to define, where appropriate, any common interests.
The other Member States will also be able to identify any common difficulties.
Then, once the negotiations have been completed, the Member States will have to notify the Commission of the results, and the Commission will authorise the concluding of the agreement if it complies with Community law and with the Community's transport policy.
Apart from this system, the proposal also obliges Member States not to discriminate so as to guarantee equal treatment for all the airlines of the Community and avoid a situation in which Member States give preference to their own national airlines.
The Court of Justice has clearly indicated that all the airlines established in a Member State should benefit from fair treatment.
There are two aspects which need to be taken into consideration when we examine this proposal.
In accordance with current practice, international negotiations on air transport must be conducted at Community level.
This proposal constitutes a special and unusual authorisation which recognises existing bilateral precedents in air transport. It provides a balance between compliance with Community law and the establishing of a practical system.
Bearing in mind the special nature of this authorisation, it is essential that the activities of Member States should be subject to systematic control before and after the negotiations, so as to avoid any abuse of the system.
Secondly, the Council has examined this proposal and, subject to a few improvements or amendments, it approves it in principle.
In particular it has approved the idea of the prior notification of negotiations, as I mentioned just now, and of the subsequent approval of the results of those negotiations.
Member States have asked for flexibility so as to be able to negotiate with their bilateral partners. As for the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it welcomes the favourable response given by the Council to its proposal, and it hopes that the various stages leading towards the final adoption of that proposal will be completed rapidly.
In the light of the above considerations, I would ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the progress of the action which we have proposed and which I have had this opportunity of describing to you on behalf of Mrs de Palacio.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are actually debating a regulation on the negotiation and conclusion of air service agreements.
This heralds the end of a dispute that has exercised the Commission and the Member States for years, a dispute which unfortunately was not resolved politically at a time when this would still have made sense, but which finally had to be as it were set aside by virtue of a ruling of the European Court of Justice.
In the past, the Member States continued to conclude bilateral air service agreements, which led to the internal market - which we had already made a reality in 1992 - being annulled in the air transport sector, ultimately reducing and restricting the opportunities and possibilities open to the Member States' airlines.
It is therefore logical - and I fully agree with this - for our finally to have a Community agreement between the European Union and the United States, so that, competing as a European continent, we can use the opportunities that the USA has already been using for years in our Member States.
I do not quite follow the Commission's comments and have also made this clear in my report: the Commission referred, no doubt partly out of annoyance and partly out of frustration after years of trying to persuade the Council to give it a negotiating mandate, to illegality, and in so doing it may now have thrown the baby out with the bathwater!
If Commissioner Barnier said that the Council had already more or less accepted that in the future Member States would have to present the results of their bilateral negotiations for approval, then I think we are a long way from what we have discussed so intensively in the past and have also written in the Constitutional Treaty, namely from the principle of subsidiarity.
Even allowing for the annoyance and the exuberance, I certainly cannot go along with the Commission's approach here, that it is now trying to treat the Member States like small children in what is after all an important issue for the national airlines.
I am not disputing the fact that in the future the Community will have to lead the negotiations in certain areas, that is right and proper, not least because of the equivalence that needs to be established.
As you rightly pointed out, however, there are over 2000 national bilateral air service agreements and these air service agreements will have to be developed further, they will have to be maintained and new ones will have to be added to their number.
I think it is right and proper, where there is no obligation and no need for a Community agreement, to leave these in the sovereignty of the Member States.
That these national agreements obviously have to be in accordance with Community law is, as I see it, not in question, but it is unacceptable for the spontaneity and sovereignty of the Member States to be restricted in such a way that, for each agreement, they not only, as it were, have to report that the negotiations have started, but also present the results and have them approved by the Commission.
I will say again very clearly that I have tried to put this in a slightly different way in my report, and I have not gone along with the Commission's proposal, which has been made once again clearly by Commissioner Barnier.
I think that the Commission should restrict itself to those areas where there is a need for the Community to negotiate, and that otherwise the Member States should continue to have the right to negotiate, obviously subject to Community law and the Commission's right, if need be, to intervene.
I am confident, when I say a dispute is drawing to an end, that at the latest at the second reading a solution will be found that is acceptable to the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
Until recently talks were still being held to achieve this, because there is a willingness on all sides to give a little more ground.
The Member States are prepared to accept committing themselves to incorporating certain standard clauses in future air service agreements, and I therefore think that we will be able, despite our still differing starting positions, to settle this in good time to the mutual satisfaction of all parties.
I would like to address one final point, because of course next we will be moving straight on to the vote, and that is Amendment No 17.
This amendment, which unfortunately - and I use the word advisedly - received majority support in the committee, states that the 'polluter pays' principle should play a role in future agreements.
I wish to point out once more that the negotiation of air service agreements is concerned exclusively with which traffic rights are retained and which can be used and I have absolutely no idea what the 'polluter pays' principle is doing in an air service agreement about these traffic rights.
Obviously we can write a great deal in regulations, but anything that does not belong there should be taken out again, because it is irrelevant in this context.
That is why I would earnestly request that when the time comes you do not vote in favour of Amendment No 17.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, my group obviously supports the rapporteur's approach of proceeding gradually, because it is right to do so.
If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he has also swung a little in the direction of the rapporteur, because originally it was still the case that the Commission wanted to say: the Member States will have to terminate all of their air service agreements and we will make new ones.
If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he is falling in with our line, because there are two things that we need to consider: we need to implement the ECJ ruling, and underlying that is also that we need to create fair conditions of competition for our European airlines in relation to third countries.
That is an important task.
But we also need to bear in mind that the airlines need legal certainty.
They need legal certainty in their air service agreements with the countries of the world, and that is why we cannot terminate everything and say that we will stay in a state of flux.
Instead we first need to restrict ourselves to those things for which the Commission has the manpower.
That is why, Mr Barnier, it is right for you also to take the path that the rapporteur has proposed, and proceed on a step-by-step basis.
The most important agreement is the agreement with the USA.
We want a transatlantic market in air transport with reasonable access rules and reasonable competition rules, and I hope that the Commissioner for transport will brief us very soon in the committee on the extent to which preparations for the negotiations with the USA are already in hand and when negotiations will start.
I think that from an economic point of view this is the most important agreement for all of our airlines, whether it be Air France, British Airways or Lufthansa, which is why we need to find a reasonable settlement, and it is also of great significance for competition between them.
I therefore hope that we will make speedy progress here.
Once we have produced such a model for an open, fair airspace with the USA, we will have to ensure, as the rapporteur said, that we apply it to those countries that either already have a similarly liberalised market or are striving to create one.
Allow me to say in closing that, irrespective of this, we also urgently need to talk to Russia, because the Russian conditions for our airlines are fundamentally such that we cannot accept them.
We should therefore proceed cautiously, start with the USA, but not lose sight of Russia.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on this report.
The basis of the discussion that we have had so far is the importance of these bilateral agreements within the aviation sector.
Quite rightly the issue of the United States is being singled out as probably the more important one.
But I would not like us to become obsessed with an agreement with the United States to the detriment of an agreement with the other third countries.
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Japan are all waiting for agreements.
So whilst it is important that we stress the importance of the United States agreement, we should remember that this is a report about relations with other countries, not just the United States.
My concern is that the United States will see this as a golden opportunity to cherry-pick, as they have always done, the best routes into Europe.
It is what the Americans call 'an early harvest', where they get all the goodies and we in the European Union are left with the crumbs off the master's table.
That is why it is important that we have a report that prevents this happening.
We have some concerns with a number of the amendments that have been passed, in particular Amendment No 16, which deletes Article 4.
We also have problems with Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 14.
We agree with Mr Schmitt with regard to Amendment No 17, but this is what happens when you allow the Green Group to hijack transport reports as they have a habit of trying to do.
The 'polluter pays' principle is an important one, but it is not the right approach to a technical decision that comes out of a European Court judgement.
Finally, I would like to say on a personal note, that whilst my group will be supporting Amendment No 4, both the British delegation and I have difficulty in supporting it.
With those provisions that I have outlined, we will support Mr Schmitt's report, but we have reservations on those six amendments and in particular Amendment No 16.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Schmitt for his contribution, which gave guidance on the report on which we will be voting today.
In principle, I think that it is important for us to only regulate on a European level things that actually have added value.
These are things that we really need to organise properly in a European context.
I am therefore very critical of the turn of phrase Mr Schmitt has chosen, and with the direction of this report, which is, I think, doing too much damage to the authority recently obtained by the European Commission with the intervention of the European Court.
I myself would like to see the Commission have ample authority in this area in order to ensure that all bilateral aviation agreements between the EU and third countries are concluded according to the same principle.
This would prevent the unnatural fragmentation of the European aviation market and ensure that the many bilateral agreements are consigned to the scrap heap from now on.
The oldest open skies agreement in Europe, the one between the Netherlands and America, is not covered by this decision as it dates back to 1991 and therefore precedes the setting up of the internal market.
This agreement, however, will not remain tenable if all other similar bilateral agreements are no longer considered permissible.
I remain so critical of some of the amendments in this report, however, that if these are adopted here, I can imagine that the Dutch Government would insist on a new decision by the Court, as a result of which the current arrangements with the United States would be delayed for a couple of years.
I am very worried about Amendment No 13, which allows Member States to disregard a comment from the Commission on bilateral agreements with third countries.
Amendments Nos 2 and 15 permit the monopoly rights of specific airlines to remain unaffected on certain routes.
Furthermore, Amendments Nos 3 and 16 entirely deprive the Commission of the verification procedure which enables it to object to bilateral agreements between the EU Member State and a third country.
Amendment No 5 also gives the Council the power to overrule the Commission by way of the comitology procedure.
Furthermore, Amendments Nos 6 and 7 give Member States the opportunity to allow national interests to play a major role in the conclusion of new bilateral aviation agreements.
The airlines themselves will also be the victims on account of Amendment Nos 4 and 18 as they will be poorly informed about any new negotiations or the transparency of what has been agreed.
In short, I had the feeling that we would have to put up with the decision of the European Court, but it now seems that real, honest, open competition in the European aviation market is not yet so important and that we apparently want to curb this authority.
So I am sorry but I hope that we do not accept the amendments, otherwise I will be compelled to vote against them.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Schmitt, for all his hard work concerning this proposal.
It has been nearly four years since we completed our report on the single market worldwide challenge in Parliament which favoured general support for a transatlantic common aviation area.
I support the granting of a mandate to the Commission to negotiate an open aviation area with the US, replacing the current bilateral agreements and the ownership restrictions which prevent the industry from developing on a global basis.
However, we should not underestimate the difficulties which may arise.
I welcome therefore the Commission's comments on the following points.
Although Mrs Palacio is not here today, I would be grateful for a response in writing.
Firstly I should like to begin by asking the Commissioner for an assurance that current bilateral aviation agreements with third countries will neither be renounced nor frozen for an indefinite period while Community agreements are hammered out.
It is vital that normal business be allowed to continue.
Secondly, can the Commission give us its assurance that during the negotiations it will not be lured by the US negotiators into agreeing, as a first step, to a so-called 'early harvest' which, whilst satisfying the current US negotiating requirements, would make the achievement of full liberalisation much less likely?
Thirdly, how will the Commission address the major issue of the massive cash injection to the US industry of USD 11 billion since 11 September and in addition the Fly America and CRAF programmes with a combined value of USD 775 million?
These schemes distort competition and are incompatible both with existing bilateral regimes and any future liberalisation between Europe and the US.
Fourthly, can the Commissioner also assure us that the airline industry will have a direct role to play in these negotiations, as is the current international practice?
Finally, given that a successful EU-US agreement would be a template for further liberalisation on a global basis, can the Commission assure us that no further mandates will be sought by it until a successful agreement is reached with the United States?
Mr President, further to what a number of Members have already said, I think that it is important to underline that what we are doing today is the start of an important process in which the European Union and the Commission will play an important role in the area of aviation negotiations.
This is, in itself, a significant breakthrough which will also mean that the Commission will now have a mandate to enter into negotiations with the USA, for example, on behalf of the whole of the European Union, and that could be extremely beneficial, but only if this mandate is so clear that the European Union can in fact speak and negotiate with one voice.
We know from other areas how often this turns out to be extremely difficult to do, particularly when we have to do business with the USA.
In the meantime, the Member States must be able to continue to negotiate with bilateral partners, and it is therefore necessary for the internal process in the European Union to be properly organised.
That is why the rapporteur's proposal is in favour of not doing everything at once but concentrating on the United States to begin with, at an initial stage.
The experience gained in this way will naturally come in useful at subsequent stages.
This will also avoid the confusion that would arise if the Commission suddenly had to accept responsibility for all bilateral matters and negotiations or exercise complete control over these.
I support what my colleague Brian Simpson said about this.
It is naturally difficult - that is clear from the amendments - to find a good formula for the role of the Commission on the one hand and the role of the Member States on the other, who naturally also have to take the interests of the aviation industry into account in order to achieve a proper balance in that area.
I do, however, think that it is important for Parliament and the Member States, but also the airlines, to be able to play a role in this process, but also to be able to exercise their influence in the execution of their new rules.
This is a major operation which can create more opportunities for European aviation, but there is also the risk, and I would like to emphasise that, of an outcome that will bring with it undesirable changes and will thus have a deleterious effect on jobs in some countries.
I think that this point about jobs and the interests of our own airlines must remain firmly on the agenda in the process.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time now that I have spoken in an hour - - a rare thing!
Now I can slow down some time in the autumn.
I am glad that at last we are to have a common EU policy on air transport, because the current situation is absolutely idiotic and therefore needs a complete overhaul.
Last year's ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Communities was very positive news.
Before that the United States of America had a real stranglehold on the Member States, owing to bilateral agreements.
The open skies agreements have prevented mergers between our airlines because no flights have been allowed to the United States from any country other than one in which the European airline is registered.
The impossibility of mergers has kept our air services market fragmented, which in turn has nibbled away at our airlines' competitiveness and led to high prices.
Once again the interests of consumers have been eclipsed by the benefits achieved.
Instead of the narrow, national approach, we should realise that national airlines are not an end in themselves but inexpensive and efficiently organised flights are, because the customer, the European, is always right.
That is why we should greet civilised globalisation with open arms in this sector too and harness it for the benefit of our citizens.
The Commission's proposals regarding air service agreements are therefore entirely appropriate.
I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for his thorough and pragmatic approach.
When autumn comes the birds fly to the south.
If we allow airline competition to increase, less well-off Europeans will also be able to fly down with them.
I should like to thank Mr Ari Vatanen for having succeeded, at the end of his speech, in giving a poetical dimension to this discussion.
Naturally I have listened to all of you, and I shall pass on to Mrs de Palacio all your comments. We have also, Mr President, sent to Parliament's Secretariat the Commission's position on each of the proposed amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
The next item is the report (A5-0254/2003) by Mark Watts, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council decision concluding an agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and the People's Republic of China (6049/1/2003 REV1 - COM(2002) 97 - C5-0062/2003 - 2002/0048(CNS)).
.
Mr President, the maritime sector is an important industry and employer in Europe.
40% of EU trade is already by sea or inland waterway.
The vast majority of our trade with the rest of the world is by sea.
Those of us who want to encourage the use of this more environmentally-friendly mode of transport welcome any action that encourages trade by sea.
It is within this context that I, as your rapporteur, welcome the agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and the People's Republic of China.
China is the EU's third largest trading partner outside Europe, which makes the Chinese market particularly important for European shipping interests.
The growth of trade with China constitutes both an important boost to employment and an opportunity to further develop the maritime sector to ensure even more trade is by sea.
In the past decade relations with China have developed in a positive way, particularly in respect of the maritime sector, with the majority of Member States signing bilateral agreements with the Chinese.
The key aim of this proposal is to secure an EU-wide agreement to improve the conditions of maritime cargo transport operations concerning China and the EU.
The agreement therefore applies to international maritime cargo transport on logistic services between the ports in China and the Member States and indeed international maritime cargo transport between the ports of the EU.
For example, as regards the ports and the use of infrastructure, each contracting party shall ensure non-discriminatory treatment of each other's vessels.
The same principle shall apply in relation to fees, charges and customs formalities.
The agreement is concluded for a period of five years and shall be tacitly reviewed on an annual basis.
The agreement will only act as a substitute for the trade provisions of existing bilateral maritime agreements.
I particularly welcome two important features of this agreement.
Firstly, if this agreement is less favourable than the existing bilateral arrangements then the more favourable shall prevail.
Secondly, I am very pleased that the Commission has indicated informally that it will assist companies that suffer discrimination, informally taking up these matters with the Chinese directly and therefore avoiding the potential of lengthy and costly litigation.
I should like to personally thank the Commission for its assistance on that point.
However, as the rapporteur, I have some concerns.
This agreement with China also applies to vessels flying the flags of third countries but owned or operated by a shipping company of China or a Member State of the EU.
In other words, we are potentially giving preferential access to flags of convenience.
In the wake of the Erika and Prestige disasters, we must ask the Commission why the agreement seeks to provide the advantages of unrestricted access and non-discriminatory treatment to European or Chinese ship owners who choose to register their ships in third countries.
I also regret the lack of formal consultation with the social partners, which could have addressed some of these concerns and made the agreement all the more effective.
Consequently I have tabled an amendment asking for the subsequent reviews - the annual reviews I have already referred to - to take this point into account.
The amendment seeks to add a new paragraph 1a to the legislative resolution, which reads: 'Requests that the concerns regarding the recognition of third country flags within the scope of this agreement be evaluated in subsequent renewals.'
The amendment does not seek, in any way, to inhibit any of the benefits for those on all sides of this agreement, but merely seeks to review this potential loophole.
In conclusion, as rapporteur, I welcome this historic EU maritime agreement with the People's Republic of China.
It is a positive step in building ever-closer relations between Europe and China, an important boost for jobs and an important boost for those of us who want to see a renaissance of Europe's maritime trade.
Mr President, Mr Vatanen is worried about having spoken twice in one hour, so what can I say?
Nevertheless, I thank you for your understanding.
For the third time we have changed the subject, and on behalf of the Commission and of Mrs de Palacio, for the same reasons as before, I should like to say that we completely approve, Mr Watts, the report that you have presented on the proposal for a Council decision concluding an agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and its Member States and the People's Republic of China.
Nevertheless, we do have some doubts about the advisability of the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, concerning the need to take into account, on the occasion of future revisions, its concerns about third-country flags in the context of this agreement.
Although we are willing to accept this, as a valuable objective, it must not call into question the Union's maritime foreign policy, which was defined a long time ago.
Ladies and gentlemen, this first agreement between two of the principal actors in the world maritime-transport market is particularly important, as you have reminded us, Mr Watts, not only because of the new economic and commercial outlets which are offered to the undertakings of both parties and the countries of which they are composed, but also because of the clear commitments contained in this agreement with a view to increased maritime cooperation, both at bilateral level and within international organisations such as the IMO or the ILO.
Not only do these commitments relate to the continuation of our efforts in the area of maritime safety: they also provide new opportunities for action in the social field, and in training, as the European mission found when it went to China at the beginning of April to study the training schemes for seafarers and the certification of Chinese sailors.
I should also like to point out that we intend to use this same approach with a view to concluding a maritime agreement with India, another major country in that part of the world.
Mr President, Mr Watts, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the fact that the draft resolution approves the concluding of this agreement, and I hope, on behalf of the Commission, that maritime relations between the European Union and China will be encouraged and successful as a result. Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes and approves the conclusion of the maritime transport agreement between the European Union and its Member States on the one hand and the People's Republic of China on the other.
This agreement is intended to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory treatment of European and Chinese shipping companies in each party's respective ports and thus enable trade between the European Union and China to be carried on even more smoothly.
This is all the more important in view of the fact that the People's Republic of China is now already the European Union's third largest trading partner.
This agreement is important because it not only governs maritime cargo transport, including the intermodal transport associated with it, but also guarantees that wholly-owned subsidiaries can be founded in either State party to this agreement.
Such subsidiaries shall be entitled, among other things, to employ key personnel irrespective of their nationality.
I see this as amounting to a definite gain in terms of legal certainty for our European shipping companies.
You are probably just as well aware as many others among us that we have many agreements and dialogues with China, but that it is the local authorities - and that is what the port authorities are - who sometimes have other ways of doing things.
It is for that reason that it is of quite crucial significance that we should now be concluding an agreement intended to secure non-discriminatory treatment in all Chinese ports for our European shipping companies.
It is, of course, for the Commission to ensure that this agreement is promptly and properly implemented throughout China, and you, Commissioner, and also Vice-President, de Palacio, can perhaps say something about why this is so.
This is particularly the case as regards the non-discriminatory use of port infrastructures and maritime services by European shipping companies in Chinese ports, but it also applies to the case of European shipping companies, who have to pay duties and charges, doing so in the same way as others, without being put at a disadvantage or discriminated against, and as regards customs formalities, which must not handicap our trade and our shipping companies in Chinese ports.
We also appeal to the European shipping companies to come to us and to the Commission if there are problems, so that we can follow them up.
Let me now turn to the amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Watts, the latter of whom and I know each other so well.
This amendment is quite simply superfluous.
In the course of the proceedings in committee, there was some correspondence with the Commission, which said what you, Mr Watts, have yourself confirmed, namely that this is an agreement for Europe's and China's shipping companies.
What flags their ships sail under is a matter for them.
This is a matter of international custom, and so you cannot behave as if European shipping companies' use of the flags of third countries were a crime or something highly dangerous.
The Commission itself has given assurances that it will see to it that European seafarers are not put to any disadvantage by this agreement.
We trust the Commission.
The amendment is superfluous!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
My group supports his work in all its aspects.
It is true that the issue is an important one: half of all trade is, so to speak, on the water.
China is indeed our third largest trading partner outside Europe, and its importance is growing tremendously fast, and up till now there has not been any agreement like this with China.
It will apply to such areas as maritime cargo transport and logistics.
It is very important that this principle of non-discrimination, which the previous speaker also discussed, as did the rapporteur, is now being supported through an agreement which also contains a measure for action to be taken in case of violation.
This principle of non-discrimination is vital for us.
Another important thing is that the agreement enables shipping companies to engage in business activity and establish their own companies, subsidiaries and representative offices.
That is also an important breakthrough.
If a European shipping company feels that it is being discriminated against, it can appeal not just to its own but also to the European Union authorities.
Obviously, this means a different sort of power altogether.
This agreement means our position and our demands will gain strength.
Maritime transport needs a common system of regulation because the sector has become one of cheap labour and despicable, even criminal, activity.
It is precisely for this reason that we need strict controls in the maritime transport sector.
I would also like to ask how the Commissioner intends to deal with the flag of convenience issue when such incidents as that concerning the Prestige or other accidents occur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
The next item is the report (A5-0152/2003) by Bernard Poignant, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending European Parliament and Council Directive 2001/25/EC on the minimum level of training of seafarers (COM(2003) 1 - C5-0006/2003 - 2003/0001(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating recommends establishing a European quality system for third country seafarers with certificates of competency issued outside the Community working on Community ships.
The purpose of this proposal is to ensure that foreign crews working on ships sailing under the flag of a Member State of the Union have been trained and certified in all cases in accordance with international requirements.
The proposal is particularly important if examined in the light of the maritime disasters involving the Erika and the Prestige.
The human factor is a very serious aspect of safety at sea; at the same time, however, it safeguards the marine environment.
Thus, all types of crews serving on Community ships must be adequately trained.
Allow me to comment briefly on the main elements of the proposal.
First, the proposal introduces a harmonised European system for recognising at Community level third country maritime training and certification systems which meet all the requirements of the S?CW Convention, the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for seafarers.
My second point concerns the provision of an efficient procedure for direct action as regards changes to the training and certification system of third countries.
The tactic of monitoring and possibly withdrawing recognition, where there is cause to do so, are two vital elements in the text.
More importantly, the proposal makes provision for the tactic of re-evaluating all recognised countries every five years.
Thirdly, the key to the proposal is the new European Maritime Safety Agency, the expert opinions and professionalism of which will assist the Commission in these vitally important duties.
This new legislative practice will improve the quality and efficiency of the system for recognising seafarers' certificates under a single Community system.
The Ministers for Transport unanimously reached political agreement on this proposal in March.
The examination on the part of the Council allowed us to introduce certain amendments which improve our initial proposal.
For example, the recognition of a third country will remain in force unless there is evidence of non-compliance by that third country, in which case recognition will be withdrawn.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the essence of our proposal, the primary concern of which is to ensure that third country crews are professionally competent.
.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we have to look at this text again in the context of all the rules concerning maritime safety.
It is just one element, one piece of the system of rules for the prevention of accidents at sea.
The Commission's proposal, as the Commissioner has just reminded us, is intended to make things easier, in other words to prevent overlapping and to limit administrative burdens.
I can give you some figures here: the European Union has 120 000 sailors, including sailors of non-Community origin, whose numbers rose from 29 000 in 1983 to 34 500 in 2001.
It is therefore a matter of legitimate concern to ensure that their training is the best possible and that it complies fully with the international convention known as the STCW Code, which is intended to safeguard human life at sea and to improve the protection of the marine environment, as well as to take action against vessels which do not comply with standards and rules on social dumping.
In short, it is an example of the kind of rules that can be applied to globalisation.
The text is concerned with two points.
The first of these simplifies things with regard to the recognition of the training of sailors from third countries.
The report is favourable towards this line, which I can sum up as follows: the initiative used to come from the Member States, whereas from now on it will come from the Commission.
The current procedure is very complicated and time-consuming, and for this reason it needs to be simplified.
The second point is concerned with bringing the text into line with the language requirements of the STCW Convention.
The Commission also supports your proposal to introduce a common language, whether that language is known or learned, in cases where a vessel puts to sea with sailors originating from different countries, so as to ensure that there is dialogue between the vessel and those people on land who are responsible for it.
The competent committee and the committee whose opinion was sought, and which is involved in the drafting of the report, want things to proceed rapidly, rather like what happened in the case of the abolition of single-hulled vessels.
Let us not delay, because we can all remember the double accident - I would even say the triple or quadruple accident - which happened off our coasts, involving the 'Tricolore', the 'Ievoli Sun', the 'Erika' and the 'Prestige'.
Given the fact that we are never entirely protected from accidents, we need to take our decisions rapidly, hence the spirit of compromise which, I believe, prevailed at the informal tripartite meeting on 17 June between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, of which I shall give you a rapid rÃ©sumÃ©.
In Amendments Nos 3, 12, 15 and 17, Parliament had proposed the recognition of individual training institutes.
The Commission told us that it was impossible to inspect them individually, quoting as an example the Philippines, where there are perhaps as many as a hundred.
It is therefore necessary to consider the country as a whole, even if it has only one or two institutes.
We have taken note of this guideline.
Parliament wants to make provision for the introduction of a certificate of compliance so as to reduce fraud to a minimum.
At the meeting, the Commission gave an undertaking - and I believe that we should stick to this line - to propose a draft text on this subject during the course of the year.
That would be the condition on which we would be willing to support your opinion.
Amendment No 10 poses a problem for Member States regarding continuing training, to the extent that such training has to be funded by the sailors' own states and not by the European Union.
We have taken note of this argument.
On the other hand, our committee does not wish to drop Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which are concerned with the upgrading of the occupation of seafarer.
The same thing applies to the quality guarantees and the guarantees preventing fraud.
As far as Amendment No 23 is concerned, which refers to an evaluation report to be submitted after five years, I think that you agree with this proposal.
Our committee was also asked to amend the time limit for the transposition of the legislative provisions in Member States.
We had suggested 12 months, while you are proposing 18 months.
We can take note of this suggestion.
Finally, Amendment No 19 has been amended by the Council, and we are able to accept the new version.

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. (ES) Mr President, I should first explain that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez who has as yet been unable to join us at this sitting.
As the rapporteur rightly reminded us, a series of unfortunate events have taken place at sea.
Such disasters are bound to lead us to review certain aspects of these occupations from the point of view of health and safety at work.
There are implications too for the environment and for every worker's right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity, as provided for by Article 31 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Training of seafarers is crucial to attaining the appropriate safety levels in maritime transport.
It is also vital to accident prevention.
This is an appropriate opportunity to remind the Commission of the need to enhance the status of nautical occupations and make them more attractive to our young people.
This would help achieve a reduction in unemployment and also improve safety levels in maritime transport.
Parliament has long been calling on the Commission and the Council to take action in this regard.
It is certainly the case that the training required within the European Union may not be imparted or may be evaded when seafarers from third countries are recruited for European Union vessels Such individuals are engaged because of the shortage of Community professionals and may well lack the necessary training.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will raise four issues in its opinion. These are the retention of the option of a selective approach to the recognition of aptitude certificates, the introduction of a European certificate of conformity for these certificates, a time limit on extension of recognition and a Community procedure for withdrawal of recognition.
Much good work has been done by Mr Poignant, rapporteur on the content. This has facilitated progress on some of the issues raised.
They must all be retained in the spirit of the changes as ideals for the future. This is in line with the aforementioned Article 31 and also with Article 37 of the Charter.
Both articles are to be enshrined in the European Constitution and will become a binding part of it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the questions already raised by many of the Members in their speeches, starting with the Commissioner, the rapporteur and Mr Ojeda, I believe that this is a proposal for a directive which has technical content but cannot be reduced to just technical points.
I would stress, and the reasons for this have already been emphasised, the importance of being able to recognise the qualifications of seafarers from third countries on the common bases of established qualifications, without fear of fraud; the need to simplify the procedures adopted thus far and turn to account the work of the Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency, overcoming the difficulties and unilateral aspects of the procedures underway relating to individual certificates of capability.
Against the backdrop of these factors and the solutions proposed, which we support - and in doing so pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the conclusions which have, at last, been reached through consultation with the Council and the trialogues held - stands the essential need to reduce by some means the level of human error contributing to risks of disaster, of maritime accidents which, as we know, have taken place in the past.
There is something else, however: we are dealing with the adoption of a proposal for a directive related to the opening up of the market in port services, for example, which is intended to regulate competition opportunities linked to this development too, while rigorously safeguarding the requirements of safety, environmental protection and social protection and, therefore, in this case too, the indispensable requirements of training and professional qualifications for crew members, requirements which must be taken as the basis for authorisation procedures and also for private supply and self-handling measures.
For these reasons, it is of crucial importance to be able to depend on guaranteed minimum qualification requirements for crew members, whatever their country of origin.
For the same reasons, I will make just one last point regarding the proposals that have been illustrated by the rapporteur.
I refer to Amendment No 10, which gives crew members from third countries employed on ships flying the flag of the individual Member States equal conditions of access to qualifications and lifelong training processes.
I believe that we must not waste this opportunity and that we must insist on a solution which I feel to be appropriate, which is that proposed by the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group thanks the rapporteur for this report and supports it.
It is important to pay attention to training.
More and more frequently vessels flying the flag of a Member State are being manned by third country nationals.
This proposal makes it easier to recruit crew members from third countries, and for that reason we have to be very careful here as it could hamper the employment of trained personnel from the European Union.
We must now, therefore, ensure that no untrained people are taken on to do these jobs and that crews have been adequately trained.
That is why I support Amendment No 1, as well as Amendment No 4: issued certificates in particular must be made fraud-proof.
Just imagine a ship which has a crew with fake papers and who perhaps cannot even read those fake papers!
Then there is Amendment No 6 to consider: certificates do have to be made out in several languages because this again makes them easier to check and facilitates the work of the authorities.
Regarding Amendment No 7, we should intervene when countries do not do enough to prevent the falsification of these documents and certificates.
It is a violation of this agreement as far as the state in question is concerned.
It has indeed been noticed that there are countries which do not do enough or do nothing at all about these fake certificates.
That is why this is very important.
Just imagine the Gulf of Finland with 20 metres of pack ice and an untrained crew with no language skills and no help from a Russian icebreaker on a single-hull ship in winter in shorts.
Can this spell anything but disaster?
I hope the Commission will take this matter up with the utmost seriousness.
Mr President, it is as a completion of what is already in place that this report is particularly important.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done.
This revision of an existing regulation for the recognition of seafarers from countries outside the European Union is, in particular, an improvement on the current situation.
The assessment of training by the European Maritime Safety Agency against the training requirements laid down in the IMO treaty, under which approval is given to the third country in question for five years, is a good thing, as it will improve maritime safety in and around European waters enormously.
We are making direct use of the agency that we have just set up.
It is extremely important to think the same things, to have recognisable rules, to have a recognisable language as far as possible.
Many of the accidents at sea are, after all, not only the result of technical defects but are often the result of inattention; human error that could have been avoided if people had been more alert.
Amendments that will allow us to use languages other than English as languages of communication in the maritime world seem to me to be undesirable.
We need to try to follow other examples of uniformity in international language use.
In aviation, for example, English is the right language of communication.
Language was said to have been a problem when the Tricolor sank in the Channel, for example.
One of the causes of the accidents that occurred after the Tricolor sank was a breakdown in communication between an English-speaking captain and the French pilot services.
It is therefore vital that we apply the same recognition in the same language and that we are dealing with the same rules throughout the European Union, and indeed throughout the entire world.
Mr Poignant, I think that it is a very good thing that you have formulated your report in these general terms and it is also in general terms that I will support it.
Mr President, I hope that all my fellow MEPs are paying attention and listening to what is being said, for it is actually very important.
Generally, it is a good idea to do what is stated in the rapporteur's report and simplify the procedures for recognising certificates of competency from third countries.
I nonetheless believe there are a number of things it is important to bear in mind.
Firstly, we must be 100% certain that the certificates to be approved in the EU come from recognised training institutions.
The certificate must be a guarantor of the fact that the seafarer really has in actual fact undergone practical training.
It must not just be a piece of paper printed in any old vending machine in some banana state.
Next, we must take a thorough look at the employment situation within the EU shipping industry.
We must ascertain that satisfactory capacity has been built up in the training area so that we have the opportunity to offer basic and ongoing training to our seafarers.
We must also be able to guarantee that there is no social dumping from outside whereby European seafarers lose their jobs because of wage pressure.
In that connection, it is important for seafarers in the candidate countries quickly to be put on a level with their peers in the present Member States so that they can receive proper wages for their work and so that we can avoid unfair competition.
I shall give an example of the way in which the subject we are discussing might have been significant in my own country.
In the area I come from, a very serious accident occurred in which a ship leaked following a collision with another ship.
It emerged that the crew members could not understand each other's languages and could not therefore communicate.
All in all, a disaster for the whole area.
That is something we could have avoided by means of sensible rules, so I hope my fellow MEPs are paying attention. They are busier, however, having their cosy chats and what not.
That being said, they may well be able to read what is subsequently put down in the Minutes.
Mr President, in the North Sea, along the Flemish coast, people are hard at work clearing the wreck of the Tricolor.
There have been almost sixty accidents this year, something that is almost inexplicable.
Last month we were shocked to hear of no fewer than three serious collisions on the River Schelde to Antwerp.
This is no longer a coincidence.
It is clear that one of the main ways to prevent shipping accidents is to have a well-trained crew.
All steps aimed at improving the quality of crews therefore deserve the support of this Parliament.
My group was extremely satisfied with the speed with which the Commission launched the proposal to create a standard system for the competencies of seafarers.
My group has also urged that an aspect of equal opportunities in terms of career development on board be included in this proposal.
The Commission's proposal must ensure that non-European personnel do not become second-class personnel.
Much has been said about the quality and the social standing of crews and the impact that these factors have on the safety of shipping.
We hope that an assessment report after the adoption of the amendments in the directive in question will clarify the relationship between crew training and the nature and number of shipping accidents.
This could be the first step on the long road towards a truly European flag.
International shipping has been in trouble for decades.
Globalisation has increased pressure on various parts of the sector.
The cost of both building and operating ships has had to come down.
Because of the impact of 'cheap' ships' registers in particular, flag countries in the European Community have revised their package of conditions.
In addition, the Western fleet has had to contend with a declining number of 'indigenous' qualified seafarers.
In order to be able to meet the need for crew, a considerable number of seafarers are being brought in from outside the European Community.
Each country has been handling this separately, resulting in a great deal of duplicated effort and a burden on the official apparatus.
That is why, in principle, we are in favour of this proposal.
Coordinating the recognition of training and the associated certificates of competency centrally is a step in the right direction.
There are, however, a number of things we must not lose sight of.
Firstly, it is important to make proper use of the maritime knowledge and workforce that is available in Europe.
A change to the current arrangements must not result in personnel from outside the European Community excluding labour from the Member States from the market, with all the consequences that brings with it for the recruitment and training of new seafarers in the European Union.
This should be properly taken into account when recognising certificates of competency from a third country.
Secondly, permits should not be the be-all and end-all of the operation.
Training is the work of men and is susceptible to change.
At regular intervals, both before and during the recognition period, it must be determined whether all criteria for the recognition have been met.
If they have not, withdrawal of the licence must follow without mercy.
It seems to me that there is an important role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in this process.
In short, this proposal can eliminate a great deal of superfluous work but we must proceed with caution in enforcing and developing it.
We can therefore support this proposal provided the abovementioned points are adequately covered.
Mr President, the text that we are examining today is in fact directly linked to the fundamental issue of maritime safety, and we should approach it mindful of the recent disasters which have cast a shadow over our coasts and which are clearly linked to issues regarding the inadequate training of crews.
Not only the increasing number, in recent years, of shipwrecks caused by human error, but also the increasing numbers of fatal collisions and of failures to report accidents, reveal both serious shortcomings in crew training and the absence of the basic culture of the very highest level of solidarity between seafarers.
At the present time, our fishermen carry out their work in constant fear of a collision with a merchant vessel.
Such collisions have unfortunately become common along our coasts.
We are also finding, and I am thinking in particular of the case of the 'Cistude', a French fishing vessel ripped apart exactly one year ago by the Norwegian cargo vessel the 'Bow Eagle', that the families of victims of accidents at sea are experiencing difficulties in obtaining compensation for the losses that they have suffered.
In the case that I am thinking of, the failure to report the accident, which resulted in the deaths of several sailors, appears to have been punished by only a short term of imprisonment.
In effect, the recruiting of crews from third countries, which really means recruiting through Manning Agencies, which in some cases are more concerned with charging high levels of commission on the wages of the sailors that they supply to shipping companies than with checking their qualifications, should be regarded as a last resort.
Any real efforts to prevent disasters in which the human factor plays a crucial role must therefore be organised around two main aspects rather than just one.
The first of these is the proactive aspect of the training of crews made up of nationals of Member States of the European Union, before we encourage and facilitate the recruitment of sailors who are nationals of third countries, which is what the present directive tends to do.
We must ask ourselves some serious questions about the real causes of the current shortage of qualified sailors in the Union, and we must draw up a proactive policy in order to correct this negative development.
This is why I believe that Amendments Nos 1 and 2, tabled by the Parliamentary committee concerned, are extremely relevant.
The second aspect of these preventive efforts concerns the absolute necessity of surrounding ourselves with as many guarantees as possible regarding the quality of training, and the effectiveness of that training, when foreign sailors are recruited by vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Union.
Controls applying right up to the level of training institutes would be desirable, even if this is difficult, as Amendments Nos 12 and 15 suggest. A system of ongoing control in order to prevent the provisions of the directive from becoming fixed for a long period of time, as proposed by Amendment No 23, also seems to me to be relevant.
Yet why, in a field which is chiefly concerned with safety, do we want, at any price, to remove responsibility from the Member States?
