I take this opportunity to thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil for the kind words he uttered in my direction.
I add to that that the Commission is extremely pleased that we have settled the matter of the so-called Lamfalussy proposal and that we can now continue with the work ahead.
More to the point, the Commission is of the opinion that this proposal is an important element of the new VAT strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system within the context of the internal market.
It also constitutes a response to the Council calling on the Commission to present proposals for fighting VAT fraud.
The intra-Community market is today seriously affected by organised VAT fraud, where professional fraudsters abuse the exemption mechanism of the VAT system.
Tackling that kind of fraud requires rapid and efficient cooperation between the tax administrations of the different Member States.
But at present the legal framework is too weak to support really effective cooperation, essentially because it is vague, over-centralised and the exchange of information is not sufficiently intensive.
In addition, cooperation is complicated owing to the existence of two legal instruments in this area with different scopes and different rules.
This proposal sets up one single legal framework merging, for VAT purposes, the regulation and the directive, and modifies the current arrangements in three ways: firstly, the proposal lays down clear and binding rules governing administrative cooperation between Member States, for example, for the presence of foreign officials during controls, or for organising multilateral controls; secondly, the proposal devolves cooperation and provides for more direct contacts between tax inspectors of different Member States.
This is also a point which Mrs Kauppi drew to our attention.
She said that when French and Spanish controllers - for example - in a border area want to communicate, at the moment this communication has to pass via Madrid and Paris.
It is obvious that direct communication between inspection staff will make cooperation faster and more effective.
Thirdly, the proposal aims to intensify the exchange of information between tax administrations in order to combat fraud more effectively.
I am very pleased that this proposal gets the support of all speakers this evening, except for Mrs Doyle, whom I can no longer convince, since she is no longer here.
The Commission is extremely pleased with this support. I would therefore like to particularly welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur, Mrs. Kauppi.
But given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council, and given the Commission' s strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board, as much as possible, during the negotiations in the Council.
However I fear it will not be possible to take some of these amendments fully into account.
In particular, as regards the issue of electronic communication, I would like to stress that much of the information covered by this regulation is not available in electronic format, and therefore, in practice, cannot be exchanged by electronic means.
As regards the translations, I share the argument according to which Member States should strive as far as possible to waive a translation.
But the Commission takes the view that the arrangements under which Member States should waive translations should be determined in an implementing regulation, binding for all Member States, and not individually by each Member State.
Finally, as concerns data protection, the Commission takes the view that if Directive 95/46/EC is fully applied, fraudsters would be informed that they are under suspicion, and consequently it is to be expected that they would transfer their fraudulent activity and would dispose of the evidence of fraud.
That would seriously hamper the fight against VAT fraud.
I am personally confident that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues.
The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail.
It will do its best to achieve an agreement as soon as possible, and we are making good headway.
But your support of the proposal is important to achieve that much desired result.
I would therefore recommend this proposal most warmly for Parliament's approval. I thank Parliament for its most constructive intervention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
State aid
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2002) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission' s ninth survey on state aid in the European Union (COM(2001) 403 - C5-0632/2001 - 2001/2269(COS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, today the world's eyes - or let us rather say, the eyes of Europe - were again upon you and what you were doing, although you were dealing with matters different from those which we are dealing with here tonight, which do not appear to be that interesting.
However, I have just heard that I am permitted to speak for eight minutes, as my group is not especially interested in the subject.
I see, though, that Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen are here, and so we can, anyway, give a repeat of our performance in committee, swapping our positions on this issue.
But, joking aside ...
We have jointly - and ambitiously - resolved that the European Union is to become the world's most competitive region within the next ten years.
If the European Union wants to be the world's most competitive region, that means that its enterprises must be the most competitive enterprises in the world.
It also means that we need the European Union's ambience to be both favourable to competition and capable of handling it.
Thus far, it is right that our task should be to roll back state aid to enterprises as far as possible, and our task must also be - if we actually have to grant aid at all - to direct it increasingly towards horizontal goals.
To that extent, the perceptible decline in aid between 1997 and 1999 is to be welcomed - and that is the period under consideration, the period covered by the Commission's ninth aid report.
We still, of course, call on the Commission to perform its role as a guard against aid that distorts competition.
On the other hand, we should desist from seeing aid policy only through lenses coloured by ideology, and from engaging in it from one ideological standpoint or another.
Some of us do that from time to time in this House, and I will give an example of it later.
Whether we like it or not, it is a matter of fact that aid is a tool of state policy, because it is used for incentives to facilitate control in line with the market and because it can be used to avoid the need for intervention in the form of instructions or prohibitions.
That cannot always be done.
It is sometimes more appropriate to achieve something by means of legal regulations, but also sometimes just as practical to do it by means of control in line with the market.
Aid has a vital place among the political instruments, as it can be used to correct failings in the market and reduce differences in standards of living between regions of the European Union.
What we are doing with European regional and structural policy is, indeed, also aid, albeit not of the State variety that we want to discuss this evening, and those policies are political instruments in supporting SMEs, environmental protection, research and development.
Let me say, Commissioner, that I welcome the fact that you, or the Commission, now have, in addition to the register of aid systems, which has now come into being, the State Aid Scoreboard.
That was something called for by all groups in Parliament.
This State Aid Scoreboard, which is in its earliest stages, can, in my view, be developed into an instrument which will make it possible to discern trends and assess aid by reference to qualitative criteria - the qualitative criteria to which I have just referred.
That, then, is something I value.
It is not only the quantity of state aid that should be comprehensively assessed; we also need qualitative criteria and objectives that have to be taken equally into account.
As I have said, I have named them.
Sometimes they justify control measures with time limits, and even existing market distortions can be removed in the medium term by the use of aid.
I believe that the Commission has a far more broad and open mind - with apologies to Mr Evans, and Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen - than has the present conservative-liberal majority in this House.
I have noted that, in general debates, there is always full-bodied rejection of aid as if it were quite simply a snare of the devil.
The politicians in the field, should one ask them, take quite different views of certain points. In reality, they too want nothing to do with its general disparagement.
Let me now give you the example I mentioned earlier. The Commission has, fortunately, been investigating for some time the extent to which sleights-of-hand in the taxation of businesses are being used to obtain illicit aid.
The Commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so, but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it.
In committee, I formulated a passage in my draft report which the Commission, remarkably, emphatically supports, and along the lines of which it intends to go forward.
When a vote was taken, the majority in committee cut out this passage.
Now, I will be giving you the opportunity to make good this error tomorrow.
My group will be reinserting this passage, and a couple of others as well, by means of an amendment.
Do please remember that this is common policy on which we have agreed.
So, tomorrow, you can make good the committee's error, or, alternatively, make it clear in public that that is not how you see the details of aid policy.
You will have to do some thinking about that.
I want to wind up by saying that too much praise for the Commission is not such a good thing.
Let us cut back on it a little.
So I would like to refer, Commissioner, to something I touched on once or twice in committee.
It also has to do with the subject of qualitative criteria, qualitative and quantitative assessment.
That is the area, as you will rightly observe, of regional aid granted by the Member States, which makes up a very large part of the aid total, well above half, I think about 56% or more if I remember rightly.
You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved.
That is, though, rather a generalised way of looking at things, and I would again recommend that you think a bit about whether it is not perhaps the area of regional aid in which we have very definitely to be guided by qualitative criteria.
If we were to have a debate on that next year, that would represent some small progress.
Madam President, I should like to challenge some of the assertions that have been made by Mr Rapkay.
Firstly, there is very much more that unites us on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs than you would think from some of the assertions he has just made.
We can see that from the report that we are considering.
There are 22 paragraphs in this report.
Mr Rapkay had only six areas where his report was significantly amended.
We have six amendments to consider tomorrow.
Let us look at the things that unite us.
I certainly do not believe that state aid is the work of the devil.
In a sense that was excessive rhetoric on the part of Mr Rapkay.
We actually both believe in a competitive Europe.
We are in favour of making our economy competition-friendly.
Mr Rapkay's excellent report - which I will support in its current form tomorrow - is a consistent report building on the one produced by the committee last year.
Of course there will be some differences of emphasis between us.
We do not all share the same political outlook.
But there is a trend in relation to the views that have been forward by the Economic Committee which are at the core of Mr Rapkay's report and for which I congratulate him.
Yes, I certainly believe in the rigorous application of state aid.
I congratulate Commissioner Monti for the stance that he has taken in this area. It is something that broadly reflects the position of our Economic Committee.
Our committee is committed to taking forward the Lisbon process.
Building a competitive Europe must be a part of that, so it is important that we have proper state aid control.
Part of that is through the transparency that comes from the State Aid Scoreboard, of which Mr Rapkay has been a keen exponent.
He has raised the issue consistently.
We are delighted that Commissioner Monti has made progress in this area.
There is more work to be done in developing the scoreboard.
I am not absolutely sure that the Competition DG competition is at the front of the queue in terms of the Internet-friendly nature of its particular website. I am absolutely confident that more progress will be made.
I went on to the Internet the other day to find out about the Competition Day that is coming up. It was not a particularly friendly site to deal with.
I should like to mention the Steel Aid Code.
I have consistently said to Commissioner Monti that the industry is looking for guidance here.
We want the current regime to stay in place in some format.
I hope that Commissioner Monti will feel after mature reflection that, given the difficulties with the United States of America, that is something he could support.
Madam President, as Mr Rapkay said, we can talk to each other as we are used to doing now that we are gathered 'in the bosom of our family' .
I would first of all say thank you again to Mr Monti for the great efforts he has made in this area, and I would also thank Mr Rapkay very much.
We do not always agree, but I am very pleased with the report, even if there are a number of things we have to discuss regarding how we are to vote tomorrow.
There are also a couple of practical matters I should like to comment on, first of all a matter on which I myself have done some work, namely the Commission' s proposal concerning the shipyards package.
We had a debate on this here in Parliament last autumn.
I was very much against the proposed aid to shipyards, and I therefore want to ask the Commission how this matter is progressing.
I was delighted to note that, at the Council meeting of Trade and Industry Ministers at the beginning of December, it was impossible to obtain the necessary majority for adopting the Commission' s proposal.
The Commission was not immediately willing to alter its proposal, which was based upon the results worked out in what is known as the TBR report, drawn up by the Commission every six months.
Naturally, I am concerned that the Commission' s next TBR report will conveniently demonstrate that we need aid for more types of ship than those cited in the Commission' s original proposal.
I would therefore ask Commissioner Monti to answer the following question: is there a new TBR report on the way from the Commission and, if so, can the Commissioner then inform us as to what conclusions are to be drawn by it?
Tomorrow, we in Parliament will vote on a proposal we did not have time to discuss before the vote.
It is most certainly a proposal that does not fall within your area, Mr Monti, for it concerns the fact that, quite extraordinarily, the airlines have been allowed to retain airport arrival and departure times which, under normal rules, they have made too little use of to be permitted to retain.
We are, then, preparing special legislation which we are now rushing through and which will, of course, mean that smaller airlines that wish to enter the market with competitive prices will not be allowed to offer this service to us as consumers, who shall instead have to put up with airlines which do not deliver the goods and which - when they do deliver them - only do so at unduly high prices.
That is also the reality where state aid is concerned, for it largely favours the old national companies with their monopolies.
For me, that is an example of the way in which our fine words about cutting back on state aid are all too infrequently followed up by firm and practical action.
I would therefore also permit myself to ask you a question, Mr Monti. How does this proposal fit in with our general desire to cut back on state aid and create a situation in which we can all compete fairly and on an equal basis?
Madam President, Commissioner, I have no hesitation in adding to those words of thanks that have gone to Commissioner Monti and Mr Rapkay, as rapporteur.
State aid granted on a large scale, often for shortsighted reasons, has for a long time been a strain on the purse of the European taxpayer and has slowed down the reorganisation of the economic structures of our Member States.
Although aid granted by Member States might be justified in particularly exceptional circumstances, large amounts of aid and various tax concessions distort competition and go against the principles of the single market.
For that reason, reductions in state aid and effective monitoring strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy and thus boost economic growth and the creation of jobs.
At the Stockholm European Council the Member States renewed their commitment to reduce state aid as a proportion of GNP.
There was also a promise to redirect state aid to horizontal objectives that benefited the Union as a whole.
This commitment must be kept to.
According to the general survey we are now dealing with, a decline in state aid was achieved in the period 1997 - 1999.
We cannot, however, be satisfied with the progress made up to the present day.
We in Parliament have time and time again called for action that would guarantee greater transparency in this area.
The Member States still do not have any monitoring instrument that can be compared to the state agency monitoring that is conducted at Community level.
Data on state aid is still provided only in the form of total sums.
To make an accurate analysis possible we need more detailed information on the use aid is put to and the sectors and companies that receive aid.
Like many of my colleagues before me, I also take a very positive view of the Commission' s announcement that a state aid register and scoreboard is to be introduced.
I also urge the Commission to continue with its earlier policy of reorganising the Union' s economic and production structures, especially with regard to sector- and case-specific state aid.
In this respect I agree fully with what my colleague, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, said about the shipbuilding industry, which is also a major sector from the point of view of Finland, my country.
There has been good progress made recently in that area by the Council.
If Europe is to become the world' s most competitive economic area, it will mean giving up the practices of old.
It is clear, however, that new and permanent jobs will not be created by trying to maintain dilapidated structures.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, particularly Mr Rapkay, who has tabled this excellent motion for a resolution.
I greatly welcome the support pledged by the committee with this report for a rigorous state aid control policy.
Listening to this brief but interesting debate, I believe I can see a wide consensus, as, moreover, has been pointed out, between the different parties represented in Parliament.
I believe I can also see a non-ideological approach, and I feel that the more we succeed in producing information tools, the more we will be able to move away from reasoning solely in terms of ideologies and place ourselves in a position to assess the qualitative as well as the quantitative aspects of state aid.
I welcome the fact that the committee calls on Member States to live up to the commitment they entered into at the Stockholm European Council, which Mrs Kauppi has just mentioned, to reduce state aid as a proportion of GDP.
Despite the positive developments of recent years, I too feel that there is still room for further reduction of state aid in the Member States.
I essentially agree that a careful reassessment of the relationship between regional policy and competition policy must be carried out for the period after 2006.
I also share the concern expressed in the motion for a resolution regarding returning regional policy to national control, given that some of the economically stronger Member States are arguing that a reduction in Structural Funds expenditure should be offset by greater tolerance with regard to national aid.
I see this as an extremely worrying trend.
I am very pleased with the positive reaction of the committee and the Rapkay report to two instruments which might not yet be as user-friendly as we would like. For our part, we will endeavour to constantly improve the State Aid Scoreboard and the state aid register now available on the Internet.
There is no longer any need for me to describe these two instruments - you are quite familiar with them - and from now on the scoreboard, in particular, will make it possible to share useful information through Internet connections with the Member States and, with the introduction of the second edition, with the European Parliament as well.
What is more, the state aid register supplements the scoreboard, providing more detailed information in a less aggregate form on each case of aid, specifying the sectors and businesses concerned.
Concerning the steel industry, may I remind Parliament that the Commission has already expressed its intention that strict rules on state aids to this sector be maintained after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.
The European Parliament, Member States, the ECSC Consultative Committee, as well as steel companies and their associations, have also requested strict rules for state aids to the steel industry.
The Commission considers that this objective may be attained by focusing on the types of state aid that, from the experience of the past and taking into account the features of the steel industry, have most distortive effects on competition in this sector.
This is the case of investment aid and rescue and restructuring aid.
It is the Commission's intention to continue the current prohibition of these types of aid after the expiry of the Treaty on 23 July 2002 and this point is planned for discussion in the Commission very soon.
Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen mentioned shipbuilding, and your interest in this does not surprise me entirely.
You are well aware what the conclusions or the non-conclusions were in the Industry Council in December.
Indeed, a report is being produced concerning the situation of another market segment, for which a procedure has been started.
I have nothing new to report on this.
On airlines, I would just like to point out that the Commission has decided, concerning the events of 11 September, that indeed they were of an exceptional nature in the sense of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty.
This means that state aid to make good damage caused can be accepted - though as you know, this has been applied by the Commission in a very stringent and cautious and restrictive manner - concerning the four days following 11 September, as a result of the closure of US air space, and measures to cover the excess costs of insurance in air transport for one month or if needed to the end of the year.
Finally, let me once again stress how grateful the Commission is for the interest of Parliament in the state aid policy.
This encourages us to act more and more effectively in this delicate and important area.
Madam President, they could not fly for four days after 11 September and now they want to have a monopoly for more than a year.
Everything can be blamed on 11 September.
Please give us a free economy.
I understand Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen as saying "they want".
So far as I am aware, this is not a Commission position or decision, even though my colleague Mrs de Palacio is the Commissioner responsible in this area.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Monitoring of BSE
The next item is the report (A5-0467/2001) by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the follow-up to the BSE crisis with regard to public health and food safety (2000/2321(INI)).
Madam President, allow me to begin by thanking everyone who has helped with this report: MEPs from other political groups - especially Mrs Roth-Behrendt, former chairperson of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on BSE - together with the Commission and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin.
Globalisation increases with every day that passes.
It is a good sign that we are trading more and more across borders.
We need a free flow of goods within the European Union, as well as an ever freer flow of goods in the world.
It is, however, important that this should not lead to our seeing a freer flow of viruses.
Where mad cow disease is concerned, it feels as though the European Union has gone into the free market back to front. First of all, a free market was created, and then we began to investigate whether the rules were adequate for a free market.
In recent years, a number of gratifying measures have been adopted.
For example, we have created the European Food Authority.
Moreover, food legislation has been reviewed, and this will lead to sound legislation once all the legal acts have entered into force.
Experience so far is alarming, however.
A look back shows that many Member States have been poor at complying with the legislation.
It is, then, not only the defective legislation but also inadequate compliance with this that have resulted in the present position.
It is extremely important that we now remedy this and become better at complying with the legislation.
If we consider the connection between these different diseases, we can see that scrapie, which is the oldest TSE disease, was discovered as long as several hundred years ago, while BSE, which attacks bovines, was not discovered until 1986.
We are obviously at a stage where a lot is happening.
Life continues, and so does its negative sides.
We must therefore be prepared for the possibility of constantly discovering new problems.
During the autumn, there was some anxiety that BSE might also be able to attack sheep.
That is presumably the background to Paragraph 11, about the need to monitor sheep, being included in the report.
I believe that its inclusion is a mistake and call upon Members not to vote in favour of it, for it appears that the investigation which was to have been carried out on sheep' s brains was most likely carried out on cows' brains.
Scientists too, of course, make mistakes from time to time.
The problem with BSE is that it is a disease which crosses the species barrier.
This means that there is a risk of people too being infected. We know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a major worry in this context.
I want to point out some of the measures we propose for the future in the report.
First of all, I want to state that, for ethical reasons, ruminants must obviously never be fed with meat meal.
They are not carnivores by nature and nor, therefore, must they be forced to eat meat.
It is, however, sensible - and we return to this in the second report - for primary produce that is suitable for human consumption also perhaps to be used as feed.
The problem is that there is a risk of disease if an animal eats other animals of the same species.
What is termed a cannibalism ban ought therefore to be introduced, prohibiting the feeding of animals with feed produced from animals of the same species.
There is a considerable risk of infection, and there has been little in the way of compliance.
We must therefore probably observe that it will not be possible within the foreseeable future to remove the ban on feeding omnivores with meat meal and bone meal.
In the long term, when there is better compliance, it may perhaps be possible to do so.
Regarding the important issue of sanctions, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Byrne.
If individual Member States do not meet their Treaty obligations, the EU must have powers to intervene by taking measures to guarantee food safety - an issue that we also address in a number of points in the report.
We also believe that the Commission must be able to impose sanctions upon Member States that have not done enough to apply this type of legislation.
It would be particularly interesting to hear the Commissioner' s view on this.
Finally, I want to repeat what I actually stated at the beginning of my speech.
Research is needed within both this and other adjacent areas if we are to be alert to new problems' and diseases' arising.
Diseases of this kind are dangerous to both animals and human beings, and it is incredibly important that we in the EU devote adequate resources to maintaining the fight against them at a high level.
Madam President, Commissioner Byrne, this being the fifteenth year since cases of the disease first appeared, one might think we had done everything necessary and had got a grip on BSE.
When we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were drafting our opinion and yet again pointing out that all Member States should now be carrying out their checks properly, we did think that, well, that has to be re-emphasised.
We could not have guessed that it would become such a live issue, yet we are now learning from Germany, mainly from Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate, that the tests were done carelessly and the checking handed over to private firms which were ill-suited to it.
One can only scratch one's head in bafflement.
One can, of course, tell the Commission to better exercise supervisory control, but one can scarcely demand that any more, as the people at the bottom know just as well what it is all about.
Let us face it, BSE is a dangerous disease, and it is actually scandalous that tests are done only from the age of thirty months.
Most of the animals that end up in the slaughter line have not been tested.
Take Great Britain, where tests are still not being done at all, because animals over 30 months old are not permitted to enter the food chain, even though tests are, of course, necessary in order to establish the incidence of BSE among animals that are not getting into the food chain.
When it comes to the scientists who made a laughing-stock of themselves by examining sheep whose brains then turned out to be those of cattle, we cannot of course say, 'OK, then there is no danger to sheep.'
There is a danger to sheep, so they too have to be tested.
Turning to the circulation of animal bone meal, there are still evidently thousands of tonnes of infected or potentially infected animal bone meal making their way around the world, so that BSE is still spreading further afield and cropping up in places where we had never expected it.
We see here, Commissioner Byrne, that the feed ban is evidently inadequate.
It must be stated where the stuff has to go and how it is to be destroyed.
As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has also made clear, the same applies to feeding with swill and food leftovers, which has, over and over again, brought us foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest when feed contained these in untreated form.
This means that, here too, we can do nothing by means of a ban on its own, but must say where the stuff should go.
If we had voted on the so-called interim report - 'The Handling of Animal By-products' - all of ten years ago, we would, of course, be under far less pressure from BSE, and if we had had it all along, there would have been no BSE.
I would say the same about swill and food leftovers: if we had had proper handling of these food leftovers, there would have been no infection with foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest.
We must reach the stage where one system prescribes this for all countries.
Those who have an economic interest in bringing about the proper handling of animal by-products must be granted licences and punished by their withdrawal if they fail to do what the law prescribes.
Whoever breaks this law must lose his livelihood, because human health in our country is at stake here.
We must be bold in showing this rigour, or else - even in ten years' time - we will still be discussing the recurrence of lapses.
Mr Byrne, I wish to expressly confirm to you that the Commission bears no responsibility for these latest failures.
They are the responsibility of the Member States.
The Commission has also done good work on the drafting of the interim report and on its presentation.
Madam President, I shall try to be brief, but I should like to say to the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, that this report comes at a time when we have the impression that we have reached a standstill in the BSE crisis.
The Member States have, on several occasions, shown how hard they are finding it to manage this crisis.
The European Union must not, therefore, shirk its responsibilities in this matter, particularly with the prospect of the forthcoming enlargement.
It is crucial, today, to better coordinate everyone' s efforts to put an end to this epidemic and to prevent further crises arising in the future.
Our objective is food safety.
We will only be able to achieve this objective by means of better coordination of the policies implemented in each State, and through greater harmonisation of screening procedures and of the fight against the disease.
My group, however, is divided over the measures to be adopted in this field, although I personally fully support the report by Mr Olsson.
On the whole, my colleagues fully support these measures, which must enable us to achieve the objective of food safety.
The differences of opinion concern the approaches to be taken.
This is something I regret, because this obligation to public health must not allow us to relax the rigour to which we have subscribed under the precautionary principle.
The aim is not to pit farmers and environmentalists or farmers and health specialists against one another.
Farmers want to produce and to be able to guarantee the quality of their products; environmentalists, like those responsible for public health, want to contribute to a sustainable development, but everyone' s objectives are, in fact, the same.
Therefore, this obligation to public health does not allow any relaxation of rigour in terms of implementing the precautionary principle and the principle of zero tolerance, respecting the ban on feeding animals with animal meal, and the destruction of existing stocks of such meal.
I can see that our British colleagues are having a hard time and that they would like to find alternatives to destroying the entire national herd, but none of this should allow us to relax the rigor that we want to see in this monitoring of the BSE crisis.
I should like to conclude, Madam President, by reminding you that, in this field, it is crucial that the Commission is able to put a number of sanctions in place and that it ensures that the necessary inspections are made by the Food and Veterinary Office.
Community legislation must be implemented more systematically and must be implemented in all the Member States in the same way.
Sanctions must be followed up and we must be able to guarantee consumers the highest level of safety in order to restore the public' s confidence in their farmers and in their political leaders.
Madam President, the Commissioner is in danger of hearing the same speech many times in different languages.
This is the English version.
I am speaking here on behalf of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, as her father died yesterday and she has had to return home.
I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing sympathy to her.
These are the things I want to say.
First and foremost, we still do not know enough about BSE and about how it is spread.
We certainly do not know enough about its incidence in all the Member States of the Community.
We know that we still have it in the UK and although in the coming year it may be that other Member States have more cases than us, that is not a cause for satisfaction for us, but rather for commiseration with those who are still discovering the full horror of what this may mean for them.
In the UK we have had over a hundred cases of the human form of CJD.
We pray that other Member States will not go through that agony either.
The Commissioner will be entitled to say to us, when we talk about inadequate testing, that the Commission has said time after time that the real truth about BSE was hidden because there was no effective testing.
If this debate does one thing at least, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and others have said, it may impress upon us that the Member States need to be able to do this.
I am glad that Mr Olsson accepts that there is an equality of effectiveness between the way the UK takes out animals at 30 months and the slaughter of affected herds and testing of individual animals before they enter the food chain in other European countries.
I would not want to see any misunderstandings about that.
I believe we need more effective checks for contamination.
There are some late, worrying statistics in the UK and elsewhere about animals born after the checks were put into effect, which are still now showing symptoms of BSE.
There are obvious suspicions about the hoarding of meat and bonemeal and about where and how the testing is effected.
Mr Olsson wants the FBO to be in effect the monitoring agency.
I do not mind that, but I believe that nothing should subtract from the responsibility of the individual Member States to ensure that their testing and external controls are effective and are carried through.
Then there is the question of animal waste to herbivores.
We will be debating this when Mrs Paulsen's report comes back for its chequered second reading.
I would simply say that I am in that party in this House that believes, with Mr Olsson, that we should outlaw the feeding of animal waste of any form to ruminant animals.
It is high time that was done.
Finally, on the issue of sheep, I would just say to Mr Olsson that when we look at that lamentable failure over the testing of what turned out to be cows' brains, all that tells us is that there was incompetence of a grotesque kind.
It does not tell us that we have proof positive that BSE has not jumped species once again and got into the sheep population.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on those things and I apologise for repeating some of the other excellent remarks made in this debate.
Madam President, I welcome the report as it raises many important issues as we work towards a comprehensive and a safe food policy in the EU.
Control of infectious diseases goes hand in hand with proper monitoring.
Close consideration should be given to how infectious diseases are monitored by European Union institutions.
We must likewise question the methods of countries outside the EU and impose stricter import controls like those carried out in Australia and New Zealand.
However, we must remember, if regulations are drawn up, that it is important to impose penalties on Member States which fail to implement EU legislation on feed and foodstuffs, otherwise regulations are not worth the paper they are written on.
I call on Members to let common sense prevail.
Of course we need to test animals for BSE, but let us base the tests on sound scientific practices.
There is no proof that testing animals at 24 months is foolproof.
On the contrary, animals can develop BSE after 24 months.
I have had no satisfactory answers as to what this calculation is based upon.
The 30-month threshold currently imposed seems to be working.
The forecasts are that the UK will be BSE-free by 2005, and this has been achieved using the 30-month threshold.
Meat under 30 months can now be exported from the UK and it is true to say that it has proved to be a safe product for the consumer.
Another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep.
Again I urge caution and call again on sound scientific evidence.
The whole UK flock was nearly wiped out last year because of the discovery of BSE in sheep.
However, luckily someone questioned the validity of the findings and it was then discovered that the test was actually carried out on a cow's brain after all.
This episode did little to restore farmers' confidence in proper scientific research.
We need to develop a comprehensive animal health strategy and ask ourselves what we have learned from BSE.
The main thing, without a doubt, is not to tamper with nature on ethical grounds.
Herbivores must not be made to eat meat or fishmeal.
However, we must now concentrate on the future and work on a policy and strategy to undo the damage to the food chain.
Finally, the farming community has suffered a great blow over the past few years.
Let us work together now towards a food safety policy and a reform of the common agricultural policy which moves us away from a so-called consumer-led policy that led to intensification - but let us not move either to a consumer-led policy based on unfounded theories.
We must regain consumer confidence by producing a policy that will embrace all aspects.
Madam President, infringements of the fundamental principles of food standards law provide a great deal of headline material in many, if not all, of the countries of the European Union.
Although they involved a lot of distortion and scaremongering, reports played a significant role in preventing such occurrences from being forgotten.
The breaches in the investigation of BSE which have become public knowledge in recent days represent setbacks for all those who have campaigned to introduce a high level of consumer health protection in food production, and I think they had had some of those already.
It is precisely the great public interest in this subject, and the apparent avoidability of the most recent instances of human health being put in danger, that justifies the introduction of strict sanctions as asked for by the report, in order to finally stop new cases of BSE flaring up.
The highest standards in food production should apply in the European Union.
Such is the most significant statement in the White Paper on Food Safety.
The legal framework this requires must, as I understand things, be allied to a recognised early warning system through the EU countries, so that suspicion that human health has been endangered will result in the products being designated and their manufacturers named in public.
As a rule, public warnings are always desirable, above all when it is suspected that a product has been widely distributed, which is always the likely case in the never-ending cycle of food production.
It makes sense to me that specific food producers should be publicly named and warned where, in future, there is the mere suspicion of danger through unhygienic production practices or basic materials.
The widely-honoured principle is this: checks on animal feed are the preliminary stages of foodstuffs inspection.
The report's demands are indeed far-reaching.
Practical experience will show whether breach of a specific duty by the withholding of information should have the same consequence as fraud against the financial interest of the European Community.
The whole importance of the report lies in the necessity of referring again and again to the need to abide by existing prohibitions and instructions.
I wish to observe in conclusion that Mr Olsson's report is of contemporary relevance and shows close acquaintance with the present situation.
I do not believe that it is a plan of campaign for the next BSE crisis.
Madam President, BSE crystallises the fears and the doubts of both consumers and producers: a considerable fall in the consumption of beef and a more than 20% fall in the price of produce.
Europe, which is largely responsible for this tragic health crisis, must learn the lessons from it, particularly with regard to the failings that have occurred.
Instead of giving the Commission and the Veterinary Office greater powers, it would be better to harmonise the measures that need to be taken and then implement them effectively.
How, for example, is it possible that the list of specific risk material varies from one State to another?
The European Union, the largest consumer of agricultural produce, must impose its requirements for food safety on extra-Community policy. In other words, it must apply to imports similar rules to those that regulate European production.
With regard to research policy, all means must be harnessed: research into the disease, methods of transmission, means of prevention, the updating of tests on living animals, etc.
With regard to waste treatment, how is animal meal stored?
How is it going to be processed?
This crisis also has a major economic and social aspect, with the threat to entire swathes of the farming sector.
The fall in the number of farms clearly illustrates the professional crisis affecting young farmers.
How, indeed, can they contemplate the future with ease if the high-quality products adapted to the new expectations of consumers are not selling?
Other professions lower down the food chain are also affected.
This is true of small butchers and specialist butchers, who refuse to give up their right to remove bones in their shops when they only work with healthy carcasses.
Farmers have already made huge efforts to ensure quality, labelling and traceability, for which they are not always compensated.
Large-scale distribution continues, in fact, to favour cheap meat, even if this means importing from third countries.
If, as we are told, society has opted for quality, it must stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in this process.
It has become crucial to launch information campaigns to reopen dialogue and to finally restore confidence between consumers and producers.
This step is essential to finding a way out of a crisis that is still unfolding.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we must bear in mind at the outset of this evening' s useful and necessary debate on the monitoring of the BSE crisis is the confusion, the distress, the suffering and the fury of farmers, whose possibilities, prices and morale have all been struck by a veritable earthquake that has shaken their world, ruined years of work on breeding and good practices and has caused them to be distrusted by consumers, which they feel is particularly unfair.
We are concerned to see that, in many farming regions, as you know, Madam President, large numbers of still young farmers are leaving the business because, unable to put up with the consequences of a crisis for which they are not responsible any longer, they are forced to stop farming.
In some cases, their despair leads them to take violent action, even to commit suicide.
The Commission, which reacted so badly and so slowly to the outbreak of this crisis, first by denying it and then by playing down its severity, appears today, probably to get itself off the hook, to be prolonging the matter by imposing whole ranges of measures which do nothing to allay consumers' concerns; they risk destabilising the markets and increase the costs of making changes to the industry, whilst at the same time proving itself to be more generous in laying down regulations than in providing money.
The European testing programme for scrapie enters into force this month.
Is this good timing when each test costs as much as a sheep' s carcase and cannot currently distinguish between the prion which causes scrapie, which is harmless to humans, and the prion that causes BSE, which can be transmitted to humans?
Furthermore, Argentinian meat imports have started up again.
Is this really the right time, when some parts of Argentina remain infected with foot-and-mouth disease?
Incidentally, the special purchases programme, set up by the Commission is about to be abolished, on 31 March, and according to Agenda 2000, the intervention mechanism for beef and veal is due to end on 30 June 2002.
I call on the Commission to state unequivocally that these deadlines will be put back, because going ahead with these blows to the beef and veal industry would be like cutting off the oxygen to an injured person who is being resuscitated.
Instead, we feel that at a time when the BSE epidemic is at very different stages in the various Member States, it is the vigilance of the States themselves that provides the bests results.
In the United Kingdom, where the disease originated and which has had 99% of all clinical cases, the measures, which admittedly took a long time to be adopted and an even longer time to be properly implemented, are now bearing fruit.
The number of BSE cases has steadily fallen by 40% per year to reach fewer than 1000 cases last year, whereas in 1992, there were 36 000.
In France, where the epidemic is more recent and where systematic screening over the last eighteen months seemed to initially increase the number of cases, there has been a slight decrease since the end of 2000.
The other countries affected have a lower rate of prevalence and also appear to be in control of the situation.
As you are aware, it is now Japan' s turn to be infected by the epizooty that we have experienced.
In Europe, we must now, therefore, allow the authorities of the Member States to get on with their work so that farmers can regain the total confidence of consumers, whilst, within the Union, resolutely making the necessary efforts to provide real traceability.
Consequently, with regard to France' s maintaining its ban on British animals and meats, the European Court in Luxembourg - the judgment should be read in its entirety - has acknowledged that the ban was largely justified due to the still insufficiently reliable traceability within the industry in the United Kingdom.
It is also crucial to effectively implement, by means of systematic and rigorous inspections, the same quality and safety requirements, in order to provide consumers with the same guarantees for meats imported from third countries as for Community meats.
Item 25 of the draft resolution that has been presented to us makes a timely insistence on the importance of this issue by emphasising the Commission' s responsibility to "ensure that the same safeguards are applied with regard to imports from third countries as apply to Community products, in particular as regards BSE testing, the temporary ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal and the proper removal of specific risk material."
Furthermore, the Commission should also inform us, as well as the Member States, of the results of its inspections.
To sum up, Madam President, consumer confidence, which is crucial if our farmers are going to find new hope, will only fully return when they see that in the European Union, public health protection comes before the dogma of free trade.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Olsson on his work and also on the willingness he has shown in incorporating the suggestions he received from all Members of Parliament into his report.
The report' s explanatory statement gives a perfect account of the BSE crisis from its origins in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.
The 180 000 infected bovine animals in Great Britain, in addition to the 1 325 in the rest of Europe by the year 2000 and the 101 human cases of new variant CJD have raised serious issues about animal feed and have highlighted the far from harmless effect of this feed on the food chain.
Today, fortunately, we can congratulate ourselves on the scientific advances made in discovering the cause of the disease and on the efforts being made by the Commission and the Member States to eradicate it once and for all.
However, there are still some loose ends that need to be tied up in order to complete these investigations and implement the measures that are strictly necessary, because the measures that have been implemented are extremely costly to public and private funds, and for this reason, we must not ask for anything that is unnecessary, even though it costs nothing to ask.
Consequently, I wish to put forward the idea that, until there is scientific evidence to support it, we should neither gratuitously request that the age for obligatory BSE testing be lowered, nor should we ask for the list of risk material to be extended.
It would be a different issue altogether were veterinary scientists to recommend this, but, as things stand, they have not done so.
With regard to conclusion No 27, which calls for a reform of the CAP to tackle this problem, I would say that the CAP deals with a great deal more than food safety alone and that this safety is sufficiently complex to be addressed within the reform of the CAP.
This is well understood by the Commission and hence the White Paper on Food Safety, the European Food Authority and all the legislation on food safety and animal feed that we are revising in this legislative period.
This is the framework in which the technical and regulatory actions to be taken to guarantee food safety in the whole food production chain and not in the CAP are established, although one side-effect of it could be to impact on some aspects of the CAP.
Finally, as has been said on many occasions, we think that if the crisis was not tackled earlier, it was not due to a lack of research, studies or mandatory regulations. It was due to a failure to implement standards and to a breakdown in the appropriate controls for their implementation.
These are areas in which we should have more influence in the future.
Thank you, Madam President. It is beyond me why, after putting so many strict measures in place, we are still fighting BSE.
Due to the unknown incubation period, the measures that have been taken only take effect in the longer term.
It is therefore possible for new cases of the serious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to emerge, against which we are still powerless to do anything.
We have to be very frank about this.
On the other hand, we can also state that, by the compulsory removal of specific risk material, a guarantee is put in place that the carrier of the disease no longer ends up in the food chain.
Since it is no longer permitted to feed cattle animal and bone meal, I expect that, in time, the number of cattle infected with BSE will be relatively small.
At some point, we hope that tests will show that we are at the level we were at prior to the BSE crisis, namely a few cases per annum.
Unfortunately, the testing of cattle for BSE has disastrous side-effects.
If one cow appears to be infected, the entire herd is slaughtered.
However, this makes no sense.
BSE is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease.
Infection is caused through the feed and is passed on down the breeding line. That is why the birth and feed group need to be traced and tested, and not the cattle accidentally sharing the same shed.
It is irresponsible to sacrifice healthy animals to a false sense of consumer confidence.
We went against God' s creation by turning ruminants into cannibals.
We cannot conceal our shortcomings with futile measures. We will once again abuse God' s creation if we slaughter and destroy animals unnecessarily.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is using the Olsson report not only to take up a position on the current BSE situation, but also, in particular, to look into the future.
Our objective is to guarantee food safety, and we will not have reached it as long as our knowledge of this disease is incomplete.
That is why I particularly support the demand for the resources needed for continued research into TSE diseases to be made available by the Commission.
We need to learn more about these diseases and epidemics, which were previously unknown, in order to be able to combat them more effectively.
Society's hysteria, which was particularly marked in Germany, is diminishing.
People are going back to eating meat, and are again buying it cheaply.
There is a need for clarity about who, in the European Union, is to bear the costs of additional impositions such as tests and investigations, and conditions for this must be the same from one Member State to another.
We must, in the same way, see to it that regulations are transposed in the same way in every Member State.
The provisions of the TSE Regulation need to be stringently applied, with tough penalties imposed for disregarding or fraudulently evading them, not only as regards the production and utilisation of animal feeds but also tests, regulations on slaughtering and the disposal of hazardous material.
Animal feed is the target of criticism as much as ever and will continue to be so until we have open declaration and can at last check to ensure that only what is listed on the container is actually in it.
We cannot carry on being driven by fear of fraud, improper treatment and erroneous identification to destroy valuable substances and, apart from that, to import materials or feed from overseas, for example, where we have no influence on their production and composition.
That is why I put working towards openness, ease of control, and truthfulness right at the top of the list, for only by them will we achieve credibility and trustworthiness.
Until that day, the ban on feeding omnivores with meat and bone meal will have to stay in place.
It follows from this, though, that the Commission urgently needs to develop innovative methods of disposal and recycling, such as, for example, the production of biodiesel from tallow or fats.
It must at least be made clear that unprocessed offal, waste water, fat and tallow still have to be treated.
We intend that this report should promote greater awareness and urge the Member States to be unstinting in their efforts to beat this disease.
Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, on his excellent work in compiling this report.
As a farmer myself, and someone who had a beef herd, I can testify to the wholesale damage and destruction that BSE has done - not only to the beef industry in my own country, but also in Member States throughout the Union.
So I welcome his efforts in fighting BSE.
This is a scourge that we must defeat across the whole of Europe.
I welcome any moves that will strengthen the efforts already made in the UK and by the Commission to stamp out BSE.
However, the report also raises some serious questions that are to be addressed if we are to maintain the efforts to improve food safety.
Firstly, I do not believe that the whole-herd slaughter policy has any scientific base for adoption.
BSE is not a contagious disease and cannot be spread between cattle.
As we have seen with foot-and-mouth, to adopt the scatter-gun approach to disease control policy of mass culling does nothing to instil confidence in the consumer and only serves to spread further concern.
In fact, if a farmer has to lose his whole herd for one case of BSE he may be less inclined to declare the animal and may bury it instead.
I ask Commissioner Byrne to review the whole slaughter policy for BSE in the EU.
Secondly, there have recently been worrying cases in the UK of beef being illegally imported from Ireland, which breaches the UK's very strict regulations. In the UK at present we have a scheme in place which prohibits beef over 30 months from entering the food chain.
In one recent case, beef over 30 months from a plant in Cork was shipped illegally for processing and then resale within the UK.
It is a testament to the tough and stringent controls in place in my own country that this particular breach was picked up so quickly and effectively.
But I call on the Commission and other Member States to ensure that their own authorities are as vigilant against this dangerous trade.
Finally, there have been far too many cases of meat containing specified risk material being exported into the United Kingdom.
The growing number of cases and the fact that they come from so many Member States - Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, to name but a few - must be a huge concern for us all.
I am not seeking to apportion blame in any way, but if we wish to see the farming industry - particularly the beef industry - flourish in Europe, we must all shoulder the responsibility to enforce the rules.
What I am calling for is a mood of resilience and an ardour to implement the EU regulations and the tough controls that we have in place, and for us to work together to improve the inspection regimes in all Member States.
I call upon the Commission to take a more robust attitude to the enforcement of this regulation.
We have found in the United Kingdom that the only way to rebuild the beef industry is to rebuild consumer confidence.
We will only do that by guaranteeing the public a safe product that they can trust.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report focuses principally on public health and food safety.
Feeding with infective animal meals or fats is still regarded as the principal trigger for BSE.
It is irresponsible, in view of the experience we had of poor adherence to the ban on feeding ruminants with animal meal, to think at present in terms of lifting the general EU-wide ban on it.
Moreover, consumers would find it incomprehensible.
All animal meals still kept in stock, as well as feed containing them, must be destroyed without delay in order to prevent future cross-contamination of feedingstuffs.
There is a particular and connected danger presented by the animal meals, some of them infective, still stored in other states.
The smallest amounts of this material is sufficient to cause infections, and this is yet another reason not to lift the ban on feeding with it.
Guaranteeing the safety of humans and animals most certainly and fundamentally presupposes a working and stringent system of controls in the Member States.
I welcome the strict prescription of effective tests for BSE in all the Member States, and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months.
The Commission must also intervene in favour of the introduction of the open declaration of all feed ingredients in all nation states.
Even before the Central and Eastern European states accede to the EU, they need to set up working systems alongside our own to oversee the safety of food and feedingstuffs.
There is an especially urgent need for slaughterhouses to be reorganised so that the immediate removal and disposal of hazardous materials in accordance with European directives may be guaranteed.
Imported food must be every bit as safe as that produced in the European Union, and so tests for BSE must now be made obligatory in countries outside the EU.
The safety of food, including that which is imported, is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily.
We must make it our concern.
Madam President, in the previous legislature, this issue was dealt with mainly by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whereas the committee responsible is now the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
This is right and proper, for in this tragedy - a tragedy which is equally great for all - there are in effect two victims, also equally affected: the consumer and the farmer.
I remember the long hours of debate, the on-site inspections carried out at the beginning of the committee of inquiry' s work and then during the work of the supervisory committee monitoring the committee of inquiry, set up because Parliament did not have confidence even in the information provided by the Commission; in effect, it proved to be severely lacking in many areas.
Now we know more than we did then, for the world of science has also provided some answers and clarified the main issues somewhat.
We now know that the bulk of the blame for this tragic affair lies with the State, with the world of politics.
Basically, there are some Member States which have been less diligent in enforcing precautionary rules and, above all, bans, over the past two years.
Other States seem, once again, to have adopted, as in the past, the approach of a conspiracy of silence, in what could be described as an irresponsible attempt to hide and minimise the impact of the tragedy or - at least - the problem.
Already, in the past, precisely this attitude of lack of transparency has caused the most severe damage for farmers, for they were the butt of suspicion, mistrust and discouragement on the part of the consumer.
I therefore feel that the most important part of the Olsson report is precisely its loud call to governments to enforce the rules properly and thereby restore the confidence of the citizens, whether they are consumers or farmers, with an adequate information campaign and, most importantly, with sufficient support not least for those who are the direct victims of the tragedy: the farmers.
Madam President, Commissioner, it is, I believe, beyond dispute that public health and food safety are matters of importance to all of us, producers every bit as much as consumers.
Preventative consumer protection is on everybody's lips, but my understanding of these things leads me to believe that our role as politicians is not to give additional impetus to the emotional discussions that are still being carried on about the ongoing handling of the BSE crisis.
For my part, I do not want to help discussion of matters concerning BSE to slavishly follow the spirit of the age.
In view of current events in Germany, I favour the strictest controls right along the food production chain.
We also, of course, need the toughest sanctions when offences are committed.
In the meantime, I advocate testing for BSE from 24 months.
Now, when can we actually expect science to come up with definite findings on how individual animals get the disease?
I think that when that does come to light, we could say goodbye in no time to the idea of killing off all our livestock.
Until then, going down the road of mass slaughter is only one alternative.
The feeding of omnivores with meat and bone meal will no doubt continue to be prohibited, at that for a variety of reasons.
We will certainly maintain the current ban on feeding with animal meals for as long as the open declaration of feedingstuffs is not made mandatory and for as long as the processing of offal from healthy animals cannot be carried out with any guarantee of safety. I will mention, though, the formulation used in Mr Olsson's report.
He, too, says 'for the foreseeable future' . 'For the foreseeable future' means, for me, that the future may perhaps find us back on a better road ahead.
Let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet.
Processed healthy bone in animal meal is, though, apparently a danger to the omnivore.
Just try making sense of that.
We could take numerous other examples to illustrate this state of affairs.
I take the view that we, bearing as we do political responsibility, have to get back to discussing things in a more matter-of-fact way.
Madam President, we still know very little about BSE, a disease that has shaken the whole European agricultural sector.
We urgently need new research into what causes it and how it spreads.
There is no reliable proof of the quality of the screening process.
The call to lower the age of animals to be tested from thirty months to twenty-four months is hardly relevant. In most cases, the disease is still diagnosed in animals when they start to behave strangely.
The possible connection between calf feed and BSE must be studied.
There has been no clear explanation for recent individual outbreaks of the disease.
It is nevertheless worth supporting the disposal of stocks of bonemeal and tallow.
The disease must not be allowed to spread by accident as a result of contaminated feed.
There must be unambiguous declaration of ingredients in animal feed, and responsible cattle breeders must be able to make the right choice on the basis of reliable information when purchasing animal feed.
The wellbeing and health of animals must be safeguarded.
There can be no transitional periods allowed for new Member States joining the Community with regard to food hygiene and declarations of quality and ingredients, as the new Member States will be joining a real internal market.
The applicant countries must be given technical and financial support in the prevention of the BSE risk.
We have to ensure that the measures will also continue after the enlargement process is over.
A lot was done last year to bring BSE under control and this brought results: for example, consumer confidence in beef is starting to return.
At this stage it is reasonable to remain cool, reinforce the measures that exist, and await the outcome of new studies.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Olsson for his good and critical report, which does a thorough job of highlighting some difficult points.
The common concern of us all is, without any ifs and buts, the maximum possible safety of our food, which, though, should also look good and taste good.
To produce this food, we need farmers, we need agriculture and we need agro-food production.
That is still the case.
It is this fact that prescribes the frame of reference in which we are at present working on this own-initiative report.
The report rightly highlights a series of shortcomings, no doubt the most serious of which is the appreciable difference in the ways Community legislation is implemented in the absence of any common level of protection.
This is where, in my view, the Commission is meant to be able to intervene and should be in a position to do so.
The precautionary principle must be adhered to by any means available.
Current events in Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate show how important responsible controls are.
We must therefore hold fast to the imposition of strict sanctions when binding regulations are not complied with, but I counsel a more cautious approach where a scientific justification has not, to date, been found.
I cannot therefore go along with testing for BSE as early as 24 months, with the ban on feeding with leftover food, even if it has been treated in accordance with contemporary scientific knowledge, and, likewise, the idea of slaughtering the whole stock when a case of BSE occurs, which is something I reject.
There is an urgent need for more research into comprehensive food safety.
We need farmers to be well-trained, good managers, motivated and - which is most important - respected by society, and these farmers need a fair price for what they produce.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Olsson most warmly for taking upon himself the very difficult task of drafting this report.
Ever since the first case of BSE occurred, Parliament has always very closely observed and discussed the steps taken at both European and national level to deal with the crisis.
It is important for us, the farmers right across Europe, that all possible steps should be taken to avoid future food crises.
The precautionary principle, already mentioned by many of my fellow Members, must be adhered to, and the latest medical findings must be taken into account.
One difficulty that has become apparent is that of the marked divergences between Member States in the way they implement EU regulations and the partial absence of details as to how and to what extent Community legislation is being transposed.
I am in good company when I say that, above all, though, much firmer measures must be taken in respect of non-compliance, including the removal of hazardous material.
I do not believe that it is sensible to provide for the reduction to 24 months of the age at which tests are carried out.
I think this would give rise to unjustifiable costs.
Tests should continue to be carried out at 30 months in order to obtain secure results.
I therefore also support those amendments that provide for this.
As I have already said, the greatest protection is offered by proper slaughtering and removal of hazardous material.
Let me make another observation. I really would like to make the point that the common agricultural policy surely already does justice to the objective of food safety even now.
In my opinion, there is no absolute link between the continuing handling of BSE and the treatment of food leftovers.
The BSE crisis was, as we know, triggered by the production of animal meal under improper conditions and the equally improper feeding of it to ruminants.
The problems of recycling should be dealt with in another report.
A second consideration to which we should give attention is that the subject of animals, which are actually omnivorous, should be dealt with elsewhere, in a report of its own and not in this report, which is actually only on the ongoing handling of BSE in ruminants.
Madam President, I am very encouraged by the recommendations in Mr Olsson's report and his support for the Commission's approach in this.
I want to thank him for this report.
His extensive experience in this area is evident from the detail and the high quality of this report, and I thank him for that.
There is too little time available to speak of the recommendations that the Commission can support.
I would like, therefore, to concentrate on those recommendations with which we differ or where there appear to be differences within Parliament itself.
The recommendation to reduce the age of testing of bovines to 24 months is an example of this.
Almost eight million tests were carried out last year on healthy animals aged over 30 months.
The youngest positive case in these animals was aged 41 months.
This suggests that there is no immediate urgency to lower the current age limit.
However, the situation will remain under review.
Another issue where there is some confusion is in relation to the Commission action in cases of poor implementation of BSE measures by the Member States themselves.
I have gone on record repeatedly to the effect that the existing enforcement mechanisms, namely the infringement proceedings, do not have sufficient teeth.
The Commission's intention is to present a proposal to the Council and Parliament shortly on food and feed controls.
This proposal will fundamentally review the inspection systems in the Member States.
In the process it will also propose much stronger action, including stronger sanctions, which many of you have referred to as having been contained in Mr Olsson's report.
The question of financial penalties in the case of fraud or serious malfunctioning of a national control system is being considered in this context.
The incidence of BSE in the Community gives mixed signals.
The total number of cases in 2001, excluding the UK, is likely to be in the region of 1,000 cases. This is more or less double the 482 cases registered in 2000.
However, most of this increase was due to the impact of the generalised testing of healthy and at-risk animals with the newly available rapid tests.
In addition, frankly, Member States that previously were not looking very hard for BSE have now learned their lesson and have hugely improved their surveillance efforts.
Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement in the area of implementation, as the reports of the FVO consistently highlight.
Another continued difficulty is the problem in the Member States in coping with the huge volume of meat and bonemeal which must be destroyed.
The Commission has actively reminded Member States of their obligations to respect Community law in this regard and I would refer to a number of contributions from Members of the House on this matter, and would draw your attention to the fact that there is legislation in place relating to this issue which must be complied with by Member States.
Finally, the continued uncertainty over the possible presence of BSE in sheep is also of concern, and many of you referred to this.
A decision was taken only last week to substantially increase the level of testing for TSEs in sheep.
This will provide a much better picture of the potential problem facing the Community if the presence of BSE in natural conditions is ever confirmed in sheep.
So, I greatly welcome this opportunity to respond to Parliament's initiative in the report.
It is only a little over a year since the most recent crisis peaked.
We have made a lot of progress in the meantime.
At this stage I should summarise the key measures that have been put in place.
First of all, the use of meat and bonemeal in animal feed has been suspended.
Testing for BSE has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-risk and casualty animals over 24 months.
The list of SRMs has been extended, notably to include the vertebral column and the entire intestine of bovines, and mechanically recovered meat from the bones of ruminants has been banned.
There has also been very important progress on the legislative front.
Regulation No 999/2001 on TSEs was finally agreed and entered into force on 1 July 2001.
Very good progress has also been made on the animal by-products proposal, with the question of how to deal with catering wastes as the main obstacle to final agreement.
The agreement also on the open declaration of animal feedingstuffs and on the Food Safety Authority will also greatly strengthen the overall framework in relation to TSEs.
Turning to imports from third countries, there are already a comprehensive series of measures in place under the TSE Regulation and its implementing provisions.
The FAO has undertaken a series of inspection missions in the candidate countries in recent weeks and months.
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay will also be visited shortly.
The reports on these missions are now coming on stream.
It appears that while there has been some progress, further important efforts are still required to achieve full compliance in these countries.
I am very concerned that they should not repeat the mistakes of the Member States in their handling of the BSE problem.
The Commission will be actively calling on the countries concerned to take urgent corrective action.
I also intend to raise the matter in the meeting of the Agriculture Council with the candidate countries scheduled for next month.
Let me conclude by thanking Mr Olsson for his report.
I want to assure Parliament that the Commission's attention remains firmly fixed on TSEs.
I am insistent that there will be no complacency.
I know that Parliament will continue to keep a close eye - rightly - on eradicating this disease.
There were a number of points raised by Members that I would like to refer to.
In the UK there is now testing of all bovines born between August 1996 - the date of MBM ban - and the end of 1997.
The youngest positive test was found at 41 months. That is in respect of eight million tests of healthy animals.
I should emphasise that there is no question ever of lifting the ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants.
That ban is in place and will remain so.
There is no debate concerning that issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Madam President, I should first of all like to thank Commissioner Byrne.
I am delighted that he replied so clearly to my direct question concerning sanctions and that this is an issue which is being dealt with by the Commission.
I am really looking forward to our being able to adopt a position in this House on the Commission' s proposal concerning the way in which the issue is to be handled.
I see this as a major step forward when it comes both to this issue and to the control and inspection of foodstuffs generally.
I can also tell the Commissioner that I share his view of the proposal to reduce the age of animals that are to be tested for BSE to 24 months.
That was not my proposal. Rather, it came from elsewhere.
I shall therefore help vote down this proposal tomorrow, using the same arguments that the Commissioner used.
I want to take the opportunity of thanking you, my fellow MEPs, for all your kind words.
It has been a pleasure to work on this report.
I would, however, emphasise in conclusion that the danger is not over.
As we have seen during 2001, new cases have been discovered in many other countries, not only within the EU but also in the candidate countries, Slovenia and Slovakia, as well as in Japan.
BSE is still a problem.
I share the view expressed by Mr Whitehead concerning the BSE investigation which proved to have been carried out on cows' brains instead of sheep' s brains.
That means that the only thing we know in many of these situations is that we really do not know anything, or that we do not know a sufficient amount.
That is why there is a need for research.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Climate change
The next item is the report (A5-0025/2002) by Mr Moreira da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder (COM(2001) 579 - C5-0019/2002 - 2001/0248(CNS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been waiting for ten years, since the Rio de Janeiro Conference, for this moment to arrive.
It is true that the absence of the United States makes the Kyoto Protocol less universal than we would have liked.
It is also true that the Protocol is less ambitious than originally intended.
Nevertheless, the alternative to this small step would be incomparably worse: without the political agreement reached in Marrakech, we would have to waste another ten years in negotiations on drawing up a new Protocol.
I am, therefore, pleased that tomorrow we will adopt the Kyoto Protocol and we hope that this can enter into force as early as this year.
There is, however, one aspect of the Council decision that concerns me.
I am talking about the alleged desire of Denmark to reopen discussions on the burden sharing agreement, which was approved in 1998.
Such a renegotiation is unjustifiable, unacceptable and would heap ridicule on the European Union' s international standing.
We should remember that, very recently, we censored Russia for attempting to do exactly the same thing.
However, in addition to this environmental message that demands that we act, approving the Kyoto Protocol also sends out other political signals that are worth highlighting.
Firstly, it has proved that it is possible to regulate globalisation.
Secondly, the European Union has demonstrated its capacity for leadership and, in this particular instance, I wish to congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m on the admirable way in which she has exercised this leadership.
Thirdly, it has created a new economic paradigm, the carbon economy.
From now on, the price of a tonne of carbon will be quoted on the markets and carbon dioxide emissions will represent a cost to be reflected in the price of all products.
The winners will be those able to produce the same things using cleaner technologies.
Having assessed the situation, let us now talk about the future.
Between 1990 and 1999 the European Union already achieved a 4% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, the lack of commitment by the vast majority of the Member States is still a matter of serious concern and the situation is very worrying in some sectors, such as transport, in which it is predicted that emissions will increase by 50% in the next ten years.
Given this framework, the community instruments proposed by the Commission are to be praised, specifically the European Climate Change Programme and the directive on emissions trading, on which the European Parliament is due to deliver an opinion within the next six months.
However, although we know what the Community strategy is, what role should the Member States play?
In my view, the Member States must not fall into the easy temptation of only implementing reduction measures that entail low costs in both economic and political terms.
This would basically be an attempt to resolve the problem by cutting emissions in industry and in the energy sector without tackling the transport or civil construction industries.
This option would be environmentally dishonest and economically irrational.
By avoiding applying the policy to some sectors, Member States would not only be wasting an opportunity for technological change but would also run up a much higher reduction bill for the future.
The strategy must, therefore, involve a reorientation of economic polices, internalising the environmental costs of the 'greenhouse effect' in all economic sectors.
This will only be possible if we introduce certain measures that are considered to be consensual, such as the production of renewable energies, energy efficiency and public transport, in addition to clearly unpopular measures such as ending subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, an energy tax and a tax on carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector.
I shall conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups for their cooperation and commitment.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the presentation of his report, and also for his commitment to climate protection in recent years.
I would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, who has done everything to make it possible for us to now discuss in definite terms the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which, we can now, thank God, get to grips with.
Tomorrow we can say only 'Yes' or 'No' to the Kyoto Protocol, but it has taken a great deal of work to give us the chance to say 'Yes' to a comprehensive agreement.
I thank all those who have played a part in this.
The Kyoto Protocol has come in for heavy criticism and will continue to do so.
Most recently, as the rapporteur has mentioned, it is burden sharing on which criticism has again been focused.
I will say here quite openly that burden sharing merits criticism, and that those who say that the burdens are shared unfairly, are right.
No one, though, is reducing too much; all the Member States are reducing too little.
The experts tell us quite unambiguously that, if we want to put a stop to climate change, we must reduce greenhouse gases by 50% worldwide.
The magnitude of the task and the pettiness of the discussions between the Member States about this first step - which is, after all, a very modest one - is shown if we work on the basis that the industrialised countries need to reduce by over 50% in order for the developing countries to have any kind of chance of achieving some sort of prosperity for themselves.
India produces a tonne of CO2 per head of the population, as against the Member States of the European Union with about 10 tonnes on average.
Against such a backdrop it is bad enough that some EU Member States are permitted to increase their emissions, and that the Member States that produce a very great deal of pollution, such as the one from which I come, complain about now having to reduce their emissions by a relatively large amount.
The Kyoto Protocol is only an initial step and must be followed by many others.
We should not, therefore, be small-mindedly discussing the number of places after the decimal point, but energetically striving for a sustainable economy, being careful with resources and saving energy.
Madam President, I also wish to welcome the Commissioner at this late hour.
I cannot help but wonder if it is always the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that meets on Tuesday night during the part-session in Strasbourg or whether we are regarded as some kind of suspect fundamentalist sect that is always placed lowest down on the agenda.
That would be pretty odd, given that we are responsible for one of the most important issues in Parliament, namely that of the environment.
I should like to ask both the President and the Commissioner to look into whether it would be possible to change this, that is to say whether it would be possible at least sometimes to raise the status of environmental issues by debating them in the daytime and not always after nightfall.
I had really intended to begin by parodying a well-known Conservative politician in Sweden who once said that he was not only a Hallander but also a European.
I should like to say, today, that I am not only a proud Gothenburger but also a proud European.
I am proud to be able to say that Parliament has now concluded its debate on the Kyoto Protocol, and I look forward to the Council' s also being able to ratify it in March.
I am particularly proud, however, of having been able to participate in the little delegation that visited the United States last week.
We were given the opportunity of discussing the climate issue with both Congress and the House of Representatives.
I have the sense that there is not only a physical ocean separating the continents but also a mental ocean, given the way in which the United States regards the climate issue and believes it should be handled.
Certainly, the climate issue has now been recognised as a problem in the United States because their own researchers have stated that it is a problem.
However, it is still believed that the solution to this problem is to be found in the United States.
It is this view that most divides us.
The United States regards a global environmental threat as a domestic problem that only concerns Americans, while the European attitude is that the issue should be dealt with jointly.
I therefore wish to thank the Commissioner for having taken such an active role and also thank the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has kept us together and ensured that we have held a common view and position beyond the frontiers of Europe.
We need, in the future, to stick together not only in theory but also in practice.
That cohesion will be put to the test following ratification, as it will also be when, a little later on in the spring, we debate the European Climate Change Programme and emissions trading.
It is just unfortunate that certain members of the Council will feel the need to make a fuss about the way in which the burden is distributed.
It is pretty pathetic that it is Members from a Scandinavian country who will be doing this.
However, there are black sheep everywhere.
Whatever the case, I am pleased that we are able to conclude the debate on the Kyoto Protocol today.
Madam President, Commissioner, as Mr Moreira da Silva reminds us in his report, ten years have passed since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. I hope that in September we can celebrate the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
We will have to consider whether or not these last ten years have been wasted.
Whilst on the one hand we recall how reports, financed mainly by Americans, were falsified during this period to show that climate change did not exist, in the same way that any scientist who insisted on the problems that climate change could cause, was discredited, it is also true to say that public awareness has greatly increased over these ten years.
In other words, we may have wasted time in implementing measures, but the level of public awareness is higher than ever before.
I think that today we are all aware of the significance of the Kyoto Protocol, the meaning of climate change and its associated effects, such as the submergence of islands, the destruction of coastline, the massive displacement of millions of people and the loss of biodiversity.
Therefore, I think that we have made gains on the one hand even if we have suffered losses on the other.
It is also true that, from 1990 to 1999, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in Europe, but it must be said that this is due, to a large extent, to two countries in particular, for very specific reasons.
There are many countries, such as my own, whose greenhouse gas emissions have increased - excessively, to my mind.
Spain' s emissions have increased by 23%, although the possibility that at the next Council of Ministers, according to today' s papers, the Spanish government will decide to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is to be welcomed and is good news.
This is an example that other countries should follow, to be able to reach, in September, the figure of 55 countries needed to ratify the Protocol, which account for over 55% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
I believe, in agreement with some of my fellow Members, that the final result is not as ambitious as expected some years ago, but, as Mr Moreira da Silva also states, the alternative would be much worse.
We have to work to ensure that States ratify the Protocol, but also that they implement specific measures, with the priority of those economic sectors that pollute the most, such as transport.
The rapporteur very clearly states that emissions caused by transport could rise by 50% over the next decade.
Priority measures should be direct action in key economic sectors.
I also agree with Mr Moreira da Silva that the balance that has been achieved should be left alone, for, as many of my fellow Members have already said, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and this Parliament have done some great work and, although it may be modest, the step forward is very significant.
Madam President, the Kyoto Agreement is very important and we can all be satisfied that at long last it is to be adopted.
The EU has shown astonishing powers of leadership in talks on climate change. Without that, the Protocol could not have been saved.
European companies have had to agree to strict measures to try to achieve an 8% reduction by 2012 compared to the 1990 levels.
Our competitors in the United States do not have to withstand this burden, President Bush has stated quite coolly that this way he is protecting American industry and production.
The EU cannot bear the responsibility for the entire world alone.
The USA, Russia and China must all commit themselves to a common aim.
This has been insisted on strongly at WTO talks.
It is not merely a matter of commercial policy but the world we share and our future.
The burden has already been shared within the EU.
Now there is talk of emissions trading.
We cannot let emissions be auctioned off; we have only bad experience of the UMTS and other auctions.
I am especially worried about those industrial sectors and companies that have already made massive investments to reduce emissions.
These responsible companies cannot now be allowed to pick up the bill again.
Surely it is nobody' s intention to force successful and environmentally caring companies out of the market?
The Union' s need for energy is only increasing with economic growth, regardless of the savings made.
To achieve the Kyoto targets we have to continue to save energy and adopt the use of renewable energy sources.
To ensure the supply of basic levels of energy, however, nuclear energy is the only realistic option.
Madam President, it is quite remarkable how Parliament is united across the boundaries of group and nation on this issue, and the Commission and the Council, too, are of the same opinion, that we want to ratify Kyoto.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will see us achieve the greatest possible majority and perhaps even unanimity on this issue.
There is a cultural significance to this, for - if I am right - Europe would be assuming cultural leadership on an important issue for the first time since the Second World War.
In the past, we always followed the Americans, trailing them by five to ten years.
This time, Europe is indeed ahead.
That is something that I welcome.
Only a few, though, are aware of what this ratification signifies.
Signing it takes no time, but putting it into practice is extraordinarily difficult.
Some have already referred to that.
I find it all the more regrettable that, on this issue, we - we, the popularly and directly elected European Parliament - are only being consulted.
This is a great economic upheaval - and we are only being consulted.
That strikes me as extraordinarily regrettable, although I must say that I would still say 'Yes' to Kyoto if Parliament had the right of codecision, and I assume that my fellow Members would do likewise.
I also call to mind the fact that we are acting on the basis of the precautionary principle, which has, in the meantime, found its way into our lawmaking.
Were we not to act, our inaction could, under certain circumstances, lead to us being sued in the European Court of Justice and compelled to ratify Kyoto.
This agreement also has its advantages, for we are putting our industry and ourselves under pressure to develop the most energy-efficient products and processes, and, finally, we are making ourselves competitive, even though I cannot deny that there will also be difficulties for some branches of industry.
Madam President, the European Parliament could have insisted that the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol complied with what is called the assent procedure, whereby this legal instrument could not have been brought into force in the Community without the approval of the European Parliament.
Against certain legal advice, we are now, however, satisfied that our opinion on this matter is being heard, and this is because we have said how important it is to have the Protocol ratified at long last.
Parliament is really doing its utmost now to see that the Kyoto Protocol will be in force when the meeting on sustainable development is held in Johannesburg in September.
That is very important.
I would like to add my thanks to those expressed here both to the rapporteur and the Commissioner.
It is certainly true that this process, which has now ended with the acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol by the Community, will not be the last indication that the European Union can demonstrate a real capacity for global leadership, and can also show its citizens, as the rapporteur stated, that globalisation can also be controlled if proper rules are applied to it.
There has also been talk of the economy in this debate.
It is important to realise that a good number of companies have already become aware of just how much potential there is for business in policies on climate.
We must also have confidence in this and include the United States in the process.
As my colleague, Mr de Roo said in his speech, a large number of companies in the USA wish the United States would become involved in this process.
It may actually be, as my country' s Minister of the Environment has said in this connection, that the USA will become the last open-air museum of the old technology unless it joins in these efforts.
Now we have before us the task of implementing the Kyoto Agreement in practice in the Community.
Thanks go to the Commission for the swiftness with which it proposed a directive on emissions trading as well as a large-scale climate programme just before the Marrakesh Conference.
This spring the European Parliament can now participate with determination in drafting the rules of this directive on emissions trading.
I believe that in this we will be acting with the express purpose of seeing to it that the companies that have already played their part will also receive a reward of some sort, and that all the other companies will also be tempted to join in.
Madam President, Commissioner, as Mr Moreira da Silva stated, on 4 March the Kyoto Protocol will be submitted for ratification to the Environment Council.
I am convinced that the Spanish Presidency is determined to overcome any last-minute difficulties that could arise and that the result will be satisfactory. This will mean that the European Union is taking another step forwards in leading the struggle against climate change.
We have seen once again this evening that the United States is widely criticised for not sharing the level of commitment the Protocol demands.
This puts all EU Member States, and this is particularly true if we are able to get the United States to sit around the negotiating table, in a position of urgent need to fulfil each and every one of the provisions laid down in the Protocol, unless we want to suffer total ridicule and have our reputation in international politics tarnished.
Nevertheless, although achieving the Kyoto objectives will not be easy, it is possible.
This is demonstrated by the data in Mr Moreira da Silva' s resolution.
We must become a society that is poor in carbon and rich in the use of cleaner technologies, taking full advantage of energy efficiency.
We know that the role of the market is crucial to achieving these objectives, but we are still hesitant when it comes to implementing specific measures, above all when we give in to those short-sighted sentiments that still perceive the Kyoto Protocol as an attack on competition and employment when it should be seen, because it can now be seen, that the opposite is the case.
We must act on demand at Community level on aspects such as the internalisation of costs, emissions trading and the exchange of certain policies such as transport, energy or agriculture.
With regard to demand, we must focus on training and motivating some European consumers who are still very apathetic and uninformed in this regard.
I believe that the rapporteur has tabled a proposal that is committed to sustainable development, which is clear and precise in stating exactly where we need to act.
For this reason it deserves, and I think already has, this Parliament' s gratitude and total support.
Thank you, Mr Moreira da Silva.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to say that I welcome the European Parliament' s draft resolution on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol.
I wish first of all to thank Mr Moreira Da Silva for the report and for the fact that it has been possible to resolve this issue of such political importance by means of a vote in Parliament at an early stage.
I also want to take the opportunity to emphasise how much I value the cooperation with the European Parliament concerning the Kyoto Protocol.
Your efforts, including visits to the United States and contacts with parliamentarians in different countries, have been extraordinarily important.
The cooperation we have had during the negotiations, especially under Mr Moreira Da Silva' s leadership, has contributed to our having come as far as this on our home ground.
I also wish to say that I consider it self-evident and very important that Parliament should be fully involved in the work we are now doing on the European Climate Change Programme and on the proposal concerning emissions trading.
For some years, the EU has of course advocated that the Kyoto Protocol should come into force at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg in September of this year.
If it is to be possible to achieve this objective, the EU should set a good example.
Mr Liese and Mr Linkohr are right: even though we can quarrel about the distribution of the burden, this is just a first step if we want to take the climate experts seriously.
It can only be seen as a first cautious step along the road.
I am particularly pleased about Parliament' s support for the proposal' s being adopted as soon as possible so that we can ratify the whole proposal by no later than 1 June, when the Member States have concluded their own national procedures.
I want to comment briefly on what is termed the Danish problem, which is to be regarded as a technical complication.
It is also in terms of a technical problem that we are trying to solve the issue.
At the Council meeting in December, the Environment Ministers agreed that we should try to find such a technical solution and that a decision should be taken during the Council meeting on 4 March.
I hope that this will be possible.
If this decision is adopted at the Environment Council meeting in March, this would be a clear signal that the EU is determined to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, a move that would strengthen the EU' s credibility and leadership role in the matter of combating climate change.
It would also increase the pressure on other parties, for example Japan and Russia, to follow our example.
The prospects for this are fairly good, given the way things look at present, particularly in Japan.
At the same time, we are going to continue the dialogue with the United States and try to convince them to resume the Kyoto negotiations or at least adopt similar measures on a national basis to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
If we are to be credible, we must put our own house in order first.
In plain language, this means that our first priority must be ratification and effective implementation of the Protocol on the part of the EU.
Thank you for your views and for this debate.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Education and training systems
The next item is the report (A5-0017/2002) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission communication on the draft detailed work programme for the follow-up of the report on the concrete objectives of education and training systems (COM(2001) 501 - C5-0601/2001 - 2001/2251(COS)).
Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise the importance of this report, which underlines the fact that the role of education does not consist merely of preparing young people for employment - even if employment also underpins society and is a means of gauging inclusion and economic and social reproduction.
It is generally said that training is about filling in the gaps.
The same applies to education.
What we really need to do here, therefore, is define what these terms actually mean, which is not happening today.
We must, therefore, also discuss the definition of the gaps that we want to fill with our education and training policies.
Definitions of this matter are not unanimous; it could even be said that there is a profusion of definitions and that this very profusion reveals our political leanings and the values that we advocate, individually and collectively.
To my mind, the greatest challenge of this decade is that of social cohesion.
In a world in which everything is going faster and faster and in which speed of movement has become a factor in the generation of wealth, there are increasing numbers of men and women for whom the doors to work, to culture and to knowledge are closed.
I would go so far as to say that exclusion is on the increase and that this trend is harming our various strategies for social cohesion, a concept which we are nevertheless fond of in the European Parliament.
Consequently, the gap is continually increasing between a growing number of European citizens and what I would call the world of money.
This divide illustrates not only the distance between the individual and the market, but also the confusion, the loss of meaning in a collective system within which there are two groups: those who make the rules and those who merely follow them.
We must, therefore, urgently discuss the issue of the continuous assessment of the European social model and of the price that we are prepared to pay to produce this social cohesion, this citizenship.
In this context, we must do everything we can to ensure that the decision of the Lisbon European Council, confirmed by the Stockholm European Council - which, in strategic terms, places economic growth, better employment and greater social cohesion on an equal footing - becomes a reality for all and that finally, everyone, without a single exception, has access both to the social skills required by citizens and the professional skills required by economic producers.
I now call on the Commission to take my suggestion fully into consideration and put in place the necessary policies for social cohesion to no longer be the consequence of other strategies and become a fully-fledged, high-priority approach in order to safeguard public welfare, in other words, the harmonious and dignified development of Europe' s citizens.
Madam President, according to Hegel, culture - that is, philosophy - spreads its wings only at the falling of the dusk, but it is getting on for dawn here!
In any case, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the Martens report, I would like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur on her work. I am not greatly opposed to any of it and would just like to highlight a few particularly important points.
I feel that it is important - as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has also pointed out - that this report should address the issue of education not just in terms of professional training, of the development of skills which will increase our citizens' chances of finding high quality work, but also in terms of more general education, of which school education is part in a wider sense, directing it towards a humanistic culture which - although it does not directly provide professional skills - certainly achieves that task of social cohesion which is our goal.
The same may be said of the report' s focus on equal opportunities for all citizens and the possibility that European Community action might remove those gaps, those divergences and distances which, in our society, still divide those who have skills, who have access to a computer and information technology, for example, from those who are still excluded from this world.
These are the main principles of the Martens report and I feel that Parliament cannot fail to support them.
This is the line taken in both the report' s declarations of principle and its practical recommendations: it focuses especially on the need to root and ground these recommendations in the changes currently taking place in the world of communications and in new teaching methods and, above all, to facilitate the climate and conditions necessary for the need for a higher level of quantity and quality of education for all to be met.
In this respect, all the measures seeking to actively involve teachers, students and trainers in the implementation of the programme are vital.
The emphasis placed on language learning, on strengthening the ties between the world of work and civil society, on the need to find more attractive images to encourage students and teachers' learning and mobility must not, however, mask the practical root of the problem: the need for financing which respects the choices of the individual.
To this framework we need to add a top priority action plan to assess and intervene with appropriate, effective tools in the tensions which can develop in the worlds of education and work where there are cases of discrimination, with the common desire to fight racism and intolerance.
For all these reasons, the Committee on Culture thanks the rapporteur once again for her work and calls upon Parliament to adopt the Martens report.
Madam President, I welcome the report on the Commission communication on the concrete objectives of education and training systems.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her conscientious work.
In line with the goals of the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, it is vitally important that we enable the generation of young Europeans to choose European research careers and European scientific disciplines.
I also agree that companies have to play a key role in training students and employees.
However, before submitting the report we should pay attention to the following points.
There seems to be a gap between the proposals in this report and the progress made by the Commission and its expert group so far.
My understanding is that the Commission has already started its work on social inclusion and reset its goals on the Leonardo da Vinci programme by, for example, including older people and disabled people within its scope.
This is welcome.
We look forward to the European Year of Disability in 2003.
In addition to that, one should not neglect the efforts made by the Commission on cooperation with the candidate countries at all levels.
While not wanting to undermine the good work of the Commission, I must say that more can be done.
We should also underline the importance of encouraging increased integration of European Union, Member States and regional initiatives in order to make efficient use of the relatively small budget for education and training systems.
In this respect I would suggest better cooperation between the different kinds of funding and an exchange of best practice, together with better dialogue between the supranational, national and regional decision-makers within the Community.
Finally, I would like to see more attention paid to the lack of equal opportunities for all individuals to experience better European integration throughout their professional lives.
There are possibilities within the budget to facilitate exchanges of experience of vocational training systems in the different Member States.
I encourage this. Europe can offer better education for everybody.
Parliament's report should not forget to underline that.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Commission and Mrs Martens on her report, although I must admit that, like a pupil at night school, all I can think about is going home to bed. This is a detailed and, I think, exemplary programme of work because it systematically links the objectives, the indicators and the timetable, thereby giving us a benchmark.
But what we have to ask ourselves is, what sort of benchmark is it if, when it comes to the crunch, we shy away from a real policy of educational convergence at European level.
We ignore the main differences, we are not willing or perhaps able to do anything about them or our priorities lie elsewhere and we use the Bologna method to set targets which every Member State has yet to meet.
I have my doubts, which I have already voiced to Mrs Reding.
Nonetheless, I think that it is a benchmark and we shall see in a few years' time how hard it is for some and how close others have come to it.
But I think dialogue is indispensable, and not just at the level of Parliament.
We need to find a way of formulating an opinion and a view before we are presented with faits accomplis.
We need dialogue at school unit level.
Teachers are strongly resisting indicators, at least in Greece.
Most indicators are quantitative, only a few are qualitative, meaning that the picture we get will not always be the most accurate, and we do need the most accurate picture.
I also share Mrs Martens' view that we need more indicators on education systems, not just training systems.
And here the Commission proposal really is one-sided.
I know we are all worried about unemployment, I know that we want to leave school with prospects of getting a job rather than joining the dole queue, but a general education for young children is equally valuable.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the sitting
Mr President, I do not want to comment on yesterday' s Minutes, but would like to make an observation of a different kind; so I hope you will allow me to do that first.
Indeed, I understand - and I am speaking as the coordinator for my group for the ACP Meeting - that none of the Commissioners will be attending the ACP-EU Meeting in Cape Town in four weeks' time.
Not one single Commissioner, not Mr Nielson, nor Mr Patten, nor Mr Lamy, nor Mr Fischler, for that matter.
In order to avoid a huge disgrace, you could perhaps make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to ensure that a Commissioner attends this Meeting, for an entire programme of questions in writing and such like are on the agenda there.
It is also a disgrace in respect of the 70 developing countries that the Commission is not making an effort to attend the ACP Meeting.
This would be the first time that this has happened, and I have been attending ACP meetings for years.
Hence my urgent request that an appeal be made to the European Commission.
I will take it up with the Commission, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and when we have the response we can come back to the House.
Statement by the President of the European Parliament
We come to the next item of business - and here I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents and colleagues in the House for taking a short policy statement from myself, followed by a debate, to talk a little bit about the next two and a half years of the presidency.
When I spoke after my election on 15 January I said I would like to claim the privilege which is a common privilege of the newly elected President to address the House on our strategic purpose for the coming period.
In deciding to speak today it was in deference to the fact that on the Wednesday of that part-session the Spanish Prime Minister was here to launch the Spanish presidency.
One thing I want to bring to this House - and I hope we will all work on this together - is an ability to communicate who we are and what we do.
So when you wish to communicate something you need to pick your moment and you cannot pick a moment which on that day belongs to someone else.
Thus I am availing myself of the opportunity this morning.
The great sense that I carry from the campaign which preceded my election as President is that there is an enormous appetite for change in our House.
Despite that, it is a frustrated appetite in terms of the delivery of change.
We need, through the different mechanisms - the Bureau, our committees, the Conference of Presidents - to convert that appetite for change into actual change on the floor of this House.
My invitation to colleagues today is to seize this opportunity to create the change for which there is self-evidently such an appetite in this House.
I hope in the next period before the election that we can be a reforming parliament in a visible way and that we can be a communicating parliament and a parliament that is prepared to take risk for change.
This will require creativity and imagination on the part of everyone and together we can face that challenge.
In effect what I should like to invite you to address in our debate today is a willingness to engage in creating a culture of transformation.
It is now more than two decades since direct elections were introduced and we need to review how we do our business.
We need to create a more vital and dynamic sense of parliamentarianism on the floor of this House.
The greatest transformation in hand of course is enlargement.
The time has come for us, the political class, to repossess enlargement.
It is inevitably the case that the acquis communautaire requires an enormous amount of work on the part of the European Commission and on the part of the public service in the candidate states to deal with all of the detail.
But surrounding that detail is the wider political challenge - and that is our challenge.
This House is uniquely well-placed to lead the politics of the transformation towards an enlarged Europe.
We are now entering the end game on the enlargement debate and we have the complex budgetary proposals which no doubt the House in due course will express itself on.
It is important that the era for change which is enlargement should not be reduced to a budgetary debate about small change or large change, however one may perceive that to be.
We have to take initiatives in this House to drive that agenda.
I want this Parliament to be the place where the vitality of the enlargement debate plays itself out.
Although the calendar is not yet firmly set, it seems to me that on two occasions this year we are likely to discuss enlargement, probably before the Seville summit at the end of the Spanish presidency and probably again in November.
I would like to ask you, especially in the political groups, to consider a formula where we can invite MPs from our political families from the candidate states to participate in our enlargement debates with us this year, to create a sense of vitality, to create a moment which is a very European moment, and to do it in terms which allow us to hear the different voices.
They may be voices of accord or discord on some of the issues, but it is a really vital time and I hope the House will find within its mechanisms, and through the groups, a willingness to explore and create this platform, to express in a parliamentary sense this new Europe.
Eventually, following from the example of German reunification more than a decade ago, I would hope that the House will agree that, when the candidate states sign the accession treaties that have yet to be ratified, we might consider budgeting and planning for full observer status so that we create the avant-garde for the new Europe and that we do it in this House because it is our public purpose to give real political leadership.
Subject to these details and to getting agreement - because we need to work through it as regards budgets, we need to work through it in our Bureau, we need the agreement of the Conference of Presidents on our calendar - I should like in the coming months and before the Seville summit if I can, to visit every candidate state on behalf of this Parliament and to issue to them, to our parliamentary colleagues, the formal invitation to be the avant-garde for the new Europe and, if you allow it, it will be your invitation to them and my privilege to deliver it on your behalf.
(Applause) In the context of foreign policy and on a wider basis I hope in a number of ways that we can up our game.
Europe needs a new foreign policy and I am certain in this House there is a majority and a will to create that foreign policy.
In forming and developing strategic partnerships with the United States, with Russia, with a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, with a dialogue of civilisations, we are engaging in politics that are vital not just to the parliamentary process which is the image of the European Union itself.
In this House we have great credibility in terms of our appetite to fight global poverty, disease and famine.
In this House we have a wonderful and proud record in the promotion and defence of human rights.
We must be determined to continue to play a leading role in this but we must find new platforms to express our leadership.
It is not simply that we need to follow events but we ourselves, as a Parliament, have the capacity to create new platforms to offer a lead.
In the last few days and weeks, thanks to the work of so many colleagues in the House, we have begun to move towards a new and more mature form of political relations with other institutions and in particular with the European Commission.
I congratulate Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, for the work which they have done in securing a landmark high-quality agreement on how we will go about the legislative process from now on.
We need it and the work is excellent.
(Applause)
I congratulate the House for the overwhelming vote of support yesterday for the report by Mr von Wogau which will allow us to adopt an effective interim solution - and it is only an interim solution - on the financial services reform pending, through the Convention, and through the Intergovernmental Conference, a new basis in the Treaty on which to conduct our institutional relations, on which to promote the role of a democratic Europe and on which to promote this Parliament's role in representing citizens in a vital way.
I would like in particular also to pay tribute, because these two reports have come through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the leadership role and qualities of Mr Napolitano whose work in this House has contributed so handsomely to these achievements.
(Applause)
The thread of consistency in all of these measures is the primacy of politics itself.
That is our business.
We also have to give a signal to the Commission, to the Council, to the wider world, that we in the European Parliament are mature and reliable partners in the project that we share in terms of European integration.
The counterpart is that I want to work now in the lead-up to the Barcelona European Council, with the Commission and with the Council, to get a meaningful interinstitutional working group.
The primacy of politics comes to zero if the platforms to develop politics are not there.
I say this to the Council: the time has now come for it, with the Commission and Parliament, to deliver that platform and to give us the ability to restore and to develop the primacy of politics, to prepare ourselves for common work on the Convention and for successful and common outcomes of substance in the Intergovernmental Conference.
We must not forget also that we here in this House are a tribune of the peoples of Europe.
Our essential public purpose is to serve our citizens.
We can create and we can communicate a new pride in this Parliament.
Our determination must be to accentuate the democratic over the technocratic, to insist on openness and to connect our message in every way we can with a wider European public.
I am very proud of the fact that it was on the floor of this Parliament that we, the parliamentarians, created, developed, explained and won the argument in favour of a Convention, in favour of a new way of creating the new Europe, in favour of an open and democratic and transparent way, in favour of trying to get in touch with a rising generation of Europeans who are untouched by business behind closed doors.
The old permissive consent to allow the elite to proceed is no longer there in the old way and so we must earn the consent and respect of a rising generation.
We can only do it through open methods and the Convention must be an open method and can be a very significant start.
Parliament can claim an ownership of the idea.
But we also have a key role as a stakeholder in this Convention.
Our determination as Parliament is to promote the democratic Europe over the technocratic Europe and to insist on openness.
In that regard, it is my view - and later today we have the possibility in the Conference of Presidents to meet the President of the Convention - that we must ensure as a Parliament that the Convention itself in its open work is the primary platform, is the main way, is the open discussion that leads to the way forward.
It is important - and we have distinguished colleagues on the praesidium to help to lead this debate - that this is a well-managed Convention.
But its management must assist the Convention itself to be a real platform for open debate.
I have asked the services here, in terms of connecting this debate to the wider public, to ensure that it is broadcast on a continuous basis on video-streaming, so that those who wish to follow - whether they are journalists, people working in research institutes, students in universities, different groups in the socio-economic sphere in Europe - but who are not in Brussels for its work, can do so on a regular basis.
Colleagues, we still have a long way to go on the question of internal reform.
I read the book Mes combats produced by my predecessor Nicole Fontaine.
She spoke in it about the Members' Statute and about the virtual impossibility of making progress on that issue.
I do not know what progress we can make but I express this hope today.
I would like to bring closure to the Members' Statute.
I want to work with the rapporteur, Mr Rothley; I want to work with key colleagues in the Bureau and the College of Quaestors.
But firstly I want to talk to Members in this House to try to develop, mobilise and motivate a majority for change.
Over the coming weeks, we will engage in an intensive round of consultation with Members.
There will be no statute over the head of Members - I give you that guarantee.
But there can be no statute without mobilising the majority - first in here.
Then, of course, even if we do that, we still have to rely on the Council to deliver its part of the contract.
But I want to start the first phase right here: to know the ground we stand on, to create a clear will for this change and then to try to bring closure to it.
It is politically important to do so before the next European elections.
I hope you agree and I hope you will help to create that climate for a majority for change.
(Applause)
I mentioned at the outset that there is a great appetite for change.
Very many colleagues feel that the House lacks vitality in many of its debates and we need to work on this.
I look forward to the Corbett report and whatever change that may bring.
I do not prejudge its outcome - it is still a matter of debate and controversy.
I have no monopoly on wisdom, but we know - even as far as it goes or may go - that the Corbett report itself is just a start.
The House will decide on the Corbett report - the President will not.
But a point I want to make: whatever powers that gives to the presidency to try to regulate how we do our business on the floor - to have fewer votes, more work done in committees and then to create space here for real political debate - I will use it to the maximum extent.
So I want people to know in advance: whatever that platform is, I want to use it in a way that opens up space to have creative political debate on the floor of this House.
We had a wonderful debate yesterday on the Middle East but we need a lot more of that class of activity because we are a political institution.
In that regard - I claim no monopoly of wisdom in this - I cannot displace the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - but I pose, Laeken-like, a number of questions.
Why is it when we have a debate that the groups have not so far been able to agree that somewhere - maybe for the last third - we actually ask colleagues to respond to each other?
Why do we not create a dynamic which demands that we debate and not simply read statements?
Some way or another we need to respond to each other.
Should we consider on committees, that where there is a report where there is broad agreement but where there are key amendments on which there is clear disagreement, that we could through the Conference of Presidents debate only the key amendments?
It is sometimes done on the floor of the Congress in the US - not the whole debate but the debate on the key amendments, because that is the part that has the political voltage running through it.
We need to look at some of these things and I invite you to look creatively at them, because we need more vitality and we ourselves can gift this to ourselves if we are creative enough.
The acquis communautaire to which I referred earlier on enlargement, covers 2 500 legislative acts over 50 years and 85 000 pages of legislation.
On the Eur-Lex website you will find half of those acts in a consolidated form - not yet the law, because we have never made a law to consolidate all those acts - but you will nonetheless find that half the acquis is now on Eur-Lex in its shortened form.
I am told that through consolidated text we could reduce the 85 000 pages to 25 000.
That is already very big but it would be some achievement.
I believe that we should work with the other institutions to do this as a matter of priority.
It is a failure in strategic planning that it has not been done already.
It should have been done in advance of enlargement, for which these 85 000 pages of text are now being translated.
However, we should do it primarily for citizens who want to connect to European law, to find in one place one consolidated text that explains their rights and the limits to them.
I hope that we can engage in an exercise with the other institutions on this.
We as Parliament have a public purpose to bring real value to debate, to be a continental-scale legislator.
I want over the next period to try to sell our story better than we have done in the past.
I want to propose to the Bureau a comprehensive stocktaking exercise in order to provide Parliament with modern and streamlined information policies.
I want with you to develop a communication strategy before the next European election in 2004.
We will have to invest in intellectual honesty and political realism to recognise past defects; to look at the underlying reasons for those defects; to look at any confusion about images of our institution in the eyes of the public.
We have many strengths to build on, not least our unique status as the largest elected representative assembly on our continent.
The pivotal role that we play in the Convention itself also requires a special exercise in communication.
As I said earlier - and I close on this - we must earn the consent of today's generation of Europeans.
This is the tribune of the people where that process must play itself out: creating a cultural transformation, recognising our responsibilities towards enlargement, towards building new strategic partnerships, stressing the primacy of politics, reforming the House, communicating our public purpose.
These are the aims of my presidency.
They can be summarised in one phrase: working together to create a Europe fit for its future.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had the opportunity to congratulate our President on his new office on 15 January, and I want to do so again today.
Mr President, I would like to express our group's congratulations and appreciation to you for the way you have just spoken.
One got the feeling from your speech that your role as President is not just a representative duty for you, but that politics, what we can do here in Parliament, is something close to your heart.
In any case, it is that sentiment that communicated itself to us.
We want to thank you for that and express the hope that you will be able to keep to this policy in these two and a half years of practical work.
Mr President, I feel particular gratitude for the way you spoke out in favour of us inviting observers from the candidate countries to Parliament and to our groups once the treaties have been signed.
I think that this idea, which our Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has promoted for some time, is an excellent one. We must make it clear that political debate must not be dominated by such issues as when agricultural aid is going to be fully operational in the candidate countries, when these or those other conditions are going to be complied with, but we must rather be saying clearly even now to people in the candidate countries: you are welcome in our community of shared values.
That is why we also want soon to welcome to Parliament members of the national parliaments as observers, as partners in dialogue, as people with whom we can discuss the future of Europe.
We are right alongside you if you are about to put that formally into effect by means of resolutions.
You rightly spoke about the strategic partnership in the Mediterranean countries, in which context you mentioned human rights.
It is easy for us in this House to talk about human rights in quite abstract terms.
We have been talking about terrorism in recent weeks and months.
My group is definitely in favour of combating terrorism, but, in the weeks, months and years ahead, we must take care not to permit violations of human rights in the name of counter-terrorism.
This means that we must speak out when human rights are violated.
Let me give Chechnya as a quite specific example.
We must not close our eyes to what is happening in Chechnya just because we say we have to combat terrorism.
This is something we cannot allow!
(Applause)
You mentioned interinstitutional balance.
It is with great disquiet that I see how some governments are now trying, for whatever reasons they may have, to cut down to size the European Commission's role as Guardian of the Treaties.
Even though it may bring us into dispute with a government on our side, our group will not permit a crucial Community institution such as the Commission to have its rights and powers interfered with.
It is the Commission that is the Guardian of the Treaties!
Madam Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, we urge you to pursue this approach with determination.
We are there alongside you.
Much has been said about the Convention.
We are, in fact, going to be discussing it this afternoon with the President.
I believe that, right from the start, we have to counteract the impression that it is not the Convention that is to play the principal role.
We have a praesidium in which there are three people with specific offices: the chairman and his two deputies.
We need working procedures for the Convention.
That is the new method and you have given it expression.
We need a way of working that is transparent and public, and that is why the Convention as a whole must be at the heart of the work.
The work cannot be delegated to the praesidium, to the triumvirate of the chairman and his two deputies.
It is clear that the leadership function naturally devolves upon the praesidium, but the work tempo - including the frequency of the Convention's meetings - must be such that it is the Convention that conducts the debate on the future of Europe.
Turning to the issue of the statute, which you have addressed, our group supports the introduction of a Members' Statute, but we also say that Members' independence, integrity and dignity must be guaranteed, and, in law, it is we who draw up the Members' Statute - and not the Council!
So, at the end of the day, this is not about us saying 'yes' to something proposed by the Council, but rather we are the ones who make the proposal, and then we must work with the Council towards a result.
Please permit me a concluding observation, Mr President. You have just referred to Mr von Wogau's report on the financial services proposals and on the Lamfalussy Final Report, on which we voted yesterday.
I am addressing my remarks to Mr RamÃ³n de Miguel and to the Council when I say that this was a fine hour for the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
If that is how we go about our business in future, we will achieve something.
This is not just about which of us - Commission, Council or Parliament - achieves the most; on the contrary, our common task is to get Europe moving.
Your speech, Mr President, was manifestly in this spirit.
We stand alongside you, encouraging you to be committed and consistent in giving your words practical expression over the next two and a half years.
(Applause)
Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome your Presidential programme.
You started with a statement: the culture of change in this second half of the legislature.
I would say that, fundamentally, what this requires is the consolidation of the culture of democracy in the European Union.
We are facing a veritable obstacle race, in political and electoral terms, in the next two and a half years.
I believe that there are basically two things we must do: one concerns our citizenship.
We already have European citizenship and the euro, but we must convince our citizens to participate actively in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament. And this is something that we must all do together.
At the same time, we must focus on those who wish to become citizens of the European Union, the citizens of the candidate countries and try to engage them in the most noble aspect of our great adventure, which is not simply discussing budgetary issues, but sharing a common destiny founded on peace and democracy.
I would say that these are the noble objectives that we share with a view to making Monetary Union, which is already a reality, into an Economic Union and, above all, as you rightly said, a Political Union, giving primacy to the most noble aspect of politics in public life.
There is also another important dimension to the European Parliament, which is our voice stating the universal primacy of human rights. Not because we are superior, but because we Europeans have learned, in the course of a long and painful history, that human rights are the best cement for maintaining peace and prosperity.
This is an important point, both with regard to the world that borders our own - I am thinking here of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and also the Mediterranean - and especially with regard to the Middle East.
I welcome the fact that yesterday, for the first time, a large number of Members took part in the debate on the Middle East.
We must keep this up.
With regard to the most tangible issues that you raised, the agenda of reforms, I should like to express my agreement with you, in that the most important thing we can do is to make our message more specific and to give primacy to political debates.
In this regard, I also wish to thank you for having mentioned the work of the members of my Group, who are also Members of this Parliament, but whom you mentioned specifically.
First of all, with regard to the reform of the Rules of Procedure, the Corbett report.
It is obviously Parliament that must decide, but the President also has powers of proposal and of approval. The Corbett reform is not only the product of the rapporteur or of the Socialist Group.
This reform is something as vital to us as the air that we breathe. It is absolutely crucial if we are to ensure that our debates resonate beyond the walls of this Parliament.
Secondly, the Members' Statute.
At the moment, the Members' Statute, which is a long-standing ambition of this Parliament, towards which we have been working for many years, is not simply something we wish to see. It is constitutionally essential if Parliament is going to be a member of the European Union with full rights.
This is the issue: we are not simply discussing the problems, the type of Assembly or the advantages that we could gain. This is an issue of dignity and of equality between the citizens and their representatives.
As you know, you have always had the support of the Socialist Group on this matter, and considerable progress has been made by recent governments that are part of our political family. I also hope that you also maintain your resolute support for the work being done by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not only because he is rapporteur for the Socialist Group, but as I have said on other occasions, because this is the birthright of the entire Parliament.
With regard to defending democracy within the European Union, I welcome the agreement reached yesterday on the Lamfalussy programme on the basis of the von Wogau report.
I wish to highlight a few points that I consider to be crucial and which should lead to Parliament maintaining a very firm stance.
First of all: governance.
This is an absolutely crucial issue and we must prevent a drastic reduction of our powers and a return to commitology.
