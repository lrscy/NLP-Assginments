Having in mind, that whereas the Unionâs textile and clothing industry consists of small and medium-sized companies and is high labour intensive, and the Member States may not adopt measures independently, because they have delegated trade policy to the exclusive competence of the EU, I voted to protect European consumers from the counterfeiting textile and clothing products, and to introduce mandatory origin and company-name labelling for the products in this sector, and that any enterprise wishing to export to the EU must declare its compliance with international social and environmental rights and standards.
We should also guarantee our support for textile and clothing companies using opportunities offered by the EU Structural Funds after 2005 in compliance with the Lisbon strategy goals.
Â Â  . It needs to be stressed that the textile sector is the tip of the iceberg: the invasion of the European market by Chinese products affects all sectors, from footwear to food.
We need appropriate counter-measures.
I am talking about the introduction of a compulsory non-EU origin label, to be applied to raw materials too.
I am also referring to the combating of counterfeited products, which damage high-quality production as well as technical and craft-based knowledge assets in the sector.
It would also be a good idea to conduct awareness campaigns in favour of âconscious consumptionâ to help European consumers to choose products via legible and clear labelling.
Finally, we should not forget that behind every Chinese product sold at a low price there are thousands of jobs lost in Europe, and in China human rights that have been denied, the death penalty, repression and child exploitation.
To conclude, will the Lisbon Strategy arrive in time to finance research and innovation?
So, are we sure that we can put aside the idea, as is happening in the United States, of imposing duties to protect our production and workers when outright commercial aggression is taking place, as in the case of the abnormal increases in Chinese exports?
Â Â  We Moderates voted today against the above-noted report.
The abolition of quotas for the trade in textiles, together with Chinaâs accession to the WTO, have made the issue a very topical one.
We are opposed both to the protectionist measures introduced in the spring and to those proposed in this report.
Those who pay the price for the type of protectionism recommended by the report are consumers, who have to pay higher prices; other industries, which have more expensive inputs; and whole regions, which forfeit structural transformation and, thereby, competitiveness â consequences that have become clear to ever more Europeans during the summer.
In northern Europe, the textile trade was deregulated as early as the Seventies and Eighties, with big advantages for quite a few countries in southern Europe.
This was a painful process for many regions in northern Europe, but it led to a new competitiveness.
It is regrettable that those countries that gained so much from this deregulation are not themselves prepared to undergo the same process.
We have known for 10 years that, in 2005, we should be obtaining new arrangements, no longer involving quotas, for the world trade in textiles.
The textile industry has had every opportunity to prepare itself.
A few more years of trade barriers will not help the European textile industry.
Â Â  The SaÃ¯fi report is designed to combat the increased imports of textiles from China to Europe. These have increased sharply since the quotas were abolished on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005 when the WTO Agreement on Textiles expired.
EU leaders should have been able to predict the situation that has arisen and, in time, to adapt to it, but protectionist blinkers have for a long time obscured the EUâs vision where trade policy is concerned.
Increased protectionism cannot in the long term protect European industry and jobs from ever tougher international competition.
The best way of facing up to this competition is by investing in education, research and innovation and by making it easier for companies to act in the global market.
Given the incompetent way in which textile quotas have been dealt with so far, there may however be good reason for drawing up a clear plan for the transition to free trade in textile and clothing products, so easing the strain on those employed in southern Europeâs textile and clothing industry.
Generally speaking, the June List supports the increased liberalisation of world trade and cannot therefore vote in favour of the report as a whole.
Nor are we able to support the proposal for an âethical taxâ on international companies because we are opposed to the EU being given the right of taxation.
Â Â  . The current dispute with China highlights a growing trend, which is making life difficult for our own textile and knitwear industries.
I supported amendments which would require that labour standards at sites operated in non-EU countries be monitored, including at sites outsourced by EU companies.
The ongoing drive towards low-cost imports should not be an excuse to continue utilising sub-standard production facilities with unacceptably poor working conditions and wages.
Â Â  . The French textile industry is being sacrificed on the altar of Euro-internationalism.
In my region of the Nord Pas de Calais, there is no end to the jobs being lost in industries.
In 2004, the textile sector saw the number of its jobs drop by 13%, while non-EU imports are soaring.
This report proposes nothing new in terms of saving our jobs.
On the contrary, the solutions recommended in this summit of pro-European jargon are extraordinary, naive and schizophrenic.
People criticise US protectionism; and they wish to put forward trivial social measures, while proposing in point 44 to help the Maghreb and Turkey!
The ultra-liberal hard-line attitude of the extreme internationalists lifts the lid on our economy and our know-how, while in Asia piracy and counterfeiting are a monstrous phenomenon. Meanwhile, the China factory, that âmarket socialistâ State, practises unfair competition through its work camps and underpaid labour.
At the heart of the economic war, the bilateral agreements and the WTO offer us no protection at all.
For our part, we want to produce French products in France with French people.
In other words, we want protection and national preference in France.
In other words, we want protection and Community preference in Europe.
Â Â  . This report is symbolic of the widespread autism afflicting the economic and political elite and intelligentsia in Europe.
The European Union textile and clothing sector is extremely important for the economy and regional development.
As a result of global deregulation, this sector is experiencing serious difficulties, sustaining relocations, numerous bankruptcies and, as a consequence, job cuts.
What is Europe proposing in order to defend and protect this sector?
A headlong rush towards the dead end of global free trade!
The Americans, however, have just shown us that, without borders, there can be no protection.
In fact, they did not wait until they had plunged thousands of homes into financial difficulty and drafted the umpteenth useless report before they reacted.
They acted and reacted quickly and effectively, as it was their duty to do to safeguard their interests, first and foremost.
Following the vote on 29 May, this report and the ideology underpinning it is an insult to everyone who has lost, or is on the verge of losing, their job.
It contravenes the principle of Community preference and sets the stage for the collapse of this sector in the medium term.
Â Â  . I have abstained on this report, which does not lay down a pro-active strategy to cope with the seriousness of the situation.
I also wish to denounce the climb down of the committee, recorded yesterday in a meeting with the Chinese Government.
To derogate from the agreement on the new quotas that was signed only in July and that was in force from 2005 is unacceptable.
The commitments made must be respected, and the policy of fait accompli adopted by the large distributors cannot be endorsed, as it would thus put thousands of jobs at risk.
The committee has delayed bringing in the import controls needed to launch the safeguard clauses provided for in the WTO and it has not organised itself in order to lay down minimum social and environmental rules in international trade.
Today, it refuses to propose a âtextile planâ that is equal to the challenges: a shortage of funds for research and innovation, a lack of significant support for technological and social conversion or for training, and no revival of the Euro-Mediterranean area, with common customs duties.
Millions of jobs and a still promising industrial sector are being sacrificed by a negligent EU policy.
Â Â  . The conflict surrounding the imports of Chinese textiles into the European Union clearly brings into focus the effects of the global free market economy.
Competition leads to a ruthless race to the bottom in terms of working conditions.
Chinese workers work six long days a week.
In those degrading circumstances, it is hardly surprising that they surpass European clothing output.
As a consequence, European workers lose their jobs, which results in a lose-lose situation.
We should also add the fact that in the poorest countries, 70% to 80% of the workers in the clothing sector are women.
Free trade is acceptable only if countries are comparable in social and economic terms.
Until such time as they are, the tough battle between enterprises will claim ever more new victims in the form of mass redundancies and unacceptable working conditions.
That is why we must press China, but also the UN and the WTO, for improvements in that countryâs working conditions.
The authors of this intervention would like to stress that the high environmental and safety standards are more important than competitiveness.
It is therefore unacceptable for the high REACH standards on chemical substances to be lowered in order to remain competitive.
Economic success must at all times come second to human well-being.
Â Â  . This is a timely report on the situation of the textile industry after the removal of export quotas and the outlook for its future.
It is clear to me that there is no long term future for European textile producers hiding behind a wall of protection.
The measures taken to limit Chinese imports must be seen as temporary and used by the industry to restructure and move up-market.
However, European textile manufactures deserve to operate on a level playing field and open access to our markets must be mirrored by similar access to third country markets.
Similarly if EU producers invest in new designs and materials they deserve the full protection of their intellectual property rights.
Â Â  . The liberalisation of the textiles market since 1Â January of this year has had a profoundly negative impact on Europeâs textiles industry, and in particular on the industry in Portugal.
Although I am an advocate of the virtues of a capitalist economy and the open market, we must understand that if we do not protect the interests of our firms with competitive potential â and in the Portuguese textile industry there are a number of examples of competitive potential â we will soon be seeing a country of consumers that produces nothing; and if you produce nothing, you cannot consume.
It is in this context that we must look at the issues surrounding the opening up of the textiles market.
If competition is restricted by practices that would be considered illegal in our economy â such as the abuse of workersâ fundamental rights â we cannot turn a blind eye and open the markets up to such competition.
If we do not allow this to happen in our market, we cannot allow it to happen when the competition comes from outside.
This has been, and will continue to be, my position in defence of both Portuguese and European interests.
Â Â  . We should welcome the news today over the resolution to the EU/China trade dispute.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the report on the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the âTV without Frontiersâ directive.
It is important for us to show our support for possible ways of developing public service.
Public service is of great importance for democracy and diversity, and it is important for the EU to safeguard it.
We also view with concern the increasing media concentration within the EU.
It is on principle, however, that we are opposed to rules determining how large a portion of broadcasting time should be given over to European productions.
Â Â  We believe that broadcasting quotas for European productions and programmes by independent producers would be a very dubious development. Above all, these quotas must not be decided at EU level.
We wish to promote products that emphasise cultural distinctiveness, but we are doubtful as to whether broadcasting quotas are a suitable means of achieving that goal.
For the above-noted reasons, we have chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . The importance of television in our society has been well documented.
In this context, the time has come to consider whether, on the one hand, the rules of a liberal economy should be followed to the letter, or, on the other hand, whether circumstances are in place that would justify some sort of regulatory intervention to protect the Communityâs interests.
Language is without doubt one of the defining elements of a community; after all, cultural production and cultural goods are among the most conspicuous expressions of a community.
Some sort of regulation, guaranteeing the necessary space for cultural expression of any community, can therefore be seen as justifiable, as distinct from state intervention that conditions peopleâs tastes and choices.
Yet we must not fall into the conceptual and analytical trap of believing that national culture is promoted by placing limits on cultural access.
Striking the right balance in the promotion of sufficient space for disseminating cultural production is not the same as imposing cultural consumption or, worse, limiting choice.
By ensuring that we do not cross that line, we will be able to protect the interests of a community without restricting individual freedoms and the freedom to create.
Â Â  The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the financial year 2006.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and privilege for me to be able to present today, on behalf of the presidency of the Council, the draft budget of the European Communities for the year 2006, as established by the Council on 15 July 2005.
I should like to begin by saying to Members that we, in the United Kingdom, have been very grateful and very touched by the messages of support and solidarity in the aftermath of the dreadful terrorist attacks in London.
I believe we would all, on an occasion such as this, like to reiterate our determination, as the European Union, to tackle on an international level the scourge of modern terrorism as one of the greatest threats facing the world.
I believe that the European Union has a major role to play in ensuring that we tackle head-on the menace of international terrorism.
Once again, I thank you very much for the expressions of support and solidarity in relation to those attacks.
With regard to the budget, I should like to note the historical importance of the 2006 budgetary procedure.
As the last procedure under the current Financial Perspective, it has a special role in bridging past priorities and future objectives.
Of course it also needs to provide a measure of continuity and the basis for coherence between two financial perspectives, but it also must offer the prospect of reform and renewal so that future budgets can genuinely meet the needs and expectations of European citizens in the 21st century.
That gives the two arms of the budgetary authority â Parliament and the Council â a very special responsibility.
We will need to build on the spirit of cooperation that has developed between us to deliver in 2006 a budget that offers a shared vision for a better future.
Already, in the short period of time that I have been fulfilling these responsibilities, I value the relationship that I have been able to build with the chairman, rapporteur and members of the Committee on Budgets, and with the Commissioner.
Whilst it is difficult at this stage of this sort of process realistically to reach any level of agreement, the atmosphere, environment and relationships that are being built are healthy and, hopefully, lay the foundations for a process that will lead to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.
To give to a wider audience today an example of the benefits of that cooperation, during the conciliation meeting between the Budget Council and a delegation from the European Parliament on 15 July, we were able to agree two very urgent matters: first, a strategy for financing a significant EC contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Tsunami-affected countries, and secondly, the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Slovakia, to help with the effects of a severe wind storm.
Those are practical, tangible and highly visible actions, important to all of the people that we represent, as well as to the victims of the Tsunami.
In addition, we were able to reach an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective ceilings for 2006, to permit modulation in agriculture.
Today I acknowledge that, on the question of the Tsunami, there remains a EUR 13 million gap but, in the spirit of the cooperation and progress we were able to make back in July, I am still optimistic that we should be able to close that gap in a relatively short period of time.
This was a very promising beginning to our relationship.
It gives me confidence that, if we retain a constructive and permanent dialogue, and with the assistance of the Commissioner, we will be able to find an appropriate agreement on a balanced and satisfactory budget for 2006 by the end of this budgetary procedure.
Before presenting in some detail the draft budget established by the Council on 15 July 2005, I would like to take this opportunity to recall the main principles which have guided our proposals.
They are fully in line with the Council's budget guidelines for 2006 adopted in March of this year.
I think it is very important that we are clear about the priorities and principles which lead and guide the financial decisions.
That is as relevant in the context of 2006 as it is in any debate about future funding in terms of the next Financial Perspective.
It is important that we are absolutely clear about the principles, the policies and the challenges which lie ahead for the European Union.
First of all, the draft budget established by the Council shows due regard for the current Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.
This is a point which is worth repeating.
Secondly, Council gave particular attention to complying with the annual expenditure ceiling set by the current Financial Perspective and to leaving adequate margins below the ceilings â where possible â so that there is some room to finance unforeseen events during 2006.
Thirdly, regarding appropriations for payments, the Council has remained committed to a limited and controlled growth consistent with sound and rigorous financial management.
The draft budget takes due account of the implementation rates in previous years and the expected implementation rates in the future.
It also acknowledges fully the dramatic and welcome improvements in the implementation that we have seen in recent times.
Securing the right level of payment appropriations for the EC budget is especially important, and I am sure that all Members will be aware that national budgets are so tightly constrained.
All public spending must be justified and prioritised to ensure continued public confidence and public support.
In setting the draft budget, Council took an overall approach which kept to those fundamental principles but which also aimed to provide adequate and realistic funding for the European Union's various budget priorities.
For example, recalling the need for budget discipline, the Council increased the margins for commitments under heading 3: Internal policies, and heading 5: Administration, and created a margin under heading 4: External actions, but without the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument.
We believe that this is entirely in keeping with Article 12 of our Interinstitutional Agreement.
By carefully targeting amendments, the draft budget was achieved in a way which continues to meet genuine priority needs.
The Council also took a similarly carefully-targeted approach to payment appropriations across the budget affecting both compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
While limiting the overall increase of payment appropriations, the draft budget still allows an increase of around 12% for research in light of the priority accorded to objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy and an increase of 9.8% for structural funds, reflecting improved implementation rates.
Sometimes, when people refer to the word 'cuts', they are not talking about cuts; they are talking about a different level of significant growth in budget headings, and yet sometimes the Council has been accused of proposing cuts.
We are not proposing cuts in the vast majority of budget headings; we are talking about sustained and stable growth, but not necessarily to the level that others consider to be the best way forward.
I now want to move on to setting out the draft budget for 2006 in more detail.
The 2006 draft budget establishes commitment appropriations at EURÂ 120.8Â billion, an increase of 3.7% over the 2005 budget, and it establishes payment appropriations at EURÂ 111.4Â million, 4.9% more than the 2005 budget, and payments correspond to 1.01% of Community GNI.
Hopefully, you will have all received a comprehensive explanatory memorandum on the draft budget.
I do not intend to bore you now with a line-by-line explanation â unless you really want me to, and I suspect you do not.
However, I should draw your attention to the key points affecting the various budget headings of the Financial Perspective.
I will begin with heading 1, concerning agricultural expenditure.
Let me stress my appreciation for the agreement that we reached to adjust the Financial Perspective ceiling for 2006.
That will allow a transfer of EURÂ 655Â million from market expenditure in subheading 1a to rural development in subheading 1b.
Regarding appropriations, the Council has made an across-the-board reduction in commitments and payments of EURÂ 150Â million, affecting budget lines in subheadingÂ 1a greater than EUR 50 million.
That reduction is designed to take account of under-implementation in recent years.
However, the Council's position will be reviewed â and this is an important point â in the light of updated forecasts due in the autumn Amending Letter to the PDB.
I must stress that this modest reduction is in line with the Council's overall approach of controlled growth of payment appropriations, which should apply to both compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
The Council has accepted in full the amount proposed by the Commission for subheading 1b, where it believes the implementation is more effective.
Turning to heading 2, on structural operations, the Council has adopted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission consistent with the European Council's conclusions of March 1999 in Berlin and of December 2002 in Copenhagen.
Payment appropriations have been reduced across the board by a total of EURÂ 150 million, which reflects the Council's view of the expected implementation rate and is based on past evidence of implementation shortfalls, taking full account of the significant and welcome improvements achieved recently.
The reduction is applied to both structural funds and to Community initiatives.
In heading 3, on internal policies, the Council accepted the amounts proposed in commitments for multiannual programmes adopted under the codecision procedure, as agreed following enlargement, as well as the specific amounts relating to Copenhagen commitments.
However, the Council limited commitment appropriations for some budget lines that are not based on multiannual programmes such as those based on Commission prerogatives, pilot projects and preparatory actions.
Those decisions followed the Council's examinations of activity statements, which are fast becoming a very important analytical tool.
In addition, the Council limited the increase of appropriation for the subsidies of certain decentralised agencies.
It is right that established agencies should face the same budgetary rigour that we expect of central institutions and, indeed, of our own domestic organisations.
However, it is also fair to allow more significant increases for new and developing agencies.
The draft budget seeks to make that distinction.
In considering the level of payment appropriations for heading 3, Council took full account of the need to increase payments, especially for the important research lines that will help to underpin the very important â the central â Lisbon reform agenda.
However, the Council could not ignore the past implementation record for this heading.
We suggest there is limited capacity to absorb increases effectively and efficiently.
In this environment, the Council believes that it would be irresponsible to budget the huge increases proposed in the PDB of nearly 12% across that particular heading.
The Council has reduced the overall increase to a more manageable and realistic 5%.
But, very importantly, we should be aware that the draft budget still permits a very substantial increase â and I want to reiterate this â of nearly 12% for research lines, which reflects the priority accorded to this very important policy area.
The Council has provided adequate funding for heading 3 and established a sensible margin of EURÂ 210Â million under the ceiling.
I am sure that Parliament will want to keep the same budget discipline principles in mind when considering priorities for this heading.
I want to move now from heading 3 to heading 4: External actions.
The Council was concerned to respect the ceilings of the Financial Perspective.
Consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council took the view that all possibilities for re-allocation must be exhausted prior to a proposal to deploy the flexibility instrument.
You will not be surprised to hear that the Council did not share the Commission's view that re-allocation had been exhausted in the PDB.
The Council fully supported the Community pledges and consequential budget proposals for the reconstruction needs in Tsunami-affected countries and in Iraq, and it respected the reference amounts for codecided programmes.
It also accepted the amount for CFSP, as proposed in the PDB.
However, the Council took the view that there was still scope to bring total expenditure within the budget ceiling and achieved this by a very modest across-the-board reduction in commitments to the remaining chapters, including, for example, for international fisheries agreements.
A slightly smaller reduction was applied to Afghanistan, which still allows the Community to meet its multiannual pledge for reconstruction assistance.
After these adjustments, the margin available under heading 4 is EURÂ 41.65Â million, which should allow the financing of the consequences of the forthcoming sugar reforms along the lines we expect the Commission to propose.
Again, we share a common belief that it is absolutely essential to make a success of sugar reform.
I hope that we will be able to reach agreement on the final amount for the CFSP budget and the international fisheries agreements in the course of the second reading of the budget for 2006, as foreseen in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
You can rest assured that we, the presidency, will make every effort to provide the appropriate information about CFSP to the European Parliament on time and in an appropriate form.
I am sure you would agree that much progress has been made in recent times in relation to that particular issue.
Moving on now to heading 5, on administrative expenditure, the draft budget aims to respect the ceiling of the Financial Perspective once again and set an adequate margin for unforeseen events.
With this in mind, the Council established a margin of EUR 130Â million, to be achieved through savings in operating costs from interinstitutional cooperation and from budget reductions, to reflect the current vacancy rate for the various institutions.
The Council's approach was objective and pragmatic, although we can never expect any institution to be entirely satisfied inevitably by the outcome of our analysis.
The Council accepted the vast majority of the new posts requested by the institutions for enlargement, pre-enlargement and new tasks.
However, it is true that we applied a modest reduction to take account of the significant delay in recruitment for posts granted in previous years.
The Council expressed deep concern about recruitment delays and about the need â the centrality â for there to be geographical balance following enlargement.
I know that Parliament shares these concerns.
It is regrettable that, due to time constraints, we could not agree a jointly-worded statement on this issue on 15 July, but I have every reason to believe that we can still reach such an agreement which would make it absolutely clear that Parliament and the Council are as one in terms of recruitment and retention, of human resource policies.
We have recently received a paper from the Commissioner, which we will be considering over the next few weeks, to inform our position on the question of administration and more specifically of posts.
Moving on now to heading 7, the pre-accession strategy, the Council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission.
However we limited the increase for payment appropriations for some budget lines, again taking into account past implementation rates.
Finally, as regards heading 8, on compensations, the Council accepted the full amounts proposed by the Commission in the PDB, which will help ensure that the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council as regards new Member States are properly fulfilled.
We believe that this draft budget adequately responds to the European Union's various priorities, making the finances available, but it also respects the important principle of budgetary discipline and sound management of which we â the Council and Parliament â are joint custodians.
We meet today in an environment where it is more important than ever that we rebuild, that we strengthen the relationship between the European Union, its institutions and the people of Europe.
Central to that relationship is the credibility of the way we do our business.
Key to that credibility is the way that we manage our finances, to demonstrate that we are efficient, that we are prudent, but also that we jointly spend money in a way that adds value to the everyday quality of life of the people who live in the European Union.
We have to close the gap between rhetoric and reality, because one of our great challenges â those of us who believe passionately in the importance of the European Union â is that often people do not see the work that is done in Parliament, the Commission, the Council as making any difference or being relevant to their everyday concerns about their quality of life and standard of living.
Therefore, it is very important, in the context not only of 2006 but also of the debate on the Financial Perspective for the years ahead, that we constantly have in mind the importance of linking our actions, our words and the decisions that we make with the centrality of making sure that we rebuild and strengthen public confidence and support in the whole function, the work and vision which underpins the European Union.
A very good place to start would be to reach in a mature way a consensual agreement on the 2006 budget.
We have major challenges ahead, but we can bridge the gap on that issue â there are significant gaps in some of the budget headings, as we will hear in the debate this afternoon, and very strong differences of opinion about the best way forward.
However, I believe that in the next few weeks we should be seeking to bridge those gaps.
We should be seeking to achieve some level of consensus, which will inevitably require compromise.
If we can do that, it will be a very important building block in terms of the challenges which lie ahead, in terms of the necessary reforms to the way that we budget and make decisions about the future.
Many of you will have been present when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom made his speech to Parliament very early on in the presidency.
I think there was general agreement among everybody present â whatever their political ideology, whatever their views â as he outlined the reform agenda and his determination that we achieve that in partnership, that his was a fair analysis of where Europe is now and that now is the time to grasp the nettle and deal with some of the fundamental issues about the future nature of the European Union and its relationship with its citizens.
The 2006 budget may â in the context of that big-picture debate â feel like a relatively small issue.
However, if we can reach some level of agreement, if we can show that we can achieve compromise in the interests of continuing progress in these areas, that will go down very well.
It will be very well received by those who closely observe the way that we do our business.
I am pleased, Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, to close my remarks and to commend the draft budget to the European Parliament this afternoon.
Â Â  On behalf of everyone here, I thank MrÂ Lewis, who, on behalf of the Council, has presented the draft general budget for 2006.
Â Â  The next item is a general debate on the European Union general budget for 2006.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ Lewisâ presentation today of the 2006 budget has confirmed the impression that Parliamentâs delegation took away from the Conciliation Committee meeting held on 15Â July.
Contrary to its name, this meeting resembled a cataloguing of differences rather than a conciliation process.
It is indeed true that noÂ one expects consensus to have been reached at this point in the year, but it cannot be denied that the standpoints of the EUâs two budgetary authorities on the 2006 budget are poles apart.
Even the consensus that has been reached on important but secondary issues, such as modulation, or in other words the transfer of funds to the tune of EURÂ 655Â million from HeadingÂ 1 to rural development, cannot hide this fact.
Our goal is to reach agreement on the budget, but this task will be far from easy.
The European Parliament is a political body, the members of which, having entered into a contract with their voters one year ago, are mindful of their commitments.
Much was said at the time, and is still said, about the need to complete EU enlargement and to invest in cohesion to this end, as well as about the need to breathe fresh life into the Lisbon Strategy and to fund the EUâs new ambitions on the international stage.
At the same time, however, there is no getting away from the fact that we also committed ourselves to strict budgetary discipline one year ago.
The voting public is firm in its condemnation of undisciplined and hence wasteful spending, yet political ambitions and goals that lack financial backing are nothing but hollow words.
Parliament must consider the 2006Â budget in terms of the experience it gained last year.
With our backs to the wall, so to speak, we agreed to a level of payments that falls short of our needs in 2005, as has already become clear from the level of expenditure so far this year.
Furthermore, the 2006 budget must be regarded as a stepping stone to a new Financial Perspective.
It was with these two factors in mind that we decided that the Commissionâs initial proposals of 1.02% of GNI, which is nearly EURÂ 7Â billion below the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective for 2006, were unsatisfactory.
A huge gap exists between these 2006 budget proposals and the Commissionâs proposals for payments in 2007, which will be the first year of the new Financial Perspective.
This means that it is even more difficult to understand or tolerate the cuts made by the Council, taking payments to just over 1% of GNI.
This year we have seen the Council taking a more selective and less mechanical approach to budgetary cuts, and I should like to dwell very briefly on the individual headings in turn.
The modulation that has been agreed from HeadingÂ 1 can be counted as a joint success.
At the same time, however, we expect the Commission to put forward proposals regarding agricultural spending in the long term, as a basis for further discussion.
Parliament has not been slow to notice that cohesion emerged relatively unscathed from the Councilâs cuts, but the preliminary reports that have reached us on the Structural Funds suggest that use of the Funds in 2005 will not correspond to the level specified in the Councilâs draft, but will be equal to, if not higher than, the Commissionâs initial proposal.
The pressure is starting to be felt most in Heading 3, that is to say in the field of internal policies, where the largest cuts in relative terms have been made, amounting to over EURÂ 500Â million.
This makes a nonsense of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, which include investment in research and in small and medium-sized enterprises, and will also make it impossible for Parliament to implement its priorities.
As far as HeadingÂ IV is concerned, however, it is not so much Parliamentâs priorities that are in conflict, but the British Presidencyâs own statements.
The arbitrary cuts of around 4% that have been made to all areas, with the exception of the much-favoured common foreign and security policy, will make it impossible for us to meet the never-ending stream of fresh challenges.
The latter will not merely relate to the tsunami-hit countries or to Iraq and Afghanistan, since the need will arise to fund assistance for other regions affected by natural disasters.
Compensation for sugar producers presents us with a further problem, and the Commission has also raised the issue of administrative expenses, with the possibility of a freeze on the recruitment of employees from the new Member States.
To sum up, our debate on the 2006 budget is taking place against a general backdrop of pessimism.
Yet the European Union is in urgent need of good news, and agreement on both the 2006 budget and sensible figures for the Financial Perspective would be exactly the news it has been hoping for.
Such agreement could serve to renew peopleâs faith in the European Union, and it is our common responsibility and task to ensure that it is achieved.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Lewis, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, our warmth towards the UK Presidency does not discharge us from the duty of expressing our disappointment with regard to the budget proposal that has been presented to us.
As pointed out by President Lewandowski, we expressed our disappointment very sincerely and firmly back in July, at the Conciliation Committee.
We therefore also confirm today that â while we appreciate the speech by Mr Lewis, with its openness and the delicacy of its expression â all this needs to be translated into definite choices.
There is, unfortunately, a blatant contradiction between the passionate words spoken by Prime Minister Blair in this assembly and the choices the Council has made regarding the budget.
The cuts in the budget â or, if you prefer, your budget forecasts â in relation to the agricultural sector and the Structural Funds, although more limited than last year, confirm the tendency towards an unjustified severity.
If adopted, they would open the door to adjustments during the year, accentuating the divide between expectations, which are, moreover, reinforced by a good funds implementation capacity, and the inadequacy of the resources themselves.
With regard to internal and external policies, our worries become fears: we are not convinced, Mr Lewis, by the symmetry between the funds allocated for commitments, which have been reduced by a lesser degree than the payment appropriations, nor can an analysis of the most significant cuts provide an explanation in terms of the political message that we all want to give.
This is how the figures add up: 21 million less for businesses; 33 million less for transport; 279 million less for research; 131 million less for information; 20 million less for education and culture and 8 million less for freedom, security and justice.
There is an inconsistency between declarations in favour of growth, employment and measures designed to help young people, on the one hand, and on the other hand the reduction of funds in the budget headings, which are vital for achieving these objectives.
I would like to ask you, Mr Lewis, what all of this means.
Does it mean that these policies are vital, but must be implemented by the national governments alone?
This is the impression that I have; if it is right, then we are in direct conflict, since these policies must be implemented by the European Union too, in so far as they possess added European value.
In my view, this is the fundamental political problem that we need to clarify first of all in order to take consistent action.
With regard to heading 4 â the notorious heading of âExternal actionsâ â we are demanding that the flexibility instrument be used: with the estimates for heading 4 made beneath the maximum ceiling, as you are asking for, it is not possible to follow up on the traditional priorities of the European Union, the Millennium Goals, emergencies that have arisen over the course of the years â from Iraq to Afghanistan, the tsunami, horizontal programmes and geographical programmes, and now we want, rightly, to add sugar to the list.
How is it possible to do all this?
And what about the dozens of other measures that have been planned, and I say again, rightly so, as external actions?
How can we implement such measures with a reduced financial allocation, without even applying the flexibility instrument?
I have the impression, and I shall use a proverb to express myself, that you want to have your cake and eat it.
We are worried and disappointed, but we continue to ask for more reflection on your part and we await, Commissioner, more determined pressure from the European Commission.
Within this Parliament, in our midst, the idea is growing of a shake-up, of action taken not on impulse but in a considered manner, to open up peopleâs eyes and recall everyone to their duties.
We have received no comforting signals on the financial perspective; in fact, I should say that we have received no signals at all.
This, obviously, increases our concerns and the wave of scepticism among citizens; you rightly referred to citizens as â let us say â the main target of our actions, but among citizens there is enormous scepticism, because the European Union has not put itself in a position to implement its policies.
Has the UK Presidency perhaps decided to give up on financial perspectives without even giving them a try?
Knowing the determination with which Prime Minister Blair faces his battles, we would have expected different signals and we continue to await them.
But time and deadlines wait for no man: as Mr Blair well knows, faced with the European crisis, to merely scrape by would amount to giving up entirely.
We in Parliament, and we hope that Prime Minister Blair and the UK Presidency feel the same, cannot stand passively by while Europe declines.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Lewis, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Lewis for his presentation of the budget of the other EU institutions for 2006.
Clearly, the European Parliament and the Council have different approaches on certain issues regarding the drafting of the budget, but there are also various common threads.
Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayersâ money.
The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the EU institutions by 120Â million euro as compared with the institutionsâ original requests.
It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutionsâ work.
For this reason, the European Parliament will be proposing a review of the reduction in the institutionsâ expenditure, assessing each institutionâs budget request and new tasks in 2006 on its individual merits.
It is important to ensure the requisite financing for one of the priorities of the EU budget for 2006, which is preparation for the next round of European Union enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join.
I believe that the European Union institutions need to adopt a harmonised approach to the hiring of staff from the new Member States.
With regard to the European Parliament budget, we should note that tomorrow the European Parliamentâs Presidium will adopt a decision on the European Parliament draft budget for 2006, which it will forward for consideration by the Committee on Budgets.
As the budget rapporteur, I believe that the Committee on Budgets will need additional information on various matters in order to be able to take each decision on its own merits, particularly in relation to the European Parliamentâs information and communication policy.
Once again I would like to stress the principle that the level of joint expenditure in the European Parliament budget ought to be set in accordance with needs that have been established following careful evaluation.
Achieving a ceiling of 20% of joint administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.
Finally, I would like to add a few words about the European Union general budget for 2006.
The Councilâs proposal to reduce payment appropriations for EU structural funds for 2006 by 150 million euro is incomprehensible.
Such an approach is indicative of the Councilâs unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing financial perspective.
Bearing in mind the fact that 2006 is the last year of the current financial perspective, it is important to ensure a successful conclusion to existing programmes and to set a volume of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget that corresponds with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the opportunity offered to me today to express my opinion concerning the first proposal by the Council, especially since as early as last June following the first reading we had a chance to exchange our views with Parliament and the Council, as well as with the representatives of political groups of the European Parliament.
I would like to share the idea held by most speakers that the 2006 budget is a special one, as it is the last of the current Financial Perspective drawn up by the Commission seeking to most comprehensively and realistically take into consideration the most pressing needs of the European Union, to complete all the important projects and to prepare well for the new financial period.
Therefore, in response to the proposal of the Council, I would like to immediately define three areas that in the Commissionâs opinion are the most challenging.
Having first outlined the importance of the European budget for 2006, I should like to focus on three main areas in which the Commission thinks that the major concerns need to be addressed and resolved by all three institutions, including the budgetary authorities in particular.
Our main concerns relate to Heading 3, where we think that the reductions proposed by the Council are not justified and cannot be supported by the Commission, mainly because the requirements and the amounts proposed by the Commission were based on projects already committed and ongoing.
We think that such reductions will create many problems for the payment of bills for ongoing projects in the Community in 2006 for the Member States.
Furthermore, half of the proposed reductions in payment appropriations are concentrated on activities which represent only about 10% of the total budget.
Surprisingly, no justification is given for concentrating the reductions in this way.
In Heading 4 the reductions proposed by the Council will create at least three serious problems.
First of all, the reduction goes against the decisions taken by the General Affairs Council itself, especially regarding post-tsunami reconstruction in Asia and the renewed commitment to the Millennium Development Goals.
Second, in relation to recent developments in the world, we expect, and have already had indications, that Europe will be asked to assist in the disengagement process from Gaza.
The third problem concerns the negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
All these three elements make it more difficult to accept or look favourably upon the Council's proposal.
The question of Heading 5 was raised and discussed at length at the 15Â July meeting between the three institutions.
As promised, on Friday I sent to both budgetary authorities additional information on the progress of recruitment from EU-10 and EU-15.
By 31 July this year, 90% of the recruitment targets from new Member States had been fulfilled.
We believe that the proposed reductions forwarded by the Council are the result of a misunderstanding between us and may well derive from a technical error.
We very much expect that, before second reading, we will be able to engage in consultations with the Council in particular in an effort to resolve this issue.
The proposal on the table today means that for 2006 not only will we be unable to recruit from EU-10, but we will be stopping all recruitment in the Commission, as well as lacking the resources to pay salaries for existing staff levels.
Taking all this into account and in reply to Mrs Pittella's request that the Commission take as forceful an approach as possible to this proposal, let me say that we are committed to resolving all possible questions in cooperation with the budgetary authorities.
I call on all sides to show goodwill in this endeavour, as it will be greatly needed if we are to finalise the deal for this year.
Â Â  .
(Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 15Â June 2005 I had a chance to participate in the conciliation meeting of the European Parliament and the Council in Brussels, prior to which the European Parliament had passed a resolution clearly manifesting the position of this European Union institution and its priorities in the formation of the 2006 budget.
Despite the criticism then expressed by the European Parliament concerning insufficient appropriations for commitments and payments, on 15 July 2005 the ECOFIN Council decided to propose a reduction of allocations for payments by EUR 1.1 billion and commitment appropriations by EUR 478 million as compared to the Preliminary Draft Budget.
This proposal, in my opinion, clearly demonstrates that the Council virtually disregards the actual needs and commitments of the European Union.
I would like to remind you that the above resolution of the European Parliament stipulates that the Preliminary Draft Budget presented by the Commission is insufficient and fails from a budgetary viewpoint to reflect commonly agreed-upon political ambitions, in particular those related to the Lisbon Strategy and the need to support small and medium-seized enterprises.
We also invited the Council to enter into a serious and constructive dialogue with the European Parliament concerning the ways to fulfil these political commitments.
It is impossible to reach our policy goals, that is, growth of the economy and enhancement of competitiveness, without increased allocations for research, innovation and SMEs, which account for about 90 of all enterprises of the European Union.
We, the European Parliament, have stressed before and would like to point out once again the important external assistance programmes that could not be foreseen while considering the current financial perspective, for instance those related to Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recently proposed post-tsunami reconstruction package.
In the Preliminary Draft Budget, expenditure heading IV âExternal Actionsâ was already insufficiently funded in our opinion. And now the Council proposes a further reduction of allocations under this heading.
I would also like to draw your attention to other alarming reductions related to specific thematic and geographical measures.
I believe that the budget amounts and resources must be reconciled anew.
I would also like to emphasise the importance of the European Neighbourhood Policy including support to democratic developments in the neighbouring States.
I must reiterate that the accession of ten new Member States in 2004, which is only the beginning of a long-lasting cohesion process, is a new challenge to the cohesion policy, meaning that the implementation of the cohesion policy should focus on regions in order to avoid possible future conflicts between the new Member States and the less developed regions of the EU-15.
I would like to conclude by once again calling on the Council to be guided by the priorities established by the European Parliament in drafting the 2006 budget.
I strongly believe that there is no need to remind you that the European Parliament is the only European institution directly elected by EU citizens and in accordance with EU law has been assigned a mission in the formation and implementation of the European Union budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I have to say that I regard the budget with which the Council has presented us as unsatisfactory.
I say that with particular reference to the EURÂ 150 million cut â for that is what I call it â in payments.
Over recent years, we have endeavoured, by introducing the N+2 rules, to tie expenditure very closely to commitments and to ensure that the money is actually spent.
We are, basically, being penalised for our efforts by seeing how there is EURÂ 150 million less available for payments.
We are, though, also punishing ourselves, the European Union as a whole, for, at some point in time, we will be called on to stand by the commitments we have made. We have always, as a matter of policy, kept the gap between payments and commitments from getting too large.
In the preliminary draft budget, the Commission really has made only the absolute minimum necessary available in terms of funding for structural policy.
We want to get them restored, and I urge the Council to follow our lead in this.
Â Â  .
The Council wants to reduce the budget of the European Union by half a billion euros compared to the Commissionâs proposal.
This is in itself unacceptable, but what is particularly unacceptable is the fact that more than one third of these cuts relate to external relations and external affairs.
The proposed reduction in expenditures on external affairs is ten times greater than in any other area.
The successes and achievements of the European Union to date have been related in no small measure to external relations.
We are proud of enlargement, and of our aid policy; we are proud of the fact that we are the worldâs biggest donor.
These priorities are nevertheless absent from the draft, and most conspicuously so from the Council proposals.
Indeed, not only are they absent; the reductions would affect these programmes most of all.
Yet I believe that today we very much need to be able to demonstrate successes.
Europe, the European Union is crying out for such successes.
However, there is also another problem.
We are failing to take our own principles seriously; we have failed to do so up to now, and we are failing to do so in this draft.
The Council has virtually never invoked the human rights clause.
We support a multitude of countries that make a mockery of democracy and human rights.
And yet we have a tool at our disposal to do something, since the human rights clause provides the possibility of withdrawing support from countries that fail to observe human rights and the rule of law and it also allows us to increase the support we give to countries that observe these rules.
One example would be the countries of the western Balkans.
You, on the other hand, propose making even greater reductions in the support we provide to the western Balkan countries than in overall spending on foreign affairs.
And yet it is in our fundamental interest to stabilise the western Balkan region.
It is incomprehensible that the Council should want to give 5% less to this region, and 8% less to Serbia, for example, than in the previous year.
At the same time, it is very generous as regards European special envoys, whose budget has been set to double over two years.
In other words, there is to be an increase in something that is of questionable necessity, while at the same time there are to be reductions affecting things that we vitally need.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lewis, when weighing up the draft budget for 2006, we cannot fail to notice that it is a transitional one, and that is what makes it so crucial in terms of the further priorities and ambitions that we share â or, at any rate, should share.
It is for that reason that I will be forthright in criticising the Council proposal on one score: it is far too cautious and envisages cuts that are massive when seen alongside those proposed by the Commission.
In order to make clear what I mean by calling this budget transitional, let us take a look at the BÃ¶ge report and at what we expect of the Financial Perspective.
There is a major difference between us and the Council; it adds up to EURÂ 106 billion in the Financial Perspective.
We believe that, in order to make Europe truly fit for the future, we have to focus on quite specific target areas: research, education, youth, cultural interchange in an enlarged Europe, the environment and renewable energies â and I have recent events in New Orleans in mind when I say that.
A look at the budget figures in Parliamentâs financial perspective and, now, in the Council draft for 2006 reveals that they diverge to a marked degree: the Financial Perspective makes EURÂ 10 billion available for research, but the Council a mere EURÂ 4 billion; there are EURÂ 2 billion for education, culture and young people, over against the Councilâs mere EURÂ 0.8 billion for the same period.
For energy and transport, Parliament has proposed EURÂ 2.5 billion, but the Council no more than EURÂ 1.3 billion.
From that alone, it is apparent that the Councilâs proposals for the 2006 financial year are timid, cautious and lacking virtually any concept of future direction.
As I see it, the draft budget for 2006 ought, instead, to be a sort of bridge extending into the years that are to come, from 2007 to 2013, and so putting forward such timid and paltry budget estimates as the Council has done is the wrong way to go about things.
The figures it has quoted to us bear no relation either to the pious utterance about Lisbon as a means of renewal or to the great economic potential that we have to rebuild.
If I may turn to the communications strategy, let me say that, especially after the failure of the referenda, it must surely be in our interest to do more in 2006, rather than to cut payments or make less use of the flexibility instrument.
I find it incomprehensible in political terms how, in the face of the many challenges we have to contend with across the globe, the Council can be so timid and cautious in its handling of the flexibility instrument, instead of demonstrating the European Unionâs willingness to be a global player in meeting the needs of the worldâs many crisis hotspots.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, for several years now I have represented my group and the European Parliament in the July budget conciliation procedure, which is conducted with the Member States after the first reading by the Council.
It has always been difficult to agree on anything in the summer, but this year it was especially difficult.
In practical terms, nothing was agreed on, and, as a result, Parliament is free to undertake its own first reading without any commitments to the Council.
From my groupâs point of view, the basic problems are the low level of budget payment appropriations and the budgetâs main areas of focus.
In the Council there is a group of so-called net contributing countries, which are not interested in the value added that results from financing the Union by way of different joint projects.
Virtually the only thing that the Council seems to be actively interested in financing is the militarisation of the EU.
Although warfare does not fall within the competence of the EU, the Member States want to finance joint militarisation projects with EU money.
As far as I understand, the Congo police operation and the mission in Sudan are being financed out of development appropriations, and the funding of militarisation activities is therefore not transparent.
Although the Constitution, which was rejected in two referenda, is not immediately forthcoming, the political elite in the Member States are implementing some of the articles contained in it, and are establishing, for example, an Armaments, Research and Capabilities Agency.
The way that the Member States behave is undemocratic, and it is very obvious that many EU joint military activities have no legal basis in the Treaties.
Instead of the militarisation of the EU, we should start to talk about building a social Europe.
Only that way will the work of the Union acquire legitimacy, which is to say the general approval of the public.
In the name of a social Europe, our group has continually criticised the narrow scope of the Lisbon Strategy; because it merely promotes a Europe of major companies.
We recently criticised the way the Council has kept its eyes and ears firmly closed and cut expenditure, even when compared to the Commissionâs draft budget, with the aim of reducing appropriations in the budget to 1% of the Gross National Income of the EU states.
Stringent budgetary discipline is a good thing, but in this case the Council is advocating a sound thrashing.
A strategic objective is also there for us all to see.
In the event of no agreement being reached on the financial frameworks and the matter being referred to the budgetary procedure within the meaning of Article 272 of the Treaty, the grand total for the 2006 budget must, from the point of view of the Council, be as small as possible.
This is a strategic objective that we cannot accept.
Our group is also concerned about the strategy whereby the costs of sudden and unexpected expenditure, such as that relating to the tsunami, are to be covered by allocating for new purposes money that had been set aside for purposes approved by Parliament.
If new, external needs arise, we have to be prepared to allocate new, âfreshâ money for them.
Finally, I wish to say that we need to safeguard Structural Funds payments and increase human resources for the needs of enlargement.
It is very difficult for us in Parliament to understand the conflict which prevails between the Commission and the Council with regard to their views on personnel requirements and the need for increased human resources as a result of enlargement.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I became a member of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means where I argued in favour of our keeping to 1% of GDP.
In view of this, I do not believe we should decide that the surplus from the 2004 budget should be used for expenditure in the 2005 budget.
I do not believe that the structural fund, which is already growing in size through this expenditure, needs to become larger.
It already amounts to more than EURÂ 8Â billion.
I do not therefore agree that I am expressing my displeasure at money not being spent.
There are obviously reasons for money not being spent, and there is therefore nothing to be lost in examining issues extremely carefully when it comes to new expenditure.
I am not, however, prepared to return these surpluses to the Member States.
I believe, instead, that these funds should be used for the flexibility margin which, in my view, is too small.
Otherwise, we shall often end up in situations in which we have to acknowledge that we cannot do what is necessary.
We cannot foresee the future.
I therefore believe that these resources should be used for developing the flexibility margin and not for developing structural funds.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, when the foundations of the European Communities were laid over half a century ago, Poland and the other new Member States were part of the Soviet bloc.
Our only option was to look on enviously as past conflicts were overcome by means of economic cooperation.
We believed at the time, and we continue to believe today, that development and solidarity are the main goals of the European Union, which Poland eventually joined.
Yet any satisfaction one might derive from this fact is marred by developments that are now becoming ever more evident in certain net payer countries.
These developments are a result not only of an economic slow-down, but also of governing principles of action.
Excessive labour costs are reducing the competitiveness of these economies, and their overregulation leads to budgetary deficits.
In turn, the latter make these countries more inclined to cut back on their payments to the EU.
The current state of progress on the 2006 EU budget is a cause for great concern.
The Council has once again made cuts to the Commissionâs proposal, reducing it by over EURÂ 1Â billion to 1.01% of GNI.
This is a bad sign, all the more so because the deadlock on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has also not been broken.
If the Financial Perspective has not been adopted by spring of next year, the reduced 2006 budget could serve as the basis for future budgets, and the worrying developments I mentioned a short time ago could persist for many years.
There are currently two approaches to the issue of EU finances.
The first of these favours spending on development to the detriment of agricultural subsidies, whilst the second gives preference to the social dimension of the EU project over the Lisbon Strategy.
It would appear that the first of these approaches promotes development at the expense of solidarity, whereas the second promotes solidarity at the expense of development, but it would be mistaken to believe that development and solidarity are alternatives to each other.
Such a belief would merely boost selfish national interests, and, in so doing, result in a disastrous compromise that delivers neither development nor solidarity.
Furthermore, it would make real the utopia of âmore Europe for less moneyâ.
The main reason why the determination of certain net payers to cut their spending is so worrying is that it poses a threat to the EUâs fundamental goals, namely development and solidarity.
Â Â  Unlike in previous years, the European Commission has presented a cautious 2006 draft budget for the European Union.
Compared with 2005, the European Commission proposed a 4% increase in commitments and a 5.9% increase in payments.
As aÂ percentage of the GNP, this amounts to just 2% in the case of payments, which is far below the imaginary ceiling of the long-term financial perspective.
The draft budget for 2006 further widened the gap between the commitments and the payments, as well as between available resources of national budgets and the EU budget.
The lack of funds to cover key EU policies has therefore been a subject of criticism in the first stage of the discussion about the proposed budget in the European Parliament.
This is the reason why the budget proposed by the Council came as aÂ cold shower, as it leaves no room for manoeuvre between the proposals of the European Commission and of the European Council.
AÂ more detailed analysis of adjustments to the budget of the European Commission shows that an overriding majority of 51 items in which the European Council has intervened compared with 2005 (46 items) maintain the trend set in the European Commissionâs draft budget.
Councilâs interventions therefore evoke the impression of aÂ technocratic reduction in expenditures under the motto âlet us cut by one half the increase in expenditures exceeding those of 2005â, and the motto âlet us take away more where the expenditures are lower than in 2005â.
This approach by the European Council undermines the atmosphere of mutual trust in the current budgeting process, and could lead to aÂ protracted position war between the key institutions of the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, budgets are about priorities and for the Committee on Regional Development and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, pride of place among these goes to the Millennium Objectives.
One in five people worldwide have no access to basic education or basic health care, and the chasm is growing every day despite all the pledges by Heads of Government.
Europe is the worldâs largest donor and can make the difference.
That is why we are not asking for more funds in the first instance, but we are asking, within the EUâs aid budget, for priority to be given to the Millennium Objectives.
At least 35% of the budget should be spent on these, at least 20% of which should go to basic education and basic health care.
Within the various geographical budget lines, we have set aside 20% for those two sectors, and we will not hand this over to the Commission until they have shown us specific plans for basic education and basic health care in those regions.
In 2003, only 2.3% of the development budget was spent on education and 5.2% on health care.
That is unacceptable.
Today, with the help of the Committee on Budgets, we want to bring the Millennium Objectives closer.
âMake poverty historyâ.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, MrÂ Lewis, except when it comes to the foreign budget, agreeing on the 2006 budget really ought, of course, to be a simple matter, for there is plenty of room for the increases requested by the Commission within the ceiling of the financial perspectives.
The finance ministers have, however, almost ritually sat down together and slashed away at every possible area.
These have primarily been within foreign policy, but payments to structural funds and for internal policy have also to bear the brunt, and that is rather surprising in the light of the far better implementation we have seen in recent years of, for example, the structural fund programmes.
Research has been cut back, as have the funds for supporting other projects within the framework of the Lisbon process that EU Heads of State no doubt still want to keep going.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe particularly regret the slashing of programmes for developing small and medium-sized businesses â programmes that, for example, help the banks make credit available to small businesses in the new Member States where, with limited resources, a large dispersal effect has been achieved, benefiting economic development.
We must also deeply regret savings within the transport area, including those in relation to the new agencies for aviation and maritime safety.
Clearly, nothing is too small to escape the axe.
Even the subsidy for the successful programme for developing medicines to combat rare diseases is at the receiving end.
MrÂ Lewis spoke of dialogue, and I do hope we can obtain dialogue and cooperation.
Unfortunately, we are likely to see a situation in which the budget has to be debated with no agreement on the framework for the 2007-2013 budget.
Â Â  â Madam President, one of the great orators of Athens, Demosthenes, said, 'money is the root of everything'.
I am sorry if perhaps you have never heard this and it is not easy to translate, but it means that, without money, nothing is possible.
We cannot do a thing.
With the 1% of GDP destined for the budget, policy is impossible.
Europe is getting poor.
We have a poorer household than at any other time.
We import lemons from Chile, garlic from Tunisia, hazelnuts from Turkey and clothes from China.
There is no development.
We cannot get Europe out of poverty.
It is ruining us.
Europe is getting poor.
We need to change policy but, instead of changing policy, we go along with Mr Blair, who says that we cannot give money to 4% of the population, to the farmers, even though the 4% feed the other 96%.
Are we only going to pay money for computers?
This is the wrong policy.
We are budgeting for nations, not for computers; we are not budgeting for numbers.
Think about the people.
They are the ones who vote for us, they have the last word.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is concerned about the cuts made by the Council in crucial areas relating to Europeâs influence in external matters.
Natural disasters such as the tsunami cannot be alleviated by making drastic cuts in areas of political significance.
This budget reduces the amounts allocated to the European initiative for democracy and human rights and to Latin America and provides insufficient funding for the Neighbourhood Policy in MEDA and for Eastern European countries.
We cannot accept it.
We firmly suggest to the Council that it makes use of the flexibility instrument.
Furthermore, even though it is the moment for making savings, the number of foreign representatives from the EU is growing at an impressive rate, without Parliament being informed as to the relevance of those appointments.
We will request additional information from the Council before offering our opinion on this expenditure.
Finally, we insist before the Council, as we did before the Commission, that the budget allocated to the reconstruction of Iraq is entirely managed by the United Nations and not in part by the World Bank Trust Fund, as Parliament has already requested on two occasions.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi and I have tabled an amendment to reduce the amount for CFSP by 3.87%.
Such a reduction would bring it into line with all the other external action components, which the Council has reduced by an average of - you have guessed it - 3.87%.
My Group does not understand why the Council chooses to let external action bear the brunt of the cuts, and points to the inconsistency of reducing the amounts for prevention, stabilisation and democracy-building, while maintaining the amounts for security policy proper.
I draw your attention to our amendment, in the hope of provoking the Council into giving a serious explanation for these cuts in the external actions appropriation, which are much too drastic.
The Minister said that the Council found that there was still more room for reappropriation, and that is what it has done.
With all due respect to the Minister, we find this explanation unconvincing.
In the absence of any serious justification, I am inclined to believe that these reductions express the half-heartedness of the Member States in entrusting the EU with a strong foreign policy of its own, not to mention the absence of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Council, the European Council and the High Representative in these matters.
Â Â  Madam President, everyone acknowledges the role aid can play in improving development, and President Barroso himself promised EURÂ 300Â million more for aid for trade at the G8 Summit this year.
As the budget spokesman for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I asked the Commission how much we currently spend on aid for trade, and it took them two weeks to work it out, because it is currently spread over around 120 different budget lines.
In fact, we spend around EURÂ 700Â million already.
The Trade Committee believes that we need to bring more visibility to aid for trade, that we need to make it easier to mobilise aid for trade and that we need to send the right signal in advance of the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December that we take aid for trade seriously.
We are therefore going to propose the creation of a new budget line called 'Aid for Trade'.
A very modest proposal because, for 2006, we are not actually asking for any money, we are simply asking for a PM line and the creation of a legal base.
Therefore, in future years, if the political will is there, we will have the legal base to bring under one single heading the aid we already give for trade.
This will be an important step forward in terms of being able to mobilise these funds in the future.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to comment on two points, echoing MrsÂ Jensen.
As permanent rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for the Structural Funds, I would like to draw your attention to the reduction, for several consecutive years now, of the amount allocated to payment appropriations in Heading 2 dedicated to structural actions.
In the context of a crisis of confidence in a Europe that is apparently no longer able to offer its citizens a reformed economic model, a competitive model, a model that is fit to rise to the great challenges of the 21st century, the Heads of State or Government have thought it appropriate to reduce by EURÂ 150Â million the amount of payment appropriations proposed by the Commission.
Well, this investment expenditure implemented by the Structural Funds is, as we know and as we keep saying, a major challenge for our European economy.
Europe needs more than ever to invest in infrastructures in order to maintain its competitiveness and its jobs, undoubtedly just as much in the new Member States as in the others.
This EURÂ 150Â million reduction is therefore out of keeping with the findings made by our Assembly with regard to the new challenges confronting us.
I would also like to draw your attention to the major ecological risk to which the draft budget is exposing our continent, as the budget for the agencies as a whole is being maintained at its previous level, in particular that of the European Maritime Safety Agency which, in the wake of the and disasters, was entrusted with the highly important task of implementing better monitoring of discards and of chartering anti-pollution vessels in the event of an accident off our coasts.
The Council has inexplicably proposed reducing from 29 to âŠ
Â Â  â Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, we would point out that, with the proposals for the 2006 budget, the Commission and the Council have failed to rise to the occasion.
The Commission has cut the budget for agricultural policy, especially for the guarantees section, by approximately EUR 1.9 billion below the financial limit, on the basis of unrealistic forecasts for purchases of agricultural products in 2006.
At the same time, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture has made an unexplained linear cut in spending of a further EUR 150 million.
The result of this overall reduction, which totals approximately EUR 2.2Â million, is to create a climate of insecurity for producers, at a time when they are being called upon to apply the new common agricultural policy and the new terms of competition by international trade.
How will the Commission and the Council be able to address the problems of dairy farmers, of small arable farmers, of wine producers who see quality and products being ousted from the market, and of sultana producers and fruit producers, as well as the problems of young farmers?
Will you reply, 'by strengthening research and technology'?
That has already been reduced under the Council proposals and has already been reduced by the financial perspectives.
In addition, the appropriations for rural development may be exhausted, but they are inadequate to meet the real needs of rural development in the face of enlargement.
As far as the proposed appropriations for equal opportunities are concerned, they are inadequate to meet the real needs which arise from the competitive environment.
The proposals for the 2006 budget must come up to expectations and to the demands of modern Europe and, more importantly, of its citizens when it is the final budget, a budget which relates directly to the financial perspectives.
Â Â  Madam President, I agree with one point made by the President-in-Office of the Council in his statements this afternoon, namely that we have to spend the funds as wisely as possible and that we must have a realistic budget.
As far as this economy is concerned, I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is aware of the statistics that show that European expenditure, which falls within the remit of the European Parliament, has increased by 8% over a ten-year period, while Member State expenditure has risen by something like 23%.
I do not therefore believe that it is for the Council to teach us a lesson in responsible budget management.
The cuts are unsurprising, as usual.
There will always be cuts in agriculture.
I understand that cuts are being made this year because certain budget lines are high and can therefore be cut back.
The ad-hoc procedure has been in place since the Amsterdam Treaty.
As the Council itself states, we will have a realistic estimate in October.
Why not wait for that?
The Council also wants to cut back on pilot projects and preparatory actions.
But why?
Some of those actions are excellent and certainly now, with avian influenza, we will need to do more in this area.
Finally, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether, in his view, the Council has kept to the agreements made in 2004 about the Council informing Parliament on the common foreign and security policy on a regular basis and at a high level.
The Council has, in my opinion, not kept its word.
Â Â  Madam President, we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have held intense debates over recent months, with the imminent negotiation of the Seventh Framework Programme and other important initiatives in mind.
Our debates have allowed us to clarify our needs and objectives in relation to science, technology and innovation.
We must make use of all we have learnt when working on our budget for 2006.
This budget must be governed by the political approach and the priorities we have been establishing, and must not contradict them in any way.
If we want to pursue the Lisbon Strategy and the recommendations of the Locatelli report, this Parliament cannot under any circumstances accept the proposed reduction in all the headings relating to research and the promotion of innovation in small and mediumâsized businesses.
Similarly, the significant reduction in the headings for research on sustainable energy systems and on sustainable land transport contradicts what we have been hearing and advocating repeatedly in our Committee.
What is more, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament do not agree with the drastic reduction in the headings aimed at combating serious diseases.
Â Â  â Madam President, in the budget before us there is a clear discrepancy between the aspirations and the rhetoric of the Union in the area of employment and social affairs.
It also reflects the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the funds involved in its implementation.
Whilst I welcome the Commissionâs decision to bring forward the pilot project of the European Year of Workersâ Mobility, I was sorry to learn that at first reading the Council cut the appropriations proposed in the preliminary draft proposal by EURÂ 2Â million.
Given that the budget is already low, this reduction amounts to a glaring lack of political will to make this pilot project a success story, rather than merely a desultory campaign.
I also regret the paucity of appropriations for EURES, the essential instrument for developing the single European labour market, which is tantamount to discrimination in relation to the amounts requested and obtained by Parliament this year.
The funds earmarked for social dialogue have also been cut in relation to the preliminary draft proposal, which runs counter to Parliamentâs position.
What is more, the European Social Fund has also seen its proposals reduced.
At this rate, how can we hope to establish a more social and more competitive Europe?
No chance!
Â Â  Madam President, first I would like to thank everyone for their amicable approach.
The Councilâs 2006 draft budget is based on payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the EUâs Gross National Income, which is to say approximately a billion euros above the 1% limit.
This, moreover, was achieved by cutting expenditure by half a billion euros as a matter of course.
As the new Member States are only just starting to become involved in the EU budget, the Councilâs proposal shows that the 1% ceiling for expenditure, as suggested by certain states, will be impossible to put into effect.
The 2006 budget will be the last to be drafted with reference to the current financial perspective.
Unless a new financial perspective is established, the institutions will find themselves in a situation in which there is no agreement between them, and that would lead to total economic uncertainty and stagnation in the EU.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget in June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was less than enthusiastic about it.
As we see it, the funds provided are simply not adequate to facilitate the proper implementation of European environmental and health policy and our policy on the safety of food.
We now have 25 Member States, yet there is to be only less than a 1% increase for environmental matters, and, in public health, no increase whatever beyond the 2005 level.
That alone is ridiculous enough in the eyes of some Members, but now the Council has excelled itself by cutting the estimates, which were low enough in any case.
In their speeches on television and in public, all the members of the Council talk endlessly about their desire to build a citizensâ Europe.
Here in this plenary, we have just heard that there is to be another rise in peopleâs standard of living in Europe, even though the funding for such a policy is being withheld.
Now that really is what I call confidence-building!
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I simply wanted to say to you that I find this impromptu meeting, which is unusual in the budget procedure, to be peculiar. In my opinion, it makes little sense.
On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I also wanted to express our disappointment faced with the sombre cuts made to programmes that Parliament feels very strongly about, such as PRINCE concerning information for European citizens, and in particular faced with the cuts that have been made in headings promoting new resources for SMEs.
Finally, in order to have a worthwhile European policy, human resources must first be given to the committee.
That is what is missing in the draft budget proposed to us and, on behalf of my committee, I wish to inform you of our utter disappointment.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I wish to inform the House that the Committee was guided by three considerations when formulating its position.
The first of these was projects in the field of transport policy, the second was the report on European tourism, and the third and final consideration related to the fact that this is the last year of the current Financial Perspective.
The position adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism is as follows.
Firstly, we wish to boost funding for the implementation of the planned Trans-European Transport Networks by EURÂ 120Â million, and we are opposed to savings in this area.
Secondly, our aim is to introduce a budgetary line for tourism, for the first time in history.
Thirdly and finally, the Committee unanimously rejected the Councilâs proposal, in particular with regard to measures to prevent marine pollution.
Our guiding principle in this respect was that we are helpless in the face of the air and land-based disasters that we experience or witness.
We should ensure that we are not helpless in the case of disasters at sea, and that we are capable of responding to such disasters.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, the Hague Programme states that, in the area of justice and home affairs, our first priority is to create full-blown policies to promote fundamental rights for all and policies strengthening citizenship.
We note that, up to now, the European Union budget continues to prioritise the strengthening of repressive policies.
We wish to find a fair balance between freedom and security.
The budget must also be balanced, and we very much hope that we shall move from important speeches to action.
It is not enough for our leaders to state their desire to promote citizenship and equal opportunities.
They must act and give us the resources for implementing this much-vaunted policy.
The European Union has a great challenge to take up: equal opportunities for all.
We know that all forms of violence are rooted in injustice, and it is in our interests to equip ourselves with the resources to fight against injustice.
Â Â  Madam President, if Europe wants to be accepted by its citizens, we have to be perceived to be working for them.
This is most evident in Category III, and it is there that the Council has made the most swingeing cuts.
If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-led and dynamic region in the world, we have to put aside more money in the budget for this.
Mr BÃ¶geâs report serves to show Parliament the way to go about this, with investment in education, research and youth, and consistent application of gender budgeting â from which, however, we are light-years away!
Plans, the Lisbon Strategy, the Youth Pact, ambitious action programmes in research, culture and the media â all these things you adopt and then slash the funding needed for their implementation.
If we want people to approve of our policies, we have to act in accordance with them.
I am grateful to Mr Pittella for laying bare the contradiction in what the Council is doing, and I call on the Commission to join this House in taking an approach that will equip us with a good budget that will come across clearly to the public.
Â Â  Madam President, the laying down of a sustainable common fisheries policy will do nothing to make our tasks in this area less daunting.
Let me give just a few examples to illustrate why it is so extraordinarily difficult to enforce the Communityâs requirements without the funding to do so: the restructuring of the fisheries sector in the new Member States, improved controls in fisheries, international fisheries agreements such as the forthcoming one with Morocco, fisheries research to provide better data on the basis of which to manage stocks.
It is for this reason that we endorse the Commissionâs preliminary draft budget and reject the Councilâs.
Â Â  â A large number of us, if not all, maintain that the internal market is the political and economic mainstay of the European Union, and thus we cannot permit that the funds allocated for next year to this crucial sector, be reduced by more than a third: from 12 million euros to 7.66 million.
This reduction goes against all that which we have discussed here in the past months.
We also have to make sure that one of the most positive and visible features in this sector, that is, consumer protection, be given the necessary resources to be able to operate.
It is not possible that with a much greater European Union with many more consumers whose rights we have to defend, the funds allocated to this sector will be even less than those for 2004.
We also have to learn from what happened a few years ago, we have to see that our consumers will be more informed and better prepared so that abuses are reduced to a minimum when the new Member States introduce the euro.
These are the proposals which my friends in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection agree about.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr PresidentâinâOffice of the Council â who is no longer present â Commissioner, it is not usual to hold a debate on an amending budget.
In fact, other amending budgets are presented in this Parliament without any debate, even when the financial sum involved is greater.
We should recall that this amending budget for aid for the tsunami has required two different trialogues. It took up a significant part of the conciliation procedure of 22Â June and furthermore, it has led to long and complicated discussions amongst the three institutions.
I must acknowledge the efforts made by the PresidentâinâOffice of the Council at the time, particularly since he is British, and the British are very tough negotiators.
I must recognise that he showed a degree of flexibility without which it would not have been possible to reach an agreement.
A solution has always been sought on the basis of the Councilâs original position, which was completely unacceptable to the other two institutions.
The Commission originally presented a proposal for the funding of aid for the reconstruction of the countries affected by the tsunami which we in Parliament considered to be acceptable and logical.
I recognise that if the Council had shown greater flexibility from the outset, we would be in a position to vote today for the European Commissionâs original proposal. This is because the European Parliament had faith in the Commissionâs proposal despite the fact that it involved reprogramming, which also has its drawbacks, as our colleagues in the Committee on Development quite rightly pointed out.
We in the Committee on Budgets believed that such reprogramming was inevitable, but we demanded that it be confined to the Asia programmes or that, at least, the duration of the aid scheduled be extended.
Nevertheless, both the European Parliamentâs statement and the statement by the Council in January of this year said that none of that EUR 350 million, which amounts to the bulk of the reconstruction aid, could be financed from the budgetary headings already committed.
To put it another way â and this is what the Committee on Budgets and this rapporteur have been saying throughout. The new financial resources are necessary in order to fund new external commitments.
This was our main point of disagreement with the Council and the reason for so many failed negotiations.
The outcome has been that it has taken nine months to adopt a final decision.
It has unfortunately taken that long to reach a decision on the mobilisation of all of this aid in order to present it for the approval of this House.
The Council intended to finance part of this reconstruction aid by sacrificing programmes already established by the European Union.
Finally, the agreement has been reached at the expense of the emergency reserve, which was the solution proposed more modestly by the Commission in order to gain the agreement of the Council.
We in Parliament insisted in particular on the mobilisation of the flexibility reserve but, in the end, we have decided to accept a proposal mobilising the emergency reserve to a greater degree than we felt was prudent.
Let us hope that there will be no need to mobilise any more than the sum currently available in the emergency reserve during the last few months of 2005.
The PresidentâinâOffice of the Council said in the previous debate that he is optimistic about the additional EUR 13 million that we have to fund in 2005.
I too am optimistic, since, as the report makes very clear, we still have EUR 293 million in the flexibility reserve to mobilise.
I am therefore sure that we will be able to find that 13 million in the flexibility instrument because at this stage we feel it is unrealistic to think that 13 million can be obtained in the final budgetary implementation of 2005.
What is more, I do not believe I would be able to present a proposal of that nature in Parliament.
In conclusion, what is clear is that the European Union may well be top of the league when it comes to issuing important and solemn declarations which affect all of the institutions and represent a commitment in the external field. Unfortunately, the Union is in bottom place when it comes to turning the declarations it signs so solemnly into financial commitments.
I hope we draw all the possible conclusions and lessons from this process and that, from now on, we can act much more quickly when it comes to unblocking aid to other countries.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, we heard earlier some very statesmanlike things from the British Presidency of the Council about the demands of foreign policy, accompanied by some calculations with virtual figures, but, as regards the compromise that has emerged from negotiations and that we unfortunately have to discuss today, I agree entirely with what was said by Mr Garriga Polledo in his capacity as rapporteur on the amending budget, namely that it does in fact stand in contradiction not only to these statesmanlike utterances but also, for example, to the response to this great catastrophe heralded by the Council conclusions of 7 January this year.
It follows that what we unfortunately have to discuss is a marvellous example of the credibility, of the occasional haggling and of the questionable timescales, all of which evidently exemplify the only response to inevitable and current challenges that the European institutions can sometimes manage.
This should be a lesson for all of us as we prepare for the negotiations on the post-2007 budget framework and on the instruments that will be needed in future.
At the outset, the Commission came up with a proposal that envisaged such measures as the use of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EURÂ 98 million.
From a total of EURÂ 170 million, EURÂ 15 million have emerged in this amending budget, while the EURÂ 13 million that we have not yet come up with are to be found from somewhere over the coming months.
It is also worthy of note that funds have been reallocated from budget lines that were already intended for this region.
The Council, and its British Presidency, cannot escape questions as to how all this can be in line with the great Millennium Goals, to which they, in their statements, have repeatedly affirmed their commitment.
Let me remind you that, as we read the situation, the Council does not exactly appear to have simply goggled like a rabbit confronted with a snake and said: âNo, we cannot give more than 15 million, or else we will have used up the 200 million in the flexibility instrument for 2005.â
If the N+2 rule had been applied, there would have been plenty of margin available.
While I am on this subject, the point has to be made that it was the European Parliament that said, from the very outset of the negotiations following the Heads of State or Governmentâs adoption, in 1999, of Agenda 2000, that Category IV was chronically underfunded, in the same way that foreign and security policy and the neighbourhood policy were likely to be chronically underfunded if the Luxembourg compromise for the new Financial Perspective were adopted.
With the worst-case scenario in mind, we insisted on the provision of a flexibility instrument and were partly successful in negotiating one.
Events have proved us right, for the fact is that unforeseen measures have made it necessary for this flexibility instrument to be resorted to every year, so what I want to say is that the embarrassing situation in which we find ourselves as regards time and resources obliges us to agree to this compromise.
I would like to make use of this debate to reiterate that we, not least in the course of negotiations on the next Financial Perspective and the instruments associated with it, will do everything possible to introduce greater flexibility and more room for manoeuvre.
Let me repeat what the plenary said in the relevant report, namely that Parliament will regard that aspect of its position which refers to the creation of reserves for emergency situations as non-negotiable.
You will be familiar with the figures that we quoted on that occasion.
We sometimes get the impression that the Commission, and particularly the Council, would rather not negotiate about figures at all.
At the end of the day, though, we will have to come to an agreement on them and find a way in future to deliver responses of this kind faster, more promptly, and with greater credibility than we have done in these proceedings.
Â Â  . Madam President, the tsunami affected large numbers of people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives.
The response of the European population, European governments, the European Commission and the Member States was overwhelming.
In Sri Lanka alone, institutional and public commitments came to about EUR 5.8 billion.
In Indonesia some EUR 8 billion has been committed.
However, promises and delivery, pledges and action are very different.
I have just returned from Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
In Indonesia I talked to Mr Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, head of the Indonesian reconstruction agency.
He told me they cannot spend the money as quickly as we think they can.
He thought he could spend it in four years, while the President of Indonesia wants to spend it over a period of five years.
In Sri Lanka, I regret to tell you that very little has happened.
Nothing much has changed.
The government is blaming the international NGOs and the NGOs are blaming the government.
I am the budget draftsman of the Committee on Development.
We adopted that opinion yesterday in my committee.
I tried to explain that, although the needs of the Commission are paramount, I recognise that it has to make commitments, put money in the trust fund and then start spending those funds on whatever projects we have undertaken.
The capacity of Sri Lanka and Indonesia to absorb this huge amount of money transparently and properly is minimal.
The Sri Lankans are still shifting paper around while people are still living in tents.
Nothing has changed in the last seven months, since 26Â December 2004.
It is a tragedy and a scandal.
However, we need to understand that, no matter how generous we are in giving and in wanting to help the people most in need, absorptive capacity and the ability to act fast in times of crisis are limited.
As we have seen in New Orleans, even the most powerful nation in the world is unable to cope with tragedies of this kind.
It has taught us that our Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has more expertise and is better prepared to deal with these emergencies than any other institution in the world.
The one positive contribution we can make is to teach people what we have already learned on many occasions.
One of the things we can do with the tsunami and in New Orleans is to give advice and guidance.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it took us nine months from the day this disaster struck to sort out the funding for reconstruction.
That is no cause for rejoicing, but rather a cause for concern and a reason to take an inventory of our own options and capacities.
When one considers the causes underlying this, one can certainly describe what the Council and the Member States have been getting up to as âkangaroo politicsâ â a lot of leaping around with an empty bag.
One problem that would not go away was that, although Parliament had rightly called on the Council to do what it had promised, the Council, unfortunately, did only half of it and with a great deal of resistance.
I find this highly regrettable.
Having given undertakings, it then left it to Parliament to deliver on them.
The debate on the technical aspects of funding was largely intended as a substitute for money.
While that is ineffective, it is very much what one would expect from the conduct of many Member States, for, although 22 of them committed themselves to a programme of reconstruction, only nine of them have, according to the Commissionâs website, handed over any money so far.
In the same time, only three of them have come close to finishing all the things they undertook to do.
I might add that the website was last updated on 20 May this year, so the Commission is in no hurry to bring its achievements in the area to peopleâs attention.
As I am told that that is the most up-to-date information on the progress of the debate, I would like to congratulate the Council Presidency on being, according to the statistics available on that site, well ahead so far when it comes to doing what it has promised.
We have to ask ourselves what Europeâs promises of aid in the aftermath of such calamities are worth.
Let me remind you also of the Iranian city of Bam, stricken by an earthquake a year before the tsunami.
To date â at least according to the âRed Crescentâ â 17% of the aid promised from around the world has actually materialised.
We keep our word; if we cannot manage to fulfil our commitments, it is better not to make people empty promises.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to talk about the amending budget for which we have been waiting for so long.
It relates to the activities that we committed to financing in order to support the reconstruction of the countries affected so seriously by the tsunami in DecemberÂ 2004.
Like you, I deplore the Councilâs attitude.
The budgetary authority has taken all this time to release the promised funds.
In January, or even back in December, the EU promised EURÂ 350Â million.
Nine months later, we are only just going to manage to donate EURÂ 170Â million over 2005.
On 27Â April, the Commission proposed a preliminary draft budget and called for the necessary mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to a level of EURÂ 98Â million.
The Council, however, would not hear of this mobilisation.
You know, it is a terrible thing, this Councilâs slogan is âHands off my money!â
It is terrible that we have a budgetary authority that takes on responsibilities and commitments, but refuses to see them through.
We have therefore had to negotiate bitterly in Parliament over the last few months in a struggle to extract EURÂ 15Â million from the flexibility fund.
That is why we have had to reallocate EUR 60Â million from other humanitarian actions in order to reach a balance and to find the EURÂ 170Â million.
I have to tell you that we consider this to be a scandal, because no poor country has become richer; quite the opposite, poverty is spreading in all these countries.
There is still EURÂ 70Â million in the emergency reserve; let us hope that we will not need it at the end of the year.
Of course, we support this agreement because it is urgently needed by the populations and citizens affected by the tsunami.
But what a mockery!
Gentlemen of the Council, I would ask two things of you: first of all, do not make any more promises, because you are never able to keep them.
Secondly, I must tell you that you have notified us, but what good is the Councilâs commitment with regard to the financial perspectives?
I now turn to MrÂ BÃ¶ge to say: let us take account of this event, of this problem, when negotiating the next financial perspectives.
Even where the Council has taken note of it, it does not keep its word or its commitments.
Yes, the European Union really is sick.
The citizens have noticed it, but in general the fault is with the Member States, who have forgotten that we need to build the European Union together, for the citizens of Europe, but also for the position and the generosity of Europe, because we have a duty towards all the countries of the world, and more particularly towards the people affected by the tsunami.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Amending Budget No 4 before us and the use of the flexibility instrument aim at dealing with the tsunami catastrophe in Southeast Asia.
The European Union wants to contribute EUR 350Â million in the form of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to the areas affected by the disaster, of which EUR 170 million will be granted this year.
Approximately EUR 85 million of this is âfreshâ money.
The amount is considerable, the next largest after that pledged by Australia and the United States of America.
It shows that the EU is endeavouring to have a responsible role in dealing with major catastrophes.
In December, the EU managed to set aside EUR 123Â million in this yearâs budget, of which food aid accounted for EUR 23 million, and the emergency relief reserve EUR 100 million.
Now the issue is one of reconstruction assistance.
Reconstruction is a huge project.
It means clearing up entire regions, the repair and construction of homes, and reviving the economy.
With this purpose in mind, the revival of fishing as a means of livelihood, for example, is vital.
It is a positive sign that the European Parliament and the Council should have reached consensus on financing arrangements in July.
Recently, cooperation between the Council and Parliament has not been exactly brilliant in matters relating to the budget, and that reached an acute stage in the complete deadlock in talks on the financial framework in June.
The fact that consensus was reached even on this important issue shows that positive results can be achieved in the work of the EU, if only we can recognise our joint responsibility.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ and representatives of the Council, I would like to start by thanking Mr BÃ¶ge and the other speakers for their unambiguous statements earlier on in the debate, particularly in view of the serious wrangling that has gone on between our three institutions over the past nine months.
I will join them in recalling how, in response to this dreadful tsunami disaster and for the benefit of the world public, the Council announced Europeâs intention of making available EURÂ 350Â million worth of aid for the tsunamiâs victims.
That was announced at the beginning of this year and was intended to run throughout 2005 and 2006.
While we had a share in making this commitment, it is also, of course, by it that we have to judge the Council.
We have already heard about the fierce debates that have gone on, particularly in relation to the so-called flexibility instrument.
About these, I have to come to the same conclusion as some of the previous speakers, namely that the debates we have had over the past nine months with the Council have sometimes been a cause for real shame, and I can do no other than forthrightly criticise the Council for the way it handled them.
I also take the view that the funds made available for other aid programmes in Asia, which some now want to use for emergency aid, must be replaced whatever happens; the Millennium Goals demand it, and I believe that the credibility of the European Union is at stake here.
If you make promises of that sort and want global public opinion to give you credit for them, you must also have the political guts to put these resolutions into practice and make the necessary resources available.
Like others who have spoken before me, I regard the compromise that has emerged from our negotiations as highly problematic.
I do believe, though, that the European Union had to consider the victimsâ needs and could not have waited any longer to vote these funds once and for all and to make them available, for to do otherwise would have adversely affected its credibility.
I cannot, however, forbear to criticise the Council in strong terms for their petty-minded and obstructive approach to negotiation, particularly when set against what they have made known to the world.
Despite that criticism, and in view of the difficult negotiations that await us in 2006, I call upon them to ensure that these negotiations take a different course and that we will again be able to avail ourselves of the flexibility instrument for emergency situations such as these â that is to say, in the way it was intended to be used.
A challenge such as that should not be met with a small-minded response.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
As a member of the Committee on Development, I visited, together with MrsÂ Morgantini, the chairman, Mr Deva, the rapporteur, and other Members, the areas hit by the tsunami, and in particular the Indonesian region of Banda Aceh.
The scale of the damage is truly remarkable: entire communities have been destroyed and swept away by natureâs fury.
The local population, however, despite suffering from the loss of material goods and of loved ones, is rolling up its sleeves and rebuilding its future.
Europe, as was its duty, did not shrink from the obligations of solidarity.
Not only did the institutions take swift action, but many, very many ordinary citizens also thought it their duty to help out and make a contribution.
As part of these comprehensive, rightful and appropriate efforts, the proposal by the rapporteur that EURÂ 100 million be allocated in 2005 for reconstruction and recovery should be supported.
This figure is in addition to the EURÂ 123 million already provided for humanitarian aid and the commitment to pay the remaining sum of EURÂ 250 million in 2006 and 2007.
As representatives of European citizens, however, we also have the responsibility to intervene with the relevant authorities, particularly in Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, to ensure that the aid reaches the people quickly and that as a result work is done and the necessary steps are taken to achieve effective, visible and concrete improvements in the living conditions of these peoples.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I have risen to speak in this debate on amendments to the 2005 budget and the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because I believe that the proposals contained in the Garriga Polledo and BÃ¶ge reports will enable the European Union to honour the commitments it has entered into vis-Ã -vis the countries hit by the tsunami.
I should like to take this opportunity to draw Membersâ attention to three problems of a more general nature.
Firstly, it is an unfortunate fact that natural disasters of various types, all of which result in enormous human and material losses, are becoming an ever more frequent occurrence.
The Asian tsunami, the hurricane in Slovakia, the floods in Austria, Romania and Germany, the fires in Spain and Portugal and the recent disaster in the United States are merely some of the disasters that have happened this year.
What this means is that we must set aside significantly more funding in future EU budgets to enable us to provide assistance to countries affected by natural disasters.
Secondly, promises of assistance are easy enough to make, but a great deal more difficult to put into action.
A good example of this is the funding for areas suffering the consequences of the Asian tsunami, which is an issue that has already been raised today.
The European Union pledged EURÂ 350Â million to this cause, but is still attempting to find sources of funding to meet this commitment, which after all is not excessively high.
Thirdly, I would draw the Houseâs attention to the overly long procedures that are in place for organising funding to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters.
A good example of this is the aid for Slovakia, where a hurricane destroyed large swathes of forest in the Slovak Tatras.
The hurricane hit the country in autumn 2004, but it is only now, one year later, that we are sending money to Slovakia to help the country cope with the consequences of this natural disaster.
Such criticisms notwithstanding, I am delighted that the European Union is so actively involved in measures across the globe aimed at overcoming the consequences of natural disasters.
I am quite sure that this Houseâs adoption of the Garriga Polledo and BÃ¶ge reports, which we are debating today, will help ensure that money is made available more rapidly for such matters.
Â Â  Madam President, this issue has been discussed for quite a long time.
It is of course good that we have now obtained a decision and an agreement.
At the same time, I am, on behalf of the Committee on Development, disappointed at the result.
We have always opposed a situation in which resources already appropriated to genuine development purposes within the Asia budget are now partially reappropriated to this disaster.
We have also always maintained that we should, as far as possible, safeguard the disaster reserve and make use instead of the flexibility instrument.
We now have only EURÂ 53Â million left in the disaster reserve, with a good four months of this year still to go.
What do we do if another disaster occurs somewhere in the world?
Our arguments have not succeeded.
That does not mean that they are lacking in relevance or weight.
On the contrary.
We shall support this proposal but go on working to bring about a situation in which efforts in connection with major disasters like this must in the first place be funded from new resources and through the flexibility instrument.
We hope, moreover, that we shall as far as possible safeguard the disaster reserve so that we can take action in the event of further major hardships.
Finally, I would hope and believe that the resources now set aside for reconstruction and readjustment will be used in the wisest possible way and that, above all, as many aspects as possible of disaster preparedness will be incorporated.
In that way, we shall not be making the already vulnerable people who live in that region still more vulnerable.
Â Â  . Madam President, we finally reached a decision before the holidays; this was not easy, and the decision was quite some way from the first Commission proposal.
The experience was a painful one for all of us, mainly because we were slow in delivering on our promises and the respective budgetary authorities were not sufficiently sensitive to each other's positions.
This experience showed how difficult it is to solve our internal problems and at the same time to help those in emergency situations in the world.
Finally, however, we reached a decision, and I hope that you will vote in favour of the mobilisation of the EURÂ 15Â million from the flexibility instrument in this plenary.
Regarding the EURÂ 142Â million on which a decision has already been reached, I can inform you that the commitments have been made.
Therefore, from our point of view, we have done the best we can.
In response to your remarks, I would emphasise that we did everything we could in the way we could, but, of course, the know-how we have on improving administrative capacities to absorb aid can and must be shared.
The Commission will do this in the best way it can.
The Commission understands that, for this year, the issue of the financing of the remaining EURÂ 13Â million is still to be solved.
The Commission will be in a position to come forward with a proposal on the matter by the end of this month.
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0330/2005).
We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . I want to express my thanks to the Member who tabled this question, because it is a very relevant issue.
At the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, the Commission was invited: 'to prepare the extension of the pan-European diagonal cumulation of origin to the countries of the region in a manner consistent with all relevant Community policies and dependent on their administrative capacity'.
The Commission is currently analysing different possibilities to allow diagonal cumulation with the countries concerned.
In any case, any further possibilities of cumulation for the Western Balkan countries will be built on the basis of the stabilisation and association agreements developed under the stabilisation and association process.
The current SAA linking the EU with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in force since 2004, and specifically Protocol 4 thereof, clearly sets out the requirements and procedures for granting preferential treatment to products originating in that country, including the movement certificates and other proofs of origin.
The text of the agreement refers to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the only designation of the country and accordingly that is the only name that can be taken into account as the country of origin on the movement certificates and other documentation required for preferential treatment to be accorded.
Consequently, Member States' customs administrations should not grant preferential treatment to goods which do not comply with the relevant provisions of the stabilisation and association agreement.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to give special thanks to Commissioner KovÃ¡cs for his reply.
It was a comprehensive reply.
I would just like to point out that the European Commission is obliged under the Treaty to defend the .
The includes the decisions taken by the European Union on the provisional name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I should like to ask if the reply which he gave and the concern of the European Commission which he illustrated will also be included in the text of the opinion being prepared by the European Commission on the eligibility of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to become a member of the European Union.
Â Â  . Moreover, I think it is important that administrative cooperation and mutual assistance be provided for in the agreement between the customs authorities of the EC Member States and of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in order to ensure the proper application of the protocol and the correctness of the information given in the movement certificates or invoice declarations.
That completes the first part of my answer.
Â Â  . Cookies, adware and spyware and similar types of software are regulated by Article 5(3) of the e-Privacy Directive.
Under this provision, accessing any user's terminal equipment, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone, or storing information on that equipment is allowed only if the user is given clear information about the purpose of such activities and if the user is offered the right to refuse it.
This is a general rule when such devices are intended for a legitimate purpose, but the situation is different if the purpose is malicious and the intention is to harm a computer system or its user.
These forms of malware are clearly banned by the e-Privacy Directive.
As is generally the case with European Union directives, the choice of remedies, penalties and enforcement tools lies with the Member States.
However, in February 2005, the 25 Member States went beyond the e-Privacy Directive by adopting the Framework Decision on illegal attacks against information systems.
Under this Framework Decision, spyware-related activities involving illegal access and interference with information systems are punishable by criminal penalties of no less than one to three years' imprisonment, and of no less than two to five years' imprisonment when committed by organised crime.
However, legislation is not enough on its own and may produce the expected results only if it is combined with other measures, such as complementary enforcement measures, industry cooperation, including standardisation research, and better user awareness.
As far as enforcement measures are concerned, the EU has a contact network of spam authorities â CNSA that aims to ease enforcement cooperation between national authorities on spam and related issues.
The last meeting of this network was mainly devoted to spyware, often spread via spam, and the challenge it represents for enforcement authorities and industry.
Spam, spyware and adware are just examples of the many security threats that risk undermining the value of the internet and of electronic communications.
The Commission is therefore planning to put forward a strategy for a secure information society that puts together various actions to make electronic communications networks safer from fraudsters, harmful content and technology failures, and to increase trust.
Another big step towards improving internet security was taken by the Commission in 2004, when ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, was established.
This Agency has already hired its first members of staff and developed its work programme, and, in August 2005 â just a few days ago â it established itself in its headquarters in Heraklion, Greece, and will soon be fully operational.
ENISA will help the Community, the Member States and, consequently, business communities to prevent, address and respond to major network and information security risks.
Â Â  I thank Commissioner Reding for her comprehensive reply.
I am encouraged by the measures that are already in place for dealing with this threat.
I believe it is the most devious and heinous threat that faces the world and especially the world economies.
Will the Commission take further action on the likely developments?
This is an ever-changing situation and the inherent dangers are very great.
I should therefore like to know what planning will take place in future.
Â Â  . Let me reply briefly to the honourable Member by pointing out that the establishment of ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, will provide a tool that will enable us to react very quickly to any emergencies or new developments which may occur.
In addition, the strategy for a secure information society, which I will present very soon and which will then certainly be discussed by the European Parliament, will be a second tool enabling us also to react at legislative level, if necessary, and if new technological developments and new abuses of those technological developments occur.
Â Â  As the author of the question is not present, Question No 40 lapses.
Â Â  . The questions have been very politically important for us, including the question I received from Mr Vakalis, but at this stage it is very difficult precisely to guarantee any results during the negotiation process.
That is why I would like to say that I organised a reply in quite a general political manner and I would like to read out this answer officially.
As the Honourable Member implies, the deadlock on the financial perspective has done nothing to reduce the urgency to reach an agreement.
There is a real risk that the necessary measures will not be in place to allow Union policies to be delivered effectively beyond 2006.
We must remain focused on the goal of a better balanced budget with a good compromise between existing spending on our tried-and-tested policies, and our new policy agenda for growth and jobs.
The Commission will provide full support for the UK Presidency, and looks forward to working to promote a timely agreement.
The Commission also looks forward to the efforts of the Presidency of the Council to lead the debate and take the initiatives required to reach a compromise.
When there are significant differences between Member States on the function and the focus of the EU budget, the need for compromise is very clear to everybody.
The Commission will continue to work actively to find a compromise which will enjoy the necessary support amongst Member States, and will allow for the agreement of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to the interinstitutional agreement setting up the new financial perspective.
Â Â  â I should like to point out to the Commissioner that I read her interview with on 18 February 2005.
It was a truly surprising interview.
I should like all my honourable friends to hear part of this fantastic interview and I should like you to tell me at the end if you have changed or if today you will change anything about what you said.
I quote, because the text needs to go down in history: I believe, the Commissioner says, that the proposal of the Six is not possible and that we shall reach a percentage of over 1%.
We continue to support the Prodi proposal of 1.4% because all it does is to add up the financing for policies decided by the Council, such as agricultural policy, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Lisbon Strategy, the trans-European networks and increased spending on research and development.
All these policies, like enlargement, were decided at the summit, not by the Commission.
If the Council does not want to pay, it must tell us where it will make cuts.
What will you change today, Commissioner?
Â Â  . I thank you for your kind words.
If the final question is whether I am going to change my view, then the answer is 'no'.
I stand by the opinion I have held until now.
Â Â  Putting aside the United Kingdom's individual position, would you agree that, in its capacity as the Presidency, it is making strenuous efforts to find consensus in this matter, by touring Member States and discussing with them the different objectives?
There is a wide range of views about future financing but, as I understand it, the United Kingdom, as a Presidency, is trying to be the honest broker and bring together these divergent views.
Do you accept that it is making genuine efforts in that regard?
Â Â  . There were a lot of perceptions and hopes.
I share your hope that the Presidency will want to reach a deal.
If that were the case, we would be very supportive.
Â Â  As Questions Nos 42 and 43 deal with the same subject, we will now take them together.
Following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the media and society as a whole are engaging in ever more frequent discussions about âthe democratic crisis in Europeâ, âthe distance between the bureaucrats and the citizensâ and the fact that âpeopleâs real lives are being ignoredâ.
For the most part these are populist slogans that seek to use the wave of Euroscepticism for political gain.
However, as the outcomes of the aforementioned referenda have shown, there is a real difference between the official position of the EU and its Member States and the opinions of the public.
This is a sign that calls for decisive action, especially as the governments of EU Member States are often keen to take the credit for positive initiatives (including those backed by the Commission), while they blame âBrussels bureaucratsâ for negative, unpopular or unsuccessful decisions.
What is the Commissionâs position, and what plans does it have to address the matter?
More specifically, how do the Commissioners view the situation?
Are there plans for new measures to be taken to project the idea of a united Europe and provide information on the EUâs practical achievements?
How is the Commission going to coordinate its actions in this field with the governments of the EU Member States?
The Commission recently announced what it calls its Plan D, for democracy, debate and dialogue, recognising that much must be done in order to explain to European citizens why the EU is involved in key issues that concern them, such as jobs, the economy, pensions and so on.
Can the Commission indicate in advance of the White Paper that is scheduled to be presented later in the year any of the new initiatives that it will propose with a view to improving communication with EU citizens?
Â Â  . For this Commission, communicating with the citizens of the European Union has been a key strategic objective from the start.
This is why we have been engaged in a lengthy and comprehensive analysis and consultation within the Commission itself and in an equally comprehensive dialogue on this issue with many of the actors concerned, and Parliament in particular.
As a result, the Commission has developed a new approach to European communication based on three strategic principles that all clearly put the citizens at the heart of European policies.
Firstly, the Commission will further improve its efforts to listen to citizens and to take their views and concerns into account.
Secondly, it will better communicate how its policies affect their everyday lives â an aspect mentioned by the honourable Members.
Thirdly, it will go local and adapt its communication to the different citizens' sensitivities according to their country, region, language, and their age, sex, profession, etc.
On 20 July 2005, this materialised in the adoption of the internal action plan to improve the way in which the Commission communicates Europe.
The aim of this plan is to improve the organisation of the Commission's ongoing communication work on the basis of the three principles.
Concretely, this plan gives details of 50 very pragmatic actions â most of them to be carried out immediately, i.e. within the next 12 months â to make the Commission's existing comprehensive communication work more professional and effective.
For example, the Commission will make better use of those communication tools that most people prefer â i.e. the audiovisual media and the Internet â and will do this in the language they understand.
It will provide its staff with specific training in communication skills and recruit communication specialists as well.
It will integrate communication aspects into policy formulation right from the beginning and it will reinforce the Commission's representation offices in the Member States and help them better focus on acting as our ears and spokesmen on the ground by simplifying and reducing their administrative burden.
However, communicating with European citizens is a task that goes far beyond the Commission's remit.
Therefore, the next step will be the White Paper on communication, which is meant to engage all stakeholders and all institutions.
In this paper, the Commission will set out the policy vision and the initiatives that it thinks have to be undertaken in the medium and long term, in cooperation with other actors.
Among these actors are the European institutions: Parliament, in particular, has an essential role to play.
Both the Commission and Parliament already have long-standing good cooperation in this area, which has gained even further momentum in the last months.
However, if we really want to achieve substantial change in European communications, it is true that it is even more urgent to enhance cooperation and coordination with the Member States in order to set up a strong partnership with their governments and regional authorities, civil society and the media as well.
The White Paper will address the role of all the stakeholders and launch a broad consultation procedure in order to give them the possibility to define and organise their input.
Based on the results of this dialogue, common actions will be defined.
Good communication is essential for a healthy democracy.
However, the public debate on Europe in the first half of this year has shown that at present there is no agreement or understanding about what Europe is for and where it is heading.
This is why we need not only a new approach to communication, but also a good discussion about the future of Europe as a whole.
Accordingly, the Commission is developing a plan D â as I have called it â where D stands for dialogue, debate and democracy.
This is also in line with the declaration by the Heads of State and Government at the June European Council stating the need for a reflection pause to organise a broad debate.
In order to reconnect Europe's citizens with the European project, they and their organisations must be given a stronger voice, and we, the decision-makers, must develop the ability to better listen to their concerns and expectations.
The Commission's role in this process would be that of a facilitator, providing support to Member States and civil societies to make this plan D happen.
However, it is essential to avoid as much as possible a top-down approach, as democracies are by definition bottom-up.
Again, this is not something that the Commission or, for that matter, the EU institutions can do alone.
If we are to succeed in creating a more citizen-driven Europe that can meet the challenges of today's globalising world, Europe's policies must also be solidly anchored in the governments and parliaments of each Member State.
Â Â  Thank you for your good and thorough answer.
I would like to add to what has been said by the Commissioner that we should probably add your blog, which I read on the Internet and of which I am a great fan, to what has been listed here.
And now the question: according to public opinion research, when unpopular governments actively promote a good idea, the outcome, as a rule, is contrary to expectations and people do not support the idea.
Half jokingly, half seriously, I would like to ask you: would not it be worthwhile to recommend that unpopular governments refrain from, let us say, active promotion of the idea of a united Europe?
Â Â  . One part of the analysis of the problems we have entered into is that there is too much of what we call the blame game.
The institutions are blaming each other.
The Commission will, of course, use the argument of Member States not wanting to do this or that, or not implementing policies.
The Member States or their governments are keen to take credit for something that is going very well, but if something happens where they have to compromise, they will say it is the fault of Brussels.
Parliament is also part of this blame game now and then.
We have to create, first of all, a modern story of why we need European cooperation.
When people have been asked in Eurobarometer opinion polls, for example, most have said that it is a good idea to cooperate.
They see the added value of working together to counter so many of the problems that one nation can no longer deal with alone.
But we also have to address young people to get them on board.
We have to have some kind of common message of why we need the European Union.
The peace argument is of course still valid but it is not enough.
The young generation needs arguments about how we want to deal with today's problems and tomorrow's problems as well â the ones that they face and are affected by.
We also have to ask for Member State governments, of whatever political colour they might be, to be loyal to the project and to be able to explain the pros and the cons, the problems and the challenges of being involved in such cooperation.
However, first and foremost, we must deliver results, so that people can see that this brings an added value to Europe.
We work together and we are able to solve some problems for citizens by working together in this European project.
Â Â  I welcome the Commissioner's general response and I also welcome the white paper, but I do not agree with her.
I think people need to be told that the European Union is an unprecedented success, compared with anything that went before at any time in history, following unprecedented consultation.
There are consultation groups and citizens' groups; if you had put a group outside Pilate's palace they still would have told you to free Barabas.
What we need is an 'L' plan, not a 'D' plan.
We need leadership to go out and tell people that 60Â million people died in the first half of the last century and this project â this unprecedented successful project â is about ensuring it never happens again.
You cannot have prosperity without peace and stability.
Â Â  . I can only say that I agree.
Leadership is definitely needed as well.
European leaders have to speak out and advocate what we are doing and be able to defend it.
I could not agree more.
Â Â  I support what the Commissioner has said on the information communication policy, which is laid out as a very clear and coherent attempt to communicate better with Europe's citizens.
I wonder whether she has had a chance to look at the preliminary draft budget to see what impact that might have on her ambitions?
Because, without joining in this blame game, it seems to me that the Council will complain that citizens do not understand Europe, but is it prepared to make the means available for the Commission to run a proper information campaign?
Â Â  . Thank you very much for wanting to support me in asking for the resources to be made available.
Of course, fine words are all very well, but we also need the resources to put them into practice.
That is what we are involved in right now, in discussing the budget for 2006 and the future financial perspective as well.
It is very important that we accompany these actions with the necessary resources.
I am happy to announce that I have secured the support of the Commission for a further 50 posts to strengthen the representation offices.
These offices operate in each and every Member State and are familiar with the debate.
We have to equip them in the best possible way so that they can communicate with their own citizens, in their own language, where they understand the conditions, the sensitivities and the debate.
I thank you for your support.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I want to ask what is actually being done about the disinformation being disseminated about Europe and the European institutions.
Is this disinformation being put about by European citizens, or does it originate from outside Europe?
Above all else, who is paying for it?
Would the best response to it not be to train journalists to counter it?
Let us then endeavour, every year, to get a hundred young journalists to come to Brussels, with the best among them to receive an internationally recognised award.
I see it as a matter of absolute priority that Europe be communicated, and we MEPs in particular, being a House of over 700Â specialists, are ready and willing to do it.
Â Â  . First of all, we are investing much more in providing a rebuttal service; this is also a way of responding to the lies that circulate about the decisions taken here or in the institutions.
This is, of course, a reaction, but we also have to be proactive in order to avoid ending up with all these lies or half truths circulating about what is going on.
That is why we also have to engage in education and training for journalists, for example.
Indeed, we invite a number of journalists from Member States every year and these courses are very popular.
These are exactly the kinds of proactive activities we want to improve in order to improve communications.
We are working together with Parliament and the Council to make the rebuttal service more effective.
It often comes from the media; of course, I do not know how much comes from outside Europe â it is impossible to say â but a lot comes from our own media, and we will work with the other institutions to improve the rebuttal service and to be quicker and sharper in how we respond.
Â Â  Is it not the case, Commissioner, that both Parliament and the Commission are going about their information work in the wrong way by often concentrating on four-colour printed matter that nobody reads and which just lies around in information offices?
It is clear that misunderstandings about Europe arise when national governments say what suits them rather than giving the full facts.
There has been debate in Germany about our being the paymaster of Europe.
Different arguments are going on in other countries.
Would it not be helpful if, even on the same day on which a falsehood or half-truth is put into circulation in any one country, an association or a member of the government or a Commissioner were to speak out and give the national press the real facts of the matter?
It would cost nothing and would engender in the national capitals a certain fear of giving voice to falsehoods or half-truths.
Communication with the press is the name of the game, and, so far, nothing has been done in this area, perhaps because the Commission does not have the nerve to speak out against certain national governments.
Â Â  . I share your view that we rely too much on written material, on documents and brochures.
We produce thousands of these brochures every year, but where do they end up?
How many of these brochures are really read and how much do we invest in the Internet, because this is where young people and the younger generation look for information on just about everything?
We have to invest and strike a better balance in how we respond or where we put out information, taking account also of modern traditions.
We have to do both, but the balance has to be improved.
This is one of the actions in the action plan that I presented before the summer.
We have to have state-of-the-art technology.
We have to be more accessible and more reader-friendly in what we do on the Internet, for example.
It is all about using the tools that we have available in a much more effective way.
We have to continue to search for the best ways.
But what one person calls a lie, another person calls the truth.
This will always be an ongoing debate, but we have to be more effective in putting facts and figures out.
That is the role of the Commission, and the other institutions as well.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission must communicate the facts about EU issues and give people opportunities to make their own judgments and choices.
It should not spread political propaganda.
Informing people is one of our responsibilities in serving the public.
It is about transparency and accountability.
This is an area in which the Commission has cooperated constructively with the European Parliament for a long time.
On 20 July, the Commission adopted a package of measures designed to improve communication and with the help of which we wish to show in a clear and pragmatic way how we can improve the dialogue with people throughout the EU.
It is also proof of our commitment to more dialogue, consultation and debate about the role of the EU.
Our measures are based on three principles: listening better, describing how EU policy affects peopleâs everyday lives and giving the message a local slant.
The first principle in particular, that of listening, shows that we are prepared, and have the will, to continue with further democratisation.
It is about more actively soliciting peopleâs views and, right from the beginning, taking account of these when new policy and legislation are drawn up.
MrÂ Lundgren asks me whether I believe that the EU institutions have already been given too much power at the expense of the Member States and would be given still more under the proposal to establish a constitution for Europe.
My answer is no.
Firstly, the fact is that every decision to give powers to the EU institutions is an independent decision by the Member States.
Moreover, the purpose is not, of course, to the role of the national governments but to their opportunities to achieve goals of common interest.
Â Â  It all sounds very splendid when Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m says that listening is imperative and when she emphasises the voluntary nature of democracy, with the peopleâs views being passed on to those given the power to govern.
However, the whole of the debate we are hearing here in the Chamber, not just today but at other times too, shows of course that what actually happens is precisely the opposite.
We must remember what has happened.
We have put forward a proposal about establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Referenda on this proposal have been held in two founder Member States, with the people voting against it.
Surely this cannot be treated as a problem to be solved through more propaganda offices and more money for providing information etc. Must we not respect these votes as a grass-roots decision, that is to say one rejecting the Constitution?
Â Â  If these two ânoâ votes in two important founder Member States of the EU have not exactly plunged the whole of the EU into a crisis situation, they have in any case sent shock waves of a kind through the institutions.
That is also why we are asking ourselves what the explanations are for these ânoâ votes.
What is the import of the ânoâ votes in the Netherlands and France?
It is important to carry out this analysis and simply to listen to the arguments that were used.
We have a fair knowledge of what these arguments were in both France and the Netherlands and of what the explanations for the ânoâ votes were.
The votes also reflect a situation and problems that are more far-reaching and that exist not only in those countries but also elsewhere around Europe.
In my opinion, too much of this project has been reserved for a fairly small political elite, this being a situation we must change.
People today demand more of our democratic systems.
They are better educated and better informed, and they want to be involved and to feel that they can influence matters.
It is in this area that we must improve the way we operate.
As I see it, there are also two routes to go down: one involving a right and the other an obligation.
The right is the right I have as a person to be given information about what is going on, how decisions are made and what is being decided of relevance to me, my everyday life and my future.
The obligation is the obligation of these democratic institutions to inform people about what is happening, what decisions are being taken and how people can be involved and exercise influence.
We cannot pretend that we do not have this obligation also to inform.
Some people call this propaganda but, for me, this is a very important task of ours.
Providing information should be one of our fundamental tasks.
It must, then, be done in a professional and efficient way.
Can you imagine other institution of this size not being engaged in public relations or the task of communication, that is to say having no relationship with those people whom you in Parliament have to represent and with whom we should have some dialogue and discussion.
Â Â  Madam President, this is a point on which I would like to express my agreement with the Commissioner.
Of the 13 countries that have ratified, two have done so by means of referenda.
Those votes are of no less value than those of the countries that have withheld ratification.
The European Parliament is legitimated by reason of being directly and democratically elected.
The Commission derives its legitimacy from the European Parliament and from the governments elected by the national parliaments, and this entitles it to argue politically the case for objectives held by a majority of its own number.
I therefore want to ask you again whether it does not make sense for it to get involved in day-to-day political debate.
If, for example, a manifestly false assertion is made in a given country, should a contrary position or correction on the part of the Commission not be communicated on the same day via national press conferences or by other means, so that such views cannot take root?
Â Â  MrÂ Brok, examples I can mention are cases in which obvious errors are contained in assertions made, statements issued or debates conducted in an individual Member State.
In those cases, the representative office would respond and make sure it introduced a correction or immediately stated what were the facts of the matter.
I believe we must be much more alert to such cases and that we must respond locally.
Such a debate cannot always be conducted centrally from Brussels or Strasbourg.
Instead, debates conducted locally or in the Member States must be responded to.
I do not believe we have been particularly effective in this area.
I believe there is much more to be done to ensure that people have the facts explained to them, especially in the case of highly topical debates.
Â Â  I welcome the initiative concerning the plan for debate, dialogue and democracy.
Obviously, different institutions should provide information about their activities.
Clearly, we politicians should go home and provide information about what is happening here in Parliament and then conduct a dialogue based on the decisions we take.
In addition to the local view, which I believe is very important, I wish, however, to address an aspect I have not heard touched upon in this Chamber today, namely the fact that politics at EU level needs to be integrated not only into national politics but also into local and regional politics.
For example, issues relating to the environment and to the labour market are, of course, of topical interest at all levels.
Are you working to integrate politics at different levels so that people have more identifiable reference points and are able to appreciate the value added by the European dimension?
Â Â  That is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks we have, namely to ensure that the national politicians also have this dimension integrated into what they do.
Out of curiosity, I looked at the agendas of local councils.
I looked at different local authorities in Sweden in order to see what in actual fact ties in with the decisions taken by the European Parliament.
In every case, there were at least three or four issues that could be directly linked up with the debates conducted in this Chamber and the decisions taken here.
Naturally, these were issues of common interest, such as those relating to the environment, trade or competition.
That is why it is important for local politicians to be able to explain that these are concerns we share with other European countries.
That is why we also have regulations that are European in scope.
It is in this way that we must try to solve the problems and to adjust the regulations so that they are applicable at all levels.
That is certainly what will take the longest time before it has become a natural part of the political debate at all levels, but it is something for which we must strive.
The debate is one in which we must engage with the Member States, the governments and the political parties.
