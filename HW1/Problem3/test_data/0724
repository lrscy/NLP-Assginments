As well as this clear need for compatibility, the medium and long-term sustainability of fisheries must be guaranteed.
Yet it must also be guaranteed in the short term.
Whilst this particular issue will not affect Portugal directly, it does have parallels with similar situations in which Portugalâs interests are at stake.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  The Commissionâs proposal is aimed at getting to grips with unduly high fishing mortality rates and the problems of obtaining adequate reproduction in these areas.
The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea showed, for example, in its report that fishing mortality rates had led to the quantities of mature Southern hake and Norway lobster in the Cantabrian Sea and Iberian peninsula being so low that stocks were no longer being replenished through reproduction and were now threatened with collapse.
There is no reason for doing what the Committee on Fisheries has successfully done and voting in favour of watering down the Commissionâs proposal at a time when the Commission is no doubt taking measures to get on top of the problems.
Genuine reform of fisheries policy is required, together with a totally different view of our relationship with poor countries and of what constitutes a sustainable use of our natural resources.
I have therefore chosen to vote against the two above-mentioned reports.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Krahmer on the proposal for a directive on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability, for the following reasons:
Firstly, the directive attaches importance to the environment.
According to the proposal, at least 85% by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recyclable, and at least 95% by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recoverable.
Otherwise, the model in question cannot be placed on the market.
Secondly, the directive provides constructors and the type-approval authorities with a reasonable amount of time to carry out compliance checks on the 600 or so types on the market, a period that takes into account the car industryâs normal production cycles.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mr Krahmer on his important report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC.
I support the report, in particular the guarantees provided by car manufacturers as regards the âre-usabilityâ, ârecyclabilityâ and ârecoverabilityâ of their cars.
Following the Lisbon Strategy, the EU must not overlook environmental policy.
In this regard, one must agree that the manufacturer has a duty to prove that the vehicle concerned is environmentally friendly and to provide disposal firms with a detailed description of a recycling strategy.
Measures such as Member States appointing type-approval authorities to check whether cars are environmentally friendly, and the provision of a longer period in which to implement this directive, 54 months, will ensure that this directive will be properly transposed and that the car industry will be prepared for the entry into force of this Community initiative.
Â Â  I welcome the aim of these proposals to help reduce waste and provide information for consumers.
These proposals reinforce good practice already established in the UK where around 75% of the two million cars and vans reaching the end of their lives are traditionally recovered or re-used.
However, I have some reservations about the benefits of applying the design standard to existing vehicle types, in which case the economic and administrative burden may outweigh the environmental gain.
Â Â  . There is concern about the damage to the environment caused by the inexorable rise in personal car use.
This has given rise to initiatives such as the one before us, aimed at reducing adverse effects by improving conditions for recyclability, re-usability and recoverability.
Given the adoption of amendments intended to make this proposal for a directive more workable, regarding the date of its entry into force, for example, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . We are disappointed that our amendments to the regulation before us were rejected, the purpose of which was to safeguard the present and future of fishermen, of fisheries and of this sectorâs vital role in our diet, particularly in Portugal.
We are compelled to condemn as an act of hypocrisy the fact that Parliament has accepted the inclusion of socio-economic measures aimed at âmitigatingâ the socio-economic effects of these plans, while there is no legal guarantee of Community funding and the recovery plans are not dependent on the existence of these socio-economic measures.
This was precisely the thrust of our amendments: to implement socio-economic measures that would fully compensate the fishermenâs loss of income, so that fishing would have a future.
Unlike those who see the scrapping of vessels as a way of making easy money in the short term, without a view to guaranteeing the sectorâs future and disregarding the fact that many fishermen will lose their livelihoods, we are seeking to guarantee the future of fishing.
Given the problem of sustaining certain stocks of Southern hake and the need for their recovery, the fishermen affected must be fully compensated for the loss of income following the paralysis of their fleets.
In that way, we will meet the prime objective, which is the future of fisheries.
This is why we do not support the report before us.
Â Â  .
I support the report before us in the form in which Parliament received it, because it strikes the balance sought by Portugal and jeopardised by the initial proposal, which laid down a range of measures that would have been damaging to national interests, especially in the short term, without sufficient justification.
Now that that balance has been struck, I voted in favour.
Â Â  We are in favour of Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania being more closely associated with the EU.
Once these countries fully comply with the Copenhagen criteria, they should become members.
That would be a natural development of the enlargement of the EU begun with the ten new members in May 2004.
We are opposed, however, to strengthening the EUâs foreign policy, which is in many respects the aim of the resolution.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly supports the work being carried out tirelessly by Lord Ashdown, the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Of course, we would wish that theÂ functions of the office of the High Representative are gradually incorporated into sovereign domestic institutions.Â However, in the interim period, It is vital that the High Representative retains the right to use the powers expressed in his mandate when the circumstances require it.
Â Â  . Ever since the early 90s, there has been an issue surrounding the name of Greeceâs northerly neighbour.
Three northern Greek provinces bear names with Macedonia in them, and it also plays a role in Greeceâs ancient history.
In the neighbouring country, the resistance movement against the Ottoman Empire before 1912 also used the name Macedonia, and that also became the name of Yugoslaviaâs southern federal state between 1945 and 1991.
It would be obvious to use this self-selected constitutional name âRepublic of Macedoniaâ generally.
Although every state chooses its own name without interference from other states or international bodies, attempts are still being made here from the outside to impose a different name in which only the last letter is indicative of the real name.
If we were to condone this, then Luxembourg would no longer be allowed to be called Luxembourg, because there is the south-eastern Belgian province of the same name.
Meanwhile, Macedonia has been recognised under its real name not only by the US, Russia and China, but also by Slovenia, which is an EU Member State, and by Bulgaria, which will one day be one.
If the EU were to continue to refer to Macedonia by a different name, that would amount to unfair and discriminatory treatment meted out to what may one day be one of its Member States.
Â Â  . In its neighbourhood policy, the EU must pay close attention to the Balkans, because we must monitor closely the development of countries moving towards various integration processes, and because experience of the recent past has taught us that peace cannot always be taken for granted in Europe.
Now that a number of years have gone by since the conflict was at its worst, the Balkan countries are slowly but surely following a path that should give us cause for satisfaction, albeit tempered by the knowledge that much remains to be done.
Let us emphasise, however, that, looking back at the past, we must feel pleased and that, happily, looking into the future, we can feel hopeful.
Â Â  . â The European Parliament resolution on the western Balkans expresses the more general move of the USA and the EU towards new border changes, the competition between them to divide up the area and the EU's attempts to annex it to Euro-transatlantic structures.
The push for the independence of Kosovo, the discussion of the revision of the Dayton accords and the reference to functional problems in Serbia-Montenegro confirm the new cycle of border changes.
However, setting such developments in motion will create a serious situation in the Balkans, which may turn into an explosive situation as a result of the more intense fight between the imperialists to control and divide up the area.
The Balkan people have already paid with death and destruction for border changes as a result of imperialist interventions and wars by the USA, NATO and the EU.
Consequently, Greece as a country, its people, and the other peoples are not safeguarded under any Euro-transatlantic agreements.
There is an immediate and urgent need to strengthen the common fight of the peoples against the ÎU, the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î which, among other things, are the main parties responsible for the tragic situation which the Balkan people are experiencing.
Â Â  The majority ofÂ this brilliant text is related to provisions of the Constitutional Treaty.
I consider this step premature and undermining the sole competence of the Member States in pushing still undecided adoption of the Treaty.
Therefore I vote against the report.
Â Â  The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports reform of the UN Security Council, in order that it better reflects today's world, and also supports improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN.
However, it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat, as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members.
We would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  . When we adopt this report, among the various ideas of major importance, we must not overlook the importance of combating terrorism as one of the central planks of the EUâs common foreign and security policy.
Dialogue with third countries, international cooperation and the implementation of the 2004 EU/US Declaration are crucial factors in this regard.
Against this backdrop, it is essential that we share with our Atlantic allies an awareness of the serious nature of the threats hanging over the free world.
Â Â  In general, I support the development of the common foreign and security policy.
In certain crisis situations, it is natural to use both military and civil resources.
At the same time, it is important that humanitarian principles should not be watered down and that humanitarian operations should not be used for military purposes (something that has unfortunately happened in Iraq and Afghanistan).
It is also important to ensure that resources intended for long-term development cooperation are not used for other purposes.
For these reasons, I have chosen to abstain because the wordings of both paragraphs 45 and 46 can offer scope for arbitrariness regarding these aspects.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report on the European Security Strategy (ESS), which for the first time provides a detailed definition of the concept of security.
The ESS sees security as a prerequisite for development and focuses on factors that had not thus far been considered fundamental to security.
In this regard, among the main threats to global security, it highlights the destructive power of poverty, malnutrition and disease.
The ESS lays down three strategic objectives.
The EU must be capable of, firstly, identifying threats and taking swift action by military as well as non-military means; secondly, promoting security within its immediate border areas, but also those of the future; and, lastly, strengthening the international order.
I should like to emphasise, however, that the EU has serious shortcomings in terms of military means that may hinder its ability to carry out high-intensity humanitarian missions.
The EU must be equipped with the technological wherewithal to assess potential threats.
Â Â  . Whilst I welcome the fact that this report raises issues that are of immediate importance, it does not dispel my objections to the original document on which it is based.
By contrast with what one might expect from a document of this nature, the time spent on identifying threats is kept brief and questions requiring thorough analysis are summed up in short paragraphs, whereas the document devotes much attention to the ways in which to press the European Security Strategy into service.
Either the EU knows very well why it wants these resources â and the reason is not mentioned here â or it does not know why it wants them, but knows that without those resources it has no clout.
Either way, we must express our concern at the lack of depth and substance, by contrast with similar documents drawn up by our allies.
Â Â  We see the fight against doping in sport as a very important issue.
It is so important that, in each and every one of the Member States, it needs to be handled by the national parliament.
We do not view sport and athletics as issues for the EU.
We demand, however, that each Member State should have effective control of the EUâs external borders and combat the trade in illegal substances.
CitationÂ E of the motion for a resolution states that the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis for drawing up and implementing Community action in the field of sport.
One of the reasons for opposing the draft Constitution for Europe is precisely that, absurdly, it regulates matters that the Member States themselves should decide about.
We are therefore voting against this resolution.
Â Â  . âDopingâ in sport is a multifaceted public health issue that concerns everyone, especially those directly involved â sportsmen and sportswomen.
The need to reach certain levels and achieve certain results, imposed by economic â sometimes colossal sums of money are involved â and political interests and mechanisms, which fly in the face of what ought to be the true values and aims of sport, fosters the use of a whole range of illicit substances that are often harmful to the health of sportsmen and women.
Sport should be seen not as a highly profitable money-making scheme for the benefit of a few, but as an educational, cultural and social activity that plays a key role in every aspect of a personâs physical, psychological and social makeup.
Among other measures, an educational and preventative policy must be introduced intended to encourage the healthy physical exercise of playing sport, starting during childhood and continuing throughout a personâs life.
Â Â  . I fully endorse the motion for a resolution on âDoping in Sportâ.
Over a decade ago, I was myself an active weightlifter, although I never, unfortunately, managed to achieve that bodybuilderâs dream figure that was so much in favour with women.
Today, I am glad that I took only lots of protein, and never clenbuterol or anabolic steroids.
Both amateurs and professionals who dope themselves in the hope of finding sponsors, or financial support, and thereby perhaps fame, pay a high price for it.
So often, what was then a star body is now not something you would want to look at.
The IOCâs World Anti-Doping-Agency, which organises intensive research and the monitoring and listing of prohibited substances has acted late in the day, but not too late.
Last year, Germanyâs national anti-doping agency carried out 8Â 000 inspections of training camps and competitions.
In future, doping tests are going to be carried out at 20% of all UEFA competitions.
We need common international standards if monitored athletes are not to be put at a disadvantage in comparison to those who have not been adequately tested.
What is needed is for those who manipulate the winning of their medals and prizes for the sake of profit or fame to be socially stigmatised for it.
Only if sport is doping-free does it deserve recognition, and only if they are clean are sportsmen real examples to others.
Â Â  . I welcome this resolution drawing attention to the problem of doping in sport.
The number of doping incidents over the 2004 Olympic Games again demonstrates the need to combat this very real problem.
The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis to draw up and implement Community action in the field of sport.
Therefore we have the legal means to protect not only increasingly pressurised sport professionals, but also the countless minors and amateurs vulnerable to doping in sport.
I particularly welcome the call for the Commission to support a sustained information campaign in order to establish an effective prevention policy.
It is also important for Member States and the Commission to co-operate closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a way which enables the European Union to act effectively with regard to the prevention and control of doping.
Â Â  . By voting in favour of this resolution I am sharing the concerns as regards the use of drugs in sport, because it debases everything that sporting competition should stand for and because of the public health issues.
Without prejudice to the rules on subsidiarity, it is clear that there is a level of intervention at which it would make sense for the Union to take action that, most importantly, might prove effective.
Â Â  We see this as an issue between the Member States and Unesco, even though the Council of Ministers has authorised the Commission to negotiate on the EUâs behalf regarding those parts of Unescoâs draft document that come within the EUâs competence.
We do not believe that these issues should be for the EU to deal with.
It is patently absurd that the EU should speak with one voice for 25 Member States on issues concerning the diversity of cultural contents and artistic expressions.
We have therefore voted against this resolution in the final vote.
Â Â  . We acknowledge the importance of this Committee on Culture and Education initiative on the convention on protecting the diversity of cultural goods and artistic expression, given the importance of preserving and promoting cultural diversity and on the current negotiations at Unesco, particularly during the current fresh round of talks at the World Trade Organisation, which, under pressure from the large financial and economic groups, would prefer to liberalise all markets and put almost everything up for sale.
The creation of an international instrument in this area will help to consolidate the sovereign and cultural rights of people and countries and foster the development of public policies on international cooperation, and will ensure that cultural products will not be considered merchandise and put at the mercy of free trade and that the citizens have a fundamental right to access to a wide range of cultural goods.
Against this backdrop, it is essential to highlight the crucial role played by the public services in safeguarding, supporting and developing cultural identity and diversity, in guaranteeing pluralism and in ensuring that all citizens have access to content and knowledge.
Consequently, we must also acknowledge the importance of public funding and the determination on the part of the Member States to provide such funding.
Â Â  . If there are areas in which subsidiarity makes perfect sense, one of those areas, as I have said on many occasions, is culture.
This is without prejudice to all efforts aimed at, , cooperation, co-production experiments and Community programming, and without prejudice to international efforts, which should be channelled into ensuring effective diversity in cultural content and artistic expression.
In so doing, we must always ensure that creative freedom, one of the prerequisites of such diversity, is not undermined.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the drought in Portugal.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is well aware of the severity of the drought situation in Portugal.
It understands the concerns and is fully committed to assist Portugal.
My colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, met the Portuguese Minister of Agriculture, Mr Silva, on 6 April 2005 in relation to this issue.
There are three sets of instruments that are of particular importance in assisting Portuguese farmers.
The first concerns market support and direct aid, where the Commission has already acted.
It has adopted two decisions: one on 4 March to increase the advance payments for the bovine premiums for 2004 to 80%, and another on 7 April to allow the use of set-aside land for animal feeding in the affected regions.
Three more decisions are currently in preparation.
The first concerns a temporary derogation from the density requirements of the regulation on the conversion of arable land to extensive livestock farming.
It introduces a corrective correlation coefficient to be applied to the number of livestock units recorded on the holding.
Another decision will extend the use of set-aside land for the feeding of animals to the whole continental territory of Portugal.
In this context, I also want to mention the Portuguese request for transfer of intervention stocks.
Traditionally, the Commission is opposed to such transfers in light of abundant market supplies.
Commissioner Fischer Boel has, in discussion with the Portuguese Minister of Agriculture, accepted the particularly difficult circumstances due to the prolonged drought in Portugal.
She has asked the services of the Directorate-General for Agriculture to discuss the arrangements with Portuguese officials with regard to the disposal of the transferred stocks.
A third decision will authorise, under certain conditions, the advance payment of a number of premiums. These include an advance of 80% of the amount of the suckler cow premium, and 50% of the sheep, goats and dairy premium for 2005.
Under Article 28(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1782/2003, the single farm payment might be advanced as well, provided that it is not paid out before 16 October at the earliest and subject to controls being carried out.
The second instrument concerns rural development.
When natural disasters occur, re-programming is possible.
However, this possibility seems limited as we approach the end of the programming period and resources are scarce.
Portugal asked that farmers continue to receive rural development payments even if certain conditions cannot be met due to the drought.
At the end of January 2005, the Portuguese authorities requested recognition of the drought as a under Article 39 of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 817/2004 and to accept derogations to certain conditions concerning the agri-environment measure.
Application of a requires a number of objective criteria, in particular the severity of the drought and the quantification of the consequences on agriculture and the farming economy.
Some reports are already available and paint an initial picture of the expected consequences.
On the basis of the information available, the Commission has no objection to the Portuguese request.
However, Portugal will be asked for a more comprehensive report.
Portugal may decide to compensate farmers through state aid for income losses resulting from severe drought.
They have to notify their plans to the Commission.
The Commission will do its best to approve such plans quickly.
However, it is essential to prove that the losses due to a climatic event reached a threshold of 20% or 30%; secondly, that there is a direct link between the losses and the adverse weather conditions; and thirdly, that no over-compensation occurs.
The Portuguese authorities can also use the regulation on state aid.
Over a period of three years, up to EUR 3 000 per farmer can be granted in aid without the Commission being notified, provided that, among other conditions, the total amount for the period does not exceed EURÂ 17Â 832Â 000.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we called for this debate, we were naturally counting on Parliamentâs commitment, and, at this point, I should like to express my appreciation to all of the political groups for Parliamentâs show of solidarity.
The drought in Portugal is extremely serious, as we know, and as Mr Borg has just described.
Only a month ago, on 15Â March, around 88% of Portuguese territory was suffering severe, or even extreme, drought, and despite recent rainfall, much has been irrecoverably lost.
According to available data, even with average rainfall over the coming months â and the forecasts do not suggest in any way that this will be the case â we could be facing a situation that only happens once every 40 years.
Farming has been damaged, livestock is at risk, supplies to some communities have already been restricted and all of this in already habitually depressed regions.
Indeed, as the situation becomes worse towards the summer, there is a danger that tourism, one of Portugalâs most important industries, will be seriously affected, and the effects of the drought will spread to many sectors and many thousands of Portuguese people.
Immediate action is also needed to prevent a repeat of the devastating fires of two years ago, which were partly caused by a dry period, albeit not even approaching the scale of this one.
The situation is therefore worthy of EU solidarity and the longer we leave it to show that solidarity, the greater the cost and the less effective the impact.
We therefore hope that the impulse of Parliamentâs adoption of the proposed resolution leads the Commission to take quick and effective action to follow up Portugalâs requests, and there is clear evidence here that they are prepared to do this.
We also hope, should this become necessary, that the Commission will analyse and approve any plan for state aid â already mentioned here â with the aim of creating appropriations to compensate for losses, and of meeting the need to reinvest and restructure the debts incurred by farmers, whose survival is, after all, the reason why we are here today.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his speech and for the Commissionâs openness in relation to the difficult situation that Portugal is currently enduring.
As you know, there is a severe drought in my country at the moment, which is especially acute in the regions of the south of the country.
Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude for the displays of solidarity and support from all Members to whom I have had the opportunity to explain the situation.
I should also like to say how pleased I am to have had the opportunity to table this joint proposal, endorsed by the main political groups in Parliament.
We are at the start of a new dry season in Portugal, after almost no rainfall in autumn and winter, which is normally the countryâs rainy season.
In some regions, ground water levels are less than 20% of the average of the past 40 years.
Consequently, all stocks of animal feed have run out, and, given that neither grazing land nor arable farmland has been growing, and that the use already in reservoirs is still restricted, it will not be possible to deliver new supplies in sufficient quantities for next autumn and winter.
Furthermore, it will be necessary to feed cattle until spring of next year, in view of the fact that normal rainfall is expected next autumn.
This situation is utterly unbearable for both arable and livestock farmers and justifies a swift Commission response to the requests put forward by the Portuguese Government, which will have a negligible impact on the Community budget.
After all, as Mr Borg rightly pointed out, the request is for advance payments and derogations from the rules of various regulations that would, in such circumstances, be impossible to comply with, whereby farmers will not be penalised, and for the granting of state aid to be authorised, especially for small farmers.
Nevertheless, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Portugal should constitute a warning for the future.
We must therefore consider medium- and long-term solutions to this type of problem, such as setting up a protection system for safeguarding European farmers against risks and crises â a timely debate was held recently by the Commission on this issue â and, on a broader scale, reinforcing the Unionâs role at the forefront of international efforts to address climate change and presenting practical proposals for strategic action beyond 2012.
I feel that in the short time I have had at my disposal, I have provided sufficient reason for Parliament to give this motion for a resolution its overwhelming support.
I therefore call on you to vote in favour, secure in the knowledge that, as the Commissioner just said, the Commission will be taking the matter seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to welcome the initiative which has led to this urgent debate in Parliament on the drought in Portugal and begin by expressing all the sympathy and solidarity I feel with regard to this problem as someone who also comes from the Iberian Peninsula.
It is clearly not necessary to be an expert in meteorology nor a weatherman to know that, if it does not rain in Portugal, it does not rain in certain areas of Spain either.
I believe that is pretty obvious and that, therefore, with regard to the climatological dimension of what we are discussing here, the problem faced by Portugal is practically identical to that faced by a large part of Spain.
There is no question that the specific economic effects in the country are different depending on the particular geography or territory in question, however. But the problem of drought, the problem of lack of water, is a shared problem.
That is why we have introduced certain amendments into this motion for resolution, some paragraphs of which extend its scope somewhat so that it does not just effect Portugal, but also, in part, the whole of the Iberian Peninsula.
And I believe that that is what we must do.
Of course, my group is absolutely delighted that specific effects are highlighted, in some cases with very specific references to problems that affect Portugal in particular, and, specifically, the south of Portugal.
But, as the previous speaker said, we should all begin to consider this issue in more depth, because this is not an isolated situation.
The European Commission, therefore, has a responsibility for studying, anticipating and planning in relation to the consequences of climate change, which is not just an issue for great political speeches during great debates, but which has immediate and at times dramatic consequences for the economy of the countries, as we can see in this case.
So that is the first thing I wished to stress: this is not an isolated situation, it is not a crisis that will pass, but it is something that warrants in-depth consideration and therefore requires medium- and long-term political measures.
With regard to the resolution itself, which discusses very specific issues, I would like to stress two or three.
The first is essentially the insistence that the economic impact is a general impact, which goes beyond agriculture; the impact of the drought, for example, directly affects tourism and its entire rural dimension, and that is something that must always be taken into account, especially when we are discussing this issue.
Secondly, the reference to the drama that brings Spain and Portugal very close together, and I would go as far as to say Catalonia and Portugal as well: the issue of fires, of forest fires.
That is an amendment that has been introduced and that does not just affect Portugal and, therefore, I would like to link the consequences of the drought with the extremely serious risk of fires and at the same time appeal for the possible application of the Solidarity Fund to deal with these issues.
I believe this to be very important and that at the appropriate time it will probably require a resolution and debate directly dedicated to this issue.
Â Â  â We have been warning the Commission and Parliament since the beginning of the year about the seriousness of one of the severest droughts in Portugal, the social, economic and environmental effects of which are set to worsen as the summer approaches.
In our question to the Commission in January, and our speech to Parliament in February, we said that urgent measures were needed to address the difficult situation in farming and that immediate steps should be taken to ensure that the water supply in various regions is not cut off.
The situation for farming is giving cause for concern.
The autumn/winter crops were lost and the spring/summer crops, such as tomatoes, maize, rice, fruit and vegetables are at risk; this is also the case with animal feed, and to the normal growth of autumn crops such as citrus and grapes.
Some reforesting that was carried out after the 2003 and 2004 fires has been lost for good due to the lack of humidity in the soil.
This situation plunges thousands of small and medium-sized farms into serious financial difficulty.
Practical measures are therefore urgently required to support Portuguese farmers, such as those measures provided for in the resolution, or, as we proposed, the creation of a public farmersâ insurance fund, financed by the Community, which will enable farmers to be paid a minimum income in the event of a disaster, such as drought or fire; financial support to offset the increased costs and the drop in agricultural production; temporary exemption from social security contributions, with no loss of rights, for full-time farmers with an income of less than 12 Economic Size Units (ESUs) and the extension of interest-free loans for two years.
Furthermore, short- and long-term measures must also be introduced, in order to guarantee that water â a public asset and a universal human right â is made available to the people in sufficient quantity and quality.
We have therefore proposed an amendment emphasising the need to introduce practical measures to support local authorities in the parts of Portugal worst affected by the drought, whilst ensuring that the European Solidarity Fund is activated fairly.
Lastly, this situation once again points up the need to implement the important objectives laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, in order to prevent global warming and the effects that this has on climate change.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Portugal is enduring an appalling drought, with crops being lost, animals dying without food or water, environmental deterioration in the areas affected, increased risk of more forest fires in the summer and populations already relying on water supplies coming in from outside.
Mr QueirÃ³ mentioned earlier that 80% of the country is suffering from the drought.
The agriculture sector has already incurred losses exceeding EURÂ 1Â billion and that figure is set to rise.
The hottest months are approaching, the temperature will rise significantly and no rainfall is expected been May and October.
At this time when we are looking to foster European solidarity with those worst affected, there is support that the EU must provide, much of which has nothing to do with money or subsidies, as Mr Capoulas Santos mentioned, but good will and an understanding of the difficulties on the ground.
Firstly, state aid; the Commission should authorise the Portuguese Government to grant state aid to support farmers who have lost their livelihoods, supporting the acquisition of animal feed and investment in water collection and distribution, and facilitating the restructuring of farmersâ bank debts; secondly, to make advance payment of premiums to which farmers are entitled â in full, not just in part, Commissioner; thirdly, to facilitate the transfer of cereal from Community intervention stocks arising from the surpluses in some Member States; fourthly, to grant derogations from various Community regulations, to which you referred, Commissioner, thereby authorising grazing in set-aside zones or on land planted with cereals already affected by the drought; fifthly, to release funds and mobilise resources to prevent a high number of forest fires this summer following the drought; sixthly, to look into the possibility of drawing on the European Solidarity Fund on such occasions; and seventhly, to reaffirm European positions on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol.
Mr President, Commissioner, the EU works best when it is closest to the citizens.
The Portuguese citizens worst affected by the drought must also be made to feel that they are European citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, my first word is solidarity.
We must show solidarity with the people in the worst affected areas, particularly farmers in the south of Portugal and in the border area.
The situation is at its most severe in the and regions.
We must show that this solidarity does not stop at the border and I wish to reassure Mr Guardans CambÃ³ that it naturally extends to the whole of the population of Seville, Huelva, Badajoz, CÃ¡ceres and so forth, regions that are indeed also suffering the impact of what can only be termed a large-scale natural disaster.
No matter what the regulation says, this is the reality of the situation and this is why solidarity is a key word to use here, too.
I am very pleased to see that nobody has mentioned the word âexaggerationâ â the situation has never been exaggerated, but has been described objectively and accurately.
I am also pleased with the Commissionâs commitment towards helping to tackle these problems.
I should like to place particular emphasis, however, on aspects that are, indisputably, intrinsically linked with a forest strategy that of course depends on Member Statesâ definitions, but which the Commission must also define accurately.
Accordingly, when I hear that, as part of the revision of the forest strategy, the period in which aid due to loss of income can be paid has been reduced from 20 to 10 years, it strikes me that in the European institutions we have still not understood the crucial importance of a proper forestation strategy to combat these instances of near desertification.
It is absolutely vital that income support continue for decades as regards species that take dozens of years to grow, before which nothing whatsoever is produced.
It is crucial that support for the forests in the south of the Iberian Peninsula be maintained and that that support be stepped up in relation to the alternatives.
I would therefore ask the Commission to attach the highest importance to this aspect.
Â Â  â Mr President, as has been said several times in this debate, my country is dry and the situation for arable and livestock farming is verging on critical.
Things are already disastrous, hence the major importance of the proposals on which we are voting today.
They partially alleviate and offset the losses incurred by the farmers.
Other measures are required, though.
It is essential that water, which is a very scarce public asset in the southern countries of the EU, be managed sensibly.
Our civilisation, and my country in particular, continues to waste a great deal of water and this must change.
The same could be said of the current agricultural policy, which undervalues the Mediterranean countries, does not encourage sensible land occupation and does not foster sustainable ecology in the rural world.
In August, when the fires inevitably hit again, we shall once again pay for this irresponsibility.
Lastly, we need new European risk prevention instruments.
Mr Capoulas Santos is right in this respect.
One thing we must do is set up a European farmersâ insurance fund that can channel part of the farmersâ contributions into a disaster fund, a participatory fund on the part of the Member States and the Union, a fund that can be automatically mobilised in situations such as the one in Portugal and the South of Spain, and on other occasions, in whatever country that may be.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to express my sympathy on account of the Portuguese drought and my support for the resolution.
I would now like to speak of the phenomenon that is behind it, however: climate change.
The subject relates precisely to what Finlandâs leading university professors in the field of the environment were speaking about at a seminar held in Parliament here in Strasbourg this week.
One of our themes was climate change.
The seminar was also attended by a leading official from the Commissionâs Directorate General for Research, who had been genuinely delighted with the contact between science and politics in Parliament.
Such cooperation between scientists and politicians is welcome, but, obviously, we should not take it for granted.
The world is not shaped in such a way that academic knowledge simply flows in the direction of politicians.
Sometimes it takes application.
Scientists have no pressing need to come and lobby us.
Although society engages in scientific research, legislators are often unfortunately kept in the dark when it comes to knowledge of this kind.
We often wonder if, for example, the drought of 2003 is an indication of climate change.
Researchers say that the question has been put the wrong way and that there is no straight answer to that.
If we ask whether more droughts can be expected, however, they answer yes; if heat waves are to become more frequent, they answer yes; and if modern society will become more and more vulnerable to extreme weather phenomena, they answer yes.
Now is the time for action, then.
We can no longer wait for more certain answers.
The information we have now should be enough for us to take ever more effective action to avert or slow down climate change.
That is one of our principle political priorities.
An essential ingredient will also be adaptation policies, in which we need to make a determined effort to invest, by redefining our very policy areas and investing in research.
We need, for example, a proper forestry strategy in this situation.
Climate change, regrettably, cannot be entirely avoided, but it is now vitally important to minimise the extent of the human and material damage.
Â Â  â Mr President, as has been mentioned several times today, Portugal is experiencing possibly its most severe drought since 1990 or 1981.
The figures are clear.
As a consequence of this drought, the Alentejo and Algarve regions are at less than 50% of the maximum ground water capacity.
It is April, and as things stand around 25% of Portuguese municipalities have implemented precautionary measures to offset the effects of the drought.
If I mention these figures, and all those that we have heard here today, with particularly strong emphasis, I do so because these have been the most devastated regions of the Portuguese mainland in recent years.
I mention this to you, because these were the areas that received support from the Solidarity Fund when it was activated following the fires in 2003, in which thousands of people saw their livelihoods and their possessions go up in smoke.
I mention the 2004 fires, which ravaged everything that had stoutly resisted the raging fire of 2003.
I mention the areas that are worst affected by the enlargement and that, in theory, became wealthy overnight due to the well-documented statistical effect.
The people who have suffered most are all those who had for many years shown strength and resolve in the face of disaster after disaster, people who make a living from the land, from livestock, from forests, from tourism and from the environment, people of meagre resources.
They have suffered from the drought caused by the weather and from the water shortage, because the reservoirs that ought to act as a safety net are already down to just 30 to 40% of useful capacity.
Commissioner, this would not have happened, or would have been appreciably less severe, if at least in the south the Commission showed it was ready to settle its differences with Portugal over the Odelouca dam and the remaining reservoir network.
This situation is dragging on and has led us into the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment.
I therefore ask you, Commissioner, whether you are prepared â whether the Commission is prepared â to solve this structural problem, so that in the future the people do not have to see such disasters happening again and again.
I naturally thank the Commission for all of the proposals that it has tabled here today as emergency solutions, yet as many Members of this House have said, what we need are practical proposals, some of which are on the table and simply need the Commissionâs approval.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their comments on the Commission statement.
The Commission shares the concerns expressed here on the effects of the drought in Portugal.
As I stated at the start of this debate, we will do what we can to assist those most affected by the drought, i.e. the agricultural community.
These measures will, in turn, also help the affected rural economies.
I have listened to your concerns and your information about the hardship on the ground.
Certainly the Commission will demonstrate its solidarity by putting in place the measures that I listed earlier.
My colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, is conscious of the problems and has done and is doing everything possible to address the situation.
As for the idea of setting up a more permanent structure to deal with such situations, I will forward the information to my colleagues, who will doubtless give it careful consideration.
Other ideas and suggestions have been put forward, which will be given due consideration by the Commission.
A number of you mentioned the need to take a wider look at the issue and at the causes of this kind of drought, which range from climate change to forestry policy.
I thank you for your suggestions and your proposals, which seek to take a longer-term and more coordinated approach to this phenomenon.
They certainly give me much food for thought and demonstrate Parliamentâs commitment to sustainable development, a commitment that is shared fully by the Commission.
The Commission is very sensitive to this issue and to the hardship that it has caused.
We will do what we can and will demonstrate our solidarity with those most affected by this drought.
Â Â  To end this debate, I have received four motions for resolutions(1) which we will vote on this afternoon following the debates.

Â Â  It is surprising that the European Union has yet to draw up and implement a short- and long-term strategy to combat drought and desertification, since, in the countries of the south and the Mediterranean, this is one of the main threats to economic and social sustainability.
The lack of a joint plan between the countries and the Commission (Agriculture and Environment) is, however, all the more striking given that the European Environment Agency has recently stressed that the areas that will suffer most from the negative affects of the expected climate change are the Mediterranean countries.
We therefore support a policy to combat drought in Portugal and any assistance to alleviate the impact of this water shortage on productivity, the market and cultivation itself.
Furthermore, we are asking that it be extended to other countries of the south.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Bangladesh(1).
Â Â  MrÂ President, imagine that, in one of our Member States, bomb attacks were to take place against former ministers, journalists were to be killed and opposition politicians murdered, and people were to be imprisoned and tortured by paramilitary forces.
Imagine if these things were to happen in your own countries.
In that case, we should be debating them every day in Parliament, demanding immediate measures and tackling the problems as rapidly as possible.
That is precisely what the government in Bangladesh has failed to do.
It has not grappled with these problems in time and with sufficient vigour.
This is all the more regrettable inasmuch as Bangladesh has for a long time been a country in which women have had a lot of freedom and the ability to exercise political power.
In many ways, it has been possible to see Bangladesh as a good example of positive development in both economic and political terms.
All this is now in danger of being destroyed if the Bangladeshi Government does not take vigorous action.
I think we must do everything in our power to help solve the problems and improve the situation in Bangladesh.
I find it sad that there are fellow MEPs in this House who want to weaken the resolution when we know how serious the problems are.
I hope that we shall today obtain a majority in favour of maintaining the resolution, without it being weakened by amendments designed to describe the reality as other than it is.
I am pleased that we have finally taken this initiative and are putting Bangladesh on the agenda.
Its people need our support, and that is what we can offer them today.
Â Â  Mr President, Shah Kibria, a former finance minister of Bangladesh, had just finished a speech at an event of that countryâs main opposition party, of which he was a member.
There, upon the spot, he was blown to bits by a grenade; three other people were killed and fifty wounded.
It is with attacks such as this that Islamic extremists have created a climate of fear.
There are parts of the country in which public offices appear to be collaborating with them.
This is an intolerable situation.
Amnesty International and the United States confirm that members of religious minorities are being systematically intimidated, persecuted and are subject to arbitrary arrest.
No satisfactory improvement has occurred either in response to the last resolution by this House, in November 2002, or to the last visit to the country by our SAARC delegation, in February 2003.
Recently, though, the government has had two leaders of Muslim criminal organisations imprisoned and their bank accounts frozen.
We call upon the government to be more vigorous in taking action against extremists.
Bangladesh must also meet its obligations under the internal conventions on human rights that it has ratified.
It must outlaw torture, guarantee press freedom and the free expression of opinion, and press on with the fight against corruption.
Only if it achieves perceptible progress in these areas should the conditions of the 2001 EU/Bangladesh cooperation agreement apply, for it was and is founded upon respect for human rights and the maintenance of democracy.
The differences that exist between the government and the opposition must not stand in the way of their at least agreeing to allow the parliament, currently suspended, to resume its functions.
Both sides must then work to create conditions that do not allow radicalism, paramilitary activity and religious extremism to operate.
Â Â  . Mr President, when, in 1947, the enormous British colonial empire in South-Asia was divided on the basis of the regionsâ predominant religion, the east of the province of Bengal was apportioned to the Muslim State of Pakistan.
It was an overpopulated and flood-prone area, which attracted the sympathy of the entire world, and, in 1971, it broke away from Pakistan, the faraway land in the west that had no interest whatsoever in helping to solve the problems of this eastern colony.
The new state could have made a good start had it, for example, followed the Dutch example of building sea walls and draining populated areas which flooded during storm tides; there would have been more space for the inhabitants and their food supply.
Instead, we witnessed in Bangladesh a grim, clan-based struggle between two parties that are fighting a feud while both denying each otherâs right to exist.
In addition, the country has for some time been dominated by the sort of intolerant religious fanaticism that hardly existed in other parts of the Islamic world until 20 years ago.
This fanaticism leaves no room for religious minorities, including Ahmadiyya Muslims or Hindus.
Intimidation and violent attacks by government supporters go unpunished.
Paramilitary groups, which claiming to fight crime, commit acts of torture and murder.
Bangladesh is at risk of sliding into a spiral of self-destruction.
Widely supported though it has been, a statement denouncing intimidation, violence, torture, exemption from punishment and economic stagnation will do nothing to solve the problem; instead, it should be a starting point to determine how we in Europe can best deal with that unfortunate country in future.
That presupposes, at the very least, solidarity with the victims.
Â Â  Mr President, about a third of this poor, over-populated but democratic country of 140 million people is landless and forced to live on, and cultivate, flood-prone land.
Traditionally the majority Muslim population has lived peacefully with other religious minorities, and Bangladesh has a good record on education and civil rights for women.
The majority BNP Government, in power since 2001, has particular problems with economic reform as it is often blocked by political in-fighting and corruption.
Matters are not helped by the current boycott of parliamentary dialogue by the Awami League opposition.
There have been attacks on opposition figures, that is true, but the authorities to their credit have arrested eight suspects, in spite of them being part of the ruling party coalition, and two radical Islamist groups have recently been banned.
Bangladesh also protests at Indiaâs understandable attempts to fence off the porous international border which is subject to contraband, including illegal drug smuggling.
One encouraging note is that growth has been steady at 5% for the past few years, but Bangladesh now feels threatened by unlimited Chinese textile exports.
We in the European Union need to be patient and give Bangladesh every political and financial support, encourage good governance and the fight against corruption and Islamic fundamentalism.
I call upon the House to support my amendments to produce a more balanced resolution.
Â Â  â The state of Bangladesh was established in 1971 following a struggle for independence.
This predominantly Muslim country is attempting to find solutions to daunting problems in the face of a very high population density, natural disasters and poverty.
The resolution leads one to believe that very little progress has been made, and ignores the fact that successes have in fact been achieved; for example, the country produces enough food to feed its citizens.
It is a great shame that Bangladeshi government and opposition representatives could not have been asked in advance for their views on the resolution, which highlights the modest progress that has been made in a number of fields and emphasises the need to continue moving in the right direction.
The fact that they were not does not reflect well on the European Parliament.
Our attempts to boost democracy in the country are welcome, but it is a pity that we failed to mention any positive signs of democratic developments in the joint motion for a resolution.
Even though we disagree with a number of unproven statements in the resolution, we support the countryâs progress towards democracy and hope it will continue, particularly with regard to preparations for the next parliamentary elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, today is New Yearâs Day in Bangladesh.
It is my heartfelt wish that the blessing of the Lord may rest upon that countryâs leaders and its inhabitants for the New Year.
While there is room for improvement in Europe too, we also have a few suggestions for Bangladesh in terms of New Yearâs resolutions.
Although it is regrettable that the constitution has since 1998 declared Islam the state religion, it does allow other religions to be professed, practised and propagated, so it is odd that it does not protect the âright to convertâ.
Would it not be a sound resolve to better regulate the freedom of religion in the constitution and abolish state religion?
I should like to illustrate the need for this with a real-life example.
On Monday 4 April, reliable sources confirmed that Dulal Sarkar, a Christian, was killed on 8 March of this year.
He was the pastor of the Bangladesh Free Baptist Church in the village of Jalalpur in the south-western district of Khulna.
This man was simply doing his job and was not offending against the constitution in any way.
On his way home, he was attacked by ten armed Muslim extremists and subsequently beheaded.
These Muslim extremists are reported to have links with the Jamaat-e-Islami, a political party currently forming part of the government coalition.
Dulal Sarkar leaves behind his mother, his wife and five children, and at present, his wife and family are forced to move from house to house in an effort to avoid retaliatory action from Muslim extremists.
The draft resolution that we co-signed is therefore extremely clear.
We are indeed deeply concerned about growing Muslim fundamentalism with its paramilitary groups and the abuse of power by fundamentalist Muslim parties.
I am at the same time emphatically opposed to moderating amendments that have been tabled in respect of this unambiguous draft resolution.
I urge the Council and the Commission, in conjunction with the State Department referred to in citation 2(2), to fight these expressions of Muslim fundamentalism. This can be done by applying the penalties referred to in cooperation agreements to violations of democratic principles, all of this in a bid to improve the plight of the Bengali citizens.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Bangladesh is exactly 34Â years and 19Â days old, which means that it is a very young state.
At the same time, it is a very poor state.
Despite the fact that poverty levels have dropped by around 1% per year over the past decade, 50% of the population still lives below the poverty line.
Every year 325Â 000Â children die, or in other words 900 every day, and on average one woman dies every 20Â minutes in Bangladesh, or 26Â 000 every year, due to childbirth-related causes.
The proportion of low birth weight babies is between 30% and 50%, and 30% of the population has no access at all to clean water.
On the positive side, access to sanitary facilities has doubled over the past decade, and now stands at 43% of the population.
The debate we are holding today is political in nature, but I see it as an opportunity to highlight the tragic conditions in Bangladesh, which was formerly known as East Bengal.
I am delighted that the European Parliament has taken up this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, this motion is ridiculous.
We are talking about a country of 143 million people.
It is one of the poorest countries in the world still able to manage its own affairs.
It has been a democracy for some time now. There are parliamentary elections, parliamentary democracy and governance.
The country is about the size of Belgium but has 143 million people.
They are managing to feed themselves for the first time after many years of independence and of course there are problems.
In Sudan, 300Â 000 people were killed, but that does not relate to the issue about which we have just heard: the outrage at somebody being killed.
A total of two ministers out of a government of fifty-six ministers does not make the government Islamist.
We need to have proportionality in our debates otherwise the world will laugh at us.
The European Parliament is supposed to be an important institution, but look at how many Members are here. There are no more than fifty Members in this Chamber and they are apparently so concerned about this.
We must use these human rights debates to talk about serious matters affecting people and their human rights.
Three hundred thousand people have been killed in Darfur.
What are we doing about that?
Let us introduce some proportionality and balance to our debates and give the issues we discuss in these human rights debates some serious consideration.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the European Parliamentâs initiative to draw public attention to the serious governance and human rights situation in Bangladesh.
Todayâs debate is very timely; it is being held against the background of a law and order situation that has suffered a serious decline since the last European Parliament resolution of November 2002.
Abuses against human rights activists, journalists and minorities are on the increase.
The governance situation is at an all-time low and political violence has reached a new climax, as sadly exemplified by the grenade attack in August 2004 and the tragic assassination of former Finance Minister Kibria in January.
We share your concerns about the dysfunction of the countryâs institutions, the culture of impunity, mounting fundamentalism, the human rights abuses of minorities and the escalating confrontation between ruling and opposition parties.
All these factors, combined with mounting religious militancy, make us believe that Bangladeshâs democratic and secular foundations are in jeopardy.
The European Community has been very vocal on these issues, not least in view of our development mandate and the human rights clause that provides the basis of our aid relationship with Bangladesh.
Over the last months the European Community and the Member States have repeatedly called on the government to condemn the persecution of political opponents, intellectuals, journalists, NGOs and minorities.
The European Union has reacted strongly to the attack on Mrs Sheikh Hasina and the assassination of former Minister Kibria by urging the government to restore justice without delay and to give clear signals that acts of terrorism are not acceptable.
We are continuously stressing our concerns about the climate of impunity reigning in the country, the confrontational politics, the mounting attacks against the tribal people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Ahmadiyya Community and the extrajudicial killings in âcrossfireâ by special police forces.
Let me also note that the European Union showed great unity on Bangladesh at this yearâs Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where the EU agreed to single out Bangladesh as one of five countries in its statement of principle on human rights in the world.
The deteriorating governance situation has compelled us to enhance donor unity.
In February the European Community, the World Bank and the US Department of State convened a meeting in Washington with all major international donors to discuss how we can foster key governance reforms.
The exchanges confirmed that our concerns are fully shared by the international donor community.
This donor unity has allowed us to define common priorities and to convey strong private messages to the government on the poor governance and the urgent need to deliver on reforms.
The gathering in Washington had a clear impact on the country: it prompted the government to admit publicly the existence of an Islamic fundamentalist problem.
Alas, the government crackdown on Islamic militants is already petering out, as demonstrated by charges being dropped against a prominent Islamic leader.
For its part, the Commission will continue closely to monitor the political situation in the country and pursue these fundamental issues through our political dialogue with the government and close donor coordination.
In that context we will also increase the focus of our attention on the next parliamentary elections in late 2006 and the conditions for free and fair elections.
The political dialogue will be underpinned by our offer to support pressing institutional reforms in the next aid strategy which, if accepted by the government, would contribute to a meaningful change and thus to more progress and prosperity for the people of Bangladesh.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the five motions for resolutions on humanitarian assistance to refugees from Western Sahara(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, I was prepared to add my name to a list of speakers and not to begin a debate.
In any event, it is the case that this joint resolution that we are going to approve on the situation of the refugees in the Sahara is self-explanatory and deals with a strictly humanitarian drama.
When dealing with the situation of human rights in the world, we will find a paragraph on the situation in the Sahara.
Moreover, the political situation in the Sahara warrants further consideration.
The strictly humanitarian situation is what we are dealing with now, however.
We are talking about around 200Â 000 refugees who have been living in refugee camps for almost 30 years and whose only resource is international humanitarian aid.
That is what we are talking about today.
That, moreover, is what is in jeopardy for various reasons, including some purely bureaucratic reasons affecting the European Commission.
All of this is on the point of creating a genuine humanitarian crisis.
That is what this motion for a resolution is intended to deal with, calling urgently on the Commission to adopt a series of measures to prevent a humanitarian crisis of unforeseeable proportions.
Furthermore, certain very specific measures are proposed, such as better cooperation with non-governmental organisations on the ground and greater support for the Sahrawi institutions which, within the refugee camps, cooperate in the administration of that humanitarian aid, which, I would emphasise, is the only source of income for 200Â 000 people.
There is no question but that this resolution only resolves and deals with part of the problem and that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fundamental problem.
There is a serious problem on Europeâs doorstep, and sooner or later we will have to exert every possible political and diplomatic pressure on the various players involved in resolving this conflict so that we can put an end to the need for debates such as this one as soon as possible: how we can feed 200Â 000 people who, without us, will have nothing to eat.
Â Â  Mr President, the resolution we are presenting and voting on today relates to the increasing deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Sahrawi camps.
We are talking about a commitment made by the parliamentary delegation that visited the camps a few weeks ago, and which we are now fulfilling.
Assistance is running out, and we must respond urgently to this situation.
Nevertheless, we must also be very aware that the humanitarian issue actually hides the real problem, which is a political one.
Humanitarian assistance is necessary, because the Sahrawi people are obliged to live in camps, far from their homes, and cannot live normal lives in those circumstances.
After thirty years with no solution to the conflict, patience is running out in the camps.
Some voices are even calling for a return to an armed approach if the situation is not resolved soon.
This is very worrying; the European Union cannot ignore this fact.
The most worrying thing, however, is that the solution is on the table, it exists and is called the Baker Plan II.
It is an imperfect plan, certainly, but it is a plan that the Sahrawi people have accepted, and they have given way significantly on some of their positions.
Despite this, the other party, Morocco, refuses to sign it, however.
Europe is looking to Spain, and the Spanish Government must therefore lead the process of resolving this conflict.
Let us not forget that the Sahrawi population is in the camps today as a result of incomplete decolonisation, and the main culprit here is the Spanish Government.
I would therefore urge President RodrÃ­guez Zapatero to give Spain the kind of role played by Portugal in relation to Timor.
After thirty years of being ignored, of silence and of broken promises, the time has come for the world in general, and Europe in particular, to stop turning its back on the problem and to face it head on.
It is time for the Sahrawi people to be granted their fair and understandable request for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter.
Finally, I would also like to express my solidarity with the Moroccan journalist AlÃ­ Lmrabet, who has been unfairly convicted of defamation after stating that the people living in the camps are not prisoners but refugees.
Â Â  â Mr President, you are aware of the biblical story in which a people wandered in the desert for 40 years.
There is much myth in this adventure and in fact it is our adventure.
In the case of the Sahrawi population, we are not speaking about myths but about real events taking place in contemporary history.
These people have been waiting for 30 years in the Saharan desert of deserts.
They are not looking for the promised land, but simply wish to regain sovereignty over their land.
Mr President, when I was a journalist I visited many refugee camps.
In Ethiopia, I discovered that there is a fourth world, a place where the people walk, walk and walk, because walking is a way of surviving, but I have never seen anything like the Tindouf camps.
Out there in the sands, there is no electricity, but solidarity has brought them solar panels; out there, there is not a drop of water, but the water that aid has supplied has reached each refugee equally, along with flour, sugar and olive oil.
The Sahrawi people depend on aid but they are not beggars.
Parliament therefore has an urgent responsibility, namely to restore levels of humanitarian support in all its facets, and an emergency that is a responsibility.
Real aid is the type of aid that can put an end to aid.
Europe must commit itself to a referendum on self-determination, not only in words but also in deeds, because while they, the Sahrawis, have time, we have the clock.
Â Â  . Mr President, the reason why we have again, today, been discussing humanitarian aid for refugees from the Western Sahara is that their homeland was not decolonised in the way planned by the United Nations as long ago as 1965, but has instead been occupied for over 30 years by its neighbour, Morocco.
At the beginning of March, a number of us MEPs visited the refugee camps, where the conditions are very difficult, and were able to inform ourselves about not only the political, but also the humanitarian, situation.
As we know that their most important food reserves will be exhausted by the end of next month, we call on ECHO and the Commission not only to provide immediate aid measures, but also to give the amounts that were laid down in 2002.
I believe that the change in ECHOâs policy, which now involves channelling aid through the World Food Programme, has brought problems in its train in so far as it now adds up to less aid for an increasing number of Saharan refugees and also less variety in the types of aid provided.
This House must play its part in securing for the people of the Sahara not only humanitarian aid, but also self-determination, to both of which they are entitled.
Â Â  Mr President, this resolution is the result of the commitment made by certain Members of the European Parliament, including Mr Portas, Mr Romeva and Mrs Scheele, in the refugee camps in Tindouf, where we spent four days together experiencing the harshness of living in the middle of the desert.
We spent a few days there witnessing the suffering of the Sahrawi people, because they have no political, peaceful or ordered solution to their situation.
Like them, we lived without water or electricity.
In addition to these harsh conditions in Tindouf because these 150Â 000 human beings live in the middle of the desert without any comforts they are faced, however, with a situation in which our humanitarian assistance is being reduced.
The resolution we are proposing here talks strictly about humanitarian assistance, because we witnessed directly the humanitarian difficulties faced by the Sahrawi people as a result of a lack of assistance.
The assistance they were receiving is being reduced.
I do not know whether any particular Member State of the European Union is responsible for this.
Franceâs position on this conflict is very clear...
I do not want to talk about that, however, because what we are saying here is that it is important for the European Union to continue to provide the assistance it has been providing for these 150Â 000 Sahrawis who are trying to find a solution.
Political problems are one thing, and we will have to seek solutions in this regard, and other resolutions will deal with them.
We cannot, however, ignore the fact that, just a few kilometres from the European Union, we have 150Â 000 Sahrawis who are suffering because we are not sufficiently generous and because, by no longer sending flour or by reducing the quotas of food that we were sending, we are contributing to the deterioration of the living conditions in the refugee camps, which are quite difficult enough in themselves.
The European Union also has a responsibility as the main donor of aid from the United Nations.
We will have to make our voice heard there as well.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is about 30 years since thousands of nomads from the Western Sahara fled to remote areas of neighbouring Algeria in order to escape the conflicts which had broken out between the guerrillas of the Western Sahara and Morocco following the withdrawal of Spain from its former colony.
Today the exiles, estimated to number between approximately 160Â 000 and 200Â 000 people, are living in the Algerian desert and are totally dependent on donations from the international community, on the humanitarian aid sent to them via the UN World Food Programme.
An acute lack of humanitarian food aid and inadequate funding are threatening the old, isolated camps, which find it hard to withstand the savage desert climate.
That is why we are calling for the granting of immediate emergency aid, which will guarantee satisfactory distribution of food and of the food distribution teams needed, without overlooking the need for proper shelter and education.
We are calling on the Commission to keep aid at the same levels at least as ECHO and to coordinate donors and European non-governmental organisations which already have a great deal of experience on the ground in saving refugees.
The international community has no right to remain indifferent.
Its response must be commensurate with its responsibilities.
The global dimension of the causes and extent and of the methods for dealing with numerous problems is no longer in dispute.
The joint resolution gives strength to this conviction on our part.
Â Â  â In March,I spent three days, along with other Members of Parliament, in tents and I saw the appalling conditions in which people live there.
We came home and they stayed there.
My conviction grew that it is of pressing importance for the EU to work to free us from the duty to continue for many more years to provide for the Sahrawi peopleâs most basic needs.
The Sahrawis know â and have shown that they know â how to work, how to organise themselves and how to survive in the most inhospitable conditions, were they able to go back and regain control of their land, which is illegally occupied by Morocco.
Through humanitarian aid, the EU must not resign itself to appeasing the conscience of the international community and its Member States with particular responsibilities in the process towards decolonisation in Sahara, which has found its path blocked by obstacles.
The EU must take action to give impetus to the search for a political solution to the process, under the auspices of the UN.
Morocco has blocked the process, repeatedly vetoing the most up-to-date proposals made by James Baker, and this ultimately led to his resignation.
The Member States, and in particular those on the Security Council, must not continue to overlook the nub of the issue.
The conflict is directly linked to Europe and not only because of historical responsibility.
European interests are at stake.
Western Sahara could be a supplier to Europe, if its abundant natural resources of oil, phosphates, fish and others could be legitimately and sustainably exploited, something that is not happening under the illegal occupation.
It is also the case that Europeâs very security is at stake.
Western Sahara is on our doorstep, and we have an immediate obligation to understand the underlying problems that feed into international terrorism.
What kind of anger is being passed on to new generations of Sahrawis in the Tindouf refugee camps involved in the resistance in occupied Sahara, if they are not taken from the arms of fundamentalist radicals, if the EU, the United States, the Arab world and the rest of the international community denies them an outlet for resolving their conflict, thereby condemning them to impotent despair in the face of injustice, violence and destitution?
I shall finish by saying that the EU must also make Rabat understand that it is in Moroccoâs interest to end the illegal occupation of Western Sahara.
Â Â  â We feel that this resolution is very important, albeit inadequate, given the difficult humanitarian situation faced by the Sahrawi people in the refugee camps.
We must show immediate and practical solidarity with these people in terms of food, health care and education, and must ensure that such support is maintained in the future.
Solidarity and practical, immediate and effective action is also required to put an end to the unacceptable occupation in Western Sahara, to guarantee the Sahrawi people the right to self-determination and independence and to ensure compliance with United Nations resolutions.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is truly necessary for Parliament and the European Union to commit themselves much more than they have done so far in defence of peoplesâ right to self-determination, particularly in such striking cases as that of the Sahrawi people.
Although this matter has been dragging on since the time of Spanish decolonisation, little attention is paid to the Western Sahara: it does not involve large-scale interests or large-scale numbers, it does not interest bankers to any great degree and does not whet particular geopolitical appetites.
Perhaps it is also because the Sahrawi people have not waged their own war for self-determination outside the desert, they have not resorted to degrading terrorist actions, and they have not served the interests of powerful allies formerly in conflict.
Europe must therefore commit to immediate humanitarian aid for the Sahrawi, but above all it must impose sanctions on the Kingdom of Morocco, so that it will respect the self-determination rights of this decent and proud people.
Â Â  Mr President, forgetting is the great enemy of many situations of injustice in the world.
It is therefore more necessary today than ever to draw attention to one of these situations: that of the Sahrawi people.
After thirty years, these men and women survive in an entirely inhumane situation, deprived of the most basic needs and living in extremely difficult conditions.
In spite of this, they offer an excellent example of organisation and work, which keep them united in great dignity, and in particular we should stress the courage of the Sahrawi women, who have been able to create a well-structured society out of nothing.
We in Europe have a moral and political obligation today.
We are talking about an extreme situation that demands an immediate response.
The Sahrawi people would like to live from their own resources and their own work, but unfortunately they must rely on our solidarity.
The Sahrawi people have demonstrated their capacity for organisation and for managing resources.
What, therefore, we are calling for today in this Assembly is an increase in European assistance and faith in the ability of the Sahrawi structures to manage it.
We cannot forget that the cause of this humanitarian problem originates from a political conflict which needs to be dealt with.
We must be in a position to resolve the political issue, and the referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people must become a reality.
We must be able to find a fair and definitive solution.
Peace and freedom for the Sahrawi people.
Â Â  . Thank you for your initiative, which gives me the opportunity to express the Commissionâs views concerning the Western Sahara conflict.
First of all, let me stress that the Commission would like to see this conflict resolved soon and its resolution is crucial for the stability, regional integration and development in the Maghreb and in the Mediterranean.
From a humanitarian point of view, one cannot but feel concern regarding the dramatic conditions for the thousands of Sahrawi refugees, the ongoing detention by the Polisario of 408 Moroccan prisoners of war, the difficulties for the families divided between the refugee camps and the Western Sahara, and the fate of people unaccounted for on both sides.
All these issues impress on us the need for an end to this crisis, which has been going on for nearly 30 years.
As you know, the provision of humanitarian aid by the Commission respects the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence and is based on real needs.
The Commissionâs humanitarian office, ECHO, also acts in accordance with the criteria of non-discrimination and not subjecting policies to political objectives.
This means that anyone affected by a humanitarian crisis is entitled to receive aid, no matter which side of the conflict they are on.
In full observance of these principles and criteria, the Commission has provided humanitarian aid totalling EUR 108 million to the Sahrawi refugees since 1993.
Thanks to these continuing efforts, the Commission has become the principle donor of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees.
The Commission has never interrupted its assistance.
It has, however, adapted the timing and the level of the most recent funding decisions to the situation on the ground.
I would like to emphasise that, thanks to the essential role of the âbuffer stockâ, created and funded by the Commission in 2000, we have been able to avoid any interruption in food supplies.
The current humanitarian situation in the camps has not deteriorated.
However, it remains worrying.
There is a risk of deterioration when and if the possible break in the food pipeline, as announced by the World Food Programme, is not compensated for in a timely and sufficient manner.
ECHO intends to propose a funding decision next month to deal with this situation.
The funding for 2005 will depend both on the needs of the Sahrawi refugees and on the conditions for the implementation of ECHO-funded projects.
I would like to stress that the Commission has a dual responsibility.
It not only needs to address the humanitarian needs of refugees in a timely and dedicated manner but it also has to protect the financial interests of the European Union.
Its operations in the Sahrawi refugee camps are designed to carry out this dual responsibility effectively.
That is why the Commission attaches such importance to the proper identification of beneficiaries and full transparency of its operations.
With a view to properly assessing the humanitarian needs of the Sahrawi refugees, the Commission is continuing its discussions with the principal agencies and organisations, in particular the Algerian and Sahrawi authorities, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and non-governmental organisations.
These NGOs have played and continue to play an important role as ECHOâs partner in the implementation of its operations in the Sahrawi camps.
Beyond its purely humanitarian dimension, I believe that the international communityâs assistance to the Sahrawi refugees helps to create and maintain conditions that are favourable to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.
More generally, I would like to state for the record that the Commission and the European Unionâs position on the political aspects of this conflict has always been to remain impartial.
The European Union continues to fully support the United Nationsâ efforts towards finding a fair and lasting solution in accordance with international law.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the five motions for resolutions on Lampedusa(1).
Â Â  The collective expulsions of immigrants by the Italian authorities between October 2004 and March 2005 from the Italian island of Lampedusa to Libya are extremely worrying.
Specifically, the High Commission for Refugees condemned the return of 180 people on 17 March and stated that it was not at all clear whether Italy had taken the necessary precautions to guarantee the safe return of those people to Libya, a country which can in no way be considered a safe asylum country.
We therefore profoundly regret that the Italian authorities have not allowed UNHCR access to the holding centre in Lampedusa.
For all these reasons, we wish to call on the European Commission to guarantee respect for the right to asylum in the European Union and to put an end to collective expulsions.
Furthermore, we demand that the Italian authorities respect their obligations in accordance with European Union law.
We are therefore calling for a delegation consisting of members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Human Rights Sub-Committee to be sent to the refugee centre in Lampedusa, and to Libya, in order to assess the scale of the problem and how it is being dealt with and, in particular, how the people are being treated, which in particular would involve investigating the final destination and fate of the people who have been expelled.
In conclusion, we must be concerned about the fact that, in the field of asylum and immigration, cases of violations of the fundamental principles to which the European Union and its Member States are committed are becoming increasingly frequent.
Lampedusa is simply one more of those cases, and we must ensure that there are no more of them.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure and, secondarily, to Rule 167.
In my opinion, the Lampedusa issueshould not have been marked down for debate because it is a matter of bilateral agreements between Italy and Libya and the enforcement of Italian laws that do not contravene the EU Treaties.
It must be remembered, moreover, that Italy is not Burma, China or Guantanamo, but rather a Member State whose dignity people are seeking to disgrace, and whose institutions, armed forces and law enforcement agencies they are seeking to condemn out of hand On the contrary, the law enforcement agencies have, for many years, committed themselves generously and far beyond their institutional duties not only to the immense task of controlling the legal entry of non-EU nationals into Italy â and thus into Europe, according to the rules laid down in the Schengen Agreement â and not only to trying to arrest and expel slave traders,but above all to humanitarian aid work and to the extremely difficult â if not outright impossible â work of identifying illegal immigrants.
I have personally witnessed what I am asserting here and I invite my fellow Members to verify it for themselves.
I wish to express my strong outrage â and on this issue I also appeal to the sensibility of every Italian Member â at the vile attempt to offend Italyâs national dignity and cast judgment on our sovereignty.
Â Â  Mr Romagnoli, you have made your point of order, but unfortunately I cannot deal with it, for the simple reason that you should have raised this issue 24 hours before this debate.
The debate was arranged at the Conference of Presidents, no point of order was raised 24 hours before, so I cannot deal with your point of order.
Â Â  . Mr President, instead of being associated with joy and happiness, Lampedusa â a beautiful island basking lazily in the hot Mediterranean sun â has become synonymous with pain and human suffering of tragic proportions.
The southernmost piece of EU land reaching out as though to link Europe with Africa is the graveyard of the hopes and sometimes the lives of thousands of immigrant men, women and children; desperate people who are either running away from torture and death or are just seeking to achieve a better way of life.
Their only crime is that they had a dream, which they thought had a slim chance of becoming reality in the otherwise civilised Europe; a dream of being in a land where they would feel safe and be treated as human beings.
A dream that for many of them soon turned into a nightmare, when they discovered that the strict allegiance to the principles of respect for human life and dignity, so eloquently and loudly pronounced on every possible occasion by some European governments, is just a big illusion when it comes to Lampedusa.
The responsible authorities are ready, willing and able, in gross violation of international conventions and treaties and against widespread condemnation, to hand them back to those murderous totalitarian regimes in Africa from which they are so desperately seeking to escape.
Let us not beat about the bush: Lampedusa is a bloodstain of shame for the Italian Government, for acting in such an irresponsible, inhumane and un-European way.
It is also a bloodstain of shame for the Commission and the Council for not taking any effective action to remedy the situation and bring the Italian Government to order.
As far as the Libyan Government is concerned, its deeply shameful behaviour in the Lampedusa affair is understandable, as we expect nothing less from an undemocratic regime.
I strongly urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, for people who have had to leave their countries of origin as a result of oppression, war, disasters and poverty, the Mediterranean Sea is an important gate to Europe.
If Europe fails to do enough towards easing the problems in Asia and Africa, an increasing number of people will take the risk of entering Europe using dilapidated dinghies and neglected ships.
That is, of course, a problem for Europe and, above all, for the countries around the Mediterranean.
This additional burden does not justify the infringement of human rights.
These refugees are equally entitled to an individual assessment of their motives and the correct application of the 1951 Geneva Convention.
The same cannot be said for the hundreds of refugees who have been sent from the Italian island Lampedusa to Libya over the past few months, because that country does not recognise the Geneva Convention, and the agreements Italy has with Libya are not public.
Between arrival in Europe and possible return to the country of origin, European law should apply rather than the arbitrariness of a country with a non-transparent government.
Adoption of the two amendments tabled by the Liberals and Amendments 2 and 3 from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will make that possible and will stress that these refugees have the same rights as other refugees and cannot simply be moved on to Libya without Europe taking any responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, large numbers of migrants regularly arrive on the island of Lampedusa in Italy.
These people have taken the painful decision to leave their countries, often because they are fleeing from political situations that are threatening their lives.
On 18 March, the Italian authorities expelled 180 people from the centre on Lampedusa to Libya.
The lack of transparency of and access to the centre and the conditions under which these people were expelled raise questions with regard to respect for the right to asylum and the Geneva Convention.
The speed of the expulsions and the fact that the people expelled were sorted according to nationality show that their applications cannot have been examined individually and that the necessary precautions cannot have been taken.
As a result, we cannot be certain that genuine asylum seekers have not been sent back to dangerous situations.
We are also particularly concerned that the High Commissioner for Refugees is being prevented from fulfilling her responsibilities.
She needs to have access to asylum seekers to ensure that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so and that their applications are examined carefully.
These expulsions are all the more alarming because we are sending vulnerable people back to a country that does not allow them to be protected: Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and has no asylum system.
It consequently cannot provide international protection for those who need it.
Finally, Libya itself deports refugees outside its borders to dangerous regions.
We therefore call on the Italian authorities to give the High Commissioner for Refugees immediate unlimited access to the centre on Lampedusa.
The expulsions must also be stopped until the centre on Lampedusa complies with Community and international law.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must declare my outrage at the assertions made in this Houseâ by people taking advantage of being seated in this House â with regard to Italy and its Government.
As everyone is aware, there is no Community policy on immigration: each individual Member State tackles the problem according to its internal rules and with its own resources.
A joint debate was begun only recently and, personally, I have had the opportunity to represent this Parliament many timesin the informal meetings of immigration ministers.
It seems obvious that the attack launched against the Italian Government is political and is an attempt to exploit the situation at this particular moment in time.
There is a law in Italy â the Turco-Napolitano law â introduced by a left-wing government and unchanged by the current centre-right government, Article 10 of which is being used to confront this issue.
The Court of Justice has been called upon to give its opinion, and therefore it would be more desirable to await such a decision, and not to put on political trial a government which is facing a continued state of emergency, with the arrival of thousands of impoverished people in a small areawith limited accommodation options, with the not altogether remote danger of indirectly encouraging human traffickers and terrorists.
Every possible rescue at sea is effected by the armed forces, every request and individual situation is assessed by the law enforcement agencies and competent associations.
No one is mistreated, no one is imprisoned; indeed, although they come seeking asylum, they slip away from accommodation centres in their hundreds with extreme ease, disappearing throughout Italy and perhaps Europe.
Anyone who denies the embarrassment of organisations such as the UNHCR for this attack on Italy is lying; the official acts of the Italian Ministry of the Interior prove the contrary.
Why do we not visit every accommodation centre in Europe?
Then we can confirm the situation everywhere.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must tackle this problem seriously and from a European viewpoint, and avoid bringing hypothetical political charges against a legitimate government, when such charges could tomorrow be brought against any other Member State and any other government.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall keep this very brief as I only wish to reaffirm some of the ideas already present in the resolution.
Whilst the right to counter illegal immigration is indisputable, it is equally true that such a right must be exercised with respect for human rights and international conventions, refraining from collective expulsions and from the indifference shown by some of the receiving countries to the future fate of these people, particularly when they are repatriated to countries that have not signed international conventions, such as Libya.
These are the two points that have been raised on the Lampedusa case, not by those seeking to exploit the situation,but by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and by the Court of Strasbourg itself, which has asked Italy to clarify its position before the start of May.
We are in a situation in which, to my mind, we, as Europeans, have an element of prestige that is also recognised by countries that do not respect human rights, which is precisely that we respect those rights, or strive to.
Let us please not lose this element of civilisation.
Â Â  Mr President, what is the connection between the Western Sahara, the topic before last in our debate, and Lampedusa, which we are discussing now?
At the beginning of the 1980s, this House â on another Thursday afternoon â held an urgent debate on North Africa.
The topic was the Western Sahara and Gaddafiâs influence in North Africa.
This House was, on that occasion, forthrightly critical of Gaddafi, as was the then Italian government under its then Prime Minister Andreotti, and in consequence of that, Gaddafi had missiles fired at the little island, which was the first time that Lampedusa became known around the world.
What that highlights is Lampedusaâs exposed position off the coast of Africa and the Libyan mainland.
What is happening on Lampedusa is not about one or two immigrants landing on it here and there; what is going on there is systematic and brutal trafficking in human beings.
People are quite deliberately being brought to Lampedusa via Libya and from there on smuggled into the European Union.
As soon as they are on the European mainland, they can get to Munich, Strasbourg, The Hague or wherever, without once being checked up on.
If we do not want this systematic traffic in human beings to continue, we have to act, and act together.
This issue is, for that reason, too important for us to allow it to be downgraded to a cheap way of scoring points in an election.
If we are going to talk as if we were fighting an election, then I would like to say that I was advocating years ago that we should lay down common quotas for refugees, sharing the burden between the Member States and bringing their standards for refugees and asylum seekers into line, arguing that what we needed most of all was fixed quotas in order to share the burden.
Who or what was it that did nothing to achieve this?
The Commission, which was then under Mr Prodi!
He, then, the leader of the Italian opposition, should clean his own side of the street first.
This is not about domestic policy on the cheap; instead, we should discharge our responsibility as Europeans.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Posselt, we have to accept our responsibilities to ensure that the credibility of Parliament is defended in relation to human rights and humanitarian norms.
We have an obligation to raise the question of Lampedusa and the appalling treatment of the hundreds of poor and weak people who are deported by the Italian Government to a regime which would not qualify for membership of this Union.
If we are to have any credibility whatsoever in relation to human rights and international law we must insist that all Member States respect those norms.
The Italian Government is not respecting those norms by any measure, and I would urge the Commission to insist that the Italian Government â and indeed any other Member State, if it is in breach of these norms â be hauled before the European Court of Justice to ensure that these laws are respected.
I want to draw particular attention to paragraph 4 of this resolution, which refers to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, and also to paragraph 9.
I urge the Commission to press the Libyan Government to stop arbitrary arrests of those whom they consider to be migrants, and to respect the Geneva Convention and the mandate of the High Commissioner for Refugees.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission followed the events in Lampedusa very closely and contacts were made with Mr Pisanu, the Italian Minister of Internal Affairs in order to obtain certain clarifications.
To date the Italian authorities maintain that all measures taken in respect of those that arrived irregularly on the island of Lampedusa were not in breach of international obligations.
They have promised to send the Commission a detailed report on the events which took place, and also on the actions taken in order to guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of all persons concerned.
The Commission has encouraged the Italian Government to adopt measures that guarantee the right of each individual to submit an asylum request, and not to expel anybody while a decision on the request is pending.
I would like to mention the Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status, which aims to provide a level playing field common to all Member States.
This concerns procedures to be applied to asylum-seekers and will be formally adopted by the Council after Parliament gives its opinion in June, thus paving the way for its transposition by Member States into their national legislation.
I would also like to underline that, in the absence of Community legislation on the matter, the assessment of whether the Italian authorities have contravened their international obligations under the Geneva Convention lies with the national jurisdictions.
Having said that, the Commission will continue to follow this matter very closely.
I emphasise that addressing the pressures underlying forced migratory movements, particularly in the Mediterranean region, is a priority for the European Union.
It is thus the Commissionâs intention to continue working towards this objective, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of those in need of international protection are respected.
The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by NGOs and UNHCR on Libyaâs respect of human rights, in particular as regards refugeesâ protection.
During the mission the Commission conducted in Libya at the end of 2004 concerning illegal immigration, issues relating to human rights and asylum were given particular importance.
Meetings were held with the Gadaffi Foundation and UNHCR.
The Commission considers that such issues should be part of any possible future cooperation with Libya on illegal immigration.
I would like to emphasise that EU regional cooperation with countries generating migrants and refugees must be firmly grounded in the principles of respect for human rights.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group.
There has been a technical glitch.
We had asked for the final vote on the other groupâs motion on Lampedusa to be by roll call.
That has gone astray for some reason.
On behalf of my group, I ask you to conduct the final vote on the Lampedusa resolution by roll call.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 14 April 2005.
Â Â  It is a pleasure for Parliament to welcome a group of Members of the Parliament of the Federal State of Mecklemburg-Western Pomerania, who are visiting our institution.
Â Â  With the agreement of the political groups, I would like to propose the following amendments to the agenda of the current part-session which appear in the corrigendum which has been distributed to you.
The Commissionâs Communication no longer appears on the agenda.
The debate on the report by Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez on sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean is postponed to a later part-session.
Following the debate on the report by Mrs KlaÃ we shall hold a debate on the report by Mrs Handzlik on the internal market in the new Member States, initially scheduled for the votes.
I must also inform you that two requests for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have been added to the votes.
If there are no comments the agenda will be approved.
Finally, I would like to inform you that, following the negotiations held in the trialogue, I have just received a request from the Committee on Development to delay the debate on the report by Mr Mitchell on the financing instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation, which was initially scheduled for this afternoon, until a later part-session.
If there are no comments we shall accept this request and this report will be debated during a later part-session.
With regard to the timetable for our work, I must point out that, since the Council is present this afternoon, the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance that we normally hold at the beginning of the sitting will take place following the Commission statement on the Roma in the European Union.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Coveney on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU's policy on the matter [2004/2151(INI)] (A6-0086/2005).
Mr Almunia is present for this purpose, replacing Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who is in Luxembourg.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the presence of the Council and the Commission, who are here to listen to our deliberations on an important report.
It has been a fascinating and challenging experience for me to produce the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EUâs policy on the matter.
It is my first report in Parliament and I was glad to take on such a significant one.
It was an honour for my party to be given the rapporteurship.
The title of the report is very broad-ranging and the report itself correspondingly deals with very many issues and very many countries.
Seventy countries are dealt with in this report, where we shine a light on human rights abuses.
The report deals with 70 different countries and eight thematic issues.
Therefore, I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries, could navigate it quickly and efficiently, as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings, requiring people to read a third, half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested.
The preparation process has been a detailed one.
We debated this report in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on 23 November 2004, again on 31 January 2005 and on 17 March â St Patrickâs Day â 2005.
The full Committee on Foreign Affairs has also had plenty of time to debate and contribute to this report.
It did so on 17Â January, 16 March and again on 29 March.
The process has therefore been thorough.
Consultation between the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, has been constructive and positive and I wish to thank my colleagues in other groups for that process.
From the outset I made it quite clear that I wanted this report to reflect the concerns of Parliament as a whole and not of any one group.
I hope we have achieved that and that it will be reflected in a strong endorsement of the report tomorrow.
I have no reason to believe that will not be the case.
Now we get down to the real question: what has all this work been about; what useful purpose that can this report serve now and in the future?
Let me outline the contribution I believe it can make.
Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this report must set the agenda for Parliament and must be a guide for Parliament when it tries to influence both the Commission and the Council with regard to the direction they should be taking on thematic issues and the priority the European Union gives to human rights.
The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically.
It concerns human rights and the fight against terrorism, which in many ways seems like a contradiction in terms.
However, we are living in a modern world, where there are real terrorism threats both to Europe and to other parts of the world, on which the European Union must take a position.
At the same time, we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right.
I would encourage the Council in particular to look at the first thematic issue in detail.
I believe the report makes a balanced attempt to answer that difficult political question.
The second thematic issue is childrenâs rights.
I received a lot of lobbying on this issue, and mush attention was devoted to it.
It is genuinely felt that the European Union has not responded comprehensively and could improve its policy in this area.
Therefore, the report calls on the Commission to present, as soon as possible, a detailed communication on childrenâs rights, linking the issue with EU development policy.
The third area concerns the impact that conflict situations have on women and children, leading to tragic consequences on a regular basis.
It deals with issues such as rape as a war tool.
Many thousands of women have been abused in the most horrific ways during conflict situations, as a tool of war.
It also deals with the issue of child soldiers.
Unfortunately, there are still tens of thousands of children who have AK-47s put into their hands and are sent out to war to kill other people.
It deals with the psychological effects that has on those children as they grow older.
I shall refer to the European Unionâs response to that shortly.
The next section relates to the death penalty, an area where the European Union has had a lot of success in influencing its neighbours through the Neighbourhood Policy and has brought about a moratorium on the death penalty in many countries.
Indeed, we are working towards achieving a ban on it.
The report also deals with trafficking in human beings, the role of international business and its responsibilities in the human rights field and, perhaps most important of all, the issue of impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court, which deserves the support of the European Union.
It is my belief that in many parts of the developing world impunity is the single biggest contributing factor to continued human rights abuses, because people believe that they will not be punished or held to account for the horrific actions they either sanction or take themselves.
This report very strongly supports the ICC.
It also strongly encourages the European Union to persuade influential countries such as the United States to support the ICC.
The report also deals with many individual countries.
I have been encouraged by the growing influence that the European Union clearly has on many countries in the world.
Many ambassadors and representatives from different countries have come to me concerned âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Coveney on this excellent report.
As he has just said, it presents a very broad and very full picture of the human rights situation viewed from a number of angles.
More than ever, human rights are at the heart of the international debate.
The sixty-first session of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights has just concluded in Geneva.
In March, the United Nations Secretary-General published his report entitled: âIn larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for allâ.
He has therefore in a way put the question of human rights at the centre of our concerns for the peaceful development of our world.
You do a similar thing in your report.
You paint a picture of the human rights situation in the world, an uncompromising picture which shows that we must continue to be concerned about human rights.
It also calls for even more decisive, even more committed action in defence of human rights.
The European Union has always been keen to defend and promote human rights; it is a key part of our external policy.
In the light of the challenges of globalisation and in view also of the ongoing deterioration in respect for human rights in many parts of the world, the European Union needs to make greater efforts to promote and defend human rights, first of all internally with the governments, but also with civil society, non-governmental organisations, national parliaments and international bodies.
Something else that must be at the very heart of our defence of human rights is a commitment to resolving conflicts, conflicts which are often the very source of contempt for the human person.
You condemn a number of cases in your report, with your tragic review of human rights violations in many parts of the world.
In this connection, I believe the UN Secretary-Generalâs report, reform of the United Nations system, the prominence given to human rights with a link between UN reform and greater respect for the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights are very important.
May I simply say that the European Union is first of all a community of values, a community of values, incidentally, which is better rooted in the draft Constitution, especially through the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This community of values that we aspire to be requires us to defend the principles of democracy and respect for human rights in the world.
These values are and must be our guide in choosing between the tools we have available for conducting our policy.
You will understand, Mr Coveney, that I cannot reply in detail to all the issues raised in your report or to all the extremely useful and extremely rich headings it contains.
I will therefore confine myself to a few of the questions you raise, while assuring you, on the Councilâs behalf, that our services will continue to study this document and take account of the many suggestions you make there.
I will therefore highlight a number of aspects whose importance justifies dwelling on them more particularly, beginning with dialogue.
We try to raise the issue of human rights wherever we have the opportunity and with all our negotiating partners.
That is also why human rights are always an integral part of every agreement we conclude with partners, even if they are mainly economic agreements.
We have in that way begun a âhuman rightsâ dialogue with China, making clear that human rights are not a luxury of rich developed countries but something that must go hand in hand with economic development.
We have also started âhuman rightsâ consultations with Russia.
This is one aspect of the âfour common spacesâ approach that we are hoping to capitalise on at the next summit with Russia on 10 May.
At this very moment, too, an EU troÃ¯ka is discussing ways of resuming the human rights dialogue with Iran.
Human rights are also an integral part of our relations with Teheran on other important matters: respect for human rights cannot in fact be separated from the other fundamental questions on which we are working.
This is long-term work, we know.
Even if it is difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the results gained from these human rights dialogues, we believe they are an essential tool for advancing the cause of human rights in the different countries concerned.
The need to find common ground with our negotiating partners obviously does not mean that we need not make regular appraisals of those dialogues.
Our aim is to improve the situation on the ground, and definite results like respect for the rule of law or the release of political prisoners are signs that we are having success with such dialogues.
I would also like to strongly emphasise the support we give to human rights organisations in a number of countries, as you also do in your report.
It is unacceptable that European Union funds devoted or allocated to human rights organisations in some countries should be blocked by their governments; I believe the President of Parliament brought this home forcefully when visiting one of those countries.
I would also like to say a word about a subject that is close to our hearts: respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism.
This is first of all a moral question and then one of effectiveness.
Those who think they can weaken respect for human rights on the pretext of fighting terrorism are in a sense giving way to the terrible blackmail of the worst enemies of democracy, the terrorists.
We cannot go down that road.
The attacks of 11 September 2001 have indeed made terrorism one of the European Unionâs priorities, but we have said, and we said it again recently before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, that the efforts made to fight against terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Moreover, on 21 September 2001 the Council stated that the fight against terrorism should be inseparable from the respect for fundamental freedoms on which our civilisation is based.
At the recent session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the European Union played an active part in negotiations on this subject, contributing to the adoption of a resolution on respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism.
That resolution provides for the appointment of a special rapporteur and will therefore help to strengthen the protection of human rights in the fight against terrorism.
The cooperation, to which you refer in your report, between the Personal Representative on Human Rights recently appointed by the Council's Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP and the EUâs Counter-Terrorism Coordinator is entirely consistent with our policy in the matter and we are keen to develop it.
I would like to mention some other questions to which you attach great importance.
First, the rights of the child.
We always speak of the rights of man, but we should as a matter of priority pay attention to the often calamitous situation of the child victims of conflict and also of poverty.
I believe the European Union has a special part to play here, and we shall have to see how we can step up our activities in support of childrenâs rights.
In this connection, I would also like to point out that the draft Constitution makes explicit reference to the protection of childrenâs rights.
I believe we should extend our activities to this end, at the level of our development aid and in the context of the Millennium Development Goals.
There is also the question of the rights of women who are the victims of conflicts, and that of strengthening the European Unionâs action to prevent all forms of trafficking in human beings, of which women and children are generally the main victims.
This is an area where the European Union needs to step up its action.
I would also like to take this opportunity to underline the freedom of information and the right to information.
Your Parliament has done a lot to encourage this right.
Journalists are often imprisoned, tortured, harassed in all kinds of ways and, today, taken hostage.
This is a good time to spare a thought for those journalists who have been held hostage in Iraq for more than 100 days.
Another issue you raise in your report is the future Fundamental Freedoms Agency and the risk of duplication resulting from the large number of bodies concerned with human rights.
We decided back in 2003 that the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia should be reviewed and that we should consider making it into an agency.
The Commission then embarked on a large-scale public consultation.
The very large number of individuals and organisations that expressed their ideas on the future role of the Monitoring Centre and its conversion into an agency for fundamental freedoms and human rights clearly shows the extent to which citizens feel they are affected by human rights issues.
We can only welcome that.
Following this consultation, the Commission began to draft a proposal for a regulation based on the many ideas received.
The proposal will then be examined according to the normal procedure.
While it is therefore premature to discuss this agency here, I would nevertheless like to stress that, given the scale of the task, there will never be too many of us concerned with protecting and defending human rights.
We are aware of the problems and we intend to strengthen cooperation between the various bodies concerned.
Our aim is to strengthen all the instruments and all the bodies that serve human rights, working together and in coordination so that our action will be effective while avoiding any duplication, since that would be an irresponsible waste of our resources.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising on behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who has not been able to come here today, and also by saying how pleased I am to be able to replace her to discuss an issue which is so essential to our model of society, of political and civic community, and to our European project.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins by pointing out that ârecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the worldâ.
All of us, in carrying out our responsibilities and in our daily and private lives, have the duty to promote and protect the rights of all human beings everywhere in the world.
The European Parliamentâs report on human rights that we are discussing this afternoon makes an extremely important contribution and I would like to begin by paying a warm tribute to Mr Coveney on his excellent work, which illustrates once again this Parliamentâs firm commitment to human rights.
The report contains extremely important food for thought and many very useful recommendations; there are too many of them for me to respond in detail to all of the issues it raises, but, as usual, the Commission will follow up this debate by responding to every one of the report's recommendations in writing.
Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to certain points raised by Mr Coveney in his report.
Specifically, I would like to make some brief comments on three issues: firstly, on the rights of children, in particular in armed conflicts, secondly, on human rights activists and, finally, on the International Criminal Court.
With regard to the rights of children, the Commission is pleased that the report places emphasis on this point.
In recent years, the European Union has implemented an effective framework for integrating the rights of children into its policies and programmes, in cooperation with UNICEF, we have launched a specific training programme on the rights of children and, last September, we established an Interinstitutional Group on this issue.
The Commission plays an active role in the application of the European Unionâs guidelines on children and armed conflicts approved in 2003: we regularly raise the issue in our dialogue with third countries and with representatives of groups involved in armed conflicts.
For example, during her visit to Sri Lanka in March, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to place particular emphasis on the importance of eradicating the use of children in these conflicts.
The Commission supports a wide range of projects dealing with the different aspects of this problem and, following a thorough analysis, we have decided to direct funds from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights towards support and training programmes in third countries.
The aim of these programmes and these resources is to make progress in the application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols.
Furthermore, I would like to point out that the group of commissioners on human rights places particular emphasis on this issue.
My colleagues have reviewed the work of the Commission in this field and are currently considering the best way to prioritise this issue; one of the possibilities being considered is the approval of a communication, as suggested by MrÂ Coveney in his report.
Secondly, I wished to refer to human rights activists.
In his speech to the United Nations general assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that human rights activists are our eyes and ears and that they represent our collective conscience.
They are a crucial source of information on the events taking place in third countries.
We, therefore, the European Union, depend on them, on human rights activists, to provide us with information.
This means that we have an immense responsibility to protect them, we must focus on improving the follow-up and communication of information and, in this regard, a firm commitment on the part of the European Union's missions and the Commission's delegations in the world.
The Commission is determined to play an active role in implementing the guidelines on human rights activists.
To this end, our campaign prioritises âpromoting a culture of human rightsâ, which is one of the four key elements of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
Furthermore, we place particular emphasis on supporting local human rights organisations in third countries.
The programming for that Initiative for this year and next year provides for more than 50 European Commission delegations to implement a microprojects plan that will represent more than 30% of the total budget.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the International Criminal Court, an institution of vital importance to the international promotion of peace and justice.
The Commission considers the Court to be one of the fundamental components of a regulated international order.
Thanks to this Court, those guilty of mass violations of human life and dignity know that the international community is going to call them to account and we all hope that this will reduce the frequency of these crimes, but in those places where they take place and where national systems do not wish or are not able to act, the international community now has a complementary system of criminal justice, enforced by means of the Court, which must distribute justice in an impartial, transparent and effective manner.
This is the only way to ensure that it is seen as a legitimate institution and to ensure that many other States sign up to the Rome Statute which established the Court.
The European Union believes that there are three fundamental principles in relation to the Court.
Firstly, the principle of the Courtâs universality, and to that end we are campaigning throughout the world to increase the number of ratifications of the Rome Statute, and I am pleased that, in March, 77 ACP countries jointly agreed to include a commitment to ratification of the Statute in the new Cotonou Agreement, which will be signed soon.
Secondly, we believe that the principle of the Courtâs integrity, which has been attacked by some countries, is fundamental.
For example, the bilateral immunity agreements proposed by the United States undermine the very concept of the Court.
The Commission is also concerned about the system of sanctions imposed by the United States on those countries that refuse to sign those agreements and we are continuing to express our concern about these issues in our dialogue with the United States.
Finally, the third principle of the Court is complementarity with national judicial systems; international justice is not a replacement of national justice.
We therefore support the reconstruction of legal systems in those countries in which the judiciary has not been able or has not had the will to tackle mass violations of human rights.
The adoption on 31 March of a United Nations Security Council resolution on the situation in Darfur, which refers for the first time to the International Criminal Court, makes us very hopeful.
Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that the large number of countries and issues dealt with in the report will be an immense help when we begin our work soon on the European Unionâs annual report on human rights.
I would therefore like once again to thank, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, Mr Coveney and the European Parliament as a whole for your excellent work and to point out once again that we are always prepared to cooperate with Parliament in this task.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Coveney, on his tireless work in defence of human rights demonstrated in his report and also on his tireless quest for a consensus in order to overcome the many problems and conflicts of interest this report raises.
This report on human rights in the world clearly demonstrates the inescapable and total commitment of the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, to the cause of human rights, which must not be preached to any one region, country or continent, but which must be of global or universal significance.
I believe that we in Europe must demonstrate intellectual modesty when approaching this task, and that we must take the view that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house.
In applying this reference to human rights, which the European Union implements by means of the democratic clause in the association and cooperation agreements, we must not show double standards and we must apply them equally to all countries, large, medium or small.
I believe we must be rigorous in our demands for respect for human rights, that we must be precise, that we must not indulge in exaggeration and, Mr President, we must take a generous view of the progress being made by many developing countries in their legislation and their real situations.
Because the European Unionâs action, Mr President, must be geared towards promoting these processes, stimulating them and providing incentives in order to ensure that human rights eventually take hold in every region of the world.
Mr President, I would like to refer to three of the many important aspects presented by Mr Coveney in his report that have attracted my attention in particular.
Firstly, the reference to the case of SomalÃ­ Mam and to the work she has been doing to combat child prostitution and to defend the 91 girls kidnapped from one of the reception centres in which she carries out her social work.
It is also worthwhile focussing on certain cases relating to the application of the death penalty in countries such as the Philippines.
I would also like to take advantage of this forum, Mr President, to refer â and I believe this is relevant within the context of this discussion of human rights â to the Spanish citizen Carlos Ayala, a European Commission official based in BogotÃ¡, where it appears he has been kidnapped in strange circumstances.
I would like to draw the attention of this House to this case, and to ask that the consequences and causes of his disappearance be clarified and, of course, call for his release.
I shall end, Mr President, by congratulating the rapporteur and expressing my hope that this Parliament will vote for this report tomorrow morning by the large majority it deserves.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to refer to just four points in this comprehensive and far-reaching report.
Firstly, on children and armed conflict, we welcome the emphasis on childrenâs rights.
We have specifically sought to widen the definition of child competence to include messengers, spies, cooks and porters, because children in all these roles are vulnerable to risk.
On the issue which divides this House, we insist that rape is a tool of war and therefore, access to full reproductive health rights has to be one of the human rights we defend in this report.
Second, on human rights and business, a major faultline has been identified in our debates between the promotion of corporate responsibility by companies themselves and public authorities using our responsibility to ensure the principle of corporate accountability.
The UN norms on business and human rights form the best basis from which to develop a set of global standards for the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations and we must support them.
Third, on terrorism, the report is right to condemn terrorism in all its forms, as well as to insist that all actions to combat terrorism fully respect international human rights and humanitarian law.
But the references in the report to targeting the democratic process and to the relationship between fundamentalism and terrorism go too near, we contend, to equating Islam and the Muslim peoples of this world with terrorism.
I accept that is not Mr Coveneyâs personal intention, but we wish to see that wording withdrawn to avoid any confusion.
Muslims are as committed to peace and non-violence as all other religions â and none â in this world.
Finally, we have sought to ensure that paragraphs 210 to 230 of the report address the specific instruments to promote human rights that we have as a European Union: the human rights dialogues, the human rights clause in our agreement with third countries, our representations in Geneva and New York, the actions and implementation of the guidelines and the European initiative on democracy and human rights.
I invite other political groups in Parliament next year to join us in focusing more exclusively on holding the Council and the Commission to account on how effectively these instruments are used.
I invite the Council in its response this afternoon to say that it will submit its own annual human rights report to this Parliament so that this report next year can be a response to it.
I thank Mr Coveney.
His compliments to the shadow rapporteurs are more than returned.
He has done an excellent job and it is a very good report.
Â Â  . Mr President, the 2004 human rights report has turned out to be an honest and balanced document, and I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts.
Initially, though, it was to be feared that this report would be marred by the same lack of consistency and coherence as the human rights policy of the Council and the Member States that very often demand sanctions against poor countries from the south but turn a blind eye to serious human rights violations in more economically interesting countries.
It would have been unacceptable if Parliament had once again agreed to human rights being made subordinate to economic or commercial interests.
Thanks to the rapporteurâs openness and willingness to listen, however, the report as it stands does not evade the more delicate points.
All problems are tackled, irrespective of the size or economic interest of the countries involved.
It is high time, I think, that the Council and Member States followed the same course; if not, the European Union is at risk of rapidly losing its credibility as protector and guardian of human rights worldwide.
This was once again evident recently during the 61st meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where no resolutions were submitted on China, Russia or Iran.
There is, I believe, a clear need for better coordination, more circulation of information and less ambivalence.
I am pleased that the report takes note of positive developments, including in a number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, despite the major political and economic problems with which the black continent still has to contend.
The successful reconciliation process in Rwanda, Burundi and in other countries illustrates that progress is definitely possible.
Africa is at a turning point and the European Union must continue to support the fragile, early successes on that continent.
The Coveney Report is right to press for closer cooperation with the International Criminal Court in the fight to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished.
After all, democracy and reconciliation go hand in hand with justice.
Quite a few developing countries, however, are under enormous pressure from the United States to undermine the Criminal Courtâs good work.
If the European Union and the Member States are really serious about the ICC, they must give those countries that refuse to bow to US threats economic and commercial compensation using all the means at their disposal.
The ICC has meanwhile launched inquiries into the situation in Congo and also Northern Uganda where the population continues to suffer at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and their terrorist activities.
Entire villages are being massacred and burnt down; children are abducted and used as soldiers or sex slaves, yet it would take only a small-scale, limited military effort to put the LRA out of action for good and to put a stop to the most serious human rights violations in the world.
Unfortunately for the population who have to experience the cruelties on a daily basis, Northern Uganda has no oil, coltan or other raw materials that might induce the international community to take an interest in it.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has tabled a limited number of amendments, one of which stresses the need for enforcing the arms embargo against China until such time as the Chinese Government demonstrates that new anti-secession laws do not entail any aggression in respect of the Taiwanese population.
If this amendment is approved, my group will support the Coveney report with even more conviction.
Â Â  Mr President, it is customary to congratulate rapporteurs in this House where we all try to outdo each other in being kind.
This time, however, we really must express our admiration for the work MrÂ Coveney has done; he has listened very hard and worked meticulously to produce what really is a full, clear and fair report.
We can all see that successfully appraising the human rights situation country by country is not an easy thing to achieve.
I would therefore like to add my own sincere congratulations to all those that have been addressed to him.
This report contains a tremendous number of positive points and my Group is particularly pleased with the balance it achieves in the matter of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism.
That is a subject which I believe is attracting a lot of attention internationally, at European level and in this House, and what we are seeing today â I mean what has just been decided following the UN session â will, with the rapporteurâs help, enable us to make very significant progress in the matter.
My group also welcomes the extension of civil and political rights to economic and social issues with an important chapter on the social responsibility of business.
When we consider the amendments tomorrow, I would like us also perhaps to recognise the right to development as an inalienable human right, as the UNDPâs work on the degradation of ecosystems and the effects of pollution on our ability, on a world scale, to achieve the Millennium goals invites us to do and as was stated in a United Nations declaration in 1986.
The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights.
I will be inviting you to consider these questions tomorrow.
Having said that, I believe the most important thing about this report is probably the ability, an ability we can continue to develop in the years ahead, to analyse the European Unionâs instruments for protecting and promoting human rights and democracy in the world.
I believe that is an extremely important chapter.
Everyone today can see to what extent the European Unionâs credibility, peopleâs expectations of it and what it will become with the hoped-for adoption of the Constitution are focussed around the question of human rights and democracy, and I do not believe we will be able to get a European way of doing things accepted in dialogue, in credibility and in equity if we are incapable of making considerable progress internally, between our institutions.
If we really want all our mechanisms to be monitored and evaluated, the European Parliament must be involved, and kept informed about, every action decided in accordance with the guidelines and with the structured human rights dialogues and be involved in all the measures taken by the Commission and the Council.
Our policy will be more effective and more coherent if we have better interinstitutional dialogue.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst I acknowledge the very substantial efforts made by MrÂ Coveney I must, unfortunately, add that the results fall well short of expectations.
It is, in reality, an extensive report, full of statements with which we can agree, which are simplistic at times and marked by a certain desire to please.
At the same time, however, the report is very careful â and on this point I disagree with Mr van Hecke â to avoid disgruntling the European Unionâs economic and political partners.
It can be argued that this report is very weak towards the strong and, all too often, very negligent towards the weak.
Many examples can be cited: no mention is made of the tragic situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey, which is yet to join the European Union and thus should have been included in such a document.
There is an unwillingness, however, to upset relations with Turkey.
With regard to Iraq, there is a reluctance to single out US responsibility in the treatment of prisoners: virtually nothing is said on the subject of Abu Ghraib.
Regarding Colombia, again no criticism is made of the role of the government and its relationship with the paramilitary forces.
The Israeli Government is asked to stop building the wall, but is not explicitly denounced for it.
Aside from that, no reference whatsoever is made to the lack of respect for freedom of information in Algeria.
I would therefore say that, in some ways, this document has not made the best of the opportunity presented and that, if it remains in its current state, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to lend their support to it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can fully identify with the appeal in paragraph 22 of the Coveney Report.
The new Palestinian leadership must put a stop to terrorist acts directed against Israel.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament should also endorse this urgent appeal; if they do not, we might as well give up all hope of a resumption of the peace talks.
Meanwhile, the forthcoming Palestinian parliamentary elections present the European institutions with a serious and urgent problem, in the shape of participation by Hamas, the Islamic organisation that features on the EUâs terror list with good reason.
In fact, Hamas is expected to achieve good results in the ballot.
How do the Council and the Commission intend to respond to that?
Israelâs Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, fears that, after the parliamentary elections, the European Union will no longer consider Hamas a terrorist movement, and he is prepared to continue talks about a peace deal only as and when the Palestinian militant groups are completely disarmed and dismantled.
If I remember rightly, the European Union made the same demands of the Palestinian Authority years ago.
What will the Council and the Commission say to the Israeli Prime Minister?
Whatever the case may be, you cannot tell this House that the inclusion of political parties with a military arm, in other words terrorist units, would be of any benefit whatever to the democratisation process in the Middle East, a region in which I would urge you to act consistently.
A clear and principled European position of this kind will help the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a reasonable political settlement on human rights and human lives in that region.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a great many aspects of this report meet with our approval.
Nonetheless, we believe there are parts of it that could be improved, and the matter of the arms embargo against China is undoubtedly one of the latter.
If I may, however, I should like to focus on a number of amendments to the report which were rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and which have now been tabled again in plenary.
We have heard certain Members invoke reproductive health rights during almost every debate in the House in recent months on issues such as measures to combat AIDS, womenâs rights in Europe and throughout the world and our humanitarian policy objectives.
Bearing in mind the WHOâs definition of reproductive health rights, the implication is that we are being asked to vote on abortion.
I am prepared to believe that all the Members of this House, and indeed all of us in Europe, are acting in good faith, yet I find it impossible to understand that abortion can be alluded to so frequently and with such flippancy, when it is something that a great many people all over the world believe to be morally inadmissible and cruel.
This is the reasoning behind a great many of the amendments to this report.
Even if not all of us are certain that human life is present at conception and during the first stages of pregnancy, there is surely no one who would argue rationally that we can be 100% certain that human life is not present during those first days, weeks and months of pregnancy.
NoÂ one can be sure of such a thing.
In this day and age, no one can rule out the possibility that abortion is an attack on innocent and defenceless human lives.
The fact that we cannot be certain means that we should ask ourselves whether it is worth taking a risk when the stakes are so high.
Do we want to be viewed by future generations in the same way that we now view those who were racist or who supported slavery?
Do we want to be viewed as a society that realised it was unfair to discriminate against people on the basis of their race or origin, but that was entirely oblivious of the fact that it did itself discriminate against people on the basis of their stage of development?
In order to prevent the risk of this happening, we should avoid making any reference to abortion or reproductive rights in our documents.
I am quite sure that every single one of the objectives of our humanitarian policy could be achieved without any mention of abortion and reproductive rights, and this would allow us to act with a great deal more unanimity and solidarity.
I thank you for your attention, and I would ask you not to view my comments as a statement of political confrontation.
I am speaking in good faith as someone who believes in European unity, and who believes that Europeâs task is to pursue moral policies that do not attempt to impose on the rest of the world solutions to issues upon which we ourselves are divided in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, for years, this House has â as is only right and proper â taken a sympathetic line on the cause of human rights worldwide.
When this report then establishes that Moldovaâs competing parties did not have equal access to the media in the previous ballot result and could not count on impartial coverage about the campaign, I am pleased that the rapporteur is concerned about such values as free expression of opinion and an independent press.
In countries such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, too, those values, according to this report, are trampled underfoot on a massive scale.
This report, though, is very selective â after all, you do not talk about rope in the house of a man who hanged himself.
Indeed, it could have occurred to the rapporteur that Belgium, which is, after all, the country in which this Parliament is based, suffers the same ailments as Moldova, Algeria and so many other countries.
In my country, VRT, the public broadcasting corporation, which is funded by all Flemish taxpayers, has, in totalitarian fashion, decreed that it will not invite the largest party in Flanders, the , to appear, which amounts, in effect, to censoring it.
So it is that Flandersâ only opposition party is formally denied access to the public broadcasting corporation and gagged in the best tradition of the former East Germany.
From now on, a politburo of left and far-left editors-in-chief, not unlike the Soviet Unionâs former Peopleâs Commissioners, will decide whether reports about my party can be broadcast; only those that depict the party in a bad light will be.
No greater obsequiousness and venal sycophancy in respect of the establishment has ever before been displayed in the EU by publicly-paid journalists.
The freedom of expression and the right to information from varied sources has become a joke in Belgium; this is completely at odds with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I would urge all my fellow MEPs, irrespective of their party political allegiance, to sign the written declaration which we submitted today to lodge their concern about this of the media in my country and to denounce the totalitarian attitude of Belgian radio and television.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coveney on his excellent report.
I have always supported the highest civil and political rights and good governance for all states.
Democracy is the ideal form of government that enables the full consent of the peoples involved.
Nevertheless, the world is a complex place and a number of issues remain relative rather than absolute.
For instance, a balance must be struck between a stateâs right to defend itself against terrorist action and the need to ensure civil rights for prisoners.
This is illustrated by the GuantÃ¡namo Bay situation.
The United States felt that its national security was threatened after the 9/11 attacks and therefore had to detain large numbers of suspects until the lack of danger could be proven.
Now of course many have been released.
Another case is the reference to the condemnation of the security fence built by Israel, which has dramatically reduced the number of Palestinian suicide bombers who cross into Israel to kill innocent Israelis.
Yet many of my colleagues here believe that the fence represents an annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel, although the final borders will be settled only through a land-for-peace deal.
Another issue is impunity, which of course we all rightly condemn.
It is also a tricky issue as we have seen in countries such as Algeria, or, in the past, South Africa.
The parliament of Algeria is currently debating an amnesty for all those guilty of crimes against detainees, in the interests of peace and reconciliation and turning over a new page.
Regrettably perhaps, sometimes the carrot of amnesty is the only way of guaranteeing a lasting peace.
I have been also involved in the report on Uzbekistan and the question of a carrot-and-stick approach to this Central Asian republic which has no traditions of human rights or democracy and is now taking firm steps in that direction, something that must be encouraged.
This House must also look more closely in general at the human rights clauses in the EU Association Agreements in countries such as Syria, which continue to be one-party dictatorships.
In the case of Syria, there is also the issue of support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah.
Lastly, I remain deeply sceptical of the need for an EU human rights agency within or outside our borders.
This would duplicate the work of other bodies such as the United Nations, the OSCE or the Council of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Flautre, who is generally scathing in her comments, has congratulated the rapporteur.
I would not dare do otherwise, therefore, and I thank him in my turn.
I would, however, like to say that the report on human rights is a virtually impossible exercise.
There are in fact at least three traps into which it can fall.
The first is for there to be no consistency between one human rights report and the next.
I would like to tell Mr SzymaÅski we voted in favour of the right to reproductive health as a human right last year: I hope we will do the same this year.
The second trap is that of double standards.
I am, for example, amazed to find a whole paragraph on Morocco, which has made constructive efforts on human rights, but to find only one line on other countries that are blatantly violating human rights.
It is the law of the genre.
A third trap is perhaps lack of transparency.
We have in fact compromised in some areas, and as they stand some paragraphs suggest we have been less critical of great powers than we would have liked.
I will say no more about that; it is somewhat inevitable in an exercise like a human rights report.
More seriously, I would like to say that it is clear that there are some paragraphs which my party will not accept, paragraph 78 in particular, which condemns the Council for lifting sanctions against Cuba.
I would like to tell the Council that I welcome this act of openness.
I do not think that economic sanctions have ever helped democracy; on the contrary, they have served to completely harm and weaken nations.
There are therefore some paragraphs, some amendments to which my Group will be particularly sensitive and which will determine its vote at the end of the day.
That has, however, nothing to do with the qualities of the rapporteur, whom I thank once again.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to concentrate my observations on two areas of this report in particular.
The first is human rights abuses in Kashmir and the second is the fight against terrorism.
I wish to start by discussing paragraph 49 on Kashmir.
I would firstly like formally to thank Mr Coveney for his approach in dealing with this matter and the way in which he has been open to considering representations made by my colleague Mrs Lynne and myself.
Through a process of dialogue between our respective offices, paragraph 49 is now an adequate recognition of the position.
Of course I welcome the dialogue between Pakistan and India, but we must not forget that the people of Kashmir are also stakeholders in this process.
We cannot expect real lasting peace in the region unless they are able to play their full and proper part in the dialogue.
Equally, I welcome the recognition of the role of the Indian military and police in carrying out abuses and call upon the Indian Government to do all within its power to end such abuse immediately.
Equally, I urge the wider world to recognise that this burning issue between two nuclear powers deserves external input to facilitate dialogue between the stakeholders.
On the issue of the fight against terrorism, I welcome paragraphs 101 to 108 as they deal directly with issues pertaining to the current situation in many countries, including some European states, where citizens who follow the Islamic faith are being targeted in a systematic fashion for no reason other than the fact that they choose to follow the Islamic faith or they are perceived to be Muslim.
This has been explicitly admitted by government ministers at a national government level and is something against which we must take a stand as a parliament.
I am therefore encouraged by the above paragraphs, as we are taking a stand on the issue of the unnecessary and disproportionate erosion of civil liberties undertaken by governments against their own citizens under the guise of the prevention of terrorism.
Finally, I wish to highlight paragraph 111, to draw attention to the use by some states of torture by proxy and the potential reliance on evidence obtained by such means.
I am saddened to say that there are reports of prisoners being removed from within the EU to outside countries, for evidence to be extracted by the use of torture.
As a parliament we are duty-bound to disapprove of such activities.
Â Â  Mr President, we have always said that the main value of European integration is respect for and promotion of human rights.
I would like to congratulate Mr Coveney on this report that deals with a sensitive area in which the European Unionâs credibility is at stake.
Within the context of the proliferation of the trade and association agreements that the Union is promoting, therefore, we must not allow human rights to become a lesser requirement, but rather they should be the very essence of those agreements.
Let us look at some examples.
With regard to China and before lifting the arms embargo, we must take advantage of the dialogue on human rights we have set up with that country in order to promote internal political changes leading to greater democratisation and improvements in the institutions and justice systems, placing particular emphasis on the so-called three Ts (Tiananmen, Tibet and Taiwan), as well as the abolition of the death penalty.
With regard to Morocco, we must also take advantage of our privileged relationship as neighbours to condemn the repeated violation of press freedom, which, amongst other things, would involve Rabat lifting the sentences handed down to journalists such as AlÃ­ Lmrabet, observing international law and promoting the Baker plan as a framework for a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.
Mexico is another case in relation to which we must insist, on the basis of the association agreement with that country, that the Mexican authorities tackle violence against women with greater determination and political will.
Furthermore, we must express regret at the increasing persecution suffered by certain indigenous groups and anti-globalisation activists as a result of their public criticisms of the government.
With regard to Colombia, the European Union must reiterate its concern at the constant violation of human rights in that country and the growing threat faced daily by human rights activists.
We must therefore urge the Colombian authorities to protect these people.
Finally, the European Union must promote a series of binding regulations for companies in order to make them responsible for the possible negative impact of their activities on the environment, the social and employment situations of people and peoples and human rights in general.
Â Â  â Mr President, given the importance of this report to Parliamentâs credibility, I should like to make three comments:
Firstly, charity begins at home, and in the countries that will one day be part of that home.
It is therefore wrong that countries applying to join the EU should be exempt from the assessment.
The Kurds and the Turkish democrats do not welcome that exemption.
Secondly, the spectre of double standards looms large over the report.
For example, the report rightly welcomes progress made in Morocco, yet omits the fact that journalists can still be put in prison for referring to the Sahrawi people in Tindouf as refugees and not as hostages.
My third and last point concerns terrorism.
I welcome the fact that the report cites hunger and poverty as contributory factors to terrorism and that the fight against terrorism has often eroded the very values that could actually defeat it.
The rest, however, remains unsaid.
There is not a single word on ongoing military and colonial occupations and the way in which they result in violence against innocent people.
Can there be any doubt that Israelâs pursuit of both the fence and the settlements mortgages any lasting solution for peace and human rights in the region, or that the result of the notion of pre-emptive war is, tragically, there for all to see in Iraq?
This is why I shall be abstaining tomorrow, despite the fact that this report raises a number of important points.
We have a duty to do more and do better.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Coveney for his extremely comprehensive and well written report.
I particularly liked the fact that he not only clearly identified human rights abuses, he also identified and praised efforts to end such abuses where these efforts are being made.
I trust this report will receive widespread and deserved approval.
Will we give an equally positive response to the people who, through courage or desperation, flee these human rights abuses and arrive legally or illegally at our borders?
