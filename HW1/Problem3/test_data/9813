These fundamental principles require us to exercise due care and if necessary, provide adequate support for the people who live in the areas mentioned.
Transport difficulties, scarcity of raw materials, increased energy supply costs, difficulties in accessing the Internet, and telecommunications networks, difficult terrain, particularly in the mountains and the furthermost northern areas, depopulation, or illegal immigration - those are the major problems addressed by the report.
In support of the conclusions arrived at by the rapporteur, I wish to call to us all not to abandon these people to their fate.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to add my own congratulations to the rapporteur and thank him for his very constructive approach to our amendments as we were working on this in the committee.
I am very pleased to support his report today.
Coming from Scotland I have a particular interest and a particular perspective, as other Scots colleagues do, and I would remind colleagues firstly that peripherality is relative.
Brussels is actually pretty peripheral if I am looking for Scottish football scores on a Saturday.
Islands have a distinctive culture, a distinctive identity and a distinctive geography, which is something to celebrate, not pity.
If the playing field is level, there is nothing wrong with Europe's islands that will not be put right by what is right with Europe's islands in their dynamism, their innovation and their potential contribution to the EU's objectives.
If Malta was in central Europe with good transport links and easy links to the rest of Europe, then it would not be Malta any more, it would be Munich.
We must celebrate Europe's islands as well as recognise their distinctiveness.
Being an island means that there are specific issues which need to be dealt with and this report makes a number of solid suggestions.
I hope that our Commissioner will give us specific assurances today that this report will be acted upon because there are a lot of good ideas in it and I would hope that this would not become another wish list that the Commission pays lip service to but does not necessarily do very much with.
I would like to highlight a few specific points.
Islands have specific disbenefits in interaction with the European Union single market and we must have up-to-date, accurate statistics in order to inform policy.
Can our Commissioner assure us that we will work with Eurostat in order to make this happen?
In paragraphs 12 and 16 of our report, we call for the creation of a specific cross-cutting administrative unit within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy to deal with islands.
This already exists in respect of outermost regions.
The case for a specific unit dealing with islands is very clear.
Can our Commissioner assure us that this will actually happen?
On state aid, as other colleagues have mentioned, we must see a more realistic approach from the Commission in assessing state aid criteria for islands.
Islands have specific economic factors which are not currently sufficiently taken into account and I would welcome an assurance from our Commissioner that we will review policy on this.
Concerning state aid cuts, particularly in the field of transport to, from and within islands, in Scotland our own government has just squandered EUR 25 million on a very wasteful tender in respect of ferry services.
This mistake was largely domestic in origin, but the complexity of the interlocking EU rules did not help and we must take a look at this again.
We also need to look in particular at public service obligations and aid of a social character in terms of how they are viewed in respect of Article 87(2) of the Treaty.
The position of road equivalent tariff must also be clarified.
On energy, islands have a clear natural advantage and we would like to see the Commission use all means available to encourage sustainable energy communities, in particular the European grid, and the abolition of domestic constraints.
In Scotland with Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles and Argyle and Bute we have the best wind, wave and tidal resources in the EU and a vast potential contribution to make to the EU's energy and climate change objectives, but we are not developing these resources because we have seen insufficient investment in the grid.
If the EU is serious about meeting the climate change challenges, invest in interconnectors to the Scottish islands and the Scottish islands will make a vast contribution to our objectives.
Similarly, the UK Government is holding us back in terms of a discriminatory pricing system in access to the National Grid in the UK.
Simply, the further away from the main market, the higher the connection charge is to feed electricity into the UK National Grid.
I am firmly of the view that this is discriminatory under Article 7(6) of the 2001 Renewable Energy Directive and I believe that the Commission must open formal proceedings against the UK for holding us back.
The islands have a vast contribution to make and they can make it.
There is nothing wrong with Europe's islands that will not be put right by what is right with them, but we must ensure the playing field is level.
Your speech reminds us of an important fact: we are always on the periphery of someone.
The problem of centrality is not easy to define.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, we must, I think, congratulate the Committee on Regional Development for taking the initiative to prepare such a report.
The islands of the European Union truly are a crucial element within the framework of the cohesion policy for the period from 2007 to 2013, because most face difficulties which they must overcome in order not to be at a disadvantage in relation to the rest of the European Union.
Thus, for an island such as Cyprus, for example, the difficulties faced are as follows: high prices due to the interaction of captive markets and additional transport costs, low wages due to the levels of demand and opportunity, a lack of raw materials, increased energy costs, shortcomings in infrastructures, a limited range of activities and greater vulnerability to environmental risks which can impact on tourism.
The report covers the broader framework of these problems in a satisfactory manner.
However, there is a problem in the report with which I do not agree, and that is the problem of immigration.
In proposing greater policing of external borders, the creation of a border guard and the stamping out of so-called illegal immigration, we are hiding our heads in the sand and we are not proposing viable solutions to a very big social problem, because we cannot advertise the European Union as a global economic power on the one hand and close our borders on the other.
As far as this is concerned, the islands have a positive role to play which, unfortunately, is not the role described in the report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, so, we need another initiative do we?
This time for island people.
Actually, island people are by nature resourceful.
They are all still there, but they need help where the EU has interfered.
Last year this Parliament approved the resumption of licences for EU fishing fleets to plunder the waters of Western Sahara.
Unable to compete with the modern vessels of the EU, these people sought work elsewhere, and the Canary Islands began to experience the trauma of massive illegal immigration.
Graphically displayed on TV, boatloads of West Africans were seen trying to make their way across the Atlantic, their misery compounded as dozens died when their inshore craft could not cope with the open sea.
Once this EU-inspired exodus began, people from neighbouring countries followed suit, making it worse.
Malta faces the same problem of mass immigration.
Of course it does: the EU's high tariff barriers depress trade, with the poorer countries of northern and eastern Africa being hard hit, so off they go to try their luck in Europe using Malta as a staging post.
Pouring aid into Malta is not the answer.
It is the tariff barriers: bring those down, trade improves and most people in Africa will be able to make a living without moving home.
If you persist with a closed shop of 27 EU countries when there is a whole world out there just waiting to engage in trade with Europe, then the problems of your own making will continue.
Do I see in the report that EU islands, especially in the outermost regions, might be used as sources of renewable energy?
I suppose that means we intend to plant these ridiculous wind farms on them.
Well, that is one way of driving the indigenous population away, and all for useless turbines producing insignificant amounts of power at unpredictable times, located on remote islands so as to ensure that much of their pitiful output is lost in transmission.
I notice that islands are said to be vulnerable to rising sea levels: another dimension of the hysterical, doom-laden warnings of the 'global warmers'.
It is not happening on the scale that has been claimed.
And it is natural.
It has happened before.
The world experiences cycles of warming and cooling.
In the Medieval warm period it was hotter than now, and for decades.
There are enough records of these hotter events, such as certain crops growing where never before, but there are no records of islands disappearing beneath the waves.
It is about time we all calmed down and realised that minimal global warming is naturally occurring in a cycle that has no input from man.
We should simply adapt as nature intended.
In conclusion, let us stop interfering.
Leave successful islands alone.
Where help is needed, for third world islands or otherwise, let trade be their aid.
The EU's protectionist attitude is no long-term help, it is just sticking plaster and that always peels off after a while.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can we not take into account the structural disadvantages of our islands in Europe?
It was vital for this issue to be an objective in the EU regulations on State aid.
The own-initiative report on islands in the European Union and their undeniable constraints, presented by my highly esteemed colleague, Mr Musotto, is a milestone in recognising the importance of islands within the context of Europe's regional development.
In this parliamentary term, this is the first time that I have found myself analysing and commenting on a report that is so valuable and worthy of endorsement.
It is worthy of endorsement because it considers all the aspects necessary and is very balanced in its approach, as well as being absolutely worthy of support on its merits and with regard to its aims.
I will be happy to vote for it and I hope that it receives full endorsement from all my fellow Members.
Is it possible for the EU not to take into account a statistically undeniable fact, which is that approximately 15 million citizens live on islands, and that over 90% of these people have incomes lower than the European average?
The main causes of this state of affairs are the undeniable structural deficits directly resulting from island status, and for too long the European Union has all but ignored this fact.
Now, the valuable Musotto report, as well as setting out in the observations reasons for this underdevelopment, and clearly describing the specific resources of islands, finally focuses on what action the Union can take, and through which specific tools, analyses and statistics, as part of the allocation of the Structural Funds and aid to disadvantaged areas, to accommodate the structural disadvantages of islands.
This course is one that we owe to island communities, acknowledging both their role in European civilisation and their current role as an extremely important environmental and economic resource for the European Union.
If the islands are sustained within the undeniable constraints on their development that they still face in the shape of obstacles associated with island status, and if due consideration is taken of this in the guidelines on the Structural Funds, the European Union will be making a significant contribution to removing inequalities, or, in fact, discrimination, which is not only unjustifiable in terms of the Community acquis but antithetical to the established objective of fair and consistent development of Europe's regions.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the pronounced objective of the European Union to achieve convergence between its regions, the peculiarities of island regions lead to divergence.
The resources of the Structural Funds did not have the anticipated results for these regions.
As such, new action needs to be planned and special measures need to be taken for the islands.
The systematic monitoring and recording of their development in comparison with the other regions of Europe will be a useful tool.
I welcome the incorporation of a series of issues in the report we are voting on today, such as a re-examination of the conditions of contracts in order to facilitate transport and public transport on lines of little commercial interest, the safeguarding of energy security with the emphasis and priority on renewable sources of energy, a study and measures to combat the effects of climate change which exacerbate existing problems such as drought, broadband coverage to facilitate the daily life of island dwellers and resolve important problems, proper, controlled development which protects the appearance of the islands and dealing with the problem of illegal immigration and border controls by introducing a European coastguard.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's report is a good start.
However, if we are to achieve the desired results, I call on the Commission to propose immediate measures and action so that what is set out in the own initiative report is put into practice.
To close, I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, on his important and consistent work.
Mr President, an island holiday may be the stuff of dreams in terms of getting away from it all, but living and working on islands can pose many difficulties, and we should acknowledge this in our policy-making.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, on his report, which outlines the natural and economic constraints faced by islands in the context of regional policy.
The report deals with the singular difficulties that many islands face in competing successfully with their counterparts on the mainland.
The report usefully identifies categories of islands: some are large - 5 island regions have populations exceeding 500 000 and account for 75% of the European island population - whilst the remainder are much smaller.
I am more familiar with the problems faced by smaller islands, such as those off the coast of my native Scotland.
For example, only this week it has been reported that twice as many young women than men are leaving the Hebrides.
If this continues, the population will not be sustainable from 2019.
As Mr Musotto's report outlines, there are also common difficulties faced by islands, for example higher prices, difficult terrain, remoteness and poor infrastructure.
I support the call for these problems to be recognised in regional policy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating Mr Musotto on his excellent work.
I have expressed my awareness of the specific features of islands when participating in the negotiation process on the new regulations on cohesion policy as rapporteur for the regulation on the Cohesion Fund and as shadow rapporteur on the general regulation and the regulation on the European Fund for Regional Development.
I am well aware, therefore, that Parliament has recognised the disadvantaged status of islands and has confirmed that they represent a natural and cultural heritage for us all as Europeans.
The European Union must be able to sustain and promote these areas, providing the resources they need for harmonious development while complying with the principle of territorial cohesion, allowing a more flexible implementation of policies on State aid and ensuring effective protection of special environmental features.
Special attention should also be paid to islands that are a long way from large population centres, which have great difficulties in accessing services, even basic ones, by developing an EU maritime policy that is able to establish stable economic and commercial relations with bordering countries.
I am very much in agreement with Mr Musotto on the need to improve transport connections and infrastructure - I refer to ports and airports - as well as the need to offset the greater costs, particularly energy costs, that result from their geographical locations.
I find the rapporteur's proposal to set up a European coastguard body to monitor the external borders of the European Union an interesting one, since one of the problems from which our islands suffer most of all is illegal immigration via the sea.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I endorse Mr Musotto's excellent proposal to designate 2010 as the European Year of Islands.
(PT) In order to give real practical shape to the economic and social cohesion that has been announced, it is necessary not only to promote genuine convergence among the economically less developed Member States - the cohesion countries - but also to help reduce regional disparities, so encouraging the harmonious development of the territory of each Member State.
With this in view, it is now crucial - partly by increasing the financial resources allocated to cohesion policy - to support the disadvantaged regions and those with structural problems, so helping eliminate those obstacles to regional development that exist due to the permanent natural and geographical disadvantages that exist in, for example, the island regions.
Despite recognising the structural disadvantages from which islands suffer, the strategy adopted has been inconsistent, and that is why we approve of certain proposals emphasised in this report, such as an increase in the Community cofinancing rate on the basis of existing eligibility criteria, or flexibility in authorising State aids to the regions concerned, so as to alleviate the costs of fuel, transport and energy in a way that discriminates positively in favour of these regions.
Recognition of the obstacles, which have already been more than adequately highlighted, is not the main issue here.
Nor is the disadvantaged regions' competition over priorities.
Rather, it is the inadequacy of the financial resources allocated to cohesion policy, as shown in the current financial framework 2007-2013, within which the Structural Funds were reduced from 0.41% to 0.37% of GNI and priority was given to the liberalising and privatising objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, which undermine the specific competitive advantages of these regions.
(FR) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of Article 158 of the Treaty and of the Declaration on island regions annexed to it, the European Union takes into account the handicaps and constraints suffered by these regions in adopting specific measures to encourage the integration of European islands within the internal market.
However, Mr Musotto, whom I thank for supporting my amendments in the Committee on Regional Development, has good grounds today for questioning the European Commission about the actual implementation of these provisions.
First, I should like to remind you that the concepts of ultraperipherality and of insularity are completely separate, whatever the ties of proximity or of solidarity that unite them, since the main characteristics of the outermost regions are their great distance from the European continent and their belonging to a geographical area that is composed, for the most part, of ACP countries.
Insularity constitutes both a geographical and cultural advantage that represents a potential to be developed within an appropriate development strategy and a permanent handicap that causes extra difficulty for the competitiveness of these regions.
The principle of territorial cohesion, which was strengthened in the Structural Funds Regulations for 2007-2013, must aim at the polycentric integration of European Union territory so as to give all regions and their people equal opportunities.
In addition to the measures that you have mentioned, Commissioner, I would ask the Commission to further integrate the possibility afforded by the Treaty in terms of adjusting Community policies that could have negative repercussions for the economic and social development of these regions, in order to solve in practice the problems that specifically affect every island region or group of regions.
In conclusion, I think we should congratulate ourselves for holding this debate at a reasonable time and not at 11 p.m., as is too often the case, Mr President.
I am delighted, too, because I have always thought that this matter is important and deserves to be tackled by the European Union, including in the Treaties.
In the past, I have attached great importance to it.
(PL) Mr President, each enlargement of the EU involves a systematic increase of the role of islands in all Community policies, from territorial cohesion through to tourism and culture.
Unfortunately, the Union's policy so far has not taken into account these specific constraints of islands, and the problems they face when trying to compete with mainland regions.
There is therefore an urgent need to establish statistical indicators to help identify the specificities of all areas with difficult geographical conditions.
It is also necessary to take account of the need of islands to enjoy access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions, with priority given to the improving transport links with islands.
Each Commission should examine the possibility of granting aid also to island regions where fuel and energy costs clearly adversely affect their competitiveness.
Another priority is the energy security of islands and the development and implementation of relevant projects using renewable energy sources and new technologies.
In addition, the Commission should examine the impact of climate change on island regions.
Recognising the efforts made by the FRONTEX Agency it is nonetheless appropriate to highlight the need to monitor the impact of illegal immigration on island communities on an ongoing basis.
Member States must not overlook the need to provide effective measures to preserve the unique characteristics of island regions in terms of protection of the environment and cultural heritage and promotion of the sustainable development of tourism, which also affects the growth of other important sectors such as trade, fishery, and agriculture.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very well-prepared document.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is useful to discuss a specific economic instrument to support islands, their special features and characteristics, and I believe that it is useful for cohesion policy to pay special attention to the outermost regions.
I believe that we must act to bring about a real improvement in the transport system and infrastructure, external and internal connections and also connections within the islands, for instance between the coasts and the interior, but that we should avoid wasting European resources on monumental, useless projects, often designed to connect islands with the mainland via enormous bridges, which would certainly mar the very idea of island status.
While I welcome the drawing up of Mr Musotto's report, I think that it places undue emphasis on describing a relationship between islands and illegal immigration.
There is no relationship.
The vast majority of migrants to the Canaries arrive by plane, not by sea, just as the vast majority of irregular immigrants to Italy do not disembark at Lampedusa but also arrive by plane.
In my opinion, therefore, this argument is misplaced, and for that reason I believe that this aspect is probably not integral to Mr Musotto's report.
We must also question whether the mobilisation of rapid intervention brigades on the borders may perhaps be more useful in preventing the deaths of emigrants in the Mediterranean rather than in stopping them from arriving.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take just one important area from my colleague Francesco Musotto's very good report, an area whose importance not only for the islands concerned but for the EU as a whole should not be underestimated, namely the problem of illegal immigration.
This problem of illegal immigration must in my opinion be tackled more effectively, having as it does a highly disproportionate effect on the EU's islands in the Mediterranean.
Even though progress has already been made with the measures the EU has taken - with the development of an integrated border management system and the establishment of a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across any kind of borders, for example - the immigration figures nevertheless show that those measures are still not enough.
Even though the competence for measures clearly lies with the Member States and will have to remain with them in future, the islands cannot be made to carry the excessive burden alone simply because of their geographical position, because what is at first sight a Spanish, Italian or Greek problem subsequently becomes a problem for the whole of Europe and therefore also calls for a response at Community level.
Solidarity in action is what is required here and must be made reality.
In this connection, the creation of a European coastguard to monitor the EU's external borders would certainly be no panacea for this island problem, but this proposal of Mr Musotto's does deserve to be examined to see whether it could be one of many measures to combat illegal immigration and protect the islands and the EU as a whole.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Musotto, as the elected Member for the Autonomous Region of the Azores - which, as our fellow Member, Mrs Sudre, capably pointed out, is an outermost region whose status is not to be confused with that of the island regions - I should like warmly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, as well as the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the excellent work they have done.
I should like most especially to draw attention to the proposal concerning a European coastguard body - a proposal crucial to defending the marine environment, monitoring fishing, supporting maritime trade and, in particular, monitoring compliance with international labour and safety standards and, of course, dealing with the problems surrounding immigration.
Opposition to, or approval of, immigration is not at issue in this case.
The fact is, there are people who take to the ocean in unseaworthy vessels, and they need support while they are on the high seas.
In this context, I should like to point out that - contrary to what is stated by some of my fellow Members - these plans for a European coastguard body do not conceal an agenda overly preoccupied with security.
What we do have is a vision of European maritime policy vital to all island regions and, most especially, to the outermost regions.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr Musotto for the high quality of his report which we are now examining on the problems associated with the island regions.
The fact is that, as the report amply demonstrates, island status is an insuperable and permanent reality that seriously affects these regions' ability to compete.
It therefore makes eminent sense for specific EU resources to be demanded within the context of the various common policies, given the fact that island regions are at a competitive disadvantage in relation to continental regions.
This need was recognised by the treaties but, unfortunately, never gave rise to consistent overall arrangements.
What is more, the need for a European response designed to mitigate the competitive disadvantage from which the island regions suffer is all the greater inasmuch as increased European competitiveness in an international context is demanded nowadays.
It is therefore important for the European Union to be innovative in responding to the problems specific to the island regions and affecting their competitiveness.
What is needed is a response by the European Union that helps island regions derive more benefit from dynamic, highly competitive developments such as Europe's large internal market, Economic and Monetary Union and the Lisbon Strategy.
I should therefore like to support, in particular, the report's recommendation that an administrative unit, charged with defining and promoting a European strategy for the island regions, be set up within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy on the model of what already exists for the outermost regions.
Only in that way will due account be taken of the very specific circumstances of the island regions in the context of policies relating, for example, to transport, energy, the environment, tourism, taxation and State aids.
(PL) Mr President, I first want to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his thorough presentation of the natural and economic constraints of island regions with regard to regional policy.
The specific characteristics of these regions are generally recognised by the majority of Member States.
Despite the efforts made through regional policy, however, the relative position of island regions in rankings based on regional GDP has remained practically unchanged over the past 20 years.
I am glad the Commission has recognised that per capita GDP and unemployment rate are considered insufficient indicators with which to assess the socio-economic situation of regions beset with natural handicaps.
In these areas the ability to react positively to economic change is limited and island economies tend to be hardest hit by economic crises.
The economies of island regions are often dependent on a limited number of economic sectors.
The islands are heavily dependent on the public sector too.
Another important issue addressed by other speakers is illegal immigration.
I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission should undertake a special needs assessment study of island regions, propose solutions, and that this issue should be duly addressed in the Fourth Cohesion Report.
Mr President, I come from the United Kingdom and of course we have several large islands there.
But we also have the western islands of Scotland and these were briefly mentioned by my colleagues from the Scottish part of the United Kingdom.
You will know, Mr President, when you were President of the Malta delegation, as does Mr Busuttil, that Malta is suffering a lot of illegal immigration at the moment.
This is a matter that needs urgent attention, as Mr Berend pointed out.
I go each year to the Canary Islands.
They too have suffered enormous immigration.
Illegal immigration from Africa has already been mentioned this morning.
But I want to emphasise in my speech today two paragraphs.
One has the full support of the British Conservatives, that is paragraph 26, which talks about the need to really home in on this very important matter of illegal immigration.
But there is another, paragraph 25, which Mr Berend mentioned, where I dispute and disagree with some of the findings or recommendations put forward by the rapporteur in what is otherwise a very excellent report.
First of all, the report mentions rapid border intervention teams with the purpose of providing swift operational technical assistance to any Member State requesting it.
I agree that is very important, but when it goes on to say that it urges the Commission to examine the need for the creation of a European coastguard body to assist in parallel these regions and the Member States in monitoring the EU's external borders, I think that is far too wide a remit.
If the isolated islands want a concentrated coastguard specialist brigade helping them, fine, but not for the United Kingdom, not for the bigger islands.
We do not want too large an agency.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report.
Coming from an island region that is also an outermost region and, for that reason, recognised and dealt with specifically in the Treaty on European Union, I can state that, by means of this initiative, Parliament is offering not only a useful perspective on the permanent structural difficulties peculiar to all the island regions and affecting the lives of their citizens but also a helpful view of what the islands, and by extension the EU too, have by way of potential.
Without its islands and, in particular, its outermost regions, which rightly benefit from special treatment, the EU would have a lower profile in the world.
Nor would it have its current maritime area, associated of course with the advantages of the new European maritime policy, currently subject to public consultation.
Cohesion - which is one of the basic objectives of the European Union - will only be achieved if the regions concerned are able to count on across-the-board support in helping reduce and eliminate the obstacles to their development.
It is therefore necessary to help bring about an adjustment to EU policies, particularly when it comes to transport, energy, public service contracts and State aids, and this with a view to guaranteeing, for example, full employment, economic growth, integration into the internal market, the European model and the objectives of the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
Hence, I would ask the Commissioner and also the Commission to consider how best to transpose the policies to be adopted in future in the areas of development and regional policy.
(ES) Mr President, I must express my satisfaction with this initiative report by Mr Musotto, since it represents a step forward in terms of viewing the islands, within the framework of the European Union's regional policy, as disadvantaged as a result of the geographical, natural, structural and permanent limitations that slow down their socio-economic development.
I share the rapporteur's view that the Euro-regions play an important role, both in local projects for exchange of good practices, and also in the field of cross-border cooperation.
For this purpose, the Balearic Islands form part of the Pyrenees-Mediterranean Euro-region.
Furthermore, I applaud the rapporteur's special mention of the issue of illegal immigration.
I would like to take this opportunity to call upon him, when drawing up his compromise proposals, to take account of the amendments that Mr Fernando FernÃ¡ndez and myself presented to the paragraph in question of the report that we are discussing today.
We are insisting on those amendments and I must point once again to the islands' great vulnerability in the face of illegal immigration, in view of their particular geographical situation.
It is therefore necessary to integrate emigration and development issues within the framework of the Union's aid policies, and also in its programming, both through the funds making up the new framework programme on solidarity and management of migratory flows and through the regional policy instruments, in particular the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
Annex 30 to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognised the special characteristics of the islands, but unfortunately this recognition in the Treaty has not been implemented by means of effective actions and specific measures necessary to alleviate and correct the inevitable extra costs resulting from the characteristics of islands.
I come from the Balearic Islands, the rapporteur is from Sicily, and many of our Members come from islands, and we are therefore well aware of our regions' struggle to overcome the difficulties resulting from their island characteristics.
We therefore call upon the Commission, the Member States and the Council, in addition to specific measures to alleviate these disadvantages, to provide help and offer understanding in relation to this special situation.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank Mr Musotto for his excellent work in having highlighted the problems of island regions.
I have experienced these problems myself and know how complex they are.
The economic and social cohesion policy is essential in reducing the divide between differing levels of development in different regions, and on this point I would argue that special attention should be paid to the situation of islands, and I would like to thank the Commissioner for having mentioned this point.
Better development of our islands means strengthening infrastructure, improving connections, integrated transport and tackling problems and weak points in water and energy supply.
We need to make our island industries, such as agriculture, fisheries, craft and tourism, more competitive and more attractive. It is necessary to focus on creating conditions to promote full employment, attracting private investment and, at the same time, securing a sustainable standard of living and a significantly higher level of development, including through the promotion and development of alternative energies and new technologies.
Finally, we must not underestimate the ever-increasing impact of illegal immigration on island communities, particularly in the Mediterranean.
This is a disproportionate burden that the islands cannot and should not bear by themselves.
It should be our priority to find a general, responsible solution, which includes ways of tackling the emergencies connected with mass arrivals of immigrants - who unfortunately do not arrive only by plane - across marine borders, while respecting fundamental rights.
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we need to reduce the development lag of the islands through a policy of real solidarity, which will encourage island peoples to support the new European Union.
I would like to congratulate Mr Musotto once again on his excellent work and on having placed the focus on the many issues that are important for our islands.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, it has been a most interesting debate.
Let me start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, on his report - which I did not do in my opening remarks -and for bringing this issue before us today in the first ever report dedicated to islands.
He has made history!
Much has been said this morning about state aids, and I should like to respond to that first.
Again, operating aid - aid aimed at reducing a firms current expenses - is normally prohibited.
It is prohibited in the Treaty and it is prohibited by the regional aid guidelines, because of its highly distortive effect.
That being said, it can be granted exceptionally in the poorest regions that are lagging behind in terms of regional development.
The regions that can benefit from operating aid are, as you are aware, the 87(3)(a) regions, which are the outermost and sparsely populated regions, provided that a number of conditions are fulfilled.
In the poorest regions and, again, the 87(3)(a) regions, operating aid can be authorised only on a case-by-case basis, provided it is limited in time, degressive, proportionate, and designed to tackle specific structural handicaps.
In reply to Mrs Sudre, as you are aware, the Commission accords a particular status to the outermost regions, given their remoteness and specific constraints on integrating into the internal market.
For islands other than outermost regions, a generalised approach based on the characteristics of these regions seems rather difficult.
Enormous differences exist between island regions in Europe, and you are an example of that.
They are characterised by a large diversity, and in terms of regional development and their GDP per capita, a significant number of large islands are rather wealthy, as some of you rightly pointed out.
Granting operating aid to an island that has a GDP per capita among the highest in the EU would completely distort competition in the relevant markets without any justification in terms of regional development.
Thus, the Commission cannot accord the status of assisted area to all European islands, given their extreme diversity.
In response to Mr Arnaoutakis, I note that subsidising fuel and energy costs constitutes operating aid.
Such aid can only be authorised if the general conditions - which I have just touched upon - are fulfilled.
It must not prop up structurally loss-making activities, particularly those that are very damaging, for example, to our environmental or climate change objectives.
Furthermore, regional operating aid is certainly not the best instrument to tackle the local problems of islands.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the islands' main problems can be tackled more effectively with horizontal instruments.
For example, local services that are not economically viable can be supported through services of general economic interest.
Work and investment for all kinds of infrastructure can be financed.
They do not have an aid element and, in the case of very small islands in particular, the de minimis aid and the EUR 200 000 threshold can be sufficient, as I mentioned.
As regards Mrs Attwooll's comment about the market investor principle, I believe that we can apply a more refined economic approach to assess situations of market failure in islands and proposed investments.
However, as I have mentioned already, making the rules more predictable and more transparent and reducing the administrative burden of state aid notification are objectives of the state aid reform.
I understand the specific concerns of smaller businesses, who have to try to pick their way through the state aid maze, and we agree upon this.
That is why I have followed up on the suggestion made by some of you that the Commission should provide user-friendly guidance explaining our rules clearly and simply.
My services have now almost completed a full update of a vade mecum offering a concise overview of the basic EU rules on state aid.
The vade mecum does not aim to provide an exhaustive description of the rules.
Instead, it focuses on the issues that are most relevant for people involved in regional development.
I hope to have this vade mecum on line on the DG Competition Europe website very shortly, in a couple of weeks time, and I would be happy to provide copies to interested Members.
I would now like to turn to four wider issues raised by some Members.
Mr Smith mentioned the need for statistics.
The Commission is working well with Eurostat on a regular basis.
This May we will publish the Fourth Cohesion Report, which will include more statistics.
Mr Smith also mentioned access to the transmission network for renewable energy.
It is indeed vital and that is why the Commission takes the view that full structural unbundling of energy markets is the best solution to the problems of concentration and foreclosure of new entrants we have experienced in these markets.
Several Members suggested the need for a specific unit on islands in DG Regional Policy.
I will certainly take good note of this, but, as you are aware, it is my colleague, Mrs HÃŒbner, who is taking the decisions here and not me.
I am sure she will examine your idea carefully.
Finally, we will look carefully at your proposal for designating 2010 as the Year of Islands, but I assure you that the Commission will continue to pursue the best interests of islands in 2007, 2008 and 2009, so do not think that we are neglecting this important issue.
On the contrary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - One of the contexts where Malta is concerned relates to illegal immigration: 'islands are in the front line of defence against this problem; all are suffering under the weight of illegal immigration'.
In fact, the Commission's decision to set up four funds is giving visibility to the concept of 'solidarity in action'.
In the case of Gozo, Malta's sister island, we have a scenario of double insularity.
The Commission has highlighted the special situation of islands in the guidelines on (i) National regional aid for 2007-2013 and on (ii) state aid and risk capital for small and medium-sized undertakings.
But that does not address the issue where fuel and energy costs adversely affect the competitiveness of the communities living in such islands.
The economic activities prevalent in islands, notably tourism, agriculture, fisheries and crafts, need special attention.
Tourism represents one of the primary sources of wealth creation in islands with spin offs on other sectors - fisheries, agriculture, crafts.
But what importance do we give tourism in the European Parliament?
Perhaps the prevalent thought is that it is a natural issue, as one very senior Commissioner put it.
On the contrary, it is about time that the European Parliament set up a separate committee on tourism, as at present it is part of the Transport Committee and hardly appears on any agenda.
in writing. - The report has quite a number of recommendations that go a long way to addressing a host of disadvantages which are very specific to small islands.
We expect the Commission to take on board and implement the recommendation outlined in Mr Musotto's report.
Islands - whether in the outermost regions or not - suffer from natural geographical limitations that severely affect the inhabitants' lives on a daily basis, both economically and socially.
Small islands like the island of Gozo in Malta are the first to feel the effects of high transport costs, lack of investment, problems of communication, high rates of unemployment, social separation, and a more restrictive choice in the opportunities available.
In theory it is well recognised and accepted in the EU that islands, especially small ones, have to be assisted to overcome these natural disadvantages.
It is time to translate the well meaning objectives into concrete action.

Illegal bird hunting in Malta (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
Mr President, for purposes of clarification, I wish to add the words 'at the time' after the word 'Commission', so now Amendment 7 would read, 'notes that prior to the accession to the European Union, the Maltese Government stated that it had negotiated a derogation on spring hunting with the Commission; regrets that the despite the fact that other political forces and segments of civil society in Malta had challenged the Maltese Government's statements, the Commission at the time opted to remain silent on the subject, thus bringing about a potentially ambivalent situation'.
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on Amendment 12:
Mr President, our group wanted to request a roll-call vote on amendment 12, but unfortunately we failed to do so in time.
I therefore ask the House to allow a roll-call vote on amendment 12, even though we did not request it in time.
I am sure that my colleague Monica Frassoni will not object.
(Laughter)
(Parliament adopted the motion)

Euro-mediterranean relations (vote)
- Before the vote on paragraph 21:
(IT) Mr President, I believe that Mr Tannock has withdrawn his amendment in favour of an oral amendment which - I refer to paragraph 21 of the French text - would read as follows: after the phrase 'aucun cas refouler une personne', add 'demandeur d'asile vers un Ã©tat oÃ¹ elle risque ...'.
Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to call on my group to vote in favour of the final text because there was an error on the voting list.
Mr President, I have not withdrawn the amendment that I submitted, but I would be prepared to do so in exchange for a change to that oral amendment adding words along the lines of 'for the duration within which the asylum seekers are having their cases considered by the authorities', because otherwise they could stay in our countries indefinitely.
(Parliament rejected the oral amendments)

Compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights (vote)
- Before the vote on paragraph 15(2):
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, shortly before the vote, my attention was drawn to a problem that is very easily solved.
Paragraph 15 reads: 'intends to this end to amend Rule 34 of its Rules of Procedure'.
As we need a different majority for Rules of Procedure than for this vote, many Members find the word 'intends' too strong.
I would therefore suggest amending paragraph 15 as follows: 'is to this end considering an amendment to the Rules of Procedure'.
I hope the PPE-DE Group will also be able to agree to amending the Rule in this way.

(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on paragraph 1(s):
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment intended to introduce, in the second line of paragraph 1(s), following 'trade liberalisation under', replacing 'competitive conditions', the phrase, 'conditions of justice and mutual benefit based on complementarity and solidarity'.
It is also proposed that the same paragraph should end with 'the parties' economic and trade relations'.

Explanations of vote
in writing. I voted for this resolution and welcome the Commission initiative to launch a consultation procedure on the best form of Community action with a view to providing a framework for cross-border aspects of health-care.
(MT) I would like to explain my vote on the resolution on spring hunting in Malta.
I voted against the resolution because I felt that it was both unnecessary and disproportionate.
There was no need for it, given that there are ongoing discussions between the European Commission and the Maltese authorities on the issue.
The resolution is pointless, considering that Malta has made great strides in tackling those who defy the hunting rules.
In addition, what should be kept in mind is that, during accession negotiations between Malta and the European Union, the European Commission recognised - in writing and not in words - an agreement whereby Malta could use a derogation to allow spring hunting.
(DE) Mr President, unlike the previous speaker, I believe this resolution on bird hunting in Malta is a very important resolution.
The European Parliament has already shown on many occasions that animal conservation and compliance with the animal conservation laws we have in the European Union are very important to us.
That is why this resolution is very important, even if we have faced quite a strong headwind from the other side of this Chamber.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to say that I voted for the resolution concerning Malta because there has hardly been any progress on the part the Maltese Government.
We are still witnessing the killing of huge quantities of birds in Malta.
Many millions of birds are dying there, contrary to all the fundamental provisions adopted by the European Union.
I would also like to state that in the first roll-call vote, I voted for paragraph 2 of the Voggenhuber report by mistake, but I wanted to vote against, so please record this fact.
in writing. British Conservatives have voted against this resolution on purely procedural grounds.
We feel that this resolution represents an abuse of procedure.
Our vote should not be taken as an indication of British Conservative MEP views on the merits or otherwise of the particular case under consideration.
in writing. I voted for this resolution and wish to see an immediate ban on all illegal bird-hunting in Malta
The tabling of this resolution to the plenary meeting of this House could have easily been avoided had Malta simply cancelled the spring hunt and, in doing so, conformed to the provisions of the Birds Directive, but it persists in ignoring the countless parliamentary initiatives and the legal steps taken by the Commission, and looks set once again to permit its hunters to shoot a huge number of protected migratory birds.
Shooting them serves no higher purpose than as a hobby for the local hunters, and it has got out of hand, now threatening the diversity and preservation of the bird species in the whole of the European Union.
Representatives of the hunters have no qualms about calling those opposed to the spring hunt fascists.
They threaten their own government, their elected representatives and their police apparatus in an aggressive manner, and that is something that we in this Union of ours, cannot condone.
The Maltese Government may feel hurt by this resolution, but it could also feel invigorated by the support of the whole of Europe when taking measures to abolish the spring hunt, and it is for this latter reason that I am completely behind this resolution.
in writing. I will be supporting this report, despite the failure to include paragraph 21 in its original form: 'Points out that, under European Court Human Rights case law, the European States can in no circumstances send a person back to a state where he or she is likely to be subject to torture or cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment, including the death penalty.'
I am disappointed that there was a small majority in this House in favour of excluding this important human rights principle.
There is a lot I might have said about this resolution.
However, I am allowed only 200 words, which I shall use to condemn the resolution's silence concerning the unacceptable boycott of the Palestinian Authority (PA) proclaimed by the Israeli Government and the United States Administration following the Palestinian elections in January 2006.
The EU joined in the boycott and also suspended its financial aid, so exacerbating the already serious humanitarian situation with which the Palestinian people is confronted as a result of Israeli occupation and aggression.
It was silent on the unacceptable, wait-and-see and follow-my-leader attitude of the EU, which still continues to make the re-establishment of relations with the Palestinian authorities, including the recommencement of financial support, dependent on their meeting certain conditions such as the 'commitment to non-violence', when it is Israel that is occupying Palestinian territories militarily; or the 'recognition of Israel', when it is Israel that does not recognise the right of the Palestinian people to its sovereign and independent state; and 'respect for previous agreements and obligations, including the Road Map', when it is Israel that does not comply with the United Nations resolutions, the Oslo Accords and the Road Map itself and is continuing with its construction of the illegal wall and the policy of settlements.
in writing. I voted for this resolution.
In particular, I am in favour of the Amendments in line with the European Court rulings which stated that no individuals should be sent where they are at risk of maltreatment, torture or capital punishment.
One of the major successes of the European Union is the effect of successive enlargements - an effect due partly to the fact that the prospect of accession has been one of the main factors in the democratisation and modernisation of our countries and societies.
Since unlimited enlargement of the EU is impossible and not something that I would champion, I am in favour of an arrangement that would help bring about similar results in the Mediterranean basin.
I am thinking of a new European project, devised in partnership with our Mediterranean neighbours and designed to create, in the medium term, an area of free movement in the Mediterranean region and one whose rationale would be as close as possible to that of the EU model.
Accession to this area would be open to surrounding countries that fulfil the basic Copenhagen criteria of being democratic, having market economies and respecting human rights.
It would be an enhanced partnership in return for reforms.
It would also have the incidental and subsidiary virtue of being a solution that, being perhaps of interest to Morocco, Israel or Tunisia, might also be of possible interest to Turkey if that country were to come to the conclusion that the accession process had reached a dead end.
To have prosperous and democratic neighbours, tied in by the potential benefits and with populations that would not need to emigrate at all costs, would be a constructive European project.
Moreover, it would not even be a completely new one.
in writing. - (FR) It is clear that a genuine policy of cooperation with the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries is necessary in order to stem the migratory flows that Europe no longer has the means to accommodate, means that it has not had for a long time now.
It is also clear that a reasonable trade policy can be mutually beneficial to both shores of the Mediterranean.
This is not, however, what Mr Arif's report is proposing, which is to do nothing more and nothing less than extend, to North Africa and to part of the Middle East, the European Union, its functions and its policies: integrated agricultural policy, free movement of people and goods and freedom of services, to name but a few areas.
For what purpose?
We do not really know, since a study quoted by Mr Arif himself envisages negative social and environmental repercussions in the short and medium term.
It is therefore purely due to its free-trade ideology, and not in the interest of European Union countries, nor even in that of Mediterranean countries, that Parliament is supporting this project.
Despite containing a degree of reformist rhetoric, the objective of this report is essentially to promote the creation of a free-trade area (FTA) between the EU and the Mediterranean region and to do so, moreover, in the context of EU efforts to bring about the effective liberalisation of world trade through the signing of bilateral/regional agreements in an attempt to rise above the difficulties involved in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.
For example, the report provides for the, albeit regulated, 'opening up of agricultural markets', with particular reference to the wine and the fruit and vegetable sectors; the liberalisation of services, albeit excluding (only...) those public services considered to be basic (health, education, drinking water provision, the arts and audiovisual services); the liberalisation of energy supplies through the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean market; and the liberalisation of the industrial sector, specifically through the 'establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean production area' for textiles and clothing, in that way basically encouraging a large proportion of production capacity to be relocated.
In other words, the intention is to promote the liberalisation of trade, to the delight of the multinationals and major European importers, which long to dominate new markets and natural resources and to create new opportunities for exploiting cheap labour.
What, basically, is being put in danger are the nations' own development models based on specific national needs and circumstances, together with a project of cooperation between these different countries that is genuinely based on mutual support.
in writing. - (EL) In the 12 years since the Barcelona Declaration, the peoples of the Mediterranean have become poorer and more desperate, while some areas have been at war.
At the same time, capital - both local and foreign - is getting richer.
The report on the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean free-trade zone expresses the EU's concern about the lack of progress in the Barcelona process.
It calls for action to be stepped up, in other words for blatant intervention by the imperialist European Union in the internal affairs of the countries of the south and southeast Mediterranean, to be targeted at all aspects of the social, economic and political life of these countries.
The EU spends huge sums in these countries subject to terms and conditions, so that economic development and political structures serve Euro-unifying capital and its profits and circumvent any national sovereignty for the states in the area.
The concern expressed about political instability in the south and southeast Mediterranean, about the material damage caused by war, is hypocritical.
The imperialist EU is equally guilty and equally responsible, as the thousands of soldiers in the area bear witness.
Prosperity for the peoples can only be possible if they have full national sovereignty and the freedom to develop their structures and production as they so choose.
That is why they need to be freed from any form of foreign intervention and their anti-imperialist fight needs to be stepped up, so that the real rulers are the people.
in writing. I voted for this report which puts forward several suggestions concerning the creation of a mutually beneficial Euro-Mediterranean FTA.
I believe that the implementation of economic and political reforms can be an opportunity for growth.
In particular I am pleased that the report stated that the FTA must look at countries' specific economic and social characteristics to entitle them to protect their most vulnerable economic sectors, such as agriculture and public services.
in writing. (IT) The three main objectives set by the Barcelona Conference of 1995 - namely the creation of a free trade area by 2010 between the European Union and its African and Asian partners; an area of peace and stability and the development of free, democratic societies - have not yet been achieved.
The conflict between Palestine and Israel is, unfortunately, light years away from a peaceful resolution.
Furthermore, since Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a dramatic civil war has broken out between Hamas and Fatah supporters.
In some non-European countries in the partnership, although some of the fundamental human rights have been recognised they are often not fully applied.
The economic and social partnership too, fed by funds from the Meda Programme, has not produced the hoped-for results, and there is still a dreadful development lag, both because Europe has not taken enough care over the full implementation of the first and second Meda programmes, and also because the beneficiary countries have not always been able to create the economic and social infrastructure necessary to make themselves competitive.
Finally, in many Euro-Mediterranean regions, there is no effective transport system, Information Technology is still insufficiently developed and the telecommunications modernisation is still some way off.
For these reasons, I think it necessary to postpone the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.
My comments with regard to Euro-Mediterranean relations apply fully to this debate, mutatis mutandis.
As I have said on previous occasions, I support the objective of creating an in-depth partnership between 'Europe' and its Mediterranean neighbours.
Anything less than that - and a free trade area is less than that - is insufficient, in my view.
It is also clear, however, that anything that moves in that direction is positive and deserves my support.
That is essentially the case with what we are debating today.
I therefore voted in favour, but I would like our debate on these issues to move towards a broader view of the form our relations with our southern neighbours should take.
For the good of both sides of the Mediterranean.
On behalf of the Integrity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group and the Tricolour Flame Party that I represent, I say 'No' to this unacceptable resolution.
This is not with regard to the creation of a free trade area, but because of the confusing contents of the proposal and the outlook for the future.
In the current context of political instability and institutional confusion, it is not possible for the free trade area to mean simply an opportunity for the countries of the south-east Mediterranean.
The delays that these countries have encountered in implementing the reforms necessary to create a Euro-Mediterranean market must not automatically allow them to be given the right to protect the most vulnerable sectors of their economies, to the detriment of the countries of the EU, whose only role, according to this report, is to provide assistance, and whose citizens have to pay the costs.
The only account taken of the need to adjust the speed and intensity with which the markets are opened up is through the timely supply of support for the integration of the south-eastern Mediterranean countries.
The plans made for the creation of a kind of integrated agricultural policy for the Mediterranean and corresponding financial support for the countries of the south-eastern Mediterranean are on such a scale as to prefigure the transformation of FEMIP into an outright development bank.
To complete this farce, the report sets out to facilitate the free movement of workers, through legal and administrative procedures to facilitate the granting of entry visas.
There is no benefit in this, but just more burdens for European taxpayers.
in writing. I voted for this report and am pleased that there is an emphasis in the report on police reform and education.
in writing. I support this report on the basis that it makes proper recommendations in order to pursue justice and uphold peace in the region.
I particularly commend the rapporteur for encouraging the authorities in BiH to pursue wanted war crimes perpetrators and bring them to justice.
I also welcome the recently submitted draft plan for the police structure reform as it lays down a balanced allocation of responsibilities at all levels, while ensuring transparency in selection of police chiefs and officers and for monitoring their work.
Here I also want to commend the work of the dedicated men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who helped train the local police force.
(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the Voggenhuber report, because this House is once again wiping the floor with the Dutch and French referendums about the European Constitution.
How else could this be described?
Despite the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has never been a legally binding document, and, following the rejection of the Constitution in those two countries, never will be, this politically correct catalogue is being smuggled back in via all kinds of backdoors.
This is both legally and politically unacceptable.
Official Europe's obvious unanimous contempt for national democracies is the reason why the Dutch people were recently, and in their own country, instructed by Commission President Barroso to at last accept this Constitution.
The citizens are welcome to carry on voting, but it is ultimately the European mandarins who take the decisions.
Whoever thinks that this sort of arrogance is going to make the public less Eurosceptic can think again.
in writing. UKIP have supported this amendment because it states very clearly the factual position that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected and therefore should be abandoned.
However, in no way does voting in this manner imply any support whatsoever for the political Group that have tabled the amendment.
in writing. Conservatives support the principle of having a Charter of Fundamental Rights in place as an advisory declaration to Member States.
However, Conservatives voted against this report as the issue was to make the Charter legally binding (Justiciable) across the whole Union, which we are wholly opposed to.
in writing. I have supported this amendment because it states very clearly the factual position that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected and therefore should be abandoned.
However, in no way does voting in this manner imply any support whatsoever for the political group that tabled the amendment.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a summary of the common European values with which all of the citizens can identify, providing them with an instrument with which to defend themselves, through awareness and understanding of their rights, and to better control the activities of national and European authorities when they adopt and apply the Union's legislation.
I regret the fact that it has not yet been made legally binding, although it has become a reference text for the activities of the European institutions and for the European judiciary, as in the case of the Court of Justice.
It is crucial that we do everything we can to develop a genuine 'fundamental rights culture' in the European Union, by creating a general system for monitoring fundamental rights and by actively promoting those rights, and by intervening in the event that Member States violate them or fail to uphold them properly.
There must therefore be rigorous and systematic monitoring with a view to finding the best solutions to ensure a fair balance between security objectives and restrictions of fundamental rights.
Furthermore, respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be extended to the entire legislative process and to comitology.
in writing. - (FR) Mr Voggenhuber's report claims that all European legislation should be subject to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that veritable ideological rag-bag, and therefore that this Charter should be made binding.
In other words, it is in favour of disregarding the people's rejection of the European Constitution, of which the Charter formed Part II, and imposing a legal constraint that has not been adopted by either the people or their parliaments!
What is more, that would have three effects.
It would legitimise the intervention of the Luxembourg Court in areas from which it is excluded by the Treaties themselves, such as police and judicial cooperation, which is quite a paradox.
It would impose illegitimate constraints on Member States: Brussels could, for example, impose 'lock out', a right recognised in the Charter, but a practice that is banned in many States.
It would impose constraints on the direction in which the European Parliament votes: how could we amend, other than just at the margins, any legislation implementing a 'fundamental right'?
This text is very worrying: in the name of human rights, it pulls off the amazing feat of violating democracy, the Treaties and the rights of the European Parliament itself!
in writing. (SV) The report points in the right direction but contains a couple of unhelpful proposals, for example in paragraph 2, all of which conflicts with the mandate we have from our electorate.
It is important for all the EU's decisions to be taken with respect for fundamental human rights.
The report criticises the previous agreements on the transfer of passenger data entered into by the Commission with American authorities.
The rapporteur points out why the secret transportation of prisoners engaged in by the CIA on EU territory was illegal and emphasises how important it is that such human rights violations should not be repeated.
The report clearly shows that a European Constitution is unnecessary for the protection of human rights in the Member States.
There have been repeated manoeuvres to try to restore the so-called 'constitutional process', flagrantly disregarding the sovereign decisions of the French and Dutch people in their 2005 referendums.
The use of the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights', an integral part of that 'European constitution', has long been a ploy in this unacceptable game.
The rapporteur's intention is to see the content of the constitution introduced via the back door, that is to say, to make this text binding when in reality it is not, and hence 'preserve' the (in)famous 'central achievements of the Constitution'
If the objective is to defend rights, then we should observe those that are laid down in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and in the European Social Charter, internationally valid texts, which are more complete and whose legitimacy is recognised, compared to the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights', the content of which is thin with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, for example.
Once again, the intention is essentially to make use of human rights (now known as 'fundamental' rights) in order to (re)impose the so-called 'constitutional process', by hiding its unacceptable neo-liberal, federalist and militarist agenda behind statements manipulating the legitimate expectations and reasonable concerns of the different peoples of the EU.
We therefore voted against.
in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has a very particular and partisan conception of the definition of fundamental rights.
These rights serve as a support in fighting against individuals whom Parliament sees as undesirable, against political opponents, or else in attacking embarrassing governments that are not politically correct.
Curiously, they are never invoked in the defence, for example, of the rights of political minorities within its Chamber.
Minorities, whose error is not to belong to the great right-thinking mass of Eurofederalists.
In this area, the great principles of freedom of expression and equality are utterly despised.
The European Parliament puts that famous expression 'do as I say, not as I do' into practice.
This breed of European politicians is prepared to do anything to impose its vision of Europe and to do so against the wishes of the people, if necessary.
Therefore, even though the European Constitution was rejected by referendum in France and the Netherlands, this breed of politician is still doing its utmost to try to get it through bit by bit.
Likewise, although the Charter of Fundamental Rights has no binding legal status, the text proposed to us here seeks to make it indispensable - worse, an essential reference text - for European courts.
Far from being innocent, this report is dangerous for the freedoms and rights of the people.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report which looks at ways of improving the mechanisms for checking all EU legislation conforms with international human rights standards and fundamental rights are considered via impact assessment procedures as early as the draft Commission proposal stage.
In particular I am pleased that the report looks at ways of increasing the role of the Parliament in the defence of fundamental rights and in ensuring EU legislation conforms with international human right standards.
in writing. - (FR) The European Union is currently going through an institutional crisis.
By means of their vote, the people of France expressed their wish for a European Union, but a Europe that is not limited to the single market.
The citizens want a Europe that also confers social rights.
This proposal for a methodology for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Commission's legislative proposals and, in particular, systematic and rigorous monitoring to ensure that all of the fundamental rights concerned are complied with at the time of the drafting of all legislative proposals, must lead to Europe's wishes being fulfilled.
It therefore seems essential to me to find a way of not undermining the legally binding character of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that it can have all the weight that European citizens want it to have.
in writing. (SV) The report contains a lot of drivel about the EU constantly having to be developed more and more, and a number of helpful wordings about the Constitution and about more power for the new agency.
None of this is to the benefit of democracy and development.
Rather, these are standard wordings that constantly crop up again and again in the reports by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
What is exciting in this case is the demand for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to be able to prevent EU legislation that threatens such rights.
That is extremely important when a constant stream of new anti-terrorist laws evermore threatens the society such laws are intended to protect.
I am therefore voting in favour of the report, despite its shortcomings.
in writing. (PL) I voted in favour of the report on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Commission's legislative proposals methodology for systematic and rigorous monitoring.
Mr Voggenhuber prepared a very good report concerning the vital issue of fundamental rights.
It highlights the need to respect and comply with these rights, and also the need to create instruments for freedom.
It is essential for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become legally binding.
Systematic control and scrutiny by the Commission in order to examine all Commission legislative proposals for compliance with fundamental rights would seem to be appropriate.
As the main legislative body, the Commission should be charged with checking compliance of legislative proposals with other international instruments regarding the rights and freedoms guaranteed to citizens.
I support the Commission position.
It intends to apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its legislative proposals until such time as this Charter enters in force.
The protection of fundamental rights and ensuring compliance with them should be one of the Union's priorities.
It seems that early control of Commission acts to ensure their compliance with fundamental rights is a good sign, and indicates the direction of Union bodies' activities.
Hopefully these will lead to the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming legally binding.
in writing. - (FR) Making the European Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding is politically dishonest and irresponsible in practice.
This Charter has always been conceived as a document that is symbolic of political compromise influenced by powerful representatives of individual interests that do not promote the common good.
The Charter creates 18 new 'fundamental rights' that are unwarranted but obligatory for national constitutions, without any government or nationally elected representative being able to oppose them.
This Charter is useless and pointless so long as we have not formally determined the legal instrument to be applied at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Faced with doubts about double standards, I will not support the Charter, and I declare myself in favour of the Convention.
The only institution entitled to deal with the protection of human rights on the continent is the Council of Europe.
The only legal instrument in relation to human rights in Europe is the European Convention on Human Rights.
Our European super-agency on human rights is the European Court of Human Rights.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Meyer Pleite on the negotiation of an EU-Central America Association Agreement because I believe that the European Union must continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the environment and human rights worldwide.
This agreement must seek a balance among the three pillars - political dialogue, cooperation and trade - that makes it possible to consolidate the democratic processes in Central America, improve the efficiency of democratic institutions and administrations, combat violence, corruption and impunity, as well as human rights violations, and, finally, improve social cohesion and the living conditions of all of the region's inhabitants.
in writing. I voted for this report as I support a balanced association agreement in which progressive trade liberalisation should be a tool (and not a goal) put at the service of the main objectives of the promotion of socioeconomic development, sustainable development and social cohesion.
The political, economic and social deficit suffered by the Central American countries deserves an agreement taking into account the asymmetries between both regions.
in writing. - (FR) Against the backdrop of the globalisation of finance, agriculture, migration and the market, the nations of Europe must form an alliance of civilisation with the countries of Central America.
Our farmers, for example, are basically confronted with problems similar to those of the campesinos in Mexico or of Latin American SMIs, faced, as they are, with the confiscation of their intellectual property, their expertise and, above all, faced with their gradual wiping out by a global trade system that pits our banana producers in the French West Indies and the Canaries against producers from Honduras or Nicaragua, solely to benefit multinationals like Chiquita.
The need for this alliance of civilisation between Europe and Latin America becomes all the more clear in the light of global migrations.
Therefore, if, in the 1970s, French manufacturers in the car, steel and building industries had turned to the Latin American workforce instead of to that of Aures, Anatolia and Kabylia, French society would have avoided today's tensions and public budgets would have avoided heavy expenses.
By entering into an alliance with Europe, Latin America would find the allies it needs, within international and trade forums, to defend a concept of the management of human societies and economies that are different from the Anglo-Saxon ideology of the market's being everything.
On being appointed rapporteur for this report, I drew up a text, in collaboration with Central American civil society and political organisations, that recommended an Association Agreement based on three fundamental pillars: political agreement and good governance, development cooperation, and trade between two regions under conditions of fairness and mutual benefit based on complementarity and solidarity.
Following the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a series of amendments were incorporated based on the opinion of the Committee on International Trade which entirely distorted the approach of my report, by indicating that the establishment of a free trade area was a priority strategic objective.
My view, which is shared by a majority in Central America, is that an Association Agreement dominated by neo-liberal formulae would be a mistake and would only lead to inequalities and poverty in Central America, benefiting the multinationals.
Within this context, the different political groups have reached a series of compromises that water down the neo-liberal nature of the report, but not sufficiently so in my view.
This report is still very different from the one I initially intended and I have therefore abstained.
in writing. (PT) There is no question that the current situation in many Latin American countries make a clear explanation of the true intentions of the Association Agreements promoted by the EU rather contentious.
This is why, at the last minute, in certain points of the resolution, the European Parliament has replaced a clear indication of its aim, the creation of a 'free trade area', with the phrase 'Euro-Latin American area of interregional partnership', while maintaining the content of the former as the objectives of the latter.
This piece of trickery does not disguise the fact that the aim is the 'establishment in time of a free trade area', providing in its 'negotiating guidelines for gradual reciprocal trade liberalisation' (which has been softened at the last minute by adding, 'in conditions of justice and mutual benefit based on complementarity and solidarity'), aiming to 'negotiate a single and indivisible trade agreement which goes beyond the negotiating parties' present and future WTO obligations, and establish over a transition period compatible with WTO requirements a Euro-Latin America Global Interregional Association Area... without excluding any sector...', developing a 'customs union' and a 'common internal market', guaranteeing 'market access in agriculture' and in services (except health and education).
What more needs to be said?
I will vote for the report on a negotiating mandate for an association agreement between the EU and the Andean Community if the asymmetries between the various member countries of the Andean Pact are taken into account when negotiating a free trade area (attention must be paid to the different economic levels, demographic characteristics, different political courses, the great lack of modern communications and transport infrastructures between the individual Member States).
Another important point is the introduction of core labour standards and the fight against drugs and arms trafficking.
in writing. I voted for this report because it supports a balanced association agreement in which progressive trade liberalisation should be a tool (and not a goal) put at the service of the main objectives of the promotion of socioeconomic development, sustainable development and social cohesion.
Mr President, I want to focus on just one aspect of the Meyer Pleite and YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a reports, namely their support for regional integration in Latin America.
In last night's debate, Commissioner Mandelson told this House that such integration is the key to growth and stability.
He is entitled to his view, but no one in Latin America has elected Mr Mandelson to anything - nor, come to that, has anyone in Europe.
As colleagues know, some states in Central America in particular are complaining that Brussels is making its trade and aid agreements conditional on their participation in regional structures.
I do not question the sincerity of those in Europe who insist that supranationalism is in everyone's interests, but is it our place to tell other countries to mimic what the EU is doing?
Why is it that whenever we debate in this House say Iraq or Iran, Members are quick to denounce Washington for seeking to impose its values on the world, but when it comes to hectoring other states about the need to cede their sovereignty, Brussels is suddenly keen to impose its values on the world?
We cannot have it both ways.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that when trade is freer, world prosperity is furthered.
The concept of free trade is based on the idea that the more parties there are involved with it, the better the results they will see.
This own-initiative report contains much that is worthwhile and that could give rise to increased prosperity.
Unfortunately, as is so often the case with reports from this Parliament, there are also extraneous and unhelpful wordings.
The report talks, for example, of the strategic external policy aspects of an agreement and of giving Parliament more power in relation to issues of both trade and external policy.
It is unfortunate that the aspects I have just mentioned overshadow the desirable things that could be achieved.
I have therefore voted against the report in today's vote.
in writing. (SV) Free trade is the most important agent of prosperity in the world, and the more countries that participate in it, the more the prosperity of those countries will grow.
The incorporation of large parts of South and Central America into a free trade area with the EU would therefore represent a big step towards prosperity and the eradication of poverty.
This own-initiative report therefore contains many worthwhile proposals that could lead to increased prosperity if they were implemented.
As is so often the case with reports in this Parliament, however, it unfortunately also contains a number of points whose aim is to promote the development of the EU into a federal superpower and to increase Parliament's power at the expense of the Member States.
The report talks, for example, of the strategic external policy aspects of an agreement and of giving the European Parliament more power over both trade policy and external policy.
Despite these strong objections of mine, it is my judgment that it is better for these Interregional Association Agreements to be entered into than for them to be prevented.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I believe that the disappearance of people, which has a dramatic impact on everybody, on the people and on their families and friends, is unacceptable under any circumstances, and particularly in European territory.
The EU cannot shirk its responsibilities and must play a key role in resolving these problems.
Effective measures must be taken, backed up by effective cooperation amongst the parties involved, with a view to putting an end to the atrocities that have been going on for decades and which violate human dignity and the Declaration of Human Rights.
I am also delighted with the removal, on 9 March, of the wall which for decades separated 'the last divided capital in Europe'.
Beyond the intrinsic merits of the proposals we are voting on, regardless of any particular view of the Cyprus issue, this resolution is important because it reminds us that in our 'Europe' there is still a wall as shameful as the one we have called the 'wall of shame', even though in Nicosia the wall has been replaced with boarding.
The problem, however, lies in the line that separates an island, divides Europe and causes suffering on both sides.
We must always remember that, and this declaration is a reminder of it.
in writing. British Conservatives can welcome certain elements of this report such as the need to monitor the impact of illegal immigration on island communities.
However, we cannot support the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
Nor can we support any moves towards the creation of a 'European coastguard body'.
For these reasons, we have decided to abstain on the final vote.
in writing. - (FR) The existence of this report on the integration, in regional policies, of the characteristics and handicaps of island regions in the European Union, in itself demonstrates that these special characteristics, while not having been completely hidden over the years, are not being properly addressed.
This is, no doubt, because of the very nature of the European Union, which is given to standardising and levelling.
I also regret that stress was not put on the unbearable restrictions that the application, or the threat of application, of ordinary European law represents for these areas, particularly in matters of tax and competition.
In France, dock dues, VAT rates or reduced excise duties, applicable to Corsica and to the French Overseas Departments, are periodically called into question and must also be periodically renegotiated in Brussels by the government.
Finally, I deplore the fact that the swamping of certain European islands by the influx of illegal immigrants is seen, almost clinically, in this report as a purely local matter, when it is an extremely serious problem.
The removal of internal borders and the immigrationist proselytising of the EU are, it must be stressed, one of the major causes of this problem.
I have just two points to add with regard to the resolution in question:
I would like to stress that we agree that the issue of being an island should not be confused with the issue of being an outermost region, and that we must therefore bear in mind that the outermost regions are doubly disadvantaged.
This is due, firstly, to their distance from the European continent, and, secondly, to the fact that they suffer structural disadvantages due to their island characteristics, in particular, and to other natural and geographical obstacles;
I would like to emphasise our complete disagreement with the points of the resolution backing the current immigration policy, in particular with regard to immigration from North Africa, in that it supports the creation of 'Rapid Border Intervention Teams' and of a 'European coastguard body' within the framework of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX), with the aim of alleviating 'the immediate pressure to deal with this problem'.
We believe that this is a repressive policy, which criminalises immigrants, who are merely seeking better living conditions for themselves and their families, in the same way as thousands of Portuguese people who emigrate each year.
It is a policy that sidesteps and fails to tackle the underlying causes of immigration, which have been identified for a long time, particularly by the United Nations.
Hence our decision to abstain.
in writing. I voted for this report.
The importance of islands in major Community policies is increasing with the expansion of the Union.
I am pleased that this issue remains on the agenda as it is still a challenge for the EU.
This report has identified the main problems of islands, such as higher prices, lower salaries and difficulty of access to the single market.
in writing. While fully supporting the calls for greater consideration to be given to the plight of islands in the context of regional development I felt I had no choice but to vote against today's report by Mr.Musotto because of its endorsement of a "Fortress-Europe" approach.
The economic and social development of islands is very important and requires special measures such as the flexibility requested in terms of competition regulations.
The islands off the coast of Ireland have played and continue to play an important role in preserving the Irish culture and economy.
Sinn FÃ©in will support any measures which contribute to the support of such islands.
in writing.
(IT) The islands of the European Union, whether they are extremely remote or not, almost all have to deal with the same difficulties. These include a lack of infrastructure, higher prices caused by additional transport costs, higher energy costs, emigration and immigration.
For these reasons I have on several occasions called on the European Commission to give an opinion on some issues that are vital for the development of islands, and specifically Sicily, my region of origin.
I believe, first and foremost, that it is vital to grant all islands special lower rates of taxation, as has been done for other European Union regions.
This would make it possible to attract more capital, generating development and employment.
With regard to incentives for investment, I have asked the Commission to look at the development of a policy that will encourage, in particular, foreign investment, particularly from outside the European Union, at a zero tax-rate.
Finally, with regard to the lack of infrastructure, which constitutes one of the greatest obstacles to socio-economic growth in the islands, I am in full agreement with the call upon the Commission to review its policy regarding failure to grant State aid for infrastructure projects that improve transport connections.
On this point, I would like to emphasise the need to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina.
The island regions face great difficulties as a result of natural and economic constraints.
Higher transport and energy costs, lack of natural resources, depopulation, poor infrastructures and illegal immigration make it necessary to adopt specific Community measures to respond effectively to the characteristic problems of these regions.
The Structural Funds are therefore the principal instrument for Community action in this field.
They can respond to the Union's political will not to abandon its islands.
Specifically, we must ascertain precisely what their characteristics and needs are.
The Commission must then ensure that the specific problems faced by the European islands are always taken into account, and accordingly it must take border control measures to tackle the illegal immigration that threatens them.
It must also draw up an integrated development policy, which is able to ensure the sustainability of economic activities, such as tourism, on the islands.
Finally, this whole package of measures is essential in order finally to create the conditions to allow these regions to enjoy the same access to the single market as the continental regions.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
(PL) Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Union is acting along the right lines by increasing the role of local authorities in our cooperation with individual countries, in particular with third countries.
I am glad it is focusing on decentralisation of both cooperation and aid.
Local authorities play an important part in local and regional development, because they understand the needs of local communities, are locally based, and have usually been democratically elected.
They play a particular role in combating poverty and inequality.
Their role as institutions mainly involves issues related to education, health, the environment and entrepreneurship.
It should be highlighted that they do not usually have enough financial resources at their disposal. This is true in particular for poverty-stricken regions with high unemployment rates.
These local authorities do not receive appropriate support from Member State's budgets.
Empowering local authorities to act in their own right in the framework of our development policy therefore deserves our full support both now and in the future.
This is confirmed by our experience of cooperation with local authorities in Union countries, including my country - Poland.
in writing. I voted for this report as I believe it is crucial that communities have their aid delivered by the structures closest to them in order to achieve their Millennium Development Goals.
In particular, I am pleased that the report contains concrete suggestions for actions to be taken by the Commission, most notably by increasing dialogue with local authorities on development aid, improving decentralisation of aid delivery and supporting structured dialogue between local authorities in the developing world and the EU.
That concludes the explanations of vote.

Banning seal products in the EU (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on banning seal products in the EU.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, thank you for giving me this opportunity to formulate the Commission's position on the ban on seal products in the European Union and to comment on the action already taken or planned.
Seal hunting has been the subject of dispute and intense debate for many years now.
I absolutely agree that there are reasonable questions in connection with seal hunting, irrespective of where it takes place.
Nonetheless, it is encouraging that most seal populations appear to have stabilised and their survival is not endangered in their natural habitat.
This opinion is based on the scientific statistics available on the development of populations of grey harp seals and blue hooded seals.
There are no scientific indications of serious adverse repercussions from the hunt on the survival of these species of wild fauna.
The seal population in the northeast Atlantic has increased significantly since the beginning of the 1970s from just 2 million to about 5.8 million grey harp seals, which are the main target during the annual hunting season.
In other words, the seal populations in question are endangered at present and, consequently, they do not come under the CITES Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
In order for these species of seal to be included in the CÎÎ€ÎS Convention, international trade would have to threaten their survival in their natural habitat.
This should not of course dissuade us from addressing the other important issue which arises in connection with seal hunting in numerous countries, including certain Member States of the European Union, by which I mean the issue of whether the importation and exportation and the marketing of seal products should be banned where the seals are not hunted in a way which complies with the specifications we have laid down on the proper treatment of animals.
This is the reason why I agree that, even if we have not yet taken legislative measures at European Union level, the concerns formulated by the European Parliament on the proper treatment of animals and, in particular, on seal hunting, need to be examined in detail.
In order to do this, we need to have the relevant information and statistics needed and that is why we have asked for an independent study to be carried out.
On the basis of the results of this study, which has been prepared mainly by the European Food Safety Authority, we shall decide to propose to the Council and Parliament that measures be taken.
According to the principles of good governance and lawmaking and the clear rules of procedure for the Commission, we must work on the basis of solid scientific data and the relevant impact study must be carried out before examining whether any measures should be taken.
I have also issued instructions to my services to examine the possibility of the Commission's sending a mission to inspect and observe seal hunting during the 2007 hunting season.
The Members of the European Parliament may examine the possibility of taking part in this mission.
A full and objective evaluation of all aspects of this issue will enable us to take the right decisions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, our Commissioner is a reasonable and a humane man.
He asks for time for research.
We grant him that, but in return he should impose a moratorium on any imports of such seal products during that time.
He says that the seal cull in Canada is sustainable.
It may be, but in 2006, 330 000 harp seals were killed and 95% of those were under three months old.
A large number of those were then skinned alive, because 79% of sealers do not check adequately as to whether the pup is still conscious.
The cull is cruel and it is not worthy of a civilised country.
It is certainly not sustainable in a country like Namibia.
In Namibia, which has the second largest seal hunt in the world, the quotas increase each year.
In 2007 the quota was 91 000 and a combination of high quota and natural mortality of seals means that the entire pup population could be annihilated this year.
Seals are not killed for food; they are not really killed to protect fish stocks.
They are killed for fashion, and Europe is the market for that fashion.
It is the key market for seal skin imports from Canada.
Belgium has banned it.
Italy and Luxembourg have temporarily banned it.
The United Kingdom and Germany have called for an EU-wide ban.
The European Parliament in its written declaration has called for a permanent ban and the majority of Members of this Parliament have signed it.
So please, Commissioner, 'yes' to research, but 'yes' also to a moratorium now.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I would like to express my agreement with what Mr Bowis has just said.
In reality, there is no reason why the moratorium should not go ahead immediately and the studies that the Commission sees fit be carried out subsequently.
There is already plenty of striking information about this issue.
Furthermore, a clear example has already been set by other countries, such as the United States and Mexico - the United States banned any use of seals more than three decades ago - and I do not understand why the Commission believes that we do not yet have sufficient information to act immediately.
As our fellow Member has already explained very well, this is not just a question of sustainability.
It is essentially a question of ethics.
The question is whether it makes sense, simply in order to satisfy certain fashion tastes, to kill in an entirely barbaric fashion - as reported last year by a delegation from the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, including our fellow Member Carl Schlyter, and as we have been shown in many different ways.
If the Commission wants to see what is happening on the ground, a mission from this Parliament is going to Canada next week.
We shall go directly to the places where this hunting is taking place.
The Commission is welcome to come.
It can certainly take part in that mission and it will be able to clear up any doubts that it may still have with regard to this problem.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, sometimes I wonder how it is possible not to see the blindingly obvious, and then I think of the Canadian Government's persistence in allowing an annual festival of blood-spilling carnage to be carried out on hundreds of thousands of defenceless baby seals.
Other times I wonder how it is possible not to have any feelings in the face of extreme cruelty, and then I think of the thousands of fashion-mad individuals who pay through the nose to wear seal fur, taken in many cases by skinning still-conscious animals.
However, at no time do I wonder how it is possible not to hear what is deafeningly loud, neither do I ever wonder how it is possible not to understand what is comprehensively simple, because, with respect, Commissioner, I have seen this happening only too often when it comes to the way in which the Commission sometimes deals with the European Parliament, and the subject matter under discussion here today is a good example.
In September 2006, Parliament called on the Commission very clearly and very loudly to introduce an EU-wide ban on the trade of all seal products.
Six months later the Commission is before us today telling us that, with seal killing being notoriously at the forefront of senseless cruelty to animals for so many years, it still needs more time to consider the matter further.
Being a close friend and ally of the Commission and stretching our patience generously, I think we should give the Commission more time, if that is what it wants, but, as other speakers have said, on the condition that, in the meantime, an immediate moratorium banning all seal products in the EU is put into effect.
This is dictated by our firm conviction on the matter, the need to act quickly and the fact that some EU Member States have already proceeded with national bans.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, last year I went and saw the seal hunting in Canada on behalf of the Animal Welfare Intergroup.
The seal hunters used violence to try to prevent me from seeing what was going on.
They forced our car off the road, they climbed onto our helicopters so that we could not fly in them and they threatened to kill us if we left our hotel in order to try to document the seal hunting.
In spite of these methods, we succeeded in obtaining photographs and we saw how incredibly cruel seal hunting is.
The hunters knew that they had something to hide.
The seals are skinned alive, clubbed and left to choke on their own blood.
They are wounded and either drown or have to suffer still more, as a second shot, designed mercifully to finish them off, would cause a two-dollar fall in the value of the skin.
It is not for conservation reasons that we should ban such hunting.
It is for ethical reasons.
I would nonetheless point out that the population declined the last time there was a huge hunt.
We are now also faced with climate change, and the Greenland seal needs the ice sheet in order to be able to suckle her young.
Many young seals are at present aborted in the water.
Through being the world's largest market, the EU supports such hunting, and Parliament has clearly said that we do not want our market to be a party to it.
As Mr Bowis said, many countries have introduced national bans.
When it was cat and dog fur that was at issue, the Commission said that the internal market was not working and that it would introduce an EU ban.
The same logic applies in this case.
Does the Commission want studies to be carried out?
There are many studies indicating the problems mentioned here in this House, especially the Bird and Veterinary Report, but these should not mean a delay in taking necessary measures.
If you want more time, we can give you that time, but in that case we want a temporary ban in place until you are ready, and you must determine the legal basis for such a ban.
Thank you for choosing the European Food Safety Authority's animal protection committee to carry out the study.
That decision has led to it being accepted and to it being independent and representative of the will of the countries concerned.
I want to point out that seal hunting is not of vital interest to the economies of any of the countries that hunt seals - Canada, Norway, Russia and Namibia.
We see in the case of whale hunting that when this was abolished and replaced by whale watching, the latter was more profitable, so we can also help the seal hunters themselves improve their financial position if they manage to give up their cruel practice.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, seals have been a threatened animal species for years.
Their numbers have not only diminished as a result of illness or pollution of the sea water along densely-populated coasts, but also by the increasing hunt for them.
For a while, it looked like seals were set to die out completely in some coastal areas.
Even now when seal quotas seem to be restored to some extent in some areas, there is a continued need for sustained protection.
There is evidence of the opposite of protection where people's possessiveness is given free rein.
Seal skin is a sought-after material for the decoration of clothing and toys, and the craving for this is satisfied by the disgraceful means of clubbing young seals to death and skinning them alive - an abhorrent activity on which some coastal residents have become economically dependent, and a system perpetuated by the possibility of exporting seal skins and finding buyers for them far from the scene of the crime.
This is why it has been vital for many years to ensure that products of this kind are no longer for sale, particularly in the richest parts of the world, such as Europe.
The first part of Commissioner Dimas's statement shows that he shares this House's, and the public's, disquiet at this.
The subsequent outcome, however, is disappointing.
There would be no objection whatsoever to an impact study, and increased inspection in Canada and Namibia would be welcomed.
This cannot be a justification, though, for continuing with a policy of 'wait-and-see'.
Some EU Member States have already followed the USA in taking action against imports, but why are some European countries lagging behind in this?
There is every reason for an immediate moratorium.
Even if we introduced one tomorrow, it would come years too late given the seriousness of the situation.
I would therefore urge you not to use the study as an excuse for further procrastination.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very constructive contributions to this afternoon's discussion.
First of all, I would like to repeat that from the conservation point of view there is no basis to take any action, because in 1970s we had 2 million seals of the most hunted species, and now we have 5.8 million of these seals.
We are looking only at the second issue - it is very important.
As regards the study, firstly I have to repeat that the Commission fully recognises the high level of public concern regarding the application of humane killing methods, and in line with its commitment to high animal welfare standards, we will examine all available information.
There are reports - which are partly contradictory - that seals are being hunted and killed in some regions in an inhumane way.
The assessment that I referred to - and which one of the speakers found to be necessary - will present balanced, objective and operational conclusions and recommendations.
The overall outcome should enable the Commission to draw some conclusions and to come back with possible legislative proposals if this is warranted by the situation.
Regarding the moratorium, in legal terms the Commission does not have available an immediate remedy to impose a moratorium on the import, export and trade in seal products.
It would not be possible to refer to the safeguard measures provided for under the public health and animal policy that would allow for a temporary ban when public or animal health is threatened.
For example, the decision to temporarily suspend imports of wild birds was adopted in order to protect animal and public health because of the risk of a worldwide spread of avian influenza.
Furthermore, under the trade policy there is no immediate remedy possible.
Any measure the European Union decided to adopt would need to be necessary and proportional and would need to be notified to the World Trade Organization.
At this stage it is therefore not appropriate, nor is it feasible, to impose an immediate trade ban.
The Commission first needs to carry out an objective assessment of all available information.
The outcome of this assessment should enable the Commission to draw sound conclusions and to come back with possible legislative proposals if this is warranted by the situation.
Reference was made to the United States, and its Marine Mammal Protection Act was enacted in 1972, which was before the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species entered into force in 1975.
Furthermore, Member States have the opportunity to impose measures according to the case law of the European Court of Justice, but the Community has no such legal basis.
I would ask you to urge your governments in your Member States to impose bans - they have the legal means.
We need to have the appropriate legal basis before we can impose bans at European Union level and that is what we are trying to do by having an impact assessment and by gathering information.
However, if you show your concern in your countries and urge your governments to impose bans, this will facilitate internal market reasons for the European Union to take steps.
Finally, I wish to reiterate that the Commission is strongly committed to high animal welfare standards, both within the European Union and at international level.
A full objective assessment of the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting will allow us to see the whole picture and have a solid basis before drawing any conclusions.
We shall examine all available information and take the necessary steps.
If it is established that seals are being hunted and killed in an inhumane way, a ban on the import and export, as well as the placing of products derived from the seal hunt on the market, will also be considered.
We will report back to the European Parliament within the shortest possible time.
I repeat that we have already asked the European Food Safety Authority to conduct the scientific part of the study, and I have written to the Canadian Government to ask that we be allowed to participate in a mission, and the European Parliament is also invited to participate in order to see how the hunt is being organised.
What you said previously about your experiences is very interesting.
The floor is yours Mr Beazley.
I understand that this will be a formal motion.
Mr President, before the Commissioner speaks, I just wonder if it is in order to put a supplementary question to him on the timing of his statement.
It is over 25 years since the European Parliament first raised this issue.
When the Commissioner very helpfully said that he would report back in the shortest possible time, could he be more specific as to exactly how long he anticipates that time might be?
Member of the Commission. I saw in your letter that you fear the study will take years.
That is not so.
It is a matter of months.
The debate is closed.
The attack on Galina Kozlova, member of the board of the Mari national organisation Mari UÅ¡em and editor of the literary magazine OntÅ¡Ãµko (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the attack on Galina Kozlova, member of the board of the Mari national organisation Mari UÅ¡em and editor of the literary magazine OntÅ¡Ãµko.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission regrets the violent attack on Galina Kozlova which took place on 25 January in the capital of the Mari Republic, and I express my sympathy to her and her family and my best wishes for her speedy recovery from her injuries.
The Commission expects that the incident will be thoroughly and speedily investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.
In this context I note that an investigation has been opened and that the President of the Mari Republic has reportedly demanded that it be given special priority.
More generally, the Commission is aware of the situation of Finno-Ugric indigenous peoples, such as the Mari-El people in Russia.
We are also aware of the concerns raised by a number of Members of the European Parliament concerning the treatment of the Mari-El, notably with regard to the Mari language in school teaching and the harassment of journalists and the presidential elections in December 2004.
The Commission took good note of Parliament's resolution of May 2005.
The Commission sees common values, including the respect for human rights, as a cornerstone of its relations with Russia.
The Commission participates actively in the EU-Russia human rights consultations, where we aim to discuss the most important issues with Russia in an open and constructive manner.
It would be useful if we could, on issues such as these, move away from mutual recriminations and focus on exchanges of experience and best practice on how to deal with these problems, which can arise in many modern societies.
It is for that reason that the Commission has suggested that the participation in the human rights consultations should be widened to include not only diplomats but also experts from line ministries and agencies responsible for tackling these issues on the ground.
The next round of consultations with Russia on human rights - including the rights of people belonging to minorities - and fundamental freedoms will take place on 3 May.
The Commission has raised the issue of the rights of the Mari population bilaterally with the Russian authorities.
In response, they have given information on the activities which have been undertaken, financed by the government of the Mari Republic, to promote the development of art and culture in the Mari Republic, to encourage multilingualism as well as to foster traditional arts and crafts.
Support is given to publishing books by authors in the Mari language, as well as their translation into Russian, for newspapers in the Mari language and for study at the University of Mari El and other institutions of higher education.
Finally, I should add that, in the roadmap for the common space on research and education, including cultural aspects, the EU and Russia have agreed to work together in order 'to strengthen and enhance the European identity on the basis of common values, including freedom of expression, democratic functioning of the media and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities and promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity as a basis of civil society in Europe without dividing lines'.
We are now working together with Russia on an action plan for cultural cooperation which will aim to translate these principles into concrete action.
Exchanges in this field should help to build a better climate in which the cultures and traditions of minority populations are respected.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her understanding and quick reaction.
Parliament has already voiced its concern about the situation in the Mari El Republic: that was two years ago back in May 2005 after Mari national leader Vladimir Kozlov was brutally beaten up.
Alarmingly, no improvement has been noted since then.
Clamping down on attempts to revive Mari national culture and language has continued.
Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the fact that an investigation into the beating of Mr Kozlov has produced no results in two years and now there is a new incident.
I think that the most alarming fact in today's Russia is that politically motivated killings, deaths and physical attacks continue unabated and that not a single perpetrator has been caught or tried.
The latest case is that of Ivan Safronov, who happened to fall from the window just before he was to publish an article about illegal Russian arms sales to Syria and Iran.
Sadly, the robust revival of widespread xenophobia, militant movements of neo-fascists and Stalinists have become part of Russia's reality.
If a government has for several years been unable or unwilling to guarantee the basic right to life and security for all its citizens and to bring contract killers to justice, then such a government necessarily undermines its own position as a credible international partner.
Our message today should be the following: there can be no further progress in EU-Russia relations until the Kremlin decides to intervene and stop this vicious cycle of killings and human rights violations.
Clearly, if Russian citizens cannot have confidence in the justice of their own state, how can Russia's partners abroad have trust in future gas deliveries and Russia's compliance with the international code of conduct?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) On behalf of the European socialists, I am very grateful to the European Commission for its rapid reaction, for we face a very serious situation that gives much cause for concern.
As my fellow Member Tunne Kelam has already implied, the 2005 decision had its result, and the situation in the Mari Republic improved temporarily.
Now, two years later, once again we see a peaceful female activist, Galina Kozlova, brutally attacked, in an incident that rightfully attracts the attention of the European Commission and the European Parliament.
We know that the perpetrators of the attack on Mr Kozlov in 2005 have still not been found, and in fact this is also grounds for the current decision.
As President of the Minority Languages Intergroup within the European Parliament, and of the Finno-Ugric forum - which is a cross-party initiative - I was able in September 2006 to invite Mr Kozlov here to Strasbourg.
I was able to determine first-hand this is no radical, unmanageable individual, but rather a remarkably moderate man.
The purpose of today's resolution is to take note of and draw attention to the fact that the European Commission and the European Parliament are paying attention to what is happening there.
We ask the Russian federal authorities to exert pressure on the local authorities of the Mari Republic, because this examination is far from reassuring.
The case is being treated as one of light bodily injury, whereas in fact Galina Kozlova suffered a fracture of the skull base, which is a serious bodily injury!
Today's resolution is important for this reason as well, and it is similarly important that at the next EU-Russian summit, the situation be raised along with the situation of other Finno-Ugric peoples, and that it be discussed within the context of the EU-Russian dialogue as well.
I wish to thank Mrs Neelie Kroes and the Commission for their cooperation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) On 25 January of this year, Galina Kozlova was seriously injured by an unknown attacker in Yoshkar-Ola.
Mrs Kozlova suffered skull, brain and eye injuries.
She was treated in hospital for several weeks, and is still recovering at home.
The perpetrator or perpetrators have not yet been caught.
This is not so surprising, of course, in light of the fact that, as we know, serious incidents against activists struggling on behalf of the rights of the Mari minority occurred regularly between 2001 and 2005, and not a single perpetrator has been brought to justice since that time.
This situation does raise the fear that these serious incidents occur at the behest of the local authorities, or at least with their tacit support.
Our parliamentary resolution of 2005 had tangible results, as my fellow Member Mr Tabajdi has suggested, since for a year and a half no such incidents occurred.
It is true that the situation of the Mari minority did not improve significantly, but small steps forward are being taken, and therefore I am glad that the Commission is now also addressing these questions and putting them on the agenda.
But I also request both the Commission and Parliament to devote much more attention to resolving the problems of the Finno-Ugric minorities and of minorities in general within Russia.
We encourage the Union to speak up within the context of the European Union-Russian human rights dialogue on this matter.
This is not simply a matter of an isolated event, but at the rights of the Mari minority and indeed of the Finno-Ugric minorities in general.
At the same time I also urge that within the context of the cultural cooperation between the European Union and Russia, subsidised programmes at last be launched in support of the education, language training and maintenance of cultural institutions of minorities, and especially of the Finno-Ugric minorities.
If we are not successful in moving forward, then this matter will have to be put on the agenda of the European Union-Russian summit, for it is intolerable that despite the will of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, there should be constant violations of civil rights in Russia.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, from this Chamber we protest against those who breach human rights and violate the rules of law.
We should, however, ask ourselves what effect our activities driven by solidarity with people of good will are having.
I do not believe it is the effect we would wish.
Nonetheless, this is one of the ways to hinder social processes that adversely affect us all such as disrespect for human beings, violence and the struggle to be able to present one's views, something every citizen of a democratic state should be able to do.
Galina Kozlova, who is a member of the board of the Mari UÅ¡em organisation and editor of the literary magazine OntÅ¡Ãµko is an example.
She is married to Vladimir Kozlov, President of the Mari-El Republic's Council.
She has given distinguished service to the republic, but unlike many journalists, she does not share her opponents' political views.
As Europeans it is our duty to monitor, raise, and condemn the discrimination of Mari citizens, and attacks on their representatives and journalists.
We support Galina Kozlova in her struggle for the interests of Mari citizens and democracy.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the 1920s, the Soviet Union tried to find a fair solution to the problem of nationalities.
The large Russian empire, with its many minorities, made way for regional self-government for the other peoples, with education and administration in the people's language.
It is to this decision that 11 countries, including Ukraine, Georgia and Uzbekistan, now owe their independence.
The many smaller peoples, such as the Chechens, Tatars, Ossetians, Karelians or Mari, on the other hand, were given only autonomous areas within Russia or one of the other federal states.
These peoples have been in a bad way ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Nobody has recognised their right to independence and they all hope that they, despite everything, can retain the rights that were granted to them 85 years ago.
Unfortunately, the continuation of these rights is threatened by resurgent nationalism in both Georgia and Russia.
The bad political climate in Russia is the price for holding onto Chechnya, against the wishes of the Chechens, by extremely violent means.
Intimidation and murder are, in fact, promoted within the army in which young soldiers are systematically abused by older soldiers, and obliged to keep quiet about it.
In Putin's Russia, there is less and less room for protest, critical investigation and change of power.
The stability of the regime in power and the ever-increasing concentration of authority over the different regions in Moscow are given absolute priority.
Opponents are put behind bars, beaten up or excluded from elections.
Even more drastic is the sudden death of critics, in particular people who are suspected of disclosing important information.
Europe must help Russia not to slide down further towards a situation that is becoming intolerable for more and more people.
It is in this light that the protection of the people who stand up for the right of the Mari Republic should be seen.
(LT) First I would like to thank my colleagues Tunne Kelam, Vytautas Landsbergis and Charles Tannock for their initiative in arranging for us to hear the Commission's report on Galina Kozlova today and adopt a resolution.
This resolution is yet another European Parliament document, concerning human rights abuses in Russia, which is linked to the EU through a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - currently in force - and through a strategic partnership that it now appears is based not on shared values but on pragmatism, seeking economic and other benefits.
To me, as a member of the European Parliament's Human Rights Subcommittee, one avenue of EU-Russia cooperation is particularly important - the ongoing EU-Russia consultations on issues of human rights, minority rights and basic rights.
In this context the brutal attack on Galina Kozlova, editor of the literary journal OntÅ¡Ãµko and wife of Mari Council chairman Vladimir Kozlov, an attack with precedents in the Mari Republic, not only deserves our attention and consideration, but it forces us to return yet again to the general human rights situation in Russia.
Considering the latest data, Russia is now the second most dangerous place in the world for journalists (after Iraq).
Therefore, I fully support the spirit of our resolution, in which the European Parliament urges the Russian Federation and local governmental institutions to honour their commitments under international law, not just to guarantee freedom of the press but to implement legislative provisions relating to the protection and support of minority languages and cultures.
I think the problems of Finno-Ugric minorities in Russia could be raised by the Commission during the ongoing EU-Russia dialogue on human rights issues, and during the EU-Russia leaders' summit.
(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament expresses its concern about the attack on Galina Kozlova, member of the board of the Mari UÅ¡em national organisation and editor of the literary magazine OntÅ¡Ãµko in the Mari-El Republic in the Russian Federation.
Galina Kozlova is married to Vladimir Kozlov, President of the Mari-El Republic's Council, who was also nominated for the 2006 Sakharov Prize.
We should recall that this prize was presented by the current President of Estonia, Toomas Ilves, who was formerly a Member of the European Parliament.
The question arises as to what Russia is aiming at.
There is a growing number of attacks on independent activists and journalists.
More and more incidents remain unexplained.
Issues such as repression, violation of human rights, and of the rights of minority national groups in the Russian Federation are being raised ever more frequently.
Perhaps what is happening is that President Putin's regime is becoming increasingly authoritarian?
This case should be food for thought for us, and we must demand a thorough investigation by the Russian authorities to identify the perpetrators of the attack.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, this has been an impressive debate and I have taken good note of all the points raised.
It is good to focus our attention, from time to time, on issues which do not necessarily make the headlines in the EU.
The attack on Mrs Galina Kozlova was one such event, and I hope very much that she will make a full and speedy recovery and continue with her responsibilities.
As I have said, the Commission would like to have a constructive dialogue with Russia on such matters.
We are aware both of the criticism of the present situation regarding the Mari people and of the efforts which have been made at official level in Russia to safeguard their rights and their culture.
Modern societies need to find ways of addressing the situation of minorities to encourage peaceful and harmonious social economic development.
We all need to continue making efforts in this respect.
We shall aim, therefore, to use our contacts with Russia, and in particular the human rights consultations, to identify ways in which we can work together to improve the situation.
I have already mentioned that 3 May is one of those meeting days.
The Commission will continue to raise concerns about human rights at all levels, from the summit down.
For a more detailed discussion, the best forum for an exchange of views with Russia is the human rights consultations.
Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received three motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5 p.m.
1.
Guatemala
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guatemala.
author. - (PL) Mr President, in recent months in Guatemala there have been a number of unexplained murders, unexplained threats, cases of intimidation of trade union activists, politicians, and of society as a whole.
Human Rights Watch published its recent report on human rights in January 2007.
This report states that during the 36-month dirty war in Guatemala, which ended in 1996, some 200 000 people were killed.
I repeat, 200 000 people were killed during the 36-month dirty war in Guatemala.
Over the last 20 years we have witnessed the process of democratisation in Guatemala, including many achievements concerning the rule of law, and the development of democratic institutions.
However, Guatemala still remains a country where the rule of law is compromised, and where democracy has not yet taken root.
We are faced with a whole series of unexplained murders and disappearances in the past, together with current incidents involving powerful gangs, and international crime.
Let me remind the House that in 2005 between 70 and 80 million documents linked to the dissolved national police were found.
These documents contain information regarding the so-called 'disappeared' during the dirty war.
An appropriate storage place for these documents has so far not been found.
It is high time for Guatemala to resolve these issues in a democratic manner.
Mr President, today in this House we have voted through recommendations for the Commission regarding the Association Agreement with Central American countries.
My political group has stressed that we believe trade liberalisation should be seen in a political perspective.
Trade liberalisation in Latin America cannot be separated from democratisation.
The European Union must make every effort to help the people of Guatemala to reinforce democracy, investigate all murders that happened during the dirty war, and strengthen the peaceful transition so as to establish genuine, truly democratic structures in that country.
author. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Pinior for pointing out that in Guatemala terror is a tradition extending back decades, on both sides.
When we were dealing with Guatemala in the urgent debate in the last session a few months ago, I reminded the House that in the early 1970s, that is more than 30 years ago, a German diplomat, Karl Graf von Spreti, was abducted and murdered by terrorists in Guatemala; he was a prominent Bavarian politician who always spoke out for freedom and we shall shortly be marking the anniversary of his death again in Bavaria.
Even then, terror was used both by the regime and by those opposing it.
Since then, the country has still not found rest, despite a degree of democratisation in the last 20 years.
There is violence on the extreme right, there is violence on the extreme left and, as Mr Pinior has rightly pointed out, there is unfortunately also the violence of organised crime, which is in many ways mixed up with the political extremists.
That is why we really must pursue an intensive and offensive policy on Latin America.
I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra for taking this initiative on behalf of our group, and also to Mr Dess, who is particularly concerned with relations with Latin America - in his case mainly Brazil.
We want to make clear, however, that Latin America is of concern not only to our Spanish and Portuguese colleagues but to all of us, and that the continent is an important partner.
Only when democracy and the rule of law are at last firmly rooted in Central and South America and all forms of extremism are brought under control will that continent be able to play the role which its economic and cultural weight actually demands.
That is why - and I agree with Mr Pinior here - we must use all the commercial policy instruments at our disposal to work for democracy and the rule of law.
Democracy and the rule of law are not a luxury, neither are they a flourish that might perhaps be applied to what are really economic relations.
In the long term, there can be no successful economic relations with regimes and forces that flout basic human rights.
That is why this human rights debate is indispensable and we must apply pressure accordingly.
author. - (PL) Mr President, in distant Guatemala, three members of the national Parliament were killed.
Then, just like in a crime movie, four policemen involved in the case and placed under arrest, including the chief of the anti-Mafia department in Guatemala, were murdered in prison.
This really sounds like a thriller screenplay, but it is not just a movie, it is life, and part of the pattern of everyday life in Guatemala.
It is right for the European Parliament to react.
We are reacting to the situation in a state whose President has publicly acknowledged that his country's police force is riddled with corruption.
We are referring to a country in which several thousand murders take place every year, and which, like Colombia, is involved in the drugs trade.
Now, as the House will be aware, the authorities of the Central American Parliament are discussing with Daniel Ortega, the re-elected President of Nicaragua, the possibility of moving the seat of the Central American Parliament to Nicaragua from Guatemala where the danger is so high.
What can things have come to, if Ortega is now offering a safe haven.
I believe that in such a situation Mr Posselt and Mr Pinior are right, we must adopt an explicit and firm position.
author. - (DE) Mr President, the human rights situation in Guatemala is frightening.
Mr Czarnecki has referred to the specific case on the basis of which we are dealing with the subject today.
The situation in Guatemala is of course marked by the strong influence of social groups outside the political parties, especially the military and business.
In some parts of the country, the Indian population in particular has little confidence in the state legal system.
Human rights experts in Guatemala say that several thousand people are murdered every year, but only around 2% of cases are actually solved or lead to arrests.
Yesterday, a German citizen was shot dead in Guatemala.
Trade unionists, like Pedro Zamora in Puerto Quetzal, or farmers' leaders and their families were killed at the start of this year.
Witnesses of murders or their legal representatives are threatened and attacked and their homes broken into.
If the security situation is to improve, there needs to be a political solution, not further arming of the security forces.
That is why it is essential to note that these very 'security forces' are part of the problem in Guatemala.
Now the European Union has announced that it intends to support these selfsame security forces and unfortunately also to continue backing an intensification of free trade.
The response from thousands of people from Guatemala is relatively clear; we saw that when US President George W. Bush visited Guatemala.
There were large demonstrations against his visit.
There is a free trade agreement between the USA and the countries of Central America, the CAFTA, and Bush told Guatemalan President Oscar Berger yesterday that it was advantageous for all sides.
Bush also promised Guatemala further support in fighting organised crime, especially drug gangs.
As in Brazil, Uruguay and Columbia, however, the first stops on Bush's journey, the president's visit was repeatedly accompanied by protests.
It is good that it was.
If the European Union follows the US policy example, that could therefore become highly problematical.
What is needed is not free trade and arms for the security forces but real steps to prevent poverty and an improvement in the legal situation of the majority of the population.
author. - Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the European Parliament has passed a number of resolutions on Guatemala in the past.
They have had some effect, but it seems that we are still a long way from achieving our aim of helping to bring true democratic reform to this country.
The callous murder in mid-February 2007 of three members of the Central American Parliament and the alleged involvement in this and many other crimes of police officials is a reminder that impunity and police corruption in Guatemala are still very much in existence.
Such gross deficiencies in democracy, along with attempts to curtail freedom of the press, are cancerous inflictions in the body of any society and drastic action must be taken urgently in order to remedy the situation.
The Guatemalan authorities have a lot to answer for and a huge responsibility to act decisively in order to protect their citizens' rights and freedoms.
We shall await and watch closely with a critical eye to see and be convinced that they have the will and the stamina to stamp out the criminals from the police force and from other state institutions.
author. - (ES) Mr President, we debated Guatemala in one of these urgency debates not so long ago, when we discussed the extradition of RÃ­os Montt and others.
Today we are debating it again, this time in relation to the murder of three El Salvadorian members of the Central American Parliament, as well as the people suspected of the crime, in their case in prison.
Nevertheless, this worrying episode is not an isolated one within a context that is becoming increasingly tense and dangerous.
Lack of security is a serious and growing problem in Guatemala, but so is the impunity following certain acts, some of which are carried out directly by public institutions or at least with their consent.
The Guatemalan Government itself, in the person of its Vice-President Stein, has acknowledged that organised crime is becoming increasingly ingrained in the public institutions, including the police.
As previous speakers have said, the statistics are striking.
Thousands of people are murdered each year in Guatemala, but arrests have been made in just 2% of cases.
One of the most recent cases has been the murder of the campesino leader, Pedro Zamora, in Puerto Queztal, which we reported to the Commission and the Council.
Nevertheless, in view of the new episode that we are discussing today, we must reiterate some of the demands that this Parliament has made previously.
Firstly, we must repeat Parliament's appeal to the Guatemalan Parliament that it ratify the Statute of Rome regarding the International Criminal Court, and also that it ratify the agreement signed on 12 December 2006 between the Guatemalan Government and the United Nations establishing an International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG).
Secondly, we must call upon the Guatemalan authorities to adopt measures to protect witnesses and victims of human rights abuses in judicial processes.
Thirdly, we must call upon the Commission, in the strategy for cooperation with Guatemala for 2007-2013, to enhance the promotion of the rule of law, the fight against impunity, full respect for human rights and support for the government in increasing the security forces' capacities to safeguard human security.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Guatemala is one of Latin America's poorest countries.
Out of Guatemala's population of 11 million, more than half live on the verge of poverty.
The civil war certainly contributed to the present situation.
We should remember that the war spanned 36 years and is estimated to have cost the lives of more than 200 000 civilians.
The people of Guatemala are still suffering particular and permanent violence, intimidation, corruption, and breaches of their civil rights.
As long as politicians and government officials responsible for maintaining public order are brutally murdered, there will be no democracy.
A society continually affected by violence cannot develop and function normally.
Police corruption makes it impossible to attempt to settle accounts with the bloody past.
It is commonly known that the army is largely responsible for crimes and serious violation of human rights.
Corruption of the state, politicians, administrative authorities, and public services stimulates the development of inappropriate behaviour and poverty.
Society is intimidated and is effectively being held hostage by criminals.
Many international organisations report that Guatemala is a paradise for organised crime.
This Latin American country is listed as a part of the world where human trafficking, involving children in particular, is conducted on a large scale.
Every effort must be made to support and protect all those who dare to say 'no' to illegal structures, and to the links between state structures and organised crime.
Putting an end to impunity by prosecuting those responsible for outbreaks of political violence is an indispensable step in this process.
The Union should therefore ban politicians who go along with the corruption of public institutions for the sake of political correctness from entering EU territory, as it has already done in the case of other countries where flagrant violation of human rights takes place.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, our resolution on the murder of three El Salvador members of the Central American Parliament and their driver near Guatemala City, the capital of Guatemala and seat of the administration of the Central American Parliament, is a protest against banditry affecting innocent people.
Guatemala is a country that became a fully independent state in 1839.
It is inhabited by Indians with links to the Mayan culture, 80% of which are Catholics.
Sadly, the population has not been fortunate in its governments.
Undemocratic governments, military coups, civil war, drugs, corruption, poverty, have all created favourable conditions for those who spread the culture of violence and ride roughshod over human rights.
Guatemala is a presidential republic, in which legislative power is vested in the Congress.
The institutions of centralised power should make a determined effort to wipe out inappropriate behaviour that destroys democracy and violates human rights.
I believe this resolution will contribute to speeding up action in support of values that are fundamental to all of us.
Member of the Commission. Sadly, Mr President, Guatemala is once again on our agenda following the horrendous murder of three El Salvador members of the Central American Parliament and their driver.
The assassination in prison of the four police officers suspected of the crime provided an extraordinary example of the country's institutional weakness.
Despite genuine efforts in the last three years to reinforce the rule of law, the Government has had to recognise that insecurity and impunity were deeply rooted in Guatemala.
The Commission, together with the Member States, has called for a rapid and independent investigation into this very serious affair.
We have pressed for decisive action to strengthen the judiciary and security-related institutions.
Furthermore, the Commission has reiterated the importance of establishing an International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala.
This project has been in discussion for too many years.
The Government's efforts in this respect are to be commended.
However, the project is still to be validated by the Constitutional Court before it can be endorsed by Congress.
The Commission therefore welcomes the fact that this debate is on the agenda today.
The European Parliament is very well placed to press its peers in Guatemala to support the much needed reforms.
The visit by my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner to Guatemala in April will be an additional opportunity for such messages to be shared with the Government.
The European Commission will continue to stand by the people of Guatemala as it has done since the signing of a Peace Accord 10 years ago.
However, for our partnership to be fully effective, the country must take decisive steps for an all-inclusive long-term security policy, addressing all the aspects involved.
It should be supported by adequate national resources for the funding of the government institutions and programmes.
It is now more important than ever that a consensual political commitment is made to a courageous fiscal pact, including tax increases.
It is hoped that the recent events will mark a turning point in the security debate in Guatemala.
As part of its new strategic framework for 2007-2013, the Commission will be ready to offer support for security-related issues as part of a 'social cohesion and human security' focal sector.
Finally, the Commission will continue, together with EU Member States, to engage in EU demarches with the local authorities.
The recent ratification by the Guatemala Congress of the 2003 EU-Central America Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, as well as the perspective of an Association Agreement between our two regions, will allow intensified dialogue which will undoubtedly include security-related issues.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
2.
Cambodia
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Cambodia.
author. - (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, I was already speaking about the human rights situation in Cambodia.
Two points in this joint resolution of six parliamentary groups particularly hold my attention.
The first, on which I intend to focus today, is the assassination, on 24 February last, of Hy Vuthy, President of the Free Trade Union of Workers in Cambodia.
This assassination is in addition to the murders, in 2004, of Chea Vichea and of Ros Sovannareth, who had been Presidents of the same Union, and in addition to the acts of intimidation and physical attacks of which other trade unionists have been victims in recent years.
The right to form a trade union is recognised in Cambodia, but incidents that have taken place recently lead one to think that this right is being flouted.
It is, of course, inconceivable that people should not be able to belong freely to a trade union without having to suffer the consequences.
The murder of Chea Vichea remains unexplained to this day.
Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun have been arrested, found guilty of the murder of the trade unionist and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment without any proof of their guilt having been produced.
Our wish is for the real perpetrators of these murders to be found and brought to justice and for Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun to be given a fair trial.
The second point on which I wanted to focus today is the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
During the mission that I conducted in Cambodia in April 2006, I came to realise the Cambodian citizens' expectations in relation to this Tribunal.
Now, a year after our visit, the Tribunal has still not been set up.
It is vital for it to be set up without delay so that all the unpunished crimes of the Khmer Rouge are at last brought to justice.
Finally, we welcome the efforts towards stabilisation and the smooth running of the electoral process.
It would seem vital for the Kingdom of Cambodia to continue its efforts and place particular emphasis on the proper functioning of the courts which, at the end of our mission last year, we deemed to be the weak link in the system.
author. - (DE) Mr President, we have been considering the situation in Cambodia regularly for years and repeatedly find severe setbacks followed by small signs of progress.
At best, everything has been moving forwards with the speed and method of the Echternach dancing procession.
We currently have the major problem that there are two opposite trends.
On the one hand, we are grateful to find that ASEAN has at last begun to put human rights questions at least tentatively on the agenda.
