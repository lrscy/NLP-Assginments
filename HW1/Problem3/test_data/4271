We were in fact the only people arguing for dollarisation of the budget.
We have settled reasonably happily for other arrangements, in close consultation with the International Monetary Fund.
I do get fed up with the suggestion again and again that we are more lax in the way we support other countries and other governments in crisis than anybody else.
On the whole, what we are now managing to do is to provide assistance more rapidly and in ways which will actually stand up to the closest scrutiny by this Parliament and by the Court of Auditors.
Sometimes we should actually recognise what we are achieving and not just assume that what tabloid newspapers say about us is correct.
Mr President, Mr Van Orden extends his apologies to the Commissioner.
He had to meet a four o'clock deadline, but he will read the Commissioner's reply in the transcripts tomorrow with great interest.
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council and Commission statements - Preparation of fourth Asia-Europe meeting ASEM IV (Copenhagen, 23-24 September 2002);
report A5-0270/2002 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships (COM(2001) 469 - C5-0255/2002 - 2002/2120(COS)).
Mr President, the fourth Asia-Europe summit, or ASEM Meeting, is to be held in less than three weeks' time in Copenhagen on 23 and 24 September, thereby giving ASEM cooperation a prominent place in European policy on Asia.
Since its first summit six years ago, ASEM has been characterised by ever broader and more fruitful cooperation in a range of areas of common interest to Europe and Asia.
More than 40 initiatives have been launched in areas as diverse as money laundering, illegal migration, people smuggling, child welfare, human rights, environmental protection, educational exchanges, lifelong learning and international cooperation.
The number of meetings has also increased.
In between the summits, ASEM's foreign ministers and ministers of finance and economic affairs meet annually, for example, partly for the purpose of improving the summits and making efforts to ensure that the best possible results are achieved through the ASEM process.
There are more than two billion people living in the ASEM countries.
Together, they produce more than half of what is produced throughout the world.
The Asian ASEM countries form the EU's second largest trading partner.
This state of affairs illustrates the considerable significance of ASEM and the importance of the two regions' continuing to cooperate fruitfully and in promising ways.
A successful summit at the end of this month is therefore a high priority for the Danish EU Presidency.
In common with the three previous ASEM summits, ASEM 4 will be divided into three work sessions, one for each of the main areas of cooperation.
These are: 1) political dialogue, 2) economic cooperation and 3) social, cultural and educational issues.
Moreover, the forthcoming summit will include, as an innovation, an informal breakfast debate under the heading, 'Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations'.
The idea is that the political dialogue should be based on the new international situation following 11 September, and it will involve a debate on the new challenges we face in terms of security policy.
That means, for example, organised cross-border crime that affects us all. It is first and foremost a question of how, in the context of ASEM cooperation, we can unite in combating international terrorism, as well as other transnational threats such as the drugs trade, money laundering and illegal migration.
A broad approach is required in this connection, with the emphasis on combating the underlying factors that can form a seedbed for extremism and intolerance.
Among the matters to which we must attach importance are the fight against poverty and better access to education.
With a view to translating words into action, the expectation is that the discussions will result in the adoption of a declaration on cooperation between Europe and Asia on the combating of international terrorism, combined with a cooperation programme based on existing ASEM activities for combating cross-border crime.
The political dialogue traditionally involves an exchange of opinions about development in the two regions.
The subjects will undoubtedly include the most recent developments in the Korean Peninsula, and a declaration concerning the Korean Peninsula is expected to be issued at ASEM 4 with a view to promoting reconciliation and cooperation.
Other subjects might include EU enlargement and the development of cooperation under ASEAN+3.
Discussion of economic matters will concentrate on economic and financial priorities in the light of the global economic recession, the consequences of the recession for the two regions and the opportunities for cooperating with a view to rectifying the situation.
The current efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation may, for example, be continued by working towards the implementation of the objectives formulated in the two ASEM economic action programmes, the Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the Investment Promotion Action Plan (IPAP).
Economic, financial and monetary integration as a growth factor is also expected to be discussed at the summit, as is the WTO Development Round as an essential prerequisite of sustainable economic development.
It will be natural to use the ASEM process to add momentum to the Doha Development Round.
In light of the results achieved in the Doha Round, there will be the possibility of strengthened regional cooperation with a view to achieving further progress in the economic relations between the EU and the Asian ASEM partners.
ASEM's efforts to break down barriers to trade and investment are based on proposals from high-ranking private sector business leaders via the Asia-Europe Business Forum (AEBF) whose tasks include that of helping improve trade relations between Asia and Europe.
This organisation's annual forum will take place - under my own chairmanship, incidentally - directly before the ASEM 4 summit.
In the third main area - that of social, cultural and educational issues - the general theme will be that of measures for combating the unintended consequences of globalisation.
The importance of developing human resources, including educational cooperation and lifelong learning, is expected to be given a central place in this context.
One objective is to ensure that economic growth is reflected in progress in the social sphere that will go on to form the basis for social stability.
A seminar on the subject is intended as the first step on the way.
The discussions during the third work session will also relate to environmental issues and include a discussion of the ASEM partners' opportunities for consolidating and developing cooperation in the environmental sphere, partly in the light of the Johannesburg summit.
ASEM brings together a broad range of different civilisations and cultures across geographical, ethnic, religious and socio-economic boundaries and, in that way, the ASEM process helps create trust between the regions.
By, as it were, building bridges between the European and Asian cultures and civilisations, ASEM is a forum well suited to the dialogue that is necessary in the fight against international terrorism's attempts to split the international community.
That is the background to the fact that the informal breakfast discussion I mentioned, under the heading 'Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations', is to be arranged at ASEM 4 with the purpose of promoting mutual understanding between Europe and Asia.
The subjects might well be the significance of education in the efforts to promote understanding of other cultures and civilisations, the importance of equal access to information and significance of closer contacts between the nations of Europe and Asia.
The expectation is that this special discussion will form the basis for an ongoing dialogue within ASEM concerning cultures and civilisations.
I have noted with great interest the observations and recommendations by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, contained in the European Parliament's report of 16 July 2002 on the Commission Communication on a Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships between Europe and Asia.
I would point out in this connection that, with the forthcoming summit, we in the Council view ASEM-based cooperation between Europe and Asia as having advanced a stage further so that it now forms a better basis for meeting the common challenges we face.
I hope we can achieve the objectives, with which I am in agreement and which are to be found in Parliament's report.
As someone who was present here in Parliament at the start of European cooperation - I was chairman of the Japan delegation - I am impressed by what it has grown into.
I should like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown and also draw attention to the personal contacts that exist between members of the European Parliament and the Asian parliaments.
The importance of these cannot be overestimated, and the Presidency therefore attaches importance to Parliament's report on ASEM cooperation.
Mr President, today's debate is extremely timely.
The report is excellent.
I know that honourable Members will understand when I say that this subject is one of particular interest to me.
The debate takes place one year after the Commission's 'Asia Strategy' was published in 2001 and one week from the first anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington.
And finally, as has been said, it takes place not long before the fourth ASEM Summit brings together 26 European and Asian leaders in Copenhagen.
These points will be the main focus of my short presentation today, so let me deal with them in the same order.
Firstly, the 'Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships' of 4 September 2001 followed our first substantial paper of 1994, called a 'New Asia Strategy', acknowledging that the new relationship between Asia and Europe had evolved beyond 'Aid and Trade'.
The strategy paper of 2001 therefore reflects the importance that European Union-Asia political dialogue has gained.
The unprecedented speed of globalisation has also affected developments in both regions.
We suggest moving towards an equal partnership with Asia, based on four key points.
Firstly, recognition of the great cultural, political and geographical diversity within Asia.
Secondly, strengthening the European Union's political and economic presence across the region.
Thirdly, achieving better balance between the economic, political, social and cultural elements in our strategy.
Fourthly, recognising that Asian countries are crucial political partners for the European Union - a point which we are discovering in the present talks on international trade.
We are fully aware of Parliament's concerns for the protection of human rights and the spreading of democracy, good governance and the rule of law in Asia and elsewhere.
That is why constructive engagement, such as our human rights dialogue with China, is so important to the Commission.
We also share Parliament's concerns about continuing tensions across the Taiwan Strait and take full note of Parliament's views on our relationship with Taiwan.
While the European Union's 'One China' policy precludes formal relations with Taiwan, we have to recognise that Taiwan is an important economic partner for the European Union - it is our third largest partner in the Asia/Pacific region.
We will therefore maintain and where necessary intensify our dialogue with the Taiwanese administration in the economic and other fields.
The Commission, as Parliament will know, also intends to open an office in Taipei very soon, probably around the end of the year.
Moreover, we support Taiwanese participation in international organisations and processes, insofar as this is compatible with Taiwan's status.
Naturally, both Council and Parliament have discussed and commented on the strategy after the appalling events of 11 September, which have since had a significant impact on policies and actions.
The most obvious influence is in our policy towards Afghanistan, which we have just been able to debate at some length in this House.
We are now only a few days away from ASEM 4 in Copenhagen.
Apart from the regular ASEM meetings of foreign and finance ministers, which will be complemented soon by an economic ministers' meeting in Denmark, we have had different ministerial meetings on the environment and on managing migration.
These meetings resulted in various concrete initiatives which will be endorsed by leaders at the Summit itself.
The minister referred to the main topics which will be discussed at the Summit.
I hope it follows the lead given by foreign ministers, which makes the discussion on these occasions rather less formal and hidebound.
One of the major advantages of ASEM is that it provides an opportunity to engage leaders from various cultures and civilisations as well as from countries at different stages of development, in order to draw strength from unity in diversity.
And, as has been said, the leaders will for the first time be discussing the dialogue among cultures and civilisations in a retreat session.
Asia - this is my greatest recent understatement - is an extremely large region and therefore we are not advocating a 'one-size-fits-all policy'.
In our latest policy paper, we have divided Asia into four sub-regions - the South, the South-East, North-East Asia and Australia/Oceania.
Specific policy actions will be taken in the common framework.
So Asia is an extremely important topic for the Commission.
There are three basic components to our approach.
One of them concerns the definition of Asia as such, since geographic, cultural, political and other concepts are differently defined.
Then there is the issue of coverage by our 'Asia Strategy', which has been the subject of some debate since its publication last year.
Finally, there is the evolving discussion about the enlargement of the ASEM partnership.
On this last point, Members may recall that the Asia-Europe Co-operation Framework 2000 introduced the two-key consensus principle.
It means that a decision on new participants will be made by a consensus of all partners, only after a candidate has got the support of its own region.
We are fully aware that many Members have expressed a desire to enlarge ASEM to other partners in Asia.
We have already agreed at the level of ASEM foreign ministers that the consolidation of ASEM and the question of enlargement will come up at the next Summit to be held in Hanoi in 2004.
This was a wise decision: we will have to use the time until the next Summit not only to prepare ASEM for more participants, but also to prepare the agenda of that meeting very carefully.
Selecting issues where there is an 'ASEM added value' is vital in order to avoid overlapping agendas.
So it is important to define what should be dealt with bilaterally, regionally or multilaterally.
In the regional context, we will have to ensure that ASEAN, ARF and ASEM deal with those issues which each forum is best placed to tackle.
We will take full account of Parliament's suggestions during the preparations for the Hanoi Summit to which I have referred, and, I can assure the honourable Member that we will continue to pay the closest attention to this comprehensive report.
I should like to conclude by mentioning three points.
We have demonstrated our growing concern about Asia by the changes we have made to our external services over the last year or so.
Parliament will know that we can only open new delegations if we close or run down existing ones.
Parliament is understandably very firm on the ceiling that we have for the number of delegations around the world.
Parliament will also know that, on the whole, you receive more flack for closing or running down an office than praise for establishing one.
Despite the political problems that we face, we will over the next few months be able to point to the opening of new delegations in Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal and to the opening of an office in Taiwan.
Parliament will know that in an environment where these things cannot be achieved at lightening pace that is a pretty good achievement and an indication of the priority that we are giving Asia.
Secondly, I remain absolutely convinced that a region to which we have not given sufficient attention and where we have not made our policies sufficiently coherent is South-East Asia.
Before 1997 European businesses, banks and other interests, often perhaps overwhelmed by stories of Asian economic miracles, piled into South-East Asia with exaggerated optimism.
The problem since 1997 is that all too many of them have exited from South-East Asia and have not been realistic about what is still being, and can be, achieved there.
I am very keen that we should develop a more coherent European policy on South-East Asia and give it higher priority.
Next year the Commission will be coming forward with a communication which will seek to put our trade, commercial, environmental, economic and political relationships with South-East Asia in a sensible context.
For example the importance of Indonesia in our political and economic lives has to be underlined in the establishment of a clearer and more coherent policy.
My last point is that an area where we have manifested an ability to be a supportive but not an insignificant player is the Korean Peninsula.
I believe very strongly that the policy being pursued by President Kim Dae-Jung is entirely right.
It is very important for us to play a supportive role - perhaps not as important as the role others such as the United States, China and Japan are playing - but nevertheless an important role in reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula and in encouraging North Korea to join the rest of the human race.
We should continue to build on the foundations which have been laid in that area.
It is just an indication of how, without any amour propre and without exaggerating what we can achieve, if we just focus on some of the areas where we have real strengths to bring to bear, we can actually make much more of a reality of our Asia policy, and that we intend to do.
Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the Commission.
The Commission's document, its view of EU-Asia relations, which is the topic of my report, is clear, coherent and shows understanding for the situation Asia is facing, and there is a desperate need for this.
One of the flaws in the Europe-Asia relations is, in my view, the Council's minimalist approach to date, particularly by Foreign Affairs Ministers.
An all-time low was, to my mind, our Ministers' paper-thin contribution to ASEM III in Seoul, which was in sharp contrast to the Commission's contribution over there.
This is no longer acceptable.
Anyone who has worked on this over the past year knows that firm and concrete steps need to be taken, for this is what Asia and Europe's challenges require.
Steps that go beyond strong, economic cooperation - of which, I, incidentally, am greatly in favour - and that go beyond window dressing and the endless symbolism that is meant to be taken as policy.
I am therefore pleased with the Commissioner's announcement that a South?East Asia strategy will be adopted soon, for that is indeed the missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle.
I can easily illustrate the challenge we are facing in the area of human rights by quoting an example from everyday life.
In October last year, I reported in this Parliament on the case of Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam.
Following a lengthy stay abroad, Mr Trinh had made investments in his own country. He was subsequently detained under false pretences and his possessions were seized.
This was a tragic event for him and his family, but, above all, sent a very negative signal to possible investors in Vietnam.
We are now a year on.
Some progress has been made, but not anything like enough.
Mr Trinh's possessions have still not been returned to him and those who falsely accused him have still not been brought to justice.
The European Union is currently Vietnam's key donor, but a parallel focus on respecting human rights is lacking.
This makes the policy incoherent and certainly lacking in one of the areas in which Europe always prides itself.
Not without reason did the UN human rights committee recently report on a large number of human rights abuses in Vietnam.
Other Asian countries, including Cambodia or North Korea, did not escape the UN committee's condemnation either.
It would be impossible to list them all one by one, but I hope that the message is clear.
The observation of human rights, including, for example, the protection of investors, cannot be seen in isolation from economic cooperation.
They are both interdependent.
Not only does the European Union consider itself to be the guardian of human rights, but also the supporter of democratisation processes and young democracies across the world.
Across the world?
Not quite, for surprisingly, there is a young democracy in Asia which should not count on any support, namely Taiwan.
The way in which Europe and our Council treat this country is hypocritical.
This is the only way I can describe it.
Taiwan is a budding democracy with which we maintain sound economic ties.
To give you an example: last year, President Chen Shui-bian was unable to receive his Liberal International Prize for Freedom, because he was refused a visa, whilst representatives of the People's Republic of China had a great time travelling across the entire Continent.
We are all acquainted with the democratic content of the regime in Beijing.
I can totally understand that Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe are refused visas, but surely it is very bizarre to bar an elected leader from a democratic country, who is on a private visit.
Not one Member State wanted to grant the liberal-democratic guest a visa, and the Council showed its weakest side by not lifting a finger.
I therefore warmly welcome the Commission's plans to open an office in Taipei.
In fact, I do this for other Asian countries too.
Commissioner, you asked for credit, well, here it is.
Following the harsh words I have spoken about the Council, I should like to say to my good friend, Mr Haarder, that I was pleased with his comments about the preparations of ASEM IV.
His words inspire confidence.
A comprehensive and serious approach to ASEM IV was needed, and I hope that he will receive actual support within the Council for this.
Economic cooperation - investments by SMEs spring to mind, but also political dialogue and exchanges - the Minister has quoted the entire list - are of major importance.
By way of conclusion, it is not as if we were still living in the Rudyard Kipling's era, who observed: east is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet.
Democratic rule of law is central in Asia too. There is no Asian model, or, in fact, a European model.
This is why I should like to finish off by reminding you of the words of a famous Asia expert, which he wrote some four years ago in his book on China and Hong Kong. He said 'it is absurd to argue for the existence of any fundamental difference between the personal standards and moral principles of Asians on the one hand and Europeans and Americans on the other, for decency is decency, East and West?.
These are wise words, Commissioner Patten, that have not lost any of their truth.
Thank you very much, Mr Maaten.
I would like to recommend that Parliament take into account the fact that we are a little short of time and, for the consistency of the debate, it would be good not to have to divide it between now and the evening sitting.
I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to be sparing with your words and that we all try to save time, so that we can make this debate consistent and finish it before half past five.
Mr President, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my dear Bertel, Commissioner, I will start by saying how glad I am that, as well as people watching the debate, there are in the galleries diplomats from the People's Republic of China and also representatives of the freely-elected parliament of Taiwan.
I think it is a great thing that both sides of the straits are following our debate today.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I speak on behalf of the PPE Group when I make the observation that we very much welcome your statements on the preparations for the fourth ASEM process.
I believe that your statements constitute impressive evidence of the careful and committed way in which both the Council and the Commission have prepared for the ASEM IV meeting.
My group, however, calls for something about which I would ask you to say something in greater detail, namely, in view of the plethora of issues to be discussed, which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, for there to be definite action by the Heads of State and of Government, with firm timetables and defined objectives.
It is not enough to do as we did at ASEM III and discuss all the problems we have in the world, taking in the economy, culture, politics and education, leaving the public to wonder after the event what actually came out of it all.
Hence our preference, and our demand, for fewer but definite plans for closer cooperation between Asia and Europe.
Please allow me to pick out from the abundance of issues that have been mentioned, just three on which I believe it important to us in Parliament that the Heads of State and of Government in Europe and Asia should bring forth definite results.
The first is that a start be made on a special process of bringing the two cultural horizons together.
It is precisely in view of the anniversary of the terrible events of 11 September that Europe and Asia, whatever their many historic, cultural and religious differences, must define, for the sake of our co-existence and peace in the world, what they have in common, what binds them together and draw conclusions from this.
We expect this political and cultural dialogue to have a definite starting point.
The second issue is one that Bertel Haarder, being a Dane, will well understand. As regards terrorism, there is one point on which we want something definite, namely the combating of terrorism at sea.
Over and over again, our ships, when sailing between Asia und Europe, fall prey to pirates in certain narrow stretches of sea.
We cannot explain to the public how it is that we are in a position to combat terrorism throughout the world, but apparently incapable of facing up to terrorists in narrow stretches of sea, terrorists who endanger our ships' crews and kill them!
The third is the problem of migration.
In the President-in-Office of the Council, whose remit not only includes European policy but also immigration, we have a good partner, one who will see to it that definite decisions will actually be taken in the course of ASEM IV on how we can cooperate better in combating the illegal movement of people between Asia and Europe.
I will now turn briefly to Mr Maaten's report, which is of course an excellent one.
Time compels me to highlight only five aspects of it, so please forgive me for that.
Commissioner Patten, you pointed out that the issue of enlarging ASEM's membership calls for a consensual approach, but you quite rightly understood that we in Parliament want to encourage you to talk with our Asian partners in ASEM IV in preparation for the Hanoi conference.
What is at issue is the assertion that 'we will enlarge from 15 states to 20'.
As Europeans, we consider it important that Asia should concentrate particularly on including such countries as India and Taiwan in the Asia process.
You yourself pointed out the special role that India and Taiwan play.
I believe that we should, so to speak, 'push' these countries in order to get them accepted.
You have already demonstrated political commitment to a dialogue on human rights, and on that you have our full support.
I believe that the human rights dialogue with the People's Republic of China, which has just begun, has demonstrated that both sides will from now on be working on the basis of human rights being universal in character.
Let there be an end to the appalling argument about whether there are Asian or European human rights - on the contrary, human rights are universal, and it is on that basis that the dialogue should be proceeded with.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe should also perhaps play more of a part in the prevention and resolution of conflict in Asia.
The security of the region is of crucial importance for the world as a whole.
That is why we should also give constructive support to the political dialogue between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on the basis of democracy, peoples' right to self-determination, respect for human rights and for the rule of law.
We should also be endeavouring to play some sort of role in reducing the tensions between India and Pakistan.
This has to do not only with the protection of cultural minorities, but also with the protection of Christian minorities in the region.
We are very grateful to you, Commissioner Patten, for referring, in your capacity as the Commission's spokesman, to the prompt inauguration of the delegation to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal.
That is something that Parliament has long desired.
We need to have higher-profile representation in a continent comprising half of the world's population.
On that you have our support.
Please permit me to conclude on a note of mild criticism. Today finds us discussing the great importance of Asia and Europe, and the two continents' relationship with one another.
I hope I am not off beam in saying that there will soon be, and also in September, a meeting, a summit between the European Union and China, which is scheduled to take one day.
I wonder whether the Heads of State and of Government should not perhaps take longer than just one day to embark on a truly in-depth dialogue with the People's Republic of China.
I think that would be appropriate in view of that country's significance and that of the continent.
Madam President, I welcome the Commission's communication, 'Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships', and Mr Maaten's report, for which we congratulate him.
We have in the past too often neglected Asia and focused more on other regions of the world, but in fact it contains a majority of the world's population.
We welcome the recognition, both in the report and the Commission statement, that we must engage with Asia, not only in trade and economics, but in other areas as well: cultural exchanges, for example, particularly between Europe and Asia's moderate Islamic states; justice and home affairs, in the war against terrorism, drugs traffic and organised crime, all self-evidently with a global dimension; environmental policy, where Europe and Asia face the same threat from pollution and environmental degradation; security policy, where, in an increasingly globalised world, a crisis on the Korean Peninsula - as Commissioner Patten mentioned - would threaten the peace and stability of the whole world.
That is one reason why the European Union is engaged in the KEDO process.
We therefore welcome the emergence of Asian voices speaking together through ASEAN and other regional fora.
We also welcome and would like to encourage and deepen the widening of the ASEM process and its parallel parliamentary dialogue through ASEP.
I had the opportunity to participate in the first ASEP meeting here in Strasbourg back in 1996 and in last week's second ASEP meeting in Manila, where we achieved a unanimity of views with statements on terrorism, the environment, on human rights for women and children.
Here Members of the European Parliament from Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy joined with colleagues from China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines to agree that Kyoto needs to be ratified; the UN must be the basis of the global war against terrorism; positive action is required to address discrimination against women; we should work with trade unions and other representatives of civil society to combat child labour.
The fundamental problem is poverty, with hundreds of millions of people around the world, particularly in Asia, living on less than one euro a day.
We hope Parliament will agree to the proposal in the amendment that I and other Members of Parliament have tabled to host ASEP III early in 2004.
We can support the broad thrust of Mr Maaten's report.
My only criticism is that an attempt has been made to hijack the report on behalf of the Taiwan lobby.
Of course Members of Parliament have a perfect right to do this, but we should be aware of what we are being asked to approve.
I would remind Members of the provisions of Rule 9(1), Annex I, Article 1 on declarations of interest.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I have tabled amendments to attempt to correct these distortions.
Yes, we must recognise Taiwan as one of the most important trading entities for the EU, but here we are being asked to go further.
If we want to abrogate our support of the one-China policy we followed in the past, we should do so directly, rather than by hiding it within paragraph 35 on the WHO.
Membership of the World Health Organisation is restricted to nation states.
To demand membership of the WHO for Taiwan is to recognise it as a nation state; to grant it an independence that its own government has not even requested.
Equally I am at a loss to see why, if the PPE-DE Group is genuinely interested to allow the fundamental rights of freedom of travel for the President and senior officials of Taiwan's Government, it wants to restrict this to strictly private visits, rather than leave it more open.
Otherwise we can only conclude, if they maintain their position, that this is really a subterfuge for opening up a political process that as yet we have not agreed.
With these reservations, we support the report.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Maaten who has produced a distinguished report on a particularly wide-ranging subject.
Asia is not only huge in terms of area. It also embraces a range of economic, political and religious differences, which mean that it is particularly challenging to deal with the area in a single report.
This has been achieved, however. I shall just highlight a couple of points here.
In anticipation of the forthcoming ASEM summit in Copenhagen, it must be crystal clear that there is full support for maintaining and developing relations between the EU, the ASEM countries and Asia as a whole.
It is first and foremost a question of supporting the struggle to obtain respect for democracy and human rights in Asia.
With regard to the global campaign against terror, it is also important for the EU to forge sound alliances with the Asian countries.
More extensive relations between the EU and Asia must also play their part in supporting the market economy and sustainable development and, in that way, promoting a prosperous Asia.
Simply take a look at recent history and the examples of Japan and Taiwan and it will quickly be very obvious that democracy, the market economy and respect for human rights are the way forward.
I must naturally express my delight at the fact that both China and Taiwan are now members of the World Trade Organisation, or WTO.
It is of course gratifying to hear the Commissioner confirm that the EU is to open an office in Taipei within a year.
Taiwan is the EU's eleventh largest trading partner and is therefore a very important partner of the EU.
Braving possible accusations from Mr Ford, I regret that Taiwan cannot participate in the ASEM Meeting, for example as an observer.
By the same token, I also regret that Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organisation, or WHO, not even as an observer.
In my view, every democracy in the world should have a place in these international institutions.
Madam President, there are large parts of Mr Maaten's report with which I can agree entirely.
There, are, though, a number of problems.
Firstly, any consideration of Europe and Asia has to include Russia as well.
All the issues touch on the interests of Russia as a great Eurasian power, as became clear only recently in the Korea issue.
Both the North Korean president's journey to Siberia and the plans to build a rail link crossing North and South Korea are worthy of a great deal of attention.
On the other hand, considering the problem more in the unclear light favoured by the USA, and failing to involve Russia and China to the extent they deserve, makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful and fair solution to the problems before us.
Secondly, to have an Asia policy without due consideration of the Shanghai Group and its place in Eurasian political events is to ignore the realities of the situation.
We must now decide on what the place of Central Asia, for example, is to be and what attitude we take towards the USA's Eurasian strategy, which envisages a new geostrategic situation in this area.
The end of the Cold War saw the budding of hope for a peaceful world, and that hope is, unfortunately, waning fast.
Thirdly, the States of the European Union have long disregarded or underestimated developments in Asia and are still persisting in deliberations that are one-sided and sometimes limited.
The Commissioner observed that reality has overtaken the report's reference to India and Taiwan in the same breath.
That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities.
Realpolitik always has something to do with interests, and the EU does well to strike a balance between its own well-understood interests and those of its partners.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, as there is a massive amount of lost ground to make up in relations between the EU and Asia.
We are behaving as if Europe were something other than an appendage to the Eurasian continent, as if it were the centre of the world, and as if Asia were on another continent.
The ASEM is certainly a useful forum on cooperation, but it is that only if all the Asian countries belong to it, with, at the least, prominence given to those that are striving to become democratic.
For example, I see the ASEM as unthinkable without India.
Only with the EU's firm commitment is the creation of democracy in Asia a feasible process, and the democratic countries, of which Taiwan is an example, can and must be planted and nurtured as a leavening influence.
Taiwan can, one might say, become the engine for the continuing process of democratisation that we want to advance in Asia.
Moreover, cooperation agreements between Asian countries and the EU - one thinks of Laos and Vietnam - are meaningless unless they are actually adhered to.
My primary concern now is with the mountain areas, for Asia has the highest mountains in the world, including the Himalayas, the Karakorum, the Hindu Kush, and also the Pamir Mountains, and it is in these mountainous areas, which, when we look at them on the map, are bigger than the whole of the EU, that we find the greatest trouble spots.
Let us consider Tibet.
Tibet has its own history and culture.
Tibet is of about the same size as Europe measured from Gibraltar to the Urals.
Tibet was occupied by China in the 1950s.
The intelligentsia and the leaders of its society were driven out of the country.
His Holiness the Dalai Lama left the country in 1959 and now lives, with his government-in-exile, in exile in India.
The Tibetans were admittedly promised autonomy, which was formally introduced in 1965, but this autonomy is a pure farce.
All things Tibetan were increasingly repressed, and the country is being plundered.
The railway that is now to be built from Golmod to Lhasa, and which, incidentally, runs across zones of permafrost, which makes little sense, does not serve to keep the country supplied, but to keep on exploiting it.
In this hybrid system, part-capitalist, part-communist, China has done everything to marginalise Tibetan culture along with this minority.
All efforts on our part towards human rights have to date been in vain.
This initiation will repress all things Tibetan unless the EU works to counteract it.
Our next stop is Sinkiang, still today belonging to China and with a sparse Muslim population.
It is a vast region in the west of China between the Kuenlun Mountains and the Altai and Pamir ranges.
Here too there is repression, the violation of human rights and, after 11 September 2001, yet more suppression under the pretext of combating terrorism.
No longer is autonomy even mentioned.
I wonder whether we Europeans might offer our experience of regional conflict resolution as aid here.
So we come to Kashmir, Asia's number one trouble spot, a problem dragged out from 1947 onwards, with the divided Kashmir, called Jammu-Kashmir, torn between Pakistan and India.
Following many wars between the two countries, soldiers have been facing each other down, in summer and winter alike, at 6 000 metres above the sea, for 15 years.
Nuclear war has been threatened.
Attempts to resolve the conflict have been unsuccessful.
I am not concerned here with apportioning blame to one side or another, but with finding solutions.
The indigenous people, the Kashmiris, must of course also be asked, and here too, autonomy is a possible solution, perhaps even shared autonomy for this divided country, and we Europeans have a number of models to offer of how to achieve solutions.
As regards autonomy, the same is true of Tibet, of Sinkiang and of various regions in the Caucasus.
Let us move on to Nepal, a small but very densely populated country.
Here there are situations resembling civil war and plunging this country - one of the world's poorest - into virtual self-destruction.
On the one hand there is a corrupt government, and on the other there are rebels describing themselves as Maoists, fighting each other, each under the pretext of supporting the impoverished rural population.
While this is going on, the rural population and tourism, which is this country's sole surviving source of income, get trampled underfoot.
This means that our non-governmental financial aid, which has indeed hitherto alleviated a certain amount of poverty, is no longer possible.
At the moment, I see no chance of giving this little kingdom at the southern foot of the Himalayas some degree of freedom from its self-destructive dilemma.
Nor has peace been brought to the situation in Afghanistan.
The mountainous areas of the Hindu Kush have been laid waste, tourism is impossible there as an economic activity, and the mountainous areas are becoming more and more desolate.
What we Europeans have to bring about is, firstly, respect for all other lifestyles, the protection of minorities, and, of course economic aid, peacekeeping, education, conflict resolution, and, where necessary, intervention.
How, though, are we to play our part in influencing political interaction in the complex entity that is Asia, and how is the EU to play its part in shaping it, if we do not learn to speak with one voice?
For as long as the EU fails to thrash out a common foreign and security policy, much of what we want to implement, and should put great effort into implementing, will unfortunately remain nothing more than wishful thinking.
This last point is unfortunately the most important for us to resolve before we take on our real task in Asia.
Madam President, I can hardly conceive of a region that would be more difficult to draft a policy strategy for than Asia.
It is a powder keg from a security point of view, a baby elephant economically speaking and mainly a source of concern from the point of view of human rights.
What is the European Union to do with this region?
Mr Maaten's report contains many valuable building blocks for a coherent vision.
These are of such high quality that I will support the report, even though I do not see eye to eye with the rapporteur on all scores.
I should like to raise two points.
I will start on a critical note.
The report says a great deal about the role that the European Union should play in all kinds of conflicts in the region, but nothing about the relationship with the United States.
According to Paragraph 14, the European Union is to point out to the East that Europe has a role of its own, independent of that of America.
This is not terribly realistic, for, as is also recognised in Paragraph 14, the EU does not yet have an effective foreign policy and certainly not an effective security policy.
I am therefore noting, without any perverse delight, that if Europe is to play any role whatsoever in conflicts of this kind, the EU will inevitably need to work more closely with the United States.
After all, not only does the US's military presence guarantee stability, it also adds political weight to the region.
The lack of this notion in the report is an oversight, in my view.
Secondly, along with the rapporteur, I should like to underline the importance of the principles of the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Our relations with, for example, China, Indonesia, Burma and Vietnam should be subject to compliance with these fundamental principles.
I completely agree with the rapporteur that the only true basis for economic and social progress in the region is to respect human rights and the rule of law.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council: this is a good report.
However, as he is quite aware, it is very often the case that Parliament produces good resolutions but there is a problem afterwards, and that problem is the Council.
Mr Messner is clearly right: there is an institutional problem, but that is not all, There is the problem of the Commission too.
Mr Belder was right to remind us of the need for the strategy.
I cannot believe that, even today, we are unable to distinguish between democratic Asian countries and non-democratic Asian countries.
We lump them all together with China, with which we have been pursuing a difficult dialogue, not just since yesterday but for a decade now, a difficult dialogue in which we are repeatedly informed by the Chinese leaders that China is a specific case, that there is a specific Asian approach to human rights.
Have you never thought to tell them that Engels, Marx, Stalin and Lenin were not exactly Asian and that they must stop talking such rubbish?
The problem is not economic, President-in-Office, and our Taiwanese friends are the best illustration of this, for, quite apart from any political or institutional relationship with our countries, they have become a country with 20 million inhabitants which is the European Union's third largest trading partner.
The businessmen of Taiwan and the European Union have found their own way.
It is we who have a problem, and the problem is that a number of countries are at war: in Vietnam, there is currently a Vietnam war against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in China against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in Laos against democracy and freedom.
This problem cannot be addressed here.
Mr Ford has condemned the initiatives of Mr Jarzembowski and other Members in support of democracy in Taiwan.
All this seems to me to be completely incredible.
I fail to understand this cooperation policy, Commissioner Patten. I fail to understand why we should continue to give money that we know full well will end up in the wallets of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Laotian leaders and have no impact at all.
Why, Commissioner, do you not do what you are starting to do with other countries?
To do away with all these cooperation projects and give countries EUR 1 million once they have completed this specific democratisation reform.
This would eliminate all the European bureaucracy and, therefore, fraud as well, all the disgraceful wastage of our and taxpayers' money.
I would also like the Council and the Commission to inform us whether there really is no hope of succeeding in obtaining the release of five 'disappeared persons' .
Twenty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Europeans marched down the streets calling for the release of the Chilean disappeared.
We are incapable of saving five missing civilians, five 'disappeared persons', in Laos, a country of 5 million inhabitants of minor geopolitical influence. We are not even capable of obtaining the release of the leaders of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who have been in prison for 20 years now.
I find all this absolutely unacceptable, not to say incomprehensible.
Madam President, Mr Haarder, Commissioner Patten, the report drafted by my colleague, Jules Maaten, on the Commission Communication on relations between the European Union and Asian countries deserves recognition, which is shown by the fact that it was adopted by the Committee by a large majority.
I also wish to thank both the Council and the Commission for the forward-looking manner in which they are handling relations between these two areas of the world.
My colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, laid down our group's major policies in his own distinctive way, one which is both lucid and brilliant, and I will therefore only consider a few details.
I would like to draw attention to particular points that for many of us might seem no more than subtleties, but which are of particular importance with regard to our relations, for example, with the People's Republic of China.
The report raises the issue of the importance that Taiwan holds for us.
It is an important trading partner and a community that has progressed a long way in its democratic development.
We have, however, accepted the concept of one China despite the fact that we are rightfully concerned about Taiwan's position and we oppose certain measures or the threat of them.
For that reason, if we are to be consistent we cannot treat Taiwan as a fully independent state, a position most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese People's Republic is a member of the United Nations, and Taiwan is not.
Neither can Taiwan therefore be a member of the WHO.
Therefore, the form of cooperation that I would also like to see develop must be of another kind.
The WHO is a community of independent states.
Next, this is obviously my personal opinion, but as I have often had the chance to visit mainland China both officially and unofficially since 1985 and have talked with ordinary people and the authorities and followed developments there, I think that human rights there, which really are still nowhere near our idea of what they should be, have also seen some positive developments.
Whilst we insist that China make further and faster progress in this area, we should also acknowledge that this has taken place in a country which is important to us in terms of cooperation.
I am a staunch opponent of the death penalty but logically we should oppose it everywhere.
It is a question of a qualitative, and not a numerical, value.
I would remind everyone that in the last ten years around three hundred death sentences have been carried out in Taiwan, with just under a hundred in Japan.
Approximately one-third of the world's Muslim population lives in Asia, which also has the world's largest Muslim countries in terms of population.
The PPE-DE Group believes it is very important to maintain dialogue with these countries and improve knowledge of each other's cultures, for example, in the form of citizen exchange programmes.
For the time being, the vast majority of Asia's Islamic population accept and comply with their governments' moderate and, to a greater or lesser degree, democratic policies.
The most critical situation is that in Pakistan where democracy has been has been overthrown and terrorist activity continues more or less openly.
If, however, confrontation in the Middle East should escalate - intentionally or otherwise - that must also have an impact on Asian Muslim attitudes and the possible rise in fundamentalism in these countries.
For that reason it is also very important for our relations with Asia to find a solution to the situation in the Middle East - and that includes both the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Iraqi threat - through cooperation across a wide front using the most universally accepted means possible.
I know that, technically, Mongolia counts as a Central Asian country as far as the Commission's - and therefore also our own - work plans are concerned, but in my opinion it should be part of a more eastern Asia, as in fact it is, geographically speaking.
Mongolia, for many reasons, not least because the structures of communism totally vanished there, destroying the industrial structure, but also because of its climatic conditions, has slid into an almost medieval state as far as industry, education and health are concerned.
I think this country deserves and, furthermore, needs the sort of first-rate care and assistance the EU has to offer.
It cannot get up off the ground unaided.
We must not forget this country.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should also like to start by thanking Mr Maaten for an excellent report.
Although not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have followed the matter and read the report, and I found it excellent.
I have a few reservations about some of the details, but on the whole it is an exceptionally good report.
We all, of course, believe it is important for the ASEM meeting in Copenhagen at the end of the month to be a success.
The economic issues, which are extremely important for relations between the EU and the ASEAN countries, will naturally be discussed.
These key issues have been developed further in recent years.
Something we ought to develop further is cooperation in the area of foreign policy, i.e. the EU should join with Asia in adopting a committed role in conflicts around the globe and play a more active part.
I therefore believe it was positive that Sweden addressed the Korean question during the Swedish Presidency, and I hope this cooperation can continue.
I have some experience of environmental issues.
With regard to the global environment, I believe it is very important to cooperate with the Asian countries.
We have a lot in common and we have the same viewpoints.
Since these are global issues, we see that the US is dragging its feet in this area.
We know that we need to get the US on board.
We stand a better chance of succeeding if we can create a coalition with the countries in Asia around these issues.
We must also continue to cooperate on human rights issues, an area in which it has - quite rightly - been said that many of these countries have considerable problems.
I remain, however, convinced that dialogue will improve our chances of moving forward in this area, too.
I should now like to turn to dialogue-related issues.
I am back from the ASEP meeting in Manila, where I was one of the delegates.
Although there were differences between us, I must say that the atmosphere was good.
We managed to agree on a joint communiquÃ©.
At the Manila meeting we tried to focus on three areas: firstly, terrorism; secondly, environmental issues; and thirdly, human rights issues.
We managed to agree on all three.
What I would stress above all with regard to the fight against terrorism is that it must be conducted under the auspices of the UN and within the framework of international law.
It is also important that the UN's various conventions be ratified.
I have already mentioned the environmental aspect, which is a global issue.
Global warming is the most important question.
It is important that we should all ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
Furthermore, we must try to get the US first to sign it, and then ratify it.
We also discussed the need to mobilise civil society in the context of the environment and of human rights.
We are very concerned about the human rights situation, which has been deteriorating in recent years.
More cooperation is needed in this area.
As Mr Ford said, it is important to have continuity in our relations at government level.
At the same time, it is important to have continuity in relations at parliamentary level.
I therefore hope that an ASEP meeting can be organised in connection with the next ASEM meeting in 2004.
Our relations with Asia have greatly improved over the past few years, and this is something to be welcomed, for Asia accounts for 56% of the world population, 26% of the total global BNP and for 25% of world trade.
Despite the crisis in Asia, trade and investment relations have expanded to such an extent that Asia is currently the EU's third largest regional trading partner.
We can even say that we in Europe have contributed to a relatively swift economic recovery in Asia by means of our open markets and investments.
Despite this, a great deal still needs to be done.
Our political ties need to be strengthened and broadened.
We still do give Asia enough consideration as an important partner in multilateral discussions within international forums, such as the World Trade Organisation.
I would, in this connection, refer to China's recent endorsement of the Kyoto Agreement.
This is a positive point.
Asia is indeed gradually realising that it faces the same global challenges as we do: promoting peace, security, minimum social standards, environmental protection and the fight against cross-border crime and trafficking in human beings.
Finally, I know from my own experience that Asians still do not know Europe well enough.
This results, for example, in the EU's trade deficit with Asia which, partly due to the crisis, has increased almost tenfold over the past five years.
We must therefore step up our presence in the region as a matter of urgency, and make the Asians aware of Europe's - and, above all, of the EU's - significance, so that the trade and investment potential of our companies can also be enhanced.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council on the ambitious programme for the Asia Summit in Copenhagen.
It is, in my view, particularly gratifying that there is a specific focus on dialogue on culture and civilisation, for it is particularly in these times that mutual understanding in this area is particularly important.
All too often, there is still great misunderstanding despite the progress made in relations between Europe and Asia, which are distant rather than close, in contrast to relations with the ACP States or Latin America.
We have to come to understand that the Asian states are not merely in economic or trading competition with us, but that they are genuinely important partners.
Both Mr Maaten's report and also the communication from the Commission make it very clear that the strategic framework also has to highlight priority areas for political and strategic cooperation, in which area the strengthening of the United Nations will, on the one hand, certainly be a point of view that will carry weight, as will without any doubt, on the other hand, the bilateral and, as far as possible, joint efforts at tying the USA into a multilateral relationship.
In this time of conflict, when we are faced with problems and challenges, it cannot be too often emphasised that it is most important that Asia and Europe should support a multipolar world.
This is where we, as Europe's Parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ASEP Summits could emphasise this.
I really do consider that important.
I would also like to emphatically underline the role to be played by the principle of detente and change through rapprochement in giving human rights and democracy issues priority.
What have we achieved in Europe by means of this policy?
Why can it not used to give us leverage in Asia?
That we should be cooperating with the Asians in this way in the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in other areas affecting stability, is something I consider right and proper.
I would like to take this opportunity to make another appeal.
Another issue here is certainly cooperation between non-governmental organisations, as is the new relationship on the basis of equal rights, partnership and mutual understanding.
What, though, will we have achieved if this remains confined to the heads of government, to the business world, or even to the parliaments?
We have to include the young people of these continents of ours.
With that in mind, I would like to encourage the Danish Presidency of the Council to do even more for the European-Asian summer schools and even more for mutual understanding between the young people of Asia and Europe.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to express my support and praise for Mr Maaten's report.
It is an excellent document.
I should also like to express my appreciation for the communication by Commissioner Patten.
Over the past ten years, the attention given to Asia by the EU has not always been what it should have been.
Partly thanks to Commissioner Patten, this attention has been rekindled.
This, of course, has something to do with his great knowledge and experience in the area in question.
At parliamentary level too, contacts have improved over the past few years, as witness the recent ASEP meeting in Manila.
It is also vital that talks should not simply be held at ministerial and official level, but also at parliamentary level.
This reinforces the debate on mutual contacts, and the contacts are thus guided and controlled at parliamentary level too.
Reinforcing the democratic substance in Asia is certainly no hollow exercise.
I should like to make a few more additional comments, starting with Indonesia.
I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has spoken so highly about Indonesia.
I should like to say something about Indonesia, because I know the country well and I am also co-Chairman of the newly formed working group 'Friends of Indonesia'.
Indonesia is in the throes of becoming a democratic system.
The authoritarian Suharto regime has fortunately made way for a democracy under the leadership first of President Wahid and now of President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
This process is far from easy, and this is why it is important for that country to receive our support.
After China, Indonesia is the region's largest country.
We should not forget that Indonesia, in terms of inhabitants, is the world's largest Islamic country.
These two elements together mean that Indonesia is of great strategic importance in the region and of great strategic importance in present-day world politics in the light of the events of 11 September last year.
Over the summer, the Indonesian Congress, which is a combination of national and regional parliaments, took important decisions which further reinforce democracy.
In future, the President will be elected directly by the people and the military power will withdraw from the national parliament in which it still had a preferential position.
At the same time, however, we also notice the emergence of an increasing number of fundamentalist Muslim groups which are opposed to freedom of religion in Indonesia.
Christian communities too, are under attack on a regular basis.
The situation in the Moluccas has often been discussed in this House.
Indonesia is vulnerable in this transitional phase to democracy, and this is why the Indonesian government deserves extra support from the European Union.
My question to Commissioner Patten is: how could this support be stepped up?
Secondly, I should like to make an observation about Burma, or Myanmar.
Mr Maaten's report states that that country should also become a member of the ASEM group.
I would strongly question that.
Burma still has a military regime that came to power by deposing a President who had 80% of the votes behind him, by depriving a parliament of its powers, by imprisoning many MPs or having them killed and by adopting a disastrous policy on ethnic minorities, resulting in more than 100 000 refugees in Thailand, among other countries.
I have visited these refugee camps.
Neither should we forget that Burma tolerates slave labour and is Asia's largest drugs exporter.
In this respect, it is in close competition of Bolivia.
In my view, such a country does not belong in ASEAN and in the ASEM group.
We should instead try to ensure that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi is reinstated as President of the country in a democratic system.
I should like to finish off with a remark about Vietnam.
It is interesting to hear that the next Ministerial Conference will be taking place there.
Although I am positive about Vietnam, I hope that attention will also be focused on the high number of political prisoners in that country.
Mr Pannella has tabled an amendment to this effect.
In my experience, it is useful to ask questions about this - and I have done so on numerous occasions - and for the Commissioner to assure that the European ambassador in Vietnam give this matter his urgent attention.
I have letters which show that Vietnamese prisoners have been released following pressure brought to bear by Parliament and the European Union.
It therefore works.
I hope that this aspect will be given due consideration in the debates in Hanoi.
One final word.
The Commission's line on Taiwan receives my unqualified support.
I hope that Taiwan will be accorded a place in the ASEM and I also hope we can appreciate that Taiwan is a more important democracy than the vast country of China, which, it is of course also to be hoped, will yet develop in that direction.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, although, when cooperation between ASEAN and the EU is mentioned, most people take it to refer to the ASEM process, that is to say the meeting of Heads of State and of Government, ASEP, the important meeting of parliamentarians from Europe and Asia, must not be overlooked.
Cooperation in this area is so important that one of our partners must not be forgotten.
We need both of them!
We have, in the course of time, built up very intensive ventures in economic cooperation, and Asia is in any case the European Union's most important trading partner.
We have built up good relations in the cultural sphere, but what we need is to step up political cooperation, quite simply because geopolitical conflicts and problems have an effect on the European Union.
Consider terrorism, consider internationally organised crime, consider migration, consider environmental issues and the many other problems we have.
So I welcome the initiatives taken in this report, as well as the Commission proposals, and congratulate the rapporteur on the very precise proposals he has made.
I would, though, like to add some of my own, which I believe will further improve cooperation. The first is that we should arrange, in future, for an ASEP meeting to be held, if at all possible, prior to every ASEM Summit, in order to draft tangible proposals and, in second place, in order that we should move on, as Mr Jarzembowski has just said, instead of just putting dialogues on the record in broad terms, to coming to definite decisions and setting out in definite terms for these summits resolutions and objectives that can and must be put into operation.
A number of us from this House, led by the distinguished Lord Inglewood, took part in the ASEP meeting from 26 to 28 August, at which we were exemplary in so far as we wrapped up a very solid package in the area of counter-terrorism.
There I had the opportunity to act as coordinator, and I will ask you, as President of the Council, and you, as the Commission's representative, to incorporate these specific points from the terrorism package at the next ASEM Summit.
Let me pick out a number of proposals.
We proposed unanimously that the UN should attempt to come up with a uniform definition of terrorism that would then be binding on all our States.
We decided on the establishment of a network facilitating cooperation in counter-terrorism, the exchange of information, mutual aid - including aid of a technological nature - in dealing with chemical or bacteriological weapons or the training of experts.
At this meeting, we made proposals for security systems in transport by land, sea and air to be improved to defined standards, and we also proposed that, at last, all terrorist acts, including conspiracy, incitement, and membership of terrorist organisations should be classified as serious offences and punished as such in all Asian states.
Finally, we also resolved that protection and help be afforded to the victims of terrorism.
We will be successful in the struggle against terrorism only when Europe itself takes measures that work, when cooperation with the USA is developed and made to work, and if, at the end of the day, we also succeed in developing first-rate cooperative projects with our Asian partners in the fight against terrorism.
I beg you, Commissioner, and you Bertel Haarder, my much-respected former fellow Member of this House, to take account of these proposals from ASEP at the Copenhagen Summit and take them on board.
Madam President, we are in the happy position today of debating this report just three weeks before the Copenhagen summit and this happy position is enhanced by the fact that, if anyone knows the area, it is the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten.
The subject of this debate is the European Union's policy towards Asia.
However, the policy discussed in Copenhagen will, of necessity, focus on the institutionalised dialogue with the members of ASEM which, as you know, are the fifteen Member States of the European Union, ten Asian countries and the European Commission.
In this sense, it is very difficult to deal with all aspects of this area under this one umbrella.
However, it is a step in the right direction and I believe that this modus operandi and our involvement in this process is helpful to the European Union's strategy in political and regional partnerships and the multipolar world.
However, I would point out that, so far, this dialogue has, for the most part, been held solely at the economic level and it needs to move on to political, educational and cultural issues.
It is no accident that China, which recently joined the World Trade Organisation and is staging the 2008 Olympics, is also party to this debate, and clearly the economy and culture also exert a great deal of influence on the development of democratic institutions and human rights.
However, one very important issue which needs to be addressed is the enlargement of ASEM.
The European Union will soon have ten new members, making a total of twenty-five.
All the members of the European Union belong to ASEM.
Obviously, once we enlarge, the other side will ask for other countries in Asia to be allowed to join.
This means that this political factor is urgent in the extreme and enlargement criteria need to be laid down.
I think that the criteria which must, without fail, be adhered to by both sides are the Copenhagen criteria, which improve economic, cultural and, above all, human relations and human rights.
I hope, in fact I am certain that successful developments will result from Copenhagen and I believe that this European Union policy will be more widely accepted in an area wracked by conflict and crisis, by which I mean the whole of Asia.
Mr President, as Mr Pirker pointed out I had the honour to lead the European Parliament's delegation to the ASEP II meeting in the Philippines last week.
This event, which was efficiently and successfully organised under the auspices of the Philippine Senate, concluded, as a number of colleagues have said, by issuing an agreed communiquÃ© and statements which dealt with human rights, with special reference to women and children, terrorism and the environment.
But at least as importantly, it provided some parliamentary input into the ASEM process, which culminates later in the year with the Copenhagen meeting.
In an increasingly interdependent world, where modern economics propelled by science, technology and improved transport systems breaks down the significance of national boundaries and with them the practical relevance of ringfenced national jurisdiction, the democratic political process must not get left behind.
The evolution of governmental, ministerial and Heads of Government meetings that take decisions, which either de facto or de jure legislate or commit their component participants to legislate, should have a proper parliamentary angle and aspect.
In my view this is at least as important as many of the conclusions reached by parliamentarians' meetings such as ASEP II.
They are the first step towards finding collective parliamentary institutions to work with collective governmental and administrative developments such as ASEM.
I very much hope that the decisions reached by ASEP II in Manila, and the decision of this Parliament in voting for the Maaten report, will endorse the call for another meeting of ASEP to be held to complement the proposed 2004 ASEM meeting in Hanoi.
I also hope that this parliamentarians' meeting will be held in Europe, although not necessarily here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the location of the first ASEP meeting in 1996.
Mr President, I should like to thank Members for an interesting debate and for the many kind words and requests received by the Danish Presidency in connection with the preparations for ASEM 4.
I would join in the praise of Mr Maaten's excellent report.
I do not entirely agree with his view that the Council has a minimalist approach towards Asia, for it might just as well be said that relations between the EU and Asia have never been stronger than they are today.
It must be remembered that all this activity was certainly not a foregone conclusion.
It is in itself an achievement that dialogue is taking place, that trade is increasing, that there are more frequent exchanges between us and that human contacts are being further developed at all levels, including the very highest.
That is an achievement in itself.
It is very important, and vital as well to our economic well-being in this part of the world.
I would mention the first six meetings that are to take place under the Danish Presidency: the big ASEM Meeting, the meetings of business leaders and of ministers of economic affairs, as well as the summits with Japan, China, South Korea and India which are all to take place in Copenhagen during the Presidency.
In addition, there is the summit with Japan which has already taken place.
Over and above these, there is a range of contacts at ministerial level and among officials.
Mr Solana undertook a major visit to four Asian countries in July, participating in the annual ministerial meeting on security cooperation in the ASEAN Regional Forum where, as is well known, the EU makes efforts towards intensifying cooperation and presses for the move to be made from mainly confidence-building measures to what we call preventive diplomacy.
Basic conditions such as respect for human rights, the promotion of democracy and the principles of a state based on the rule of law are central themes in the EU's relations with Asian countries, and I can assure Mr Messner and others that we shall raise the Tibet issue at the summit with China.
The EU is also involved in a range of problems of regional significance such as relations between India and Pakistan, the situation in the Korean Peninsula and developments in Burma.
In my view, the activities we have under way are, then, particularly wide-ranging.
Nothing just happens of its own accord and there is nothing that is here and now giving rise to tremendously visible practical progress, but relations are slowly but surely improving, and that is of course how cooperation takes place in terms of the larger frame within which Euro-Asian relations must be conducted.
If it comes to making a list, there have of course been very many examples of practical progress, some of them of benefit to our citizens.
There is a host of tasks waiting to be carried out, however, and both the Commission Communication and Mr Maaten's report are very useful tools in this regard.
I have also heard Mr Patten say that relations with South-East Asia are an area in which we could well do more.
An EU-ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers is planned for January 2003, and this will be a good opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen relations.
The communication on relations with South-East Asia, mooted by Mr Patten, may prove to be a valuable contribution to the debate.
I can give an assurance that the Council shares the desire to strengthen relations between the EU and Asia.
With all the activities mentioned and with everything which has been said here in Parliament and which, I know, is taken note of in the countries we wish to cooperate with, there is a particularly sound basis for the range of activities we are now getting under way under the Danish Presidency.
Finally, I want to say that we shall follow with interest the efforts to arrange another ASEP meeting, or Asia-Europe parliamentary meeting.
I myself took part in the first meeting here in Strasbourg, and I look forward to its being possible to arrange something.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
Question No 1 by Bart Staes (H-0524/02):
Subject: Charter of EU Fundamental Rights and a tightening up of aliens policy in various Member States of the EU
Governments throughout the EU are tightening up their aliens policy and creating more and more obstacles to asylum-seekers, for example: tightening up family reunification provisions, with those concerned being required to deposit large amounts of money as a guarantee, an increase in the minimum age for marriage to 24, expulsion of children born to parents who entered the country illegally, the obligation on immigrants to prove that they have a job to go to, and restrictions on the right of immigrants' parents to come and live with their children.
The measures referred to above constitute a downright violation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Can the Council indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures referred to above and implemented by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit of, inter alia, Articles 7, 9, 15(3), 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 33, 34, 41 and 47 of the said Charter, and it is prepared, where appropriate, to intervene?
Illegal immigration is a considerable problem for the EU's Member States and an issue that occupies their populations a good deal.
The Seville European Council decided to reinforce the EU's efforts in this field.
There was agreement that the measures taken in the short or long term for the joint management of migration flows must strike a fair balance. On the one hand, there should be an integration policy for lawfully resident immigrants and an asylum policy complying with the international conventions, principally the 1951 Geneva Convention.
At the same time, our policy must involve resolute action to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
That is what is stated in paragraph 28 of the conclusions agreed in Seville.
The measures to which the honourable Member refers are legislation adopted by the individual Member States as national measures for combating the problems faced.
It is outside the Council's competence to decide whether the measures taken by the Member States are, or are not, in accordance with the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I should like to refer to Article 51(1) of the Charter, affirming that the Member States are bound by the Charter when they are implementing Union law and only when they are implementing Union law.
There is generally no question of the regulations to which the honourable Member refers being adopted in implementation of Union law, and I do not therefore think that there is any point in asking me to assess whether the measures taken by the Member States are in accordance with the Charter.
The Charter is of a different character.
It is aimed at the implementation of Union law.
Wearing my other hat as Danish Minister for Integration, I should like to say, however, that, when it comes to Danish legislation in this field, it complies fully with all the international standards.
That is something I should like to emphasise.
I should obviously like to thank the Minister and former fellow MEP for his response, but surely we cannot concern ourselves with word games.
I clearly asked whether the Council could indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures enacted by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit, I repeat the spirit, of the Charter.
I am aware of the fact that the Charter is a solemn declaration, Mr Haarder, but it contains very fine passages about respecting privacy, the right to marry and start a family, the right to equal working conditions, the right to asylum, the ban on discrimination, and I could carry on for a few minutes yet.
Surely you have to admit, Mr Haarder, that in your country too, legislation is now being enacted which is at least in breach of the spirit of what is written in the Charter.
I should like to call on the Council, the Ministers of the Fifteen Member States, to respect the spirit of the Charter.
I believe that a better society could be the result.
Mr President, I completely disagree with the questioner and should like to emphasise in no uncertain terms that there is no question of any breach either of the letter or of the spirit of any international agreement whatsoever.
I should also like to add that what the question says is false in certain respects.
It states, for example, that a country has a minimum age for marriage, and that is incorrect.
There are conditions governing the circumstances under which a permanent residence permit can be obtained solely on the grounds of marriage, and that is something quite different.
It is self-evident that no condition of this kind applies, of course, to refugees for, if it did, it would be contrary to the conventions.
I can assure Mr Staes, when he talks about Danish legislation, that we are up to speed on the conventions.
We are well aware of how they are to be interpreted, and I could not contemplate taking responsibility for any breach at all, either of the spirit or of the letter, of any convention whatsoever.
I was myself the European Parliament's human rights spokesman in 1998 and 1999.
The reports are there to be found and read.
I have no intention of infringing either the spirit or the letter of any international convention whatsoever.
Question No 2 by Gerard Collins (H-0526/02):
Subject: Southern Africa and serious food shortages
Last February the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations warned that nearly 4 million people in southern Africa would need emergency food assistance this year.
This is due to reduced 2001 cereal harvests caused by adverse weather and reduced planting.
Christian Aid has just published a position paper warning that over 12 million people in the southern Africa region risk starvation in the coming months after poor harvests, drought, flood and mismanagement.
Will the Council outline its response to this alarming situation and state how it considers the issue of providing adequate food aid can be addressed and how support for civil society organisations can be strengthened?
The food crisis in southern Africa was discussed at the most recent Council meeting on 22 July of this year, that is to say the meeting of foreign ministers.
The Council expressed its concern about the situation in southern Africa where up to 13 million people are feared to have been hit by the crisis.
The Council is disturbed by various political decisions and initiatives that have been taken and that have apparently contributed to exacerbating an already alarming humanitarian situation, involving drought and floods.
The Council is of the view that solving the humanitarian crisis is one of the most important political priorities, and it therefore calls upon the countries in the area to direct their respective policies towards fulfilling that objective.
Regional efforts to solve the crisis should be encouraged in line with principles, such as that of good governance, laid down in the initiative concerning the New Partnership for African Development, NEPAD, in which the states of southern Africa play a crucial role.
The Council calls upon the countries in the region to do their utmost to facilitate the regional and humanitarian operations that are under way, including those designed to provide logistical and administrative support and to secure access to, and the distribution of, emergency aid.
Organisations forming part of civil society ought to play a decisive role in the distribution of food aid so as to prevent such aid being misused for political ends.
The EU has already responded by providing extensive food and humanitarian aid to the area.
There is, however, a need for further efforts.
The EU and its Member States are prepared, in close cooperation with the SADC countries, to continue to contribute to these efforts.
I surely do not need to say anything about Zimbabwe and Mr Mugabe.
It is surely self-evident what the Council thinks about the matter.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the very comprehensive reply which he has given.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is now warning that some 13 million people are threatened with starvation over the next six months as a result of food shortages brought about by adverse weather conditions and flawed government planning.
The UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa is to visit six drought-stricken countries in the region from 6 to 16 September, and I understand that representatives of WHO, the UN Children's Fund and the Food and Agricultural Organisation are expected to join the mission.
What strikes me is that there is no reference to EU participation.
Would the Council take appropriate and urgent action to ensure that the EU is involved in this mission and in the coordination of international food aid with other international organisations?
Finally, I would like to know what the Council's response is to the FAO warning in a report last August that only 24% of the USD 507 million needed to provide food assistance until the next harvest in April 2003 has been pledged and that agricultural inputs are needed to help farmers recover from the crisis.
I fully understand the view put forward here by my good friend and colleague, Mr Collins.
I should like to emphasise that the European Union is involved, but that it is the UN that takes action.
It is therefore the UN that is the contractor and in charge of the work, while the EU to a very large degree supports the work financially and, of course, also diplomatically and politically, if need be.
The EU is involved, then, but it is the UN that is responsible for actually carrying out the work.
Question No 3 by Liam Hyland, which has been taken over by Mr Crowley (H-0527/02):
Subject: Promoting the participation of young people in political and civil life
How does the Council intend to follow up the positive comments of the Education and Youth Affairs Ministers who met on 30 May last and highlighted the need to promote the participation of young people in political and civil life in the Member States and acknowledged that it is necessary to be more receptive to young people and to take their views into account, both formally and substantively, and will the Council outline the areas in which it considers that the views of young people should be taken into account?
The honourable Member is undoubtedly aware that the discussions in the Education and Youth Council on 30 May, discussions concerning the participation of young people, took place in connection with the adoption of a resolution on the framework for European cooperation in the youth field.
In accordance with this resolution, the open coordination method is to be applied in a flexible and appropriate way to certain priority themes in the youth field.
The Commission has drawn up proposals on this in a white paper entitled 'A New Impetus for European Youth'.
It was published in November of last year.
Information and participation are some of the subjects which will be tackled initially.
In consultation with the Member States, the Commission has drawn up a questionnaire on these subjects.
The questionnaire has now been submitted to the Member States, which should answer the questionnaire with due regard for prevailing opinion among young people themselves, youth organisations and other relevant bodies.
The issues concerning young people's voluntary work and greater understanding and knowledge of young people will be tackled at a later date.
I would like to emphasise on the Council's behalf that the new framework for European cooperation in the youth field is still at a preliminary stage.
An evaluation report is to be presented in 2004.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
The reason for Mr Hyland asking this question, and why I am taking it on his behalf, is that over the last few years we have seen more and more young people becoming disconnected from political and civil life.
Indeed those same people who feel no connection with the political movements or the political parties in their own countries are very likely to turn up at demonstrations about anti-globalisation, about reclaiming the streets or eradication of poverty and so on. Surely, through the Council and the good offices of the minister himself, there must be some mechanism whereby that energy and that idealism can be harnessed for the good of all of society and not just for the good of the few.
I am particularly anxious to hear an answer concerning the initiatives they hope to undertake during the Danish presidency.
I am entirely in agreement with the presentation of the problem, as outlined here by my esteemed colleague.
On the one hand, we have a group of young people who are more internationally minded than ever before and who are deeply committed.
We saw this in the summer at the 'Youth 2000' forum, where a thousand young people from throughout Europe met at 13 folk high schools in Denmark, where they each drew up proposals for a constitution for Europe and finally came together and combined them all into a single proposal which they presented to the Convention.
I also want to mention the youth convention as exemplifying these very committed young people.
Next, there is a very large group which is extremely passive.
They are perhaps not opposed to European cooperation, but it does not interest them.
Finally, there is a very small group which demonstrates and throws stones.
As for this small group, I would say that one of the gratifying features of the meeting in Elsinore at the weekend was that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators present.
That is a step forward - let us hope that this will characterise the rest of the presidency and also future presidencies.
I can only declare myself in agreement with the honourable Member.
The Council is very aware of this issue, and I think this has been stated so well that I do not need to repeat it.
As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together: Question No 4 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0528/02):
Subject: Seville European Council agreements
One of the decisions taken at the Seville European Council was that said Council should meet formally four times a year (twice as frequently as is currently the case), without prejudice to other informal meetings, and should draw up three-year strategic programmes starting in December 2003, on the basis of which annual operational programmes would be devised.
Does the Council not think that this would lead to an increase in the influence exerted within the Community by the European Council - the body within which the Member States' highest executive powers of government are concentrated and which controls the EU's legislative by means of its component ministers?
Does the Council not think that this would be to the detriment of the Commission's executive powers whilst at the same time increasing the democratic deficit of a Union which does not practise the proper separation of public powers as prescribed by Montesquieu and as required of a modern democracy?
Question No 5 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0535/02):
Subject: Separation of powers
Should executive and legislative powers be separate?
If not, why not?
The Council considers that the Seville decisions concerning the European Council merely elucidate the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union, in particular Article 4, which states that the European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof.
At a time when the Union's activities are characterised by increasing development and differentiation, and immediately before major enlargement to include a number of new Member States, the European Council has found it necessary to strengthen the Council's powers as a provider of guidelines and impetus.
This is precisely what the role of the European Council is according to the Treaty.
The Council cannot see that these practical guidelines are in any way incompatible with the Commission's executive powers, which cannot in any way be affected by a decision, the sole purpose of which is to enable the European Council to exercise as effectively as possible the responsibility which the European Council has been given.
In this respect, I would point out that the President of the Commission is of course a member of the European Council, and I have not heard any objections to the Council's trying to reform itself.
As regards any possible democratic deficit and the lack of separation of powers within the Union, the Council considers that the current situation, regardless of what one thinks about it, cannot be affected by a reform the sole purpose of which is, as has already been observed, to implement the existing provisions of the Treaty more effectively.
As the question concerning the separation of the executive and legislative powers - whether it is a matter of the principle in general or its application in the Union - has not been discussed as such by the Council, the Council is not in a position to respond to the exact point raised in Question H-O 535.
Of course, the Council is not unaware of this classic problem, which is indirectly taken up in the Laeken declaration, for example, adopted by the European Council in December, and which will, in all probability, also be taken up in the Convention and later at the subsequent intergovernmental conference.
The honourable Member must understand that, beyond purely academic considerations which do not belong here, the Council cannot comment on the possible outcome of a debate which will not be conducted in the Council itself and which, in any case, has not yet taken place.
I hope that, with this explanation, I have made it clear why I cannot go further into the question which has been raised.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many thanks for your response.
I might be asking the impossible, but I would have liked the period for responding to our questions to be shorter, so that the Spanish Presidency could have replied to my question, as it, in its time, was responsible for the Seville European Council.
Having said this, it is undeniable that in Europe, in the European Union, it is the Council that wields the most legislative power and, furthermore, controls executive power through the comitology procedure.
I would like to ask you if you believe that the United States would be the world leader if its legislative power, instead of residing with the House of Representatives and the Senate, resided with a Ministerial Council composed of representatives of the various North American States, from New York State or Washington State to California, Florida or Colorado.
If the American President, Mr Bush, had the level of attributions, competences and powers that our President, Mr Prodi, has, do you think he would have the influence and capacity he has in international relations and at domestic level?
Would he have the same influence and capacity?
I believe we must make Europe a true democracy, with separation of powers, as suggested by other speakers: legislative power should reside with this Parliament, and executive power with the Commission.
I will confine myself to saying that I am as exercised by Montesquieu's theories on the separation of powers as the honourable Member is.
I am, as it happens, a political scientist by training and think that it is absolutely fundamental that we should keep this separation of powers in mind.
I said this as recently as yesterday, when I represented the Presidency in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs here in Parliament.
With the best will in the world, I cannot, however, see the Council's efforts to reform itself as being in conflict with Montesquieu's theories on the separation of powers, and I cannot see that the Council has taken powers or in any way hampered the Commission.
As a matter of form, I would like to report what I said on behalf of the Danish Government in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, that is that the Danish Government is an ardent adherent of the Community method and does not want the Council to take powers from the Commission.
That is what was said - but it was as a Danish Minister that I added this.
The President-in-Office made an extremely interesting remark in passing in the first half of his first answer when he referred to the President of the Commission having been a former Member of the European Council.
So it is in order for people who have been members of other EU institutions to express an opinion in their present position.
The President-in-Office was a very distinguished Member of this Parliament so he is therefore able to express an opinion, by his own words, on the state of the Council now.
Would you agree Mr President-in-Office of the Council, based on your experience in the Parliament, that we do need separation of the powers and will you be urging the Danish presidency to put this forward at the Convention?
This is Question Time and concerns questions to the Council.
The Council does not deal with the Convention, the Danish presidency does not deal with the Convention.
We respect the procedure that has been laid down for the Convention so I have no further comment.
Yet I hope that what I just said indicated that the honourable Member might tend to agree on the need to separate powers in a democracy.
As the author is not present, Question No 6 lapses.
Question No 7 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0536/02):
Subject: Cyprus - expiry of the deadline for a political solution to the problem
In June 2002 the deadline that had been set for a political solution to the Cyprus problem, to be achieved by means of talks between the two Cyprus communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN, expired without producing a result, because of Turkish intransigence.
Could the Council assess any results attained by the talks so far?
Could it outline the next steps leading up to the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, together with the nine other applicant countries?
As the honourable Member no doubt knows, the current direct talks concerning Cyprus are confidential.
The Council is well aware that no breakthrough has yet been made in the talks, and that disappointingly little progress has so far been made, which has also been stated by the UN Security Council according to the report which Mr de Soto, the UN Special Envoy for Cyprus, issued on 9 July.
As the talks are now continuing, the Council expects the parties to increase their efforts with a view to taking advantage of the current unique opportunity and finally make the necessary progress towards a solution - hopefully before the accession negotiations are concluded.
The decisions concerning the accession of the candidate countries must be taken before the end of the year within the normal enlargement procedure on the basis of the Commission's report and the recommendations which the Commission will put forward in its document on the enlargement strategy, which we expect by October.
With regard to the accession of Cyprus, the EU's view, which was put forward once again in Seville, is in line with the Helsinki conclusions, to the effect that a solution of the Cyprus problem will facilitate Cyprus's accession to the EU.
A solution is not, however, a prerequisite for Cyprus's accession.
When it takes its decision, the Council will take into account all the relevant factors.
That is a position which it is wise to adhere to, and so we all hope, and cross our fingers, that advantage will be taken of this 'window of opportunity', this unique opportunity which there will be this autumn to resolve this extremely old and tragic problem on this wonderful island.
I thank the minister and former member of this House.
I have listened very carefully to his views, which are the same views as those expressed by his prime minister, Mr Rasmussen, in a recent interview in the Politiken newspaper.
I should merely like to ask the President-in-Office a straight question: what message is the presidency of the Council of the European Union sending Turkey.
Why, if the talks are not succeeding, must someone be to blame?
There are those who stand to gain if the talks do not succeed.
Is the message which the presidency of the European Union is sending Turkey, yes, we will make every effort to resolve the Cyprus question, but if no political solution can be found, that will not stop the Republic of Cyprus from joining the European Union?
I think that it is important that, in my answer, I should adhere entirely to the well-established and sensible formulation which was adopted in Helsinki and which has been repeated time and again, namely that a solution to the Cyprus problem will facilitate the accession of Cyprus, but that a solution is not a prerequisite for accession.
The Council will take all factors into account when the decision is taken.
That is what can be said, and I think that everyone understands what is meant, and I have nothing to add.
Mr President-in-Office, that we are concerned about the impasse in cross-community talks goes without saying.
You said in your first reply that the interested parties will need to step up their efforts.
However, as everyone knows, the key to resolving the Cyprus problem is to be found in Ankara, not in Cyprus itself.
I should like to ask if the Council intends to put pressure on the Turkish government to take the steps needed in order to help resolve the Cyprus problem.
Otherwise, I fear that, as things stand, we may well end up partitioning the island, with the Turkish side, with Turkey behind it of course, as always, insisting on recognition of the independent sovereignty of the Turkish Cypriots.
I would like to emphasise that the negotiations have certainly not broken down.
There is a continuing dialogue, and there should be a meeting very soon between UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the parties on Cyprus, so there is absolutely no question that anything has broken down.
Nor will I accept the description of Ankara's shadow.
I will not comment on whether there is a shadow, but I can say that this process, which was adopted in Helsinki and has been confirmed, is going ahead.
It will not be affected by any shadow.
Question No 8 by Ioannis Marinos (H-0539/02):
Subject: Discrimination against Greeks in Albania
According to reports in the Greek press, hundreds of Greek residents of the town of Himara, in southern Albania, have protested formally to the Albanian Government concerning the non-restitution of their property in the part of the town located by the sea, which Albania's former communist regime took from them.
The residents of Himara have not yet managed to obtain the title deeds to their property, and much of it has been illegally transferred to Albanians by the authorities, who took advantage of the absence of the owners outside Albania for a period of many years.
There is also a similar problem with the property of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania, whose land was also confiscated by the communist regime and has not since been returned.
Is the Council aware of the problems faced by property-owners in Albania?
What action does it intend to take to ensure that they receive the title deeds to their property as soon as possible?
The Council is aware that the Greek minority in Albania claims property rights in the same way as other citizens.
It has also emerged that the Autocephalous Orthodox Church makes similar claims.
Pursuant to Article 181 of the Albanian constitution, the Albanian Parliament must adopt laws before the end of November with a view to finding a fair solution to questions concerning expropriations and confiscations that took place before the constitution was adopted.
The Albanian Parliament has set up a special committee on the restoration of property.
This committee is now starting to scrutinise the legislation with a view to restoration of, or compensation for, property which was seized under Communist rule.
The committee has not completed its work.
The Council is fully aware that a solution to the property question is also an essential prerequisite for encouraging domestic and foreign investments in Albania, just as it is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture.
The Council was able to subscribe fully to the assessment of the individual countries, given by the Commission in its first annual report on the stabilisation and association process.
On 13 May of this year, the Council approved the recommendations in this report and requested that rapid progress should be made in each of these areas over the next few years.
In one of these recommendations, Albania was specifically called on to adopt new legislation on ownership and restoration of property, to remedy the existing shortcomings in the legislation in this field and to ensure better enforcement of property law in Albania.
Albania is the EU's partner in the stabilisation and association process.
The EU maintains a regular dialogue with Albania, especially in the form of the meetings in the advisory EU-Albania taskforce.
Here, the EU has the opportunity to stress the importance which is attached to solving this issue, now that the country is starting to approach integration into Europe, at the same time as acquiring closer ties with the EU.
It also gives the EU the chance to ensure that Albania continues with the measures which it has promised in this field.
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, from which I understand that the Council really is aware of the problem and is making efforts in the right direction.
However, it is not clear exactly what the Council is calling for or I, at least, fail to understand what he means by 'dealing with the problem'.
I would expect him to decide how the problem should be dealt with.
The State Department wrote to the Albanian government a few days ago, calling quite specifically for Greek schools to be opened at once, for recognition of land ownership by members of the Greek community and for trespassing on Greek property in Himara to stop.
As far as I know, the Greek government has taken similar steps.
I would remind the President-in-Office that Greece sends generous financial aid to Albania and that over 600 000 Albanian immigrants work legally and without obstruction in Greece, earning wages that workers in Albania can only dream of.
Perhaps the European Union which also sends various forms of aid to Albania should take more persuasive measures?
And surely it considers it urgent and imperative, Minister, to put a stop to the plan to move 15 000 settlers from northern Albania and Kosovo to the Himara area, in order to tip the ethnic balance against the Greek minority?
I understand my colleague's concern very well, but I would like to stress that Parliament has taken up the matter, and a special committee has been set up.
The constitution envisages that a solution will be found.
The Council has expressed its opinion, and there is an ongoing dialogue between the EU and Albania, in the context of which I promised here a little while ago that the EU would ensure that Albania pursued the measures promised.
There is therefore no question of either the Greek minority or others being left in the lurch or forgotten.
The situation will be monitored continuously and closely.
Mr President, first a comment on the manner in which the President-in-Office replied.
Perhaps he thinks his questioners are stupid.
But I can assure him that we are not that stupid.
He has no right to say that the matter is not overshadowed by Ankara when both Ecevit and his foreign secretary have stated that they will go ahead and integrate occupied Cyprus into Turkey.
How dare he reply like that.
What does he take us for?
I did not think at all that I had brushed it aside; I think that my last remark was extremely binding.
It was a little shorter than the first one, but no less binding.
Without wishing to correct anyone here, I shall simply remind you all that this is Question Time, which has its own rules, and ask you to adhere to the Rules of Procedure.
Without setting a precedent and taking into consideration that Mr Lage had to leave the room for a few minutes at the time scheduled for his speech, I am going to give the President-in-Office of the Council the opportunity to respond to his question.
I repeat: this must not set a precedent.
If you leave the room, you lose your turn, but Mr Lage had to leave for a moment.
I would also ask him to avoid doing this again.
Question No 6 by Carlos Lage (H-0530/02):
Subject: Free movement of persons in the Schengen zone
On 22 June a group of 500 Portuguese citizens travelling to Spain to take part in an authorised demonstration to be held in Seville during the European Council meeting was prevented - in a violent manner - from entering Spanish territory by members of the Spanish police forces.
Nothing can justify this kind of behaviour and action, totally unacceptable in a Union which considers respect for fundamental freedoms and rights as one of its founding principles.
It seems unlikely that the Portuguese citizens represented a particular danger, or indeed any danger, to the Spanish State.
And, even if they had, the forceful and heavy-handed behaviour which, unfortunately, characterised the reaction of the Spanish police authorities, would have been quite unacceptable.
Can the Council therefore say what measures it will take vis-Ã -vis the Spanish Government to clarify the facts?
Does it not consider that a clear definition and common agreement should be sought concerning the circumstances and conditions which may lead to the suspension of the rules governing Schengen?
I should like to answer Question 6 by Mr Carlos Lage.
As regards the first question, I would like to draw attention to the fact that neither Article 33 of the EU Treaty nor Article 64(1) of the EC Treaty gives the Council the ability to intervene to maintain public order or security in the Member States.
This also applies to public-order measures which the Member States take when meetings of the European Council are held within their territory.
This is therefore something in which the Community cannot interfere.
As regards the second question, I would like to refer to the Executive Committee Decision of 20 December 1995 on the procedure for applying Article 2(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has a long reference number which I do not want to read out.
This Decision draws up detailed rules for when controls can be reintroduced at the internal borders.
It constitutes a part of the so-called Schengen rules, and it is thus binding for all Schengen States.
Incidentally, it is published in OJ L 239 of 22 September 2000, page 133.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the information you have provided.
I must tell you that this episode, linked to the Seville Summit, has caused a small political storm in Portugal and has been used by many opponents of the European Union as an argument against the European Union itself.
Because we live in an area of free movement, the majority of public opinion in Portugal cannot understand how this area of free movement and these citizens' rights could be breached by border controls carried out in a quite oppressive and arbitrary way by the Spanish authorities.
We do not want to make this a Portuguese issue.
We are simply asking the President-in-Office of the Council, when he has the opportunity, to look into the matter in order to establish, not even changes to the law but common and consensual procedures to ensure that such episodes do not reoccur.
As has been shown, it is not a matter for the Council to decide when it is reasonable to make use of the possibility under the Schengen rules for temporarily closing the borders.
I can state that the Danish Presidency reserves the right to make use of this possibility.
We have stated this expressly, but we were pleased that, during the weekend which has just ended, there were so few demonstrators at the summit of Foreign Ministers in Elsinore that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators.
Let us hope that this sets a trend for the future.
This is not the first time this unacceptable practice has been used and the citizens of one Member State have been banned from crossing the border into another Member State and treated badly; generally it is people protesting against the policy of the European Union who are on the receiving end.
It is what happened during the Nice summit, when thousands of Italian protesters found the French borders closed, during the Genoa summit, when hundreds of Greek demonstrators, who were badly mistreated, were prevented from disembarking in Ancona.
It happened to Danish demonstrators, your fellow countrymen, Mr President-in-Office, during the Gothenburg summit, when they tried to cross the border and meet up with people protesting against the policy of the European Union.
It is clear, despite the pronouncements, that Schengen was not introduced to facilitate the free movement of the citizens of the Member States of the European Union within the European Union; it was introduced in order to turn the European Union into a fortress.
It applies when it is in the interests of the ruling circles of the European Union, so that capital can move freely, but it does not apply when it comes to the movement of people protesting against interests of big business and the policy of the European Union.
The Schengen cooperation means that the countries undertake to maintain open borders in respect of each other, except when there are exceptional reasons for temporary closure.
It is not a retrograde step; it is a step forward.
The Council and I regard the possibility of temporary closure as reasonable.
We must bear in mind that it is not only a question of lawful demonstrations, it has been a question of something resembling terrorist activity in connection with these meetings.
We must protect democratic gatherings. That is something we owe to democracy.
Mr Haarder said, amongst other things, that the meeting in Elsinore had been very calm and that none of the expected, or feared, disturbances had arisen.
That is good, of course.
I wonder, however, whether this might possibly also have had something to do with the fact that there were strict border controls, so that any foreign demonstrators who might have wanted to get to Denmark and Elsinore were in fact unable to do so.
It would be helpful if Mr Haarder could deny that this is the case and state clearly that no one has yet been turned away from the Danish border during the Danish presidency.
If I may venture to answer as a Danish minister: I do not think that, in connection with the weekend meeting in Elsinore, we made any use whatsoever of the possibility under the Schengen rules of closing the borders.
Demonstrators were completely free to enter; but fortunately only peaceful demonstrators came, and that is something I think we should be pleased about.
Question No 9 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0540/02):
Subject: Women who work in the fields in accession countries
What measures, benefits and activities connected with the accession process directly affect women who work in the fields in the accession countries?
What measures will the Danish presidency be taking with regard to such women?
Both the Member States and the EU institutions are obliged to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women in all EU policies and programmes, and the European Council has on several occasions set out guidelines for a special strategy in this field.
Furthermore, Regulation No 1250 from 1999 lays down that the Structural Funds shall contribute to removing inequalities between men and women and to promoting equal opportunities in the context of strengthening economic and social cohesion.
That also applies to pre-accession programmes.
In connection with this, the Union has set aside considerable financial aid for measures to develop the rural districts by means of the so-called SAPARD programme.
The Member of the European Parliament may apply directly to the Commission if she wishes to have a fuller overview of the specific programmes.
With particular regard to the pre-accession negotiations concerning the chapter on agriculture, the common position of the Union also contains a comprehensive section on development of the rural districts. It covers the aid which will be given through the EU's various financial instruments.
As the rural districts in the candidate countries require restructuring, modernisation and alternative production and facilities, the EU attaches great importance to the measures for developing the rural districts, which have a direct effect on the conditions under which women in these regions work.
During the negotiations on the chapter on employment and industrial relations policy, the Union has stressed the importance which this section has for the equal treatment of men and women, and it has also been emphasised how necessary it is for the candidate countries to comply with the rules in this field.
I would like to draw attention to Regulation No 1257 from 1999, which groups together all Community actions in favour of development of the rural districts and in which it is expressly stated that measures aimed at removing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities for men and women should be supported.
Recently, the Council concerning agriculture, that is to say the Agricultural Ministers Council, at its meeting on 27 May of this year, adopted specific conclusions on the integration of the equality aspect into the Common Agricultural Policy.
The Council expressly recognised in these conclusions that women play a bigger and bigger role in the rural districts, and it calls on the Commission to use the Structural Funds to continue to promote entrepreneurial spirit, high-quality employment, training and the provision of life-long services for rural women.
Furthermore, the Council urges the Member States to adopt policies which actively strengthen women's economic capacity in the rural districts.
The Council points out that all the candidate countries have now agreed to come into line with existing Community law regarding equality immediately on accession.
The Danish Presidency wants to follow the same line, inter alia in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and the further negotiations on accession.
We want to make use of every opportunity to draw attention to the general fundamental principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and in this respect to promote equality between men and women, as referred to in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of the Treaty.
Finally, I should point out that the current Chairman of this Agricultural Ministers Council is herself from a farming background.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how many of these female agricultural workers will become part of the European Union at the next enlargement?
What number were you working with in your forecasts?
I would also like to ask you if, during the Danish Presidency, any actions or campaigns will be implemented to correct the current salary discrimination.
I am not in a position to answer the question that has been asked, and I am not even sure that studies will make it possible to answer it.
I shall gladly try, but I cannot answer the question here orally.
I cannot.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo asked two questions, did she not?
I believe the second question was this, but perhaps you would care to comment, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo.
Mr President, I would like to tell you that I would be interested to know the figure whenever the President-in-Office of the Council can provide it, in other words, how many female agricultural workers are expected on the first wave of accession.
Otherwise, we cannot carry out any advance planning.
For any action to take place, if we are to gear it towards female agricultural workers, we have to know how many there will be.
At the moment this is not possible, but I would be grateful if you could send me the figure.
With regard to the second question, I would also appreciate a response on whether or not a campaign will be carried out.
I do not think that we in Denmark have any information as to how many there are in Denmark. Nor do I think that people in other countries have any.
It may be regrettable; but I do not think the information exists.
However, I shall willingly try to find the information, if it is wanted.
Yes, we have taken note, but, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, Mr Haarder answers what he sees fit to answer.
We are not going to start a debate now.
Mr President, the Council must know how many female agricultural workers are going to join the Union.
Well, if and when the Council does know, it will answer you, but now you have asked your question twice.
If the President-in-Office of the Council wants to tell you anything else, however, I am not going to stop him.
Yes, of course we know how many farms are entering.
We know quite precisely, both in Poland and the other countries.
However, we do not know how many rural women are coming in.
We do not have the classification by gender.
I very much regret that.
Question No 10 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt, which has been taken over by Herman Schmid. Question No 10 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0542/02):
Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States
It is possible that the Irish electorate will vote against the Treaty of Nice for a second time, which would also render the new breakdown of votes on the Council and seats in Parliament under that Treaty null and void.
Would it not then be possible for the Union to act as it did at the time of the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, i.e. negotiate and reach agreement with each of the applicant countries separately on seats in Parliament and votes in the Council in the treaty of accession?
The Treaty of Nice would not then be needed as a basis for the accession of new Member States.
Is this not an appropriate procedure to use for the enlargement of the Union should the Irish people vote against the Treaty of Nice once again?
I would like to remind the honourable Member that the European Council in Seville expressed satisfaction that the Irish Government had firmly decided to get the Treaty of Nice approved, something which - as is well known - is a prerequisite for enlargement to take place within the time limits laid down.
On behalf of the Council, I would like to recall that, at the meeting in Seville, Ireland's Prime Minister stated that his government intended holding a referendum this autumn, so that Ireland can ratify the Treaty of Nice.
The Prime Minister presented a national declaration from Ireland, confirming that the provisions of the EU Treaty relating to foreign and security policy do not affect the country's traditional policy regarding military neutrality, and will not do so after ratification of the Treaty of Nice, as can be seen from Annex 3 to the Presidency's conclusions.
The European Council adopted a declaration, in which note was taken of the national declaration by Ireland.
This declaration can be found in Annex 4 to the same conclusions.
The European Council expressed satisfaction that the Irish Government had firmly decided to get the Treaty of Nice approved, something which - as is well known - is a prerequisite for enlargement to be implemented within the time limits laid down.
I fully appreciate that the Irish Government and the Irish Prime Minister would like this to happen, but the Irish Government cannot decide how the Irish people will vote.
The issue must therefore be regarded as remaining open until the referendum has been held.
Consequently, another 'No' vote from the Irish people cannot be ruled out.
My question relates to a situation that is wholly feasible and quite practical.
This is not an abstract question, but a practical, political one.
Given such a situation, could we not solve the problems in a very simple, practical way, by allowing Ireland to join the institutions in the same way as Finland, Sweden and Austria did, i.e. by negotiation?
That way, there would be no problem with the Treaty of Nice.
Would not that be a practical, pragmatic solution that might also appeal to Mr Haarder?
I cannot say any more than I have already said, because this is the way things stand.
Of course it might turn out to be a 'no' - we all know that - but in that case we would have a totally new and unpredictable situation of which it would be impossible to predict the conclusion.
It is a very uncertain situation, and one which puts enlargement at risk in any case.
I would not wish there to be any controversy over the matter, however; I only wanted to state the facts concerning the Council and the Irish vote.
Yes, as I have said twice before, this is a precondition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale.
This is what it says in the Seville conclusions, and I take my stand on these.
My question follows that one.
You say it is a precondition within the time set.
Is that the 2004 time-limit, meaning that it will still be possible to have enlargement beyond 2004 without the Nice Treaty, perhaps under the system suggested by Mr SjÃ¶stedt in this question?
I have said what was agreed in Seville, and I take my stand on that.
I have nothing to add: everyone is aware that deadlines were set in Helsinki and that these have been affirmed time after time.
What was said in Seville was that the Treaty of Nice is a precondition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale.
Non-ratification of the Treaty of Nice would present us with an extremely uncertain and unpredictable situation.
Question No 11 by Gary Titley (H-0544/02):
Subject: Better regulation
This month, the Commission delivered its communication on better regulation. A central aim of this communication is to ensure that an impact assessment of all Commission proposals is carried out.
What practical measures are being taken by the Council to ensure that they carry out impact assessments on Council amendments to Commission proposals?
The European Council in Seville welcomed a number of communications from the Commission on how lawmaking might be improved.
I am thinking in particular of the action plan for finding ways of simplifying and improving the quality of the regulatory environment.
It invited the three institutions concerned, that is, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to arrange for this to happen on the basis of the work of the High Level Technical Group and to adopt an interinstitutional agreement before the end of 2002 in order to improve the quality of Community legislation and the conditions, including time frames, for its transposition into national law.
The High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation met on 15 July 2002.
In anticipation of this meeting, the Presidency had put forward a proposed timetable for drawing up and adopting the commercial interinstitutional agreement, starting with the specific actions relating to the three institutions as proposed in the Commission's action plan.
At the meeting on 15 July 2002, it was decided firstly to reach common agreement on the chief elements of a future interinstitutional agreement.
The institutions would then, on the basis of this, discuss the practical content of the specific actions of the agreement.
At the same time, it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention.
Practical measures with a view to an impact assessment of amendments to the Commission's proposal can be expected to be an element for inclusion in further discussions on an interinstitutional agreement.
In this context, I can tell you that the next meeting of the High Level Technical Group is expected to take place next week, on 10 September.
It is a delight to have Mr Haarder with us again, in a different role.
But may I say with respect that now that he has become part of the government he acquired the government's habit of not answering the question.
How exactly is the Council going to approach the issue of impact assessments?
If the Commission carries out an impact assessment as part of its better regulation proposals, will the Council, when it amends the Commission's proposals, carry out a further impact assessment of its own amendments?
How will it do that and who will it get to do it?
It is very important in terms of the interinstitutional agreement with Parliament to know exactly what the Council's approach is to impact assessments.
I should like to have given a clear answer.
If I did not do so, it was because that very question is to be discussed in connection with the interinstitutional agreement; it is a question which, among other things, will be discussed next week, on 10 September.
I cannot say what will happen, therefore, but I can say this: a reform is not undertaken without carrying out assessments, and without pursuing the aims of the reform.
Finding a way of assessing its possible impact is a natural subject for the interinstitutional agreement.
Following up Mr Titley's point, could I ask whether the Council would look seriously at the question of critically considering methodologies of impact assessment?
In the years when I had something to do with this in an academic capacity, it was notorious that it was extremely difficult within the sociology of law to find reliable ways of assessing the impact of legislation which was in force.
Predicting the impact of legislation which is going to come into force is yet more difficult.
Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it would be wise for the Council to look into issues of methodology before we embark on expensive projects of this kind?
It is precisely that which is to be discussed.
I cannot say whether I am 100% in agreement with what was said, but the speaker is in any case an intelligent man and he is probably right in what he says.
The question, therefore, is to what extent we shall proceed in this way.
It is that which is to be discussed on 10 September, and I ask that the House appreciate this.
The conclusions from the Seville European Council outline the measures which are to be taken with a view to combating the problem of illegal immigration effectively at EU level; and here we are talking about both prevention and restriction of immigration.
We need to strike a fair balance between this aim on the one hand and the aim of better integration of those immigrants who are lawfully present in our countries on the other, and of course we also need an asylum policy which complies with international conventions.
It should also be mentioned that, even before the Seville European Council, the Spanish Presidency had given a significant impetus to this matter, notably by adopting two normative instruments, which not only map out some of the necessary measures, but also set the framework for future efforts and the development thereof.
The instruments concerned are the action plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and the action plan for the management of EU external borders, which were both adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
In addition, this Council reached an agreement on 13 June of this year on conclusions about measures to be taken to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings by sea.
The conclusions from Seville, which make specific reference to these action plans, attach importance to the following measures.
Firstly, speeding up the conclusion of readmission agreements currently being negotiated and approval of new briefs for the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries already identified by the Council: see conclusion No 30.
Secondly, as regards expulsion and repatriation policies, adoption by the end of the year at the latest of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Green Paper submitted by the Commission in April 2002.
This also falls under conclusion No 30.
Thirdly, the gradual introduction of coordinated, integrated management of external borders, which should, among other aims, help bring greater control of migration flows.
A number of measures are mapped out which should make it possible to achieve this goal very shortly: see conclusions Nos 31 and 32.
In a wider and more general perspective, the conclusions from Seville affirmed that immigration policy, as an essential element to be taken into consideration, should be integrated into the EU's relations with third countries.
They pointed out that an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration must remain the EU's constant long-term objective.
The conclusions highlight the importance of ensuring the cooperation of countries of origin and of transit in joint management and in border control and also in readmission, which is discussed in conclusion No 34.
The conclusions confirmed that it is necessary to carry out a systematic assessment of relations with third countries which do not cooperate in combating illegal immigration in the relevant areas.
They point out in this regard that inadequate cooperation by a country could hamper the establishment of closer relations between that country and the EU.
In the light of the conclusions from Seville, the Danish Presidency has attached a high priority in its work schedule to the fight against illegal immigration, so that the European Council conclusions can be implemented swiftly.
I can inform you that I myself shall be the President-in-Office of the Council when it debates these issues.
Mr President, during the first sitting in July, when you were President-in-Office of the Council, I asked you a very similar question and you told me that the Council and the Danish Presidency would address the matter as quickly as possible.
Two or three days later, on 8 July, I asked this question, hoping specifically that during the summer something would have been done.
The problem we have in the European Union, Mr President, and this is neither your fault nor that of the Danish Government, is that our system does not work.
Between the date on which I asked the first question, the first week of July, and today, thousands of illegal immigrants have entered the Canary Islands, both by sea and by air, and the situation there is unsustainable, and we do not have any reception centres.
These islands have a smaller area than the islands of Denmark, and at the moment we do not have any means of solving the problem.
Mr President, I would say - and I repeat - that, through no fault of your own or of the Danish Presidency, the Council of the European Union is not following up the proposals that Mr Vitorino has been making for some time now, so that the European Union can in fact establish control.
We should at least know who is arriving and why, and what we can do for them.
These problems in the Canary Islands came to my attention frequently when I attended the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) on migration in Lanzarote in the early summer.
I am therefore very aware of these problems, and I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that we are very active in this field.
I travelled to Athens to discuss problems - specific problems - with what is known as the Dublin II agreement, which determines which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application.
I am probably going to Rome next weekend to discuss the same problems.
If we adopt the new system - guaranteeing that it is the responsibility of the first country to handle an asylum application - combined with the system of fingerprint exchange, there is some apprehension that certain countries will see particularly large numbers of asylum seekers returned to them and will therefore bear an exceptionally heavy burden.
Of course, this will have to be discussed.
I do not believe that the problem is very serious; but we do have to consider how we can reassure the governments concerned.
There are several ways of doing this, and it is those I am discussing with the relevant governments.
This merely by way of convincing Mr Medina Ortega that we are absolutely not passive in this matter; we are extremely active.
We have started with the most difficult problems of all, with a view to getting those out of the way, in order that we can not merely realise the wish expressed in the Seville conclusions for the completion of the Dublin system, but also make the best possible progress with the common asylum rules. Although the Presidency has also declared these a high priority, we have not promised to be able to finish drawing them up during the Danish term.
We intend to make the best progress we possibly can with the work, and if possible complete it in November.
Question No 13 by Astrid Thors (H-0547/02):
Subject: Finalising of the agreement concerning the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program
According to the Commission (DG External Relations) a part of the bilateral work concerning the EU's relations with Russia focused for much of 2001 on energy, environmental protection and nuclear safety.
This was meant to be done through the conclusion of the agreement on a Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program, (MNEPR), aimed at cleaning up radioactive waste in north-west Russia and through the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP).
Similarly, in the press brief from the Commission (issued on 27 May 2002) before the Ninth EU-Russia Summit held in Moscow in May 2002, it was stated that the environment and nuclear safety were going to be discussed and that it would be important to ensure that the Russian federation finalise the MNEPR agreement as soon as possible.
In the Joint Statement issued after the EU-Russia Summit, however, no reference was made to the MNEPR.
A pledge conference on the NDEP is also to be held on 9 July.
What is the current situation concerning the MNEPR?
What are the obstacles to the conclusion of an agreement on the MNEPR?
What measures is the Council going to take in the near future in order to ensure that the Russian Federation finalises the agreement?
The negotiations on the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) have been going on for more than three years.
The EU has emphasised at a number of summits that these negotiations should be brought to a swift conclusion.
It is true that the common will to conclude the negotiations was not formally expressed in the joint statement from the summit in Moscow on 29 May, but the question was discussed at the summit, and Russia expressed a desire for resolution of the outstanding issues, which are of course taxation and civil liability.
The EU has taken every opportunity to put pressure on Russia to break the deadlock, including at the meetings of the Cooperation Council.
The other partner countries, the USA and Norway, have also put her under intense pressure.
The EU attaches great importance to nuclear safety in North-West Russia and believes that this agreement could contribute to overcoming some of the obstacles to the implementation of projects which could further cooperation on safety in connection with the management of irradiated nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in the Russian Federation.
The inaugural pledging conference for the Support Fund of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) was concluded with a positive result on 9 July of this year in Brussels.
The initial contribution to the Support Fund was approximately EUR 110 million, of which EUR 62 million are earmarked for nuclear projects.
Participants in the conference emphasised that the conclusion of this MNEPR agreement is a necessary precondition for projects within the nuclear sphere entering into operation within the framework of the NDEP.
The NDEP is an important and practical step towards achieving the objectives, set by the G8, of the Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.
The nuclear-safety issue is of decisive importance for environmental protection on the continent of Europe.
This particularly concerns Russia, but also other North European countries.
The Danish Presidency therefore wishes to work towards bringing the negotiations on the MNEPR agreement to a conclusion by the end of this year.
I hope this answers Mrs Astrid Thors's question.
I am satisfied with the reply, but unfortunately I must say that the Russian side seems to have a certain attitude of divide et impera towards the European authorities.
In the past, I have even seen a situation where the Council was given one answer and the Commission another, and they play on the fact that the presidency changes.
I could also quote yesterday's answer from the Commission to a similar question: 'Unfortunately, over recent months the Russian side has neither confirmed its willingness to sign nor given any indication of the nature of the problems holding up their signature.'
I regret to say I have a feeling that the Russian side will continue to delay.
I would therefore appeal to the Danish Presidency to exert considerable pressure if necessary.
At the same summit where this agreement was not signed, Russia was still accepted as a market economy.
Is there no similar way to achieve what is now needed?
I would like to thank Mr Haarder for the commitment he showed to the Northern dimension last week.
I do understand the fact that Mrs Astrid Thors is losing patience: we in the Presidency and the Council are as well, which is why we have taken every opportunity to exert pressure.
Without commenting on what was said about Russia's strategy, I can at least guarantee that we shall not miss an opportunity to put pressure on Russia, as I have said.
I have just attended a Ministerial Conference in Greenland in which the Russians also participated.
The subject matter was the Northern Dimension, in which I know that Mrs Thors also has a great interest.
Many of these matters were also raised there, and I believe that it is important - and here I am sure that we are in agreement - that we establish cooperation with Russia in as many fields as possible, while seeing this as a way of increasing the opportunities for exerting pressure on her in those areas where we believe it important and necessary.
I am thinking of Kaliningrad, of the enlargement of NATO and the EU and of the environmental problems in the Murmansk area, which Mrs Thors knows more about than I do.
There is every reason for establishing relations with Russia in as many fields as we possibly can, and at the same time for taking advantage of these opportunities to put pressure on her where we believe it really is necessary.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would be interested to know whether these treaties were concluded at International Atomic Energy Agency level.
In Europe, we do have the problem that it is the Member States alone that decide on safety standards for nuclear power stations.
Parliament has come to an arrangement with the Commission, specifically with Commissioner de Palacio, that safety standards for atomic power stations are to be submitted before the new Member States join.
Your fellow Member of the Council emphasised to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that this would be one of your Presidency's priorities.
So I would not only like to know what the current position is on the agreement with Russia, but also what we ourselves think about nuclear safety and about how nuclear power stations are to be made safe.
In my opinion, the agreements which I have been answering questions on here concern a different topic, and therefore this supplementary question does not bear any direct relation to the questions I have answered.
I do not mean that there is a set of rules in the archives, but I prefer not to improvise, as this is outside the scope of the question.
The supplementary questions should still be on the Russian Federation and the problem of nuclear energy in EU-Russia relations.
Question No 15 by Brian Crowley (H-0554/02):
Subject: Tackling Drugs
The prevalence of illegal drugs, including crack-cocaine, continues to cause serious problems for society in terms of addiction, criminality, treatment and policing.
Will the Danish Presidency, in the light of subsidiarity, give assurances that the Council will make the fight against illegal drugs a top priority of the Danish Presidency, and will it report back to the House in December 2002 on the initiatives and actions it has undertaken in this regard?
This is Question No 15 by Mr Fitzsimons.
No, sorry, just a moment.
The question was from Mr Crowley.
Like its Spanish predecessor, the Danish Presidency attaches great importance to combating drugs.
The cornerstone of the Presidency's drugs programme is the mid-term review of the EU action plan to combat drugs for 2000-2004.
The Commission will draw up an evaluation report to be submitted to the European Council at the meeting in Copenhagen in December.
The Danish Presidency intends to monitor closely the preparation of the Commission's report to ensure that the relevant working parties in the Council contribute to the greatest possible extent so that the report is comprehensive and informative.
The Danish Presidency has adopted a balanced approach to the drugs problem and will therefore endeavour to pay as much attention to prevention and drug-supply reduction as to international cooperation.
It has presented initiatives on the treatment of criminal drug abusers whilst they are in jail, and on synthetic drugs: the generic classification.
In addition, the Presidency intends to step up efforts to address current, and any future, problems regarding the distribution of illicit drugs on the Internet.
At international level, meetings will be held with the candidate countries, the USA, Russia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN); and, as far as Latin America is concerned, meetings will be held in preparation for the event to be held during the Greek Presidency.
In this way, the Presidency intends to hold meetings with most of the countries which, from the point of view of the EU, are the principal countries of origin and of transit for illicit drugs.
The issue of cocaine will be discussed at meetings with the USA and with parties in Latin America.
