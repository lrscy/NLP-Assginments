I would just like to briefly pick up on the comments you made about polygamous marriages, which caused you to shake your head.
For goodness sake, go and read Article 3, paragraph 2, which says: therefore, whilst it is not permissible to bring in several wives and their children, it is, on the other hand, permissible to bring in one wife and her children.
This means I could have married someone here in the Member States, and would be at liberty, under certain circumstances, to have at least one more wife join me.
In other words, there is admissibility.
That is the fact of the matter.
In this way, it would be possible....
... no, that is precisely how it can be interpreted in legal terms!
It gives free rein to all kinds of interpretations.
There is only one thing we can do here, and that is reject this proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force that the European Parliament has been consulted on a Commission proposal for a Council directive on the matter of the lawful immigration of persons originating from third countries.
It is therefore a sign of the profound institutional changes introduced by the Treaty and given top priority on the European political agenda by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council.
The Commission has decided that a proposal on family reunification should start us off on this journey, this considerable effort to construct a common European immigration policy.
I should also like to begin by explaining why we have chosen this subject - in answer to a critical observation from Mrs Klamt, whom, regardless of our differences of opinion, I should like to congratulate on the work she has carried out as the first rapporteur for this matter.
I believe family reunification is a concept that is thoroughly coherent with the commitments that all the Member States undertook several decades ago in the sphere of international law.
From the reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the international convenants made under the United Nations in 1966, to the European Convention on Human Rights itself - in all these instruments of international law family protection is upheld as an essential factor for ensuring social peace.
I do not believe anybody can deny that family reunification is also an important instrument for the integration of immigrants from third countries into their host societies.
This has indeed been repeatedly recognised by the bodies of the European Union. That is, since 1993 the Council has been devoting constant attention to the subject of family reunification.
It must also be recognised that family reunification is significant in numerical terms because it is today one of the main causes of immigration into the countries of Europe.
The directive is not creating this flow of migrants; what the directive intends is to regulate a situation that already exists on the ground.
Those who refuse to see that this directive aims at setting up legal rules to respond to a situation that already exists on the ground and try to blame the Commission for inventing a new flow of migrants are therefore being unfair in their analysis of the actual situation that we are addressing.
That is why the Commission decided that family reunification should be given priority treatment over other forms of lawful immigration.
It is not a matter of deciding on entry and residence for economic purposes, or the immigration of workers, or the immigration of students.
As we see it, it is a matter of regulating a different form of admittance in response to values - that is, family protection - and a strategic political objective: the promotion of the integration of third-country nationals who are already living lawfully in the Union into their host societies.
We are basing our approach on a principle which is debatable, but without any evidence to the contrary I believe it can be demonstrated.
This is that family reunification is a factor which promotes the personal stability of the immigrant, since family life is always an important instrument for integration into the host country.
The Heads of State and Government at Tampere in fact unanimously stressed the need to ensure equitable treatment for third-country nationals who are lawfully resident in the Member States of the Union.
They also stressed that a more dynamic integration policy needs to be developed in parallel, and that this policy should aim at offering third-country nationals rights and duties comparable to those held by the citizens of the Union.
These, then, ladies and gentlemen, are the values and political commitments upon which the Commission has based its proposal.
I should also like to point out that the Commission has proposed an initiative in which family reunification is seen as a right.
This is not, however, an absolute right of the third-country citizens who reside in the Union' s Member States, and reside there lawfully.
Instead it is a right subject to conditions, whether procedural in nature or material conditions regarding the definition of the status of the family members in the country to which they have been admitted and regarding the rights that they enjoy.
I am willing to discuss all the implications of this proposal, also because the French Presidency considers this subject to be central during the six-month term for which it is responsible.
For our part, we are also willing to introduce an amended proposal as quickly as possible so that we can achieve a positive outcome during the French Presidency.
I should like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate.
Here as in the Commission it has been a lively, at times even passionate debate, because it deals with a sensitive issue on which, naturally, each country puts forward a very strong case for its own situation.
It is difficult to find common ground at European level.
Above all, however, this debate has one fundamental feature.
It is no longer a debate on statements of intention: it is a debate on rules, binding legal provisions, which will have to be implemented.
It is therefore natural that it should be a lively, even passionate debate, and one in which there are divergent views.
The Commission considers your opinion to be of the utmost importance.
And I should like to congratulate Mr Wilson on the job he has done in presenting a report under the difficult circumstances in which this debate has taken place.
I should like to explain to you all what the Commission' s position is on the more difficult political issues in this directive.
First, the scope of the proposal: the Commission believes that refugees should be included within its scope, because from a political viewpoint it would be incomprehensible if economic migrants were granted a right to family reunification that we did not grant to refugees recognised under the Geneva Convention.
I accept, however, that it is necessary to exclude the beneficiaries of temporary protection or subsidiary protection.
This is not a matter of going back on a question of principle.
I am convinced that a certain kind of beneficiary of temporary or subsidiary protection should also have the right to family reunification.
I do recognise, however, that the lack of harmonisation of this concept at European level and especially the Commission' s intention to submit a directive on temporary and subsidiary protection to Parliament and the Council next year will allow us to deal with the right to family reunification in that directive very soon.
We therefore accept an amendment to the proposal excluding beneficiaries of temporary or subsidiary protection.
Where issues relating to the concept of the family are concerned, I should like to make it very clear that in this proposal the Commission is not interfering in the matter of defining the concept of the family.
This proposal fully accepts that each Member State has the competence to define what a family is, as well as the issue, for instance, of unmarried partnerships.
This proposal does not say that all the Member States will be obliged to recognise unmarried partnerships and accept unmarried partners under all circumstances.
We are simply saying that in those countries where unmarried partnerships are placed on an equal footing with marriage in domestic law for their own nationals, these unmarried partnerships must also be recognised for the purpose of family reunification for third-country nationals.
I should therefore like to state clearly that there is nothing in this proposal favouring family reunification for polygamous marriages.
I am sorry, but the text is quite clear!
It is not possible to apply for a second wife to come!
Only one exception is made: for the children of the second marriage if the interests of the child so justify.
But how could you explain treating the children of a second polygamous marriage differently from the children of a first marriage or the children of an unmarried partnership?
I am not a subverter of moral values, but I think we have to keep the interests of the children in the forefront.
Finally, Mr President, the Commission is willing to accept a number of other amendments and other modifications regarding the rights of family members, the conditions and clarification of the conditions for family reunification, the situation in which the person being reunited may acquire independent status, and concerning procedural rules.
Full details will be given before the vote is taken.
I should like to conclude by saying that this is, of course, an exercise that will give rise to debate.
The debate with the Council will not be easy, just as the debate with Parliament has not been easy.
I respect the opinions of all Members.
I should like the final opinion of Parliament to have as broad a support-base as possible.
And I hope - regardless of our differences of opinion, which are to be expected and, may I say, useful and essential for democracy - that once this directive has been adopted, we may all be able to pool our efforts to solve the essential question that we have before us. This question is how we can create a clear and transparent legal framework that will ensure the integration of lawful immigrants into their host countries and we must do so because this integration is the key to the success of a common European immigration policy.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Movement and residence of EU citizens
The next item is the report (A5-207/200) by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs, on the Commission report on the implementation of directives 90/364, 90/365 and 93/96 (right of residence) and on the Communication from the Commission on the special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health [COM(1999) 127 COM(1999) 372 - C5-0177/1999, C5-0178/1999 - 1999/257 (COS)]
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank all of you who have, through your comments, contributed to fuelling this debate.
Before embarking on an explanation of my report, I would like to start by asking you a question that I cannot get out of my head.
This is in my view the crux of the problem described in my report and will determine the way we vote.
This question is: what in fact does European citizenship really mean?
Is it just a simple expression aimed at selling Europe, or do we really want to add content to this term?
Today, for the majority of us who live in Europe, European citizenship is still a concept that is devoid of meaning.
If we want Europe to be more than a vast free trade area, we must take action to ensure that European citizenship goes beyond the status of a concept and takes root in the everyday life of the citizens of Europe.
This is the context in which I wish to place this debate.
The directives that have been examined concern Community nationals, but they must be modified in favour of third-county nationals.
The report aims to sum up the reality of the freedom to move and reside in the European Union.
With reference to the EC Treaty, my report was written with due regard to Article 14, concerning free movement of persons, and Articles 17 and 18 concerning European citizenship, which entails the right to move and to reside freely throughout the territory of the European Union.
Although Member States have made great progress in ensuring the free movement of goods, services and capital, it is clear that we are no nearer to achieving the same for people.
I will start by filling in some of the background and the content of the directives. Initially, freedom of movement was reserved for people who were economically active.
In June 1990, the Council adopted three Commission draft directives to extend this right to all Member State nationals, even if they were not economically active.
I will just give the broad guidelines of these directives.
For retired people and other non-economically active people, the right of residence is open to those who have health insurance cover and adequate means.
For students, the right of residence is subject to the condition that the student is enrolled at a recognised educational establishment and that he is covered by sickness insurance.
In both cases, spouses and dependent children may accompany the holder of the right of residence and may work.
The transposition of these directives was doubly problematic.
On the one hand, the directives were transposed extremely slowly throughout the Union.
What is more, the Commission had to initiate fourteen infringement procedures.
The Commission concludes that 'for too long, EU citizens have been denied some of their rights or been faced with unjustified administrative difficulties due to the incorrect transposition of the Directives' .
Let us now proceed to a concrete assessment of the situation.
This right to free movement and residence, which is confirmed in the Maastricht Treaty, is violated by economic considerations.
The notion of adequate means is incorrectly interpreted by governments.
What income is to be taken into account when evaluating means?
What evidence must be provided?
How does one take into consideration a progressive financial situation which sometimes depends on the help provided by the spouse?
Because the acceptance procedures are long and difficult, it is often necessary to take out a second health insurance in the host country.
When you are not in salaried work, it is difficult to obtain a residence permit and the instability of the professional situation is added to by the short-term nature of the residence permit once it has been obtained.
With regard to special measures justified in the name of public order, the Commission gives examples of many cases of incorrect interpretations, such as criminal convictions that justify systematic deportation and expulsion.
Finally, administrative procedures are too long - more than six months - and become very costly when frequent renewal is necessary, as the period of validity is normally two years rather than five.
I will now present the main measures advocated with a view to overcoming these problems.
Our first proposal is to ask the Commission to prepare a framework directive, which would adopt a position based on the fundamental right of free movement and residence rather than on a sector-specific approach which necessarily leaves room for ambiguities.
It will still be possible at a later date to implement a whole raft of specific measures to help citizens depending on their particular situation.
This reworking of the existing directives must dissociate the fundamental right of movement and residence from any economic considerations.
These measures must be concomitant with simplifying administrative procedures and providing documents free of charge.
Until these mechanisms can be put in place, a transitional measure may be to introduce a one-year residence permit for all applicants.
Harmonising social protection systems and pension systems is vital.
Finally, in the case of special measures justified by the notion of public order, we can only call on Member States to narrow down their interpretation, to put an end to the double penalty and to protect certain categories of people from expulsion.
I would like to finish by clarifying a number of points.
Rights must be attached to the individual and the individual must take the rights with him wherever he goes.
Third-country citizens living and working legally in a Member State must benefit from the same rights as European citizens.
Furthermore, it is a pity that the Council has not followed up this proposal of citizenship and residence.
In conclusion, I hope that I have persuaded you to support this resolutely citizen-centred approach of freedom of movement and residence, which is a fundamental issue for awareness of a European identity.
At a time when discussions about the future of Europe are hitting the headlines, and when we are examining a future charter of fundamental rights, we must support any project aimed at providing an area of freedom, justice and equality, where all the residents and citizens who contribute to the construction of Europe must have the same rights.
Perhaps it is time that people acquired the same rights as the products they consume.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur.
We are dealing here with a long-overdue overhaul of a number of directives relating to rights of residents of the non-economically active.
My starting-point, as was the rapporteur's, is that we should give European Union citizenship real meaning.
The Treaty statement that every citizen should have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States and the reality are still far apart.
I draw on the experience of a number of language students from other Member States in my own constituency.
They received a standard letter from our local social security office asking them to attend for a two-hour interview and to bring with them as many items as possible on a non-exhaustive list of about twenty documents such as a passport, bank statements, or household bills to "establish their identity".
When I enquired further about this I was told that it was not an EU matter, because the same letter would be sent to UK residents.
In what circumstances I cannot imagine.
And, the two hour time-scale, even more ludicrously, was supposed to save them from a car parking fine in the local car-park!
I would not want to see any citizens treated in the same way as these students.
The history of the directives that deal with the rights of residence of the non-economically active is an unhappy one: non-implementation, infringement proceedings, a patchwork of different and burdensome requirements.
You can move a sack of potatoes around Europe more easily than a citizen can move.
If we are to appeal to our citizens and the basic right of free movement is to be real, then simple, fast codification of this area of Community law is long overdue.
Then, and only then, will the Treaty statement on European Union citizenship become a reality instead of mere words.
Mr President, we are great talkers about human rights in the EU, but in practice it is often the case that citizens' rights are synonymous with money.
Those who have work and can support themselves are protected by legislation, but there are large groups of people who do not have work of their own and who therefore do not have rights.
This may apply to students who have to prove that they have a proper place at university or to pensioners who have to prove that they will be taking their pensions or own capital with them if they move.
It may also apply to third-country nationals and especially to relatives who are third-country nationals and who are not allowed to accompany the breadwinner when he or she obtains work on the other side of the border.
This means that those who are weakest economically are still discriminated against.
The report proposes significant improvements for these groups, which in practice are larger than one might think.
They are to be given better opportunities to move and an extended right to take up residence in other countries.
In this connection, I would also point out that the right to move within the labour market and the right of residence are not the same thing.
Nowadays, there are many workers who are sent on short-term contracts to work in other Member States and who do not receive any right of residence at all.
For those who do not have a secure income or other means of support, the right of residence is almost nil.
Freedom of movement for labour is protected by the legislation of the internal market.
For the majority of people, it is more important, however, for their right of residence, including their right to stay on, to be protected.
This means that people are not compelled to move even if they cannot support themselves.
Radical improvement is needed in this area, and it would be as well to tackle this problem now, at a time when the Member States' economies are looking better than they once did.
.- (DE) Mr President, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery 's report addresses the problems that the Commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights.
Yet, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery would like to see the scope of application of these residence rights extended to third-country nationals.
The Committee on Petitions was asked to submit an opinion because it is a special committee that is directly concerned with the problems facing the general public.
Unfortunately, there are still far too many infringements of the rights of EU citizens; I wholeheartedly agree on that score.
Firstly, Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights.
In particular, subordinate authorities in the Member States are unfamiliar for the most part with the relevant provisions.
Secondly, the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive.
What use is the right of residence to me, if I do not have the right to exercise the profession I am trained in, in the host country?
Thirdly, a failure to adapt the provisions on freedom of movement, and the social security rules, to the changing labour market, is causing problems.
It is simply not acceptable that I could fail to be reimbursed for medical treatment abroad merely because I do not have the correct form.
Mr President, we have provisions governing EU citizens' right of residence in other Member States, but even now, they are not being fully applied.
We are constantly hearing of cases where EU citizens are unable to reside in another Member State.
Therefore, let us urge the EU Member States to implement the existing Community law provisions without delay, before we consider extending these rights to third-country nationals at any rate.
Mr President, in the event that the amendments we are presenting to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report are not accepted, my group will vote against it for reasons which I believe to be fundamental.
The directives under debate today refer to the free movement and residence of students as well as people who have ceased professional activity or who are economically inactive and who, furthermore, receive disability or old-age pensions or subsidies - all of them Community citizens - as well as the exceptions laid down in another directive on expulsion for reasons of public order, security or public health.
The problem is that Mrs Boumediene-Thiery widens the scope of these directives to include citizens of third countries.
For example, section 20 of the resolution extends family reunification to non-Community families and their relatives in ascending and descending lines, who are not dependent on the resident, which would increase admission without restrictions.
Furthermore, to treat unmarried couples on the same terms as married couples, which does not raise many problems in the case of Community citizens, given the diversity of the legislation, does raise problems in the case of third country citizens because there would be very real problems recognising stable cohabitation.
It would give rise to so-called marriages of convenience or false marriages, and that amounts to fraud..
Furthermore, I believe that all the false logic which is used when referring to migrant workers has no place in this debate, not so much because of the subject matter but rather because it is not appropriate for the study of these directives.
As the Commission says, the level of information needs to be improved so that European citizens are crystal clear as to what their rights are with regard to moving freely within the internal market, with clear, concise and specific rules and using communication technologies such as the Internet, the television, or local and regional media.
Commissioner, the suggestion that replies to parliamentary questions should reach our various citizens by means of the methods of communication considered appropriate, does not seem to me to be a good procedure.
I think that it is impractical, apart from anything else because not even MEPs always read those replies.
It is also necessary to eliminate the absurd amount of paperwork needed to justify the nature and size of the pension.
I believe that an identity card for pensioners and the use of computers should replace these cumbersome forms of authorising payments.
The same would apply to students.
In order to facilitate their mobility, we should free them of unnecessary costs and make their residence compatible with their periods of study or apprenticeship.
Finally, I would also like to point out that it makes no sense to link public order, as section 6 of the resolution does, with the Schengen area in a proposal aimed at the citizens of the European Union, who are not governed by the Schengen legislation but by Community directives, in particular those relating to public order.
In order to update the legislation, I believe it is necessary to revise the texts by means of a new regulation and simplify the obstacles to free movement and to the residence of Community citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by thanking the European Commission for its sustained efforts in keeping the right of residence - within the context of the free movement of persons in Europe - high on the agenda; this is once again borne out by these two communications on the right of residence.
Secondly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
She has opted for a broad approach, Mr Hernandez Mollar, and her report covers right of residence for all citizens, including the economically active and those from third countries, topics which are, in fact, covered by proposals already submitted.
My group supports this approach because, despite all initiatives from the Commission, despite the Veil report, despite the action programme and despite the legislative initiatives, the proposals remain on the Council table with very little happening to them.
Within the framework of this debate, I should like to home in on four specific points.
Firstly, it has become apparent recently that the European labour market is relying increasingly on mobility; an ever dwindling number of companies manage to fill their vacancies.
It is therefore quite astounding that there are still that many obstacles with regard to the free movement of persons and right of residence, especially where temporary contracts, part-time jobs and the unemployed who look for jobs abroad are concerned.
Secondly, my group keeps an open mind on European citizenship. To us, this means that the non-economically active, the retired and students should also be entitled to a right of residence, subject to certain conditions, of course.
The obstructions which some Member States are creating at the moment do give us the strong impression that some Member States do not want to embrace the European citizenship idea at all.
Thirdly, we aspire to create a citizenship which does not discriminate according to the type of relationship citizens choose for themselves.
Whether they choose to live together, and whether they are single, gay or lesbian, they should also be able to claim right of residence in those countries where these types of relationship are recognised; if not, we would be denying thousands of people the right to live in families.
And finally, we embrace a vision of citizenship which is also open to people from third countries, residents of the European Union, legal immigrants and permanent residents, without discrimination.
We therefore give this report by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery our unconditional support.
We hope that the Commission will continue to adopt a hard line against infringements and the pitiful transposition of EU legislation in the Member States, but above all I hope from the bottom of my heart that the Council will finally pluck up the courage to tackle the free movement of persons full-on.
Mr President, there has thankfully been a change in European Community law over the last 30 years from freedom of movement of persons being seen as purely an economic issue - functional mobility - to it being seen as a personal right.
This has meant a lot of rhetoric about a citizen's Europe but not much change in the mentality or administrations of the Member States, as Mrs Wallis has pointed out.
In saying that, I am not overlooking the economic benefits of free movement.
Mrs Boumediene-Thiery's report points out - and I congratulate her for its quality - that facilitating mobility promotes dynamism and economic competitiveness.
So why does the Right ignore this?
But the real bottom line for Liberals is whether the Member States believe in and respect the notion of European citizenship, not only allowing the citizens of a Member State and their families to move around but also conferring such rights, to the greatest extent possible, on legally resident third-country nationals and their families - which unfortunately were not covered by the Commission report.
It is very aggravating when the Council of Ministers and individual governments wring their hands about the low turnout in European elections, launch campaigns with balloons and plastic bags about people's Europe and seek to win citizens' votes in referendum campaigns, but still maintain obstructive red tape when those citizens have the cheek to assert their European legal right to move freely.
Those rules are far too complicated anyway.
We need a complete overhaul to streamline and make crystal clear the unimpeded exercise of free movement.
It is not too much to ask.
As Mrs Wallis said, it should be as easy for people to cross borders as it is for widgets or potatoes.
We support Mrs Boumediene-Thiery ' s report.
It is indeed time that we respected equal rights and abandoned the rationale of suspicion towards immigration.
Member States take it upon themselves to refuse the right of residence to foreign students, even if they are enrolled at a recognised educational establishment, if they believe that they have changed direction or are not progressing quickly enough, which should be a decision left to the university authorities.
This rationale of suspicion gives rise to obsessive references to the need for public order and the scandalous practice of double penalties.
For the same crime, in addition to prison, foreigners are systematically and automatically expelled from a Member State.
This banishment violates the principle of equality before the law that is enshrined in Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Finally, it is important to facilitate the granting and renewal of permanent residence permits, as a residence permit of very brief duration leads to employment of very brief duration, discrimination and exploitation.
Finally, the time has come to promote a European citizenship that is based on residence.
The right to vote must be extended to non-Community nationals if we want to get rid of xenophobia and racism in Europe.
Mr President, as the rapporteurs who have just spoken said, although the right to free movement is deemed to be one of the most important aspects of the fundamental right of European citizenship, it is a right which is all too often subject to restrictions, and the large number of petitions to the European Parliament on precisely this subject are testimony to this.
I would first of all like to focus on a point strongly emphasised in the report: the need to fight against all abusive and excessively restrictive interpretations of the concept of public policy by some Member States.
For example, someone who has lived in a country since childhood or, at any rate, for a large number of years, and therefore has cultural, social and family ties in that country, should not be deported unless he or she is convicted of a crime which is deemed to be, in effect, a serious offence, under the criminal law of the country of residence.
Sadly, this is very often not the case.
Another point which I would like to focus on concerns the members of certain royal families, such as the Italian royal family, for example, which, despite the fact that it does not pose a threat to national security, cannot fully exercise its legitimate right of free movement.
I feel that the time has truly come to make a genuine attempt to tackle these issues and remove the barriers to free movement once and for all, for the very reason that - as has already been said - potatoes and goods appear to have greater freedom of movement in Europe than the citizens.
Freedom of movement and residence is a right enshrined in European treaties and granted to all citizens and should only be denied in exceptional cases when there is a real threat to public safety.
It is therefore all the more extraordinary that 50 years after the signing of the Convention of Human Rights, which ironically was signed in Rome, and one year after the Treaty of Amsterdam upholding such rights, that one European family, which for a thousand years has been involved with the continent's history, is being denied the fundamental rights my colleague has mentioned.
The Watson report demands such rights for family reunion and the Boumediene-Thiery report for freedom of movement and residence, even for third-country nationals and even for convicted criminals.
This family, as mentioned, is the former royal house of Savoy in Italy and lesser violations are also being committed against the royal houses of Austria and Greece by their governments.
The thirteenth transitional article of the Italian Constitution, absurdly labelled "transitional" but still in force after 53 years, is not only a violation of European treaties, but also sexually discriminatory in that it applies only to male royal descendants, no matter how far removed, of the constitutional monarch King Victor Emanuel, deemed guilty of signing unacceptable wartime fascist laws.
Ironically, descendants of Mussolini are not only allowed to live in Italy but one actually sits in the Italian Parliament.
This article is shameful and obsolete and all Members of Parliament, even those with anti-monarchist feelings, should join me in calling upon the Italian government to allow an innocent European family to return to their native land, where it poses no conceivable threat to public safety or the stability of the Italian Republic.
We can only call for European citizens to have more rights if all their rights are upheld irrespective of origin and without discrimination.
This issue goes far beyond individual families and goes right to the heart of the Union's respect for its own laws and treaties.
Either we have a European Union based on law or we do not.
I therefore commend my Amendment No 14 to this House.
Can I congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on her report on special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health.
It is a very good report.
Unfortunately, in two minutes all I can do is talk about some of its failings.
Firstly the Commission has failed to deal with the issue of the 12 to 14 million third-country nationals living legally in the Union who currently suffer discrimination and, outside the Union's island States can move freely de facto but cannot do so legally, which of course creates situations in which they are exploited and used in illegal ways.
With all due respect for the rapporteur, I have to say that we also have a problem with a number of areas that she has not dealt with, one of which is the issue of football hooliganism.
I am generally in favour of free movement but I think it needs to be limited.
I do not normally believe that persons who have not been convicted of crimes should be prevented from moving freely, but there is a European problem that is being ignored at European level.
Europol should be used to prevent the free movement of people who have been convicted of football-related crimes to ensure that they do not cause the same kind of trouble as at previous World Cup and European championship tournaments.
I also believe that the provisions should be invoked on the grounds of public security to prevent the free movement of German neo-Nazis who produce Holocaust denial material in Denmark with the clear intention of reimporting it into Germany, where it is illegal.
I hope that the Danish Government will use the provisions in this instance.
Equally, we need to make sure that the system is not abused.
I naturally hope that the free movement of people who have the misfortune to be HIV-positive is not restricted in any way on grounds of public health.
I agree with Mr Tannock in principle.
Of course the royal families of Europe should be allowed to move about freely.
However, I disagree with his priorities.
When we ignore the rights of 12 to 14 million legal residents, then the rights of two families are comparatively insignificant.
Mr President, I should like to begin by agreeing with all those who have pointed out that the matter we are discussing concerns the very essence of European citizenship.
We might say that this right contributes towards a practical and concrete expression of the concept of European citizenship, in that the great challenge facing us at the moment is to turn this legally recognised right into a practical reality that is implemented in citizens' everyday lives.
I also agree with those who have pointed out that the transposition of these directives has taken place too slowly, or even incorrectly in some cases.
In addition, we must also face up to the difficulties arising out of implementation of the directive on special measures concerning the movement and residence of citizens of the Union which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, in that there should be guidelines not only for the Member States, which have so far interpreted the provisions of the directive in quite a variety of ways, but also for the citizens regarding the rights conferred on them.
The Member States may impose restrictions on the right to free movement of Community citizens, particularly in matters of entry to and expulsion from their territory as well as the issuing or renewal of residence permits, where this is justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
Member States cannot, however, abuse such prerogatives in a European Union based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and particularly respect for the European Convention on Human Rights as well as, soon, a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is for this reason, then, that these measures of exception to free movement have been subject to restrictive interpretation.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to express my agreement with my colleague HernÃ¡ndez Mollar when he gave his support to the proposal from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to integrate the various texts into a single regulation. This could be implemented directly and would be a primary document on European citizenship, which would offer all the necessary information not only to citizens regarding their rights of citizenship but also to the government departments in each Member State that have the task of implementing existing legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, in company with Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar - whom I would like to thank for his enthusiastic support for Amendment No 15, tabled by myself - I feel that this document must be rejected if the European People's Party's amendments are not incorporated.
I support Amendment No 14, tabled by Mr Tannock, which upholds the free movement of the heirs to the Italian and Greek thrones and supports the monarchy.
Personally, in tabling Amendment No 15, I support the pensioners, for although the measure facilitates the movement of non-EU citizens, it does not remove the difficulties facing its own citizens, particularly its disabled citizens, who wish to travel within Europe.
At Bergamo Orio al Serio airport, as I was leaving to come to Strasbourg, I met a pensioner - a very old lady who is 80 years old - who told me that she wanted to go to Paris to visit her daughter but that she could not do so because she would lose her Italian State pension which is her only means of support.
Another person, who is totally handicapped, said that they wanted to go to London but that they could not do so because they would have lost their pension.
Yet another person, who is disabled - in a wheelchair, no less - told me that he would have liked to go and visit his brother but that in doing so he would have lost his incapacity allowance.
Therefore, our goal must be to bring about the free movement of pensioners and disabled citizens in Europe.
Mr Fatuzzo, you have made me think very carefully about where I shall travel to in old age.
Commissioner Vitorino has the floor.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like first of all to congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and all those who have taken part in this debate.
Indeed, I think that, for the Commission, the establishment of European citizenship has created a new legal and political environment and, for our part, we intend to draw all the practical lessons we can both in the legislative field and in the field of day-to-day public administration.
The Commission is counting a great deal on the support of the European Parliament when the time comes.
With regard to the motion for a resolution that you have just presented, I would simply like to address two or three comments directed at the Commission.
The three directives on the right of residence of the non-economically active have, I am sure, enabled thousands of European Union citizens to benefit from this right without encountering any particular problems.
However, there are still cases where these directives are incorrectly applied.
I can assure you that the Commission always intervenes - and tries to do so strictly under all circumstances - even if its intervention is not always obvious. If agreement is not reached, the Commission does not hesitate to notify Reasoned Opinions to the Member States concerned.
Citizens' complaints that meet with a satisfactory administrative response through extra-judicial procedures can be counted in their hundreds.
The action of the Commission also applies to the laws of Member States.
One could, in my view, cite several cases where this intervention has brought about modification of the legislation of Member States and sometimes even the examination, by the Court of Justice, of issues to which it has provided positive solutions.
There is no shortage of examples either concerning the Member States' improper use of the notion of public order, especially that leading to the expulsion from their territory of nationals from other Member States.
I can assure you, however, that the number of these cases is now very low and that, with regard to such cases, the European Commission never fails to take the necessary measures pursuant to Community law.
Nevertheless, it cannot be claimed that the strict application of Community law is sufficient to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of European Union citizens, bearing in mind the huge number of obstacles that persist due to the shortcomings in Community law. These shortcomings have already been identified in the second report by the Commission on European citizenship and in the report by the High Level Group headed by Simone Veil, which was presented to the Commission in 1997.
Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this morning we debated the directive on family reunification and that the Tampere Conclusions require the Commission to present a proposal on the recognition of entry, admission and residence conditions and on the legal status of third-country nationals within the European Union legally.
We are currently working on this.
For all these reasons, the Commission shares the opinion expressed by several Members of this House on the need for a global reworking of existing texts within the context of a single legal instrument, which will organise and guarantee the unimpeded exercise of the freedom of movement and residence.
This reworking, which moreover is included in the Commission action programme for 2000, is already in preparation.
It is based on the idea that entitlement to the right of free movement and residence must be dissociated from any prior reference to the economic situation of the beneficiaries in order to be attached henceforth to a concept and a status resulting directly from the importance of European citizenship.
The unique status of a European Union citizen necessarily creates the need for a unique general system of movement and residence in response to the demand to enrich the content of European citizenship in accordance with the political aspirations of the Union.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Environmental effects of certain programmes
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0196/2000) by Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position (C5-0180/2000 - 1996/0304(COD)) for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.
Mr President, I am very pleased that I have been entrusted with being rapporteur for the second reading of the SEA Directive which I believe is an important step towards a new form of behaviour in environmental policy.
I want to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, together with the Commission and, in particular, the Portuguese Presidency for the excellent way in which they have cooperated.
This draft directive concerns strategic environmental assessments which, in brief, involve a systematic process for identifying, analysing and assessing the influence and likely effects of plans and programmes upon the environment.
The assessments are to be carried out at as early a stage as possible in the planning process, partly so that alternative solutions might be found before the decision-making process is taken any further.
Environmental reports are to be written and made available to the environmental authorities, the public and environmental organisations, which are also to be given sufficient time within which to respond to the reports.
This is a very important directive for the whole of the Community' s environmental policy if a tool is to be obtained which makes it easier to comply with the commitments to sustainable development and compliance with the precautionary principle which have been made in the Treaty and in other agreements.
A modern environmental policy worthy of the name must do everything to ensure that damage to the environment does not occur and that effects upon the environment are minimised.
What often happens nowadays is that attempts are made to identify and repair damage once it has occurred.
As early as at the planning stage, we must learn to use policy areas, plans and programmes to avoid and reduce the negative effects and influence upon the environment.
The SEA Directive constitutes a very important step towards an approach of this kind.
Unfortunately, this draft directive makes no mention of policy areas, in spite of the fact that they figure in the Commission' s original draft from 1991 and in spite of the fact that all researchers in this area actually take it for granted that policy areas too must be included in a strategic environmental assessment.
It was not possible to achieve this in the Council, but the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy considered that policy areas too must be included in the review to be carried out in five years' time.
This has been discussed in Amendments 2 and 21.
A crucial argument when the Commission finally tabled this proposal in 1996 was that the assessment at project level enters the decision-making process much too late.
In actual fact, this is one of the main points in the directive - that an environmental assessment should be made early on in the decision-making process.
At first reading, the European Parliament had quite a lot of points of view. The proposal was thought to be heading in the right direction but in many areas, it did not go far enough.
Parliament tabled 29 amendments, of which 15 are more or less to be found in the common position.
If the SEA is to be a genuinely useful tool, the directive must be sufficiently broad in scope and the environmental report and the assessments must naturally be of very high quality.
In the common position, the Council has now made the text worse in a number of areas, specifically when it comes, for example, to the scope of the directive and the definition of what it is to cover.
The Commission too was very, very critical of the common position because it was far too limited in relation to the original text.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tried to restore something of the balance, for example by means of Amendments 6 and 7 which broaden the scope of the directive by not limiting it only to plans and programmes linked to EIA projects.
We do not permit whole categories of plans and programmes to be exempt.
Nor can we accept that financial plans and the whole of the defence sector are exempt from strategic environmental assessments.
This is discussed in Amendment 10, which also proposes that structural funds must also of course be covered by strategic environmental assessments next time around.
Other amendments which improve the directive concern greater transparency and openness to inspection and the need also to cooperate and consult with countries outside the Community.
I personally am very surprised at Amendment 26 from Mr Nassauer and 29 other MEPs who want to reject the common position.
This possibility was not mentioned at all in the Committee' s discussion.
Clearly, they are fully entitled to make this proposal, but do they really think that the EU' s environmental policy is something extraneous which is not in any way binding?
Should the European Parliament just not bother about the text of the Treaty, the Cardiff Agreement, the Fifth Environmental Programme and so on?
I really do not think that the proposal is a genuinely serious one.
Amendments 11 and 31 also worry me a little.
Amendment 11, in particular, says that the Member States should define at what level SEAs are to be carried out if plans and programmes are part of a hierarchical system.
In this way, the whole idea of arranging an SEA is called into question, so I hope these amendments do not go through.
Mr President, this is a small but significant measure to extend the duties of Member States to carry out strategic environmental assessments on the planning framework as well as on the actual plans where the implementation would or could have a significant impact on the environment.
All Member States voted for the common position, but some made it clear that they would go very little further than that.
Our task is to clarify and to amend responsibly and on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on the work she has done and the consultation she has had with us.
We will however be rejecting some of her amendments, notably those that seek to extend the system to all financial plans, to defence and civil defence, to consultation beyond what is reasonable and to the general policies she has just mentioned, which become more of a wish-list than firm proposals.
However, we agree that it makes no sense to exclude projects financed wholly or partially by the European Union, especially structural funds, and we certainly agree that it makes sense to talk to neighbouring states outside the European Union.
We agree that there should be adequate reporting back, not only on the environmental risks identified by the assessment, but on the action it is proposed to take to mitigate or remove them.
We also of course have to consider Amendment No 26, in the name of some of our German colleagues, which rejects the common position.
I understand the concerns of colleagues from Germany and some parts of Italy.
These result from the way in which some governments and regional governments have chosen to implement the assessments.
These governments are giving environmental assessment and Europe a bad name for what are entirely excesses of their own making and they need to look carefully at their domestic policies.
But this is a subsidiarity measure which leaves the details to Member States.
It is not the big hand of Europe extending control to local planning matters.
It does, however, ensure that particularly at our respective borders our planning takes account of the environment quality within and across our borders when planning frameworks are being agreed.
We believe that to be a good thing and my PPE-DE Group will therefore not be supporting Amendment No 26 and will vote for the common position.
We shall then vote for the amendments we supported in committee and for one further clarifying amendment which has been submitted since, but we shall oppose the amendments which we believe are a step too far in terms of what is desirable, practical and acceptable.
Mr President, the directive we are about to vote on represents a major step forwards.
The obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment at an extremely early stage of town and country planning activities does, in fact, make it possible to incorporate environmental concerns fully right from the conception of town and country planning plans and programmes.
The Union has at last realised that we can no longer restrict ourselves to merely picking up the pieces following damage caused by short-sighted planning, but that the damage must be averted as early on as possible.
The amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment substantially improve the Council's common position.
Firstly, it was upheld that, in order to exert any real influence over national customs, the scope of the directive must be as wide as possible.
In this context, I feel that plans and projects financed from the Structural Funds must without exception be governed by the directive, seeing that, in practice, they represent all the programmes implemented, particularly in regions whose development is lagging behind.
Secondly, the principle of consultation and provision of information to the public and the organisations concerned throughout the assessment process, in compliance with the Aarhus Convention, has been reestablished.
I therefore feel that this is a sound text overall.
I understand the concerns of the Members coming from countries organised according to a Federal State model, who fear that the local authorities will be overloaded with work, but I feel that the amendments, particularly Amendments Nos 19, 29 and 31, are sufficient to avoid an overlap between the two directives and still ensure respect for the environment.
Mr President, every day it is drawn to our attention that the environment is changing.
Last Sunday, I was listening to a Swedish radio programme which said that, in central Sweden, people would have to adjust to the fact that rainfall would increase by 50 per cent over the next few years.
In one way or another, environmental questions are always the subject of public opinion nowadays.
They must therefore feature in a better way in political work, too.
I therefore want to congratulate Mrs SchÃ¶rling on a very good report which proposes that environmental aspects must be taken into consideration at an early stage.
In principle, environmental issues must permeate all activities, economic activity above all perhaps.
When it comes to plans, building projects etc, it is of course important, as proposed in this report, to take account of environmental aspects as early as possible so that mistakes and increased costs can be avoided and the right solution found as soon as possible.
I think it is extremely important and commendable that Mrs SchÃ¶rling should propose that the scope of the directive should be broadened.
It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment.
It is transparently obvious to the EU, which invests a very large part of its budget in the agricultural sphere, in regional policy and in the structural funds, that these areas should be examined from an environmental point of view.
We cannot go in and do this directly but should do so as quickly as possible whenever new plans come out.
It is unreasonable to do what is at present done with EU funds and to support such activities within these sectors as are opposed from an environmental point of view in other contexts.
We must try to create a system in which we think in environmental terms from the very beginning, even when it comes to economic problems.
This is a major and important issue.
I realise that large sections of this House do not agree with me, but my group and I completely support Mrs SchÃ¶rling in this connection.
Mr President, I am going to refer briefly to four points which were fully debated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We are basically in favour of the proposal of the Environment Committee and its rapporteur.
With regard to the inclusion of some of the sectors in the directive, in particular the extractive industry and the defence industry, we believe that they should not be left out.
Provided, of course, that the necessary precautions are taken.
I would also like to stress the importance of the inclusion of the management of water resources.
An ambitious government plan will be presented soon in Spain, the National Hydrological Plan, which will have a clear impact on the places where it is put into practice.
We feel it is essential that these assessment studies should be carried out.
Also very important to us is the role of the public, i.e. transparency.
There is a directive on the right to information, No 313, which has been repeatedly ignored by the Member States and by local and regional authorities.
Likewise, we must include the quality of the studies and the issue of health amongst the significant sectors affected.
High environmental standards and good health are very closely related.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and in so doing acknowledge the positive role of Parliament in setting the agenda for the highest standards of environmental protection.
There is of course a cost factor in environmental management, but equally an economic return, which not easily quantified but exists none the less.
The proposed directive, which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan, makes good environmental and economic sense.
Far too often in the past we have seen costly development plans collapse because of environmental considerations that were not addressed at the initial planning stage.
Finally, I would appeal to professional planners to use their common sense by taking account of the views of public representatives and community groups.
A textbook approach of the kind seen far too often has not always served to meet citizens' requirements in this important area.
Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification.
Elected Members must exercise greater care and concern when drawing up development policies that will ultimately affect Union citizens.
Mr President, strategic environmental impact assessment is an instrument which allows governments to assess whether policy proposals, plans and programmes are compatible with the concept of sustainable development.
In this way, we can ensure that environmental concerns form a more integral part of the economy. Indeed, decisions at macro-economic level too should be accompanied by a preliminary strategic environmental impact assessment.
It is therefore important for public administrations to be very aware of the usefulness of this exercise in order to prevent environmental damage as far as possible.
It is equally important for us to clearly outline which plans require environmental impact assessments and which do not.
The Council has dealt with this extensively.
I am in favour of submitting policy proposals, including environmental impact assessments, to public administrations.
In that case, a public administration may decide to scrap a plan, programme or proposal, call these off in good time or replace them by environmentally-friendly alternatives.
On the other hand, there is a substantial risk of too many plans and programmes being subjected to environmental impact assessments.
If extensive studies are carried out of plans and programmes whose impact on the environment is negligible, then this is a waste of energy.
What is more, the instrument as such is being weakened.
So in this light, including all financial plans, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection would therefore be going too far.
Mr President, the best way to integrate environmental issues with all areas of policy is to get the environmental perspective in the picture at the earliest possible stage.
In this way we will avoid the problems we have at the moment with regard to harmonisation of the use of land, financial activity, and the expectations of the public.
There is in existence a strategic evaluation of the impact on the environment that applies not only to town planning but also agricultural, transport, travel and energy sector programmes, among others.
In order for us to be able to harmonise all these important aspects and proceed in an environmentally and socially sustainable way we need plans that are sufficiently long-term in nature: long-term inasmuch as they act as genuine guidelines for separate and independent measures.
In this connection I have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.
It is quite natural that Structural Funds programmes, plans and measures should be included in any examination of this issue.
It is also important that we take the proper course of action at different levels, and not act in too complicated or bureaucratic a manner, but take account of the new information we get all the time.
In this respect there has perhaps been too much anxiety about overlap, but I hope that, after this debate, this report will be as successful as possible as far as this is concerned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a new instrument and it accords with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which concerns the integration of environmental policies into other areas.
It is a delicate flower and we all want it to be a success.
I also want it to be well received by my electorate back home.
Hence I sometimes ask myself the questions that they ask themselves.
When I look at the Council' s proposal, I assume that people will ask themselves this: how can the EU introduce an assessment regime that excludes the plans and projects financed by the European Union itself?
This is completely unacceptable, and that is precisely how I see it.
The scope of application must be extended to include areas that are financed by the European Union.
Secondly, the people of Germany, in particular, may well ask themselves why the assessments are to be carried out at state level, national level, regional administration level, and at local level, which will drag the procedures out.
This is indefensible in my view.
It is the real issues that count, not having the same thing assessed at every level.
Therefore we must make it clear that a duplication of effort must be avoided.
Accordingly, Guido Sacconi' s Amendment No 31 has my unequivocal support.
A third question the people may ask themselves is this: why is nothing happening now that an assessment has taken place which may have raised certain issues?
Therefore we must make it clear that the regulation is binding.
We certainly cannot have a situation where an assessment is carried out and the findings are then filed away, never to be seen again.
We need a binding commitment to the effect that any findings will be acted on.
Therefore, I emphatically support Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which provide for us to make the transposition of environmental protection measures following assessment a little more binding in nature.
With this in mind, I wish Mrs SchÃ¶rling' s report every success.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for her constructive approach and for being open to dialogue with all the interested parties - including the Commission - which I hope will finally enable us all to achieve a positive result in relation to this directive.
I would also like to highlight the quality of the report which we are debating today and I would like to talk about what I see as the most significant problems raised in the various amendments that have been tabled and the interventions of the various Members. My sincere thanks for all your comments and points of view.
Of the key questions, I would firstly like to mention those amendments which involve broadening the scope of the future directive.
The joint position clearly distinguishes the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory from those for which it is necessary to make a selection, a screening.
The Commission is inclined towards this approach, provided that the joint position is improved, because we believe that otherwise it would be insufficient.
Firstly, there must be a balance between the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory and those for which we have to make a selection.
Secondly, the scope of the directive must, in any event, be sufficiently broad and systematically include those plans which have a significant impact on the environment.
This is why the Commission enthusiastically supports some of Parliament' s amendments which broaden the scope of this directive and do so in a balanced fashion, such as, for example, the second and fifth sections of Amendment No 5, which have been mentioned by the rapporteur and also by some other speakers, such as Mrs GonzÃ¡lez, which proposes also including extractive activities. We also support Amendment No 6.
Nevertheless, we believe that some amendments go too far and propose the strategic environmental assessment for plans which will not probably have a significant impact on the environment.
For example, section 4 of Amendment No 5 would make these assessments obligatory for all the plans for the sectors listed in the directive. The third section of Amendment No 10 would mean an unnecessary burden for the Member States.
Some amendments limit the directive' s scope even further and actually contradict what I have just said.
Certain amendments would reduce the scope, such as Amendment No 3, which limits the scope to the plans financed by the EU, or Amendments Nos 11 and 31, which allow States to choose the level or levels of planning with which these strategic environmental assessments will be carried out.
This would exclude many plans which have an impact on the environment.
Now, if Parliament were to adopt these amendments together with those which broaden the scope to plans with no significant impact, it seems to me that we would end up with a text which is inconsistent with itself.
These amendments seem to be inspired by the fear of the assessment being duplicated.
In my view, this fear is not sufficiently justified.
Planning is usually carried out at various levels and each one has its own specific characteristics.
The carrying out of assessments at various levels of planning is not a duplication of the assessment, especially given the safeguards contained in Articles 4, 5 and 10 of the joint position which are intended to prevent just the kind of duplication which Mr Lange, for example, referred to.
Thirdly, I would point out the amendments which establish the procedures for planning and programming the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment - Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 13 - and which require the screening to be carried out on a case by case basis, with the participation of the public in all cases.
I believe that the objective of the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment is to determine, quickly and efficiently, which plans and which environmental problems are the most relevant.
Establishing the best way to deal with these issues will require practical experience.
We therefore believe it is too soon to establish that all circumstances justify a screening and a broad scope.
We therefore believe that, by incorporating the provisions on the screening and the definition of the scope into their national legislation, Member States would be liable to exceed the requirements of the directive and, for that reason, we will not accept these amendments.
Nor will we accept the amendment which implies a rejection of the joint text - Amendment No 26 - which contradicts the other approaches.
I do not believe it is necessary to point out that this directive on the strategic environmental assessment is a key instrument for integrating the environment into policies and for promoting sustainable development in the European Union.
I believe that a rejection of the joint position would deal a serious blow to these principles which are at the heart of the Treaties and which must inspire all our policies.
I understand that this may seem insufficient to some of you, but we must appreciate that sometimes it is not always best to seek perfection.
I believe that we should seek something acceptable, which would be a step forward, rather than reach a deadlock.
Mr President, having carefully examined all the amendments, I can tell you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 5 (sections 2 and 5), 6, 12, 28 (section 1) and 29.
Amendments Nos 9 (the part which refers to the requirement to justify that the strategic environmental assessment is not necessary), 10 (sections 1 and 2), 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24 and 25 are acceptable in principle, providing that there is some rewording of its content.
The Commission cannot, however, under any circumstances, accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 (sections 1, 3 and 4), 7, 8, 9 (in the part on the requirement to justify the need for a strategic environmental assessment), 10 (section 3), 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28 (section 2), 30 and 31.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues
The next item is the report (A5-0213/2000) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive [C5-0348/2000 - 1998/0249(COD)] on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a directive intended to fight marine pollution, and this will not be the only one this year.
I am, of course, referring to the Erika directives which are due at a later stage.
It would perhaps be a very nice start to the season and the French Presidency if this directive, along with the outcome of the conciliation between the Council and Parliament, in particular, were to be adopted today in Parliament.
That is why I would like to say a word of thanks to the representatives of the Council, as well as to the Portuguese Presidency, which had a role to play, and also to the French Presidency, the Commission and the members of the conciliation committee, who were involved at the last stage.
As we have already discussed, at the heart of the proposal is, of course, the duty on the part of ships to report and to deliver waste.
Ports are required to draw up waste-processing plans and to ensure that there are waste-processing plants or organisations that implement these plans.
This is to prevent the problem of marine pollution from escalating to an even higher level than that at which it already stands.
A recent study by KIMO Coast Watch has shown, for example, that there is still a growing volume of waste on beaches, that the sea is still being polluted and that state-of-the-art technology is being used to discharge sludge into the sea.
If we consider the waste processing plants which already exist in a number of ports, there is even a downward, rather than upward, trend in waste deliveries.
Officially, according to MARPOL and other conventions, waste is required to be handed over. In practice, however, it appears that this does not happen.
This was the reason why the Commission was right to come up with a directive which was the subject of conciliation not so long ago.
It might be useful, in this context, to highlight the outcome of the negotiations because, at the end of the day, we made a certain investment, and we must assess this investment jointly in order to be able subsequently to decide in this House whether or not we can go along with it.
Eventually, what mattered most was the fee system, which is, in itself, not unimportant.
It is important because we hope that by means of a fee system - leaving to one side the attendant obligations for a moment - ships will be coaxed into delivering waste.
This is why we have had long debates with the Council, and the Commission was a great help in ensuring that the financial incentives were incorporated into this system in one way or another.
Parliament' s suggestion was for a figure of 90%, which we would like to collect by means of port dues in one way or another.
During committee discussions, we took a more lenient approach but, ultimately, decided to start the negotiations with this figure.
For a long time, the Council had decided neither to incorporate the word "significant" in this sense, nor to include the percentage figure.
However, certainly in the light of the review clause which has already been the subject of discussion, it is important ultimately to specify the amount.
You may well ask yourself why this percentage would be of any significance?
For the simple reason that if we were to endorse and adopt the polluter-pays principle, each and every ship could then pay at the port but could also decide simply to dump the waste at sea.
In other words, this principle is not very effective in this case. This is why we have abandoned it and believe that a fee system as explained should be introduced.
We support the percentage which has now been agreed upon, or at least the interpretation laid down in the Commission statement, namely 30%, certainly in the light of the review clause which has been adopted.
In this clause, it is agreed that, three years after the entry into force of the directive, it will be examined whether the volume of waste delivery has increased or whether a situation has been created which requires either a higher percentage level or a review of the system.
We can go along with this.
It may be useful to indicate that we were able to reach agreement on the 25% of inspections to which we aspire, as well as a provision for delays which can arise when waste is being delivered. In the main, national legislation prevails in this context.
A few exceptions have been made for small ships, not so much on the basis of the length but on the basis of the number of passengers they carry i.e. twelve.
This means that, although they do not have a notification duty, they must, of course, deliver waste.
Small ports will need to make a considerable effort to accommodate this directive in the foreseeable future.
Finally, I should like to note that, with regard to traditional sailing ships, whose exemption we initially secured by drafting a specific list, we have now decided to apply the Marpol convention to them with regard to sewage.
I would like to thank everyone, and my fellow committee members, in particular.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is very pleased with the end result - one reservation aside - because the new directive will ultimately enable us to make progress in marine protection, and in establishing a level playing field for the Union' s ports.
The significance of the directive resides first and foremost in the fact that all Member States will be obliged to ensure that port reception facilities are set up, within the next two years, in all ports subject to this requirement.
Captains will also be obliged to use these facilities.
We hope that the rationale behind these two commitments will lead to a reduction in the amount of ship-generated waste deposited illegally in the sea, thus strengthening the marine environment and also improving competition between ports.
I believe that the conciliation procedure was successful in the end, for we did at least manage to secure our demand for ships to have to pay a significant contribution towards the costs of the facilities, irrespective of how much they make use of them.
Parliament would rather have succeeded with its demand for 'significant' to represent at least 90%, as this would have satisfied us, and there would no longer be any financial interest whatsoever in simply dumping waste at sea.
After all, if ships had to pay anyway, then they might as well use the facilities.
Sadly, the Council could not bring itself to accept this logical, no special fee provision, hence our reservation against the directive.
And we hope that if it becomes apparent that ships are continuing to discharge waste into the sea, the Commission will propose an amendment at the revision stage in three years' time.
Having said that, Madam Vice-President, we are grateful to you for the fact that your statement - which is, after all, of crucial importance - does at least, in effect, secure a bottom line of 30% as the amount agreed by the Council and Parliament, and we are relying on the Council to act on your statement accordingly.
Secondly, as my honourable friend has already said, we have scored two other victories for marine protection and the citizens of the European Union.
Firstly, we have stipulated that 25% of all commercial shipping will in fact be obliged to undergo inspection, in order to ensure that waste disposal is being carried out in accordance with the regulations. MARPOL is all well and good but not when it stays on the bookshelf!
We will only be able to protect the sea if we actually monitor whether waste disposal has taken place.
Secondly, we have put pressure on the Member States to meet their obligation to actually set up these port reception facilities.
We have ensured that Member States will be required to introduce compensation measures, in case ships are forced to remain in ports unnecessarily, simply because there are no waste disposal facilities available, or they are inadequate.
In this way, although the ships will have to pay, they will also be protected.
Mr President, on a final note, I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank the committee chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, and the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for their committed and successful handling of these negotiations.
Thank you very much, Mr Jarzembowski.
I would have been surprised if Mr Piecyk had not wanted to speak for three minutes!
Mr President, and I would have been very surprised if you had not been the one to chair this sitting again.
After all, it is a good day for Europe' s seas, as it for you personally, Mr President, because I know you are a keen diver.
We would all be delighted if you had even cleaner waters to dive in in Europe.
But the sea is our primary concern.
I believe we are in a position to congratulate each other today.
We can congratulate both the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, and the delegation, because we have succeeded in improving some crucial aspects of the directive, or should I say, the Council' s common position.
It had been watered down, and I believe Parliament has secured coherent measures for all concerned
Firstly, mention has been made of the fact that all ports will have to provide reception facilities for waste and cargo residues.
This is an important step.
Secondly, all ships will have to pay, irrespective of whether or not they use the facilities.
That is the real principle that is being brought into play here for the first time.
The sums involved will not be small; they will be considerable.
It is true that we cannot be completely satisfied with 30%.
That much is absolutely clear.
Nevertheless, the 30% introduces and establishes the principle of a 'no special fee system' .
Naturally there is room for improvement, but with this principle in place, every one will have to pay their way.
Thirdly, all Member States must carry out checks on at least 25% of shipping.
I believe we should urge them to exceed the 25%.
We should challenge them to increase the number of checks.
After all, on so many occasions, we have been forced to recognise that, where ships docked at ports are concerned - take the 'Erika' for example, or other ships - monitoring is one of the crucial issues.
If there is no monitoring, there is no point in having any regulations.
On balance, the point of this directive is that the criminal discharge of waste on the high seas will no longer be as profitable as it used to be.
I also feel that marine pollution should no longer be treated as a trivial offence.
Europe' s seas are becoming cleaner, which will benefit the flora and fauna, and not least, the fishing industry.
This directive will also have a very positive effect on tourism, in the long run, for it will scarcely be possible to sustain tourism if there are no clean beaches.
So it is a good day for Europe' s seas and also a good day for you, Mr President.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Parliament has enjoyed co-decision power with regard to transport issues, for example.
In this way, differences of opinion between the Council and Parliament, which are a regular occurrence, need no longer be settled unilaterally.
This procedure has proven to be worthwhile in practice.
The conditions for the delivery of waste by ships at Community ports have been the topic of many a discussion.
On previous occasions, Parliament had stressed the importance of including certain elements and, fortunately, the Council has, sometimes after pressure has been put upon it, taken on board the significance of these points.
Right until the very end, however, there has been one main contentious issue, namely the ships' own contributions toward the cost of collecting waste.
The European Parliament was of the opinion that the user should cover the lion' s share of the costs that he has given rise to but made provision for a scale of different charges and made every effort to discourage illegal dumping in the process.
Accordingly, it came up with a percentage level for own contributions which far exceeded 50%.
The outcome of the negotiations is nowhere near the agreed percentage, which is regrettable.
However, I do believe that simply quoting a percentage is a step in the right direction.
This is why I will be backing this report, albeit not with much enthusiasm.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for having invested so much energy in this project.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, this is perhaps the first time I have addressed the European Parliament without having to express any worries or concerns about the subject of the debate. I am fully in agreement with the outcome of the conciliation procedure and I would like to commend both Mr Bouwman and the other Members who sat on the Conciliation Committee and Mrs de Palacio and her services for ensuring that we worked together to achieve this positive outcome.
I think that the outcome of our work will finally help to improve the quality of our seas, tourism and the quality of life of the citizens of Europe.
It is a step forward.
I believe that we are now protecting the environment more effectively than hitherto, although I do admit this could have come about in a better way.
But, here we are. If we see that the new system is not working as effectively as we believed it could work, we can review it.
Since we had to go to conciliation, as Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I would prefer to avoid such procedures as far as possible.
But this requires the Council, which must abandon its tradition of secrecy, to cooperate better with the European Parliament and to speak more openly. Only in this way can the work of the Commission and our own work progress more quickly, especially in our own committee, where there are many issues that directly affect our citizens.
I hope that this tradition will change under the French Presidency.
In any event, we are all in favour of better cooperation and the speedier progress of the work of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Mr President, as a new Member of the European Parliament and as a permanent member of the Conciliation Committee for the first time, I have to say that I was satisfied with this procedure, which saw representatives of the main institutions of the European Union making every effort to achieve a happy medium, that is to say, between the possible and the feasible, bearing in mind existing conditions and possibilities, which are of course not the same for all Europe' s ports.
Especially with regard to fees, the important thing is that agreement was reached that the ships would pay part of the cost of waste disposal regardless of whether they use the port facilities or not. This will prevent difficulties arising for many ports and ships.
It is clear that this substantially reduces the incentive to discharge at sea. It also leaves each port the option of having its own charging policy.
Let us not forget that the European ports in the Mediterranean face competition from the ports of North Africa, whereas the Baltic or North Sea ports do not face any competition.
What is more, the possibility of amending the system to cover additional costs, should this prove necessary during its implementation, is guaranteed.
The essential thing is that, by approving the joint text under debate, we will have a directive that will protect our seas and coastlines from pollution caused by ships, and we will also have enhanced the image of the European Union as a standard-bearer for environmental policy and as an example for the rest of the world to follow.
Mr President, after a fight lasting many years, we are now to take the crucial decision on reception facilities which will make it possible, for example, to leave waste oil in port instead of dumping it in the sea.
This is obviously an extraordinarily large step in the right direction.
At the same time, it is worrying that, right up to the end, there have been those who have tried to thwart what is obviously the right step.
This is shown by the fact that a third reading has been required and that a conciliation committee has had to be set up, as well as by the lack of commitment on the part of large sections of the Council of Ministers.
It also has to be said that what we have achieved today is a compromise.
In the original proposal, almost all portions of the costs were covered by port fees in accordance with the system which has been in existence for a long time in parts of the Baltic.
This means that there was an economic motive for a vessel to leave waste oil in a port rather than dump it in the sea.
Now, only portions of the cost are to be covered in this way, while an extraordinarily large part of the cost is to become a further additional cost for the ship owner.
In my view, it remains to be seen what effects this will have.
I believe it is very important that we should be prepared to keep track of developments and make further decisions on this, if need be.
The evaluation envisaged in the Conciliation Committee' s proposal and the monitoring of vessels which is to take place are therefore extraordinarily advantageous.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for his efforts over quite a long period of time in negotiating this very satisfactory proposal which will - as all colleagues have said so far - significantly reduce the amount of pollution dumped illegally into the seas around Europe.
Let us pause and reflect on the scale of the problem.
Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to Erika.
This was indeed a tragedy of enormous proportions, with significant and perhaps enduring consequences, but the amount of deliberate spills from oil tankers along all our coasts dwarfs the amount of oil that was spilled from Erika.
It is that problem that this particular proposal aims to tackle.
I am delighted that it will, by ensuring that the Member States provide adequate facilities at all their ports, that their ships and masters are obliged to use them, that the fees system is fair and balanced and above all that 25% of ships are inspected to ensure these requirements are met.
I particularly welcome the three-year review, because my only concern is that Member States should implement this legislation that they have now signed up to.
As Mr Jarzembowski will know only too well, on port state control several Member States still do not inspect 25% of ships.
If they cannot do it on that, what is to say they will do it on this?
That is our challenge to them: to make sure they adhere to the very worthy agreement that we are hopefully going to be endorsing this week.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bouwman on the publication of this text, which had been uncertain for a long time.
This is indeed a very important date in maritime history.
A number of our colleagues have said that this text is a precursor to the Erika package and, in many respects, it aims to solve a problem that is even more serious. This problem concerns acts of ecological piracy, when ships discharge waste at sea, discharging hydrocarbons and a huge amount of waste onto our shorelines.
It is also a victory for Parliament over the Council' s reluctance to imposing a common-sense fee-paying system.
The principle of polluter pays is not working in the case in point, because the polluter cannot be identified.
If we want to settle this issue, we must move towards a universal fee system, which will be mandatory and not linked to the act of waste treatment.
I am among those who, in their capacity as French Members of Parliament, have made every effort to ensure that this text is published, even acting against the sympathies of their government towards this text or against its reservations.
I am among those who welcome this compromise.
But this compromise cannot be allowed to become a let-out. It must be implemented and its implementation must be strictly monitored at the level of the Member States.
In this connection, I would like to give you the position of a Frenchman who has worked so hard, despite the reluctance of his government.
It is clear that this text currently favours large ports and puts small ports, which are not equipped, at a disadvantage.
I therefore call on the Council to help Member States equip small ports, possibly in the framework of the Structural Funds, or in the form of some kind of loan, because small ports are also important elements of national and regional development and of regional and local economies.
And I believe that, if we provide small ports with waste treatment plants, we will secure the success of this directive.
Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on a commendable result.
I do not normally make a habit of doing this here in Parliament but, since there is good reason for doing so on this occasion, I would thank the rapporteur and the others who have worked on this report.
As Mr Stenmarck said, we are familiar with this system from the cooperation that has taken place in the Baltic.
Since March 1998, the Baltic Recommendation has taken such a system for granted.
I should like to say, however, that the agreement is in certain respects a disappointment in the perspective of what has happened in the Baltic.
I should also like to refer to the law we have passed in Finland which stipulates that the fee ought not to depend upon how much waste the vessel leaves at the port.
In Finland, we have had such a system for waste oil since 1 June.
In that respect, the agreement is a disappointment.
In the last few days, we have learned that, even when it comes to grey water and pollution which is eutrophic in its effects, intentional and unintentional discharges from vessels are the main sources of pollution in the Baltic.
We are used to the fact that the polluter-pays principle does not operate in the case of oil, but there are problems too when it comes to eutrophy caused in other ways.
We are aware that everyone has been exposed to tough lobbying from the port organisation in Europe which has consistently set its face against this proposal.
The outcome is, therefore, nonetheless a good one.
However, it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal.
The Commissioner is known to have a major interest in the sea and in obtaining a clean environment.
It is important that the follow-up should be carried out seriously so that any supplementary measures can be taken, if need be.
This is a first step, but I would observe that it is important that we should have stricter conditions for the Baltic, which is perhaps far and away the most sensitive inland sea in Europe.
Mr President, the report by Mr Bouwman, which is the outcome of a long process, has in the interim become even more topical in France because of the shipwreck of the tanker, the Erika, on the occasion of which the Minister for the Environment did not see fit to interrupt his holiday.
This report goes some way to preventing marine pollution because it deals with ships that discharge waste at sea.
These acts are not covered by the media in the same way as shipwrecks, but they nevertheless make up most of the pollution of our seas.
We must however recognise that Community legislation would not be necessary if the Member States of the European Union, who are all signatories to Marpol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, had taken the necessary steps.
Nor is it enough to accuse unscrupulous shipowners or captains; we must bear in mind that it is often impossible to discharge waste inside the ports, due to the lack of appropriate facilities. The problem of waste storage is also extremely difficult to solve, as this in turn gives rise to the problem of waste treatment.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that, in an age when agricultural installations are monitored by satellite, it is so difficult to monitor a ship discharging waste at sea.
We will, however, vote for this report, because it seems to be moving towards better prevention of pollution and because, wishing to remain at a general level, it leaves Member States a certain latitude in their choice of implementation tools.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to be here today to participate in the debate on the approval of the directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues.
Like previous speakers, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, on the excellent work he has done.
During this time he has combined steadfastness with flexibility and intelligence to achieve a result which is acceptable to all the institutions and which will serve to make our seas cleaner.
I must tell you, for example, that this summer, one of the items in the news in the country I know best, Spain, involved the southern coastlines being affected by the pollution resulting from oil tankers cleaning our their holds in international waters.
This is one of the 100 000 cases which occur throughout the year on Europe' s coastlines.
What we have to do is find out how we can, if not end, then at least limit as far as possible, given the capacity we have, these harmful effects on our seas. In order to end it, we would have to reconsider Maritime Law which, to a large extent, originates from the maritime situation of the 17th and 18th Centuries, which bore no relation to the current situation.
I believe we have made a great deal of progress which will noticeably improve the marine environment in the face of the deliberate contamination by certain ships - because not all of them do this sort of thing - of our coastlines.
The current version of this directive has the support of everybody.
It has the support of the shipowners because it provides them with waste facilities, which already exist in some European ports but unfortunately not in all of them, particularly not in the smaller ports, where the Member States will have to make significant investments.
This version of the directive has the support of the ports, because it means that their investments in this type of facility will not put them at a competitive disadvantage, which has unfortunately been the case at times, since some ports have made considerable efforts and others have not.
It has the support of those sectors which are most sensitive to the problem of residues and the fight for sustainable development.
I believe that the whole of this House and also the representatives of the Council and the Commission are included in this group, not only the ecologists, but all those who are concerned about this type of problem.
We believe that issues such as the planning of residue management, the ships' delivery obligations, prior notification, the controls - 25% of the controls -, fees which incentivise the use of port facilities for cleaning the holds of ships, will necessarily contribute to a reduction in marine pollution.
This directive, of course, enjoys the support of the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, because we know that it will mean something positive for our citizens.
It would have been very sad if we had been unable to reach this agreement, which was so longed-for by everyone.
I would like to thank the Council for its flexibility and its constructive will, and Parliament also, especially the rapporteur, for the work carried out over this period and during the conciliation procedure.
The Commission has obtained some commitments which have helped this agreement. These commitments enable us to specify that "significant" means that at least 30% of the costs of the cleaning of holds in ports must be covered in a general sense, whether or not these port facilities are used.
If over the next three years we see that the Member States' actions are not sufficient and the desired results are not obtained, the Commission reserves the right to present a new directive clearly establishing a minimum percentage which must be covered by the general fees or by an obligatory cleaning fee in the various European ports.
It is also the Commission' s responsibility to verify that that control of 25%, another key element of this directive, is carried out by the Member States.
I would like once again to thank Parliament for standing firm on the need for a strengthened mechanism for reviewing the fees system, which will undoubtedly allow us to move forward and make a detailed study of the current system which we have implemented and the consequences for the environment.
Mr President, it has already been said in the debates that we have suffered from the impact of the Erika tragedy, but the cleaning out of holds is equivalent to more than one Erika each year on Europe' s coastlines.
We are, therefore, taking a great step forward today.
This does not mean that we are not going to move forward on issues relating to oil tankers and safety in the transport of polluting materials, such as oil and its derivatives, issues which we hope will not only make progress in this House and the Council, but which will also be supplemented by means of additional initiatives which, as the Commission has stated, will be presented shortly.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)
Madam President, can I impose on your goodwill and Parliament's goodwill for a moment in welcoming to the diplomatic gallery a delegation from Kazakhstan?
They are in Parliament today and tomorrow to raise awareness of the former Soviet empire's nuclear testing programme which impacted not just severely but hugely on their country.
They had 607 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere between 1949 and 1990.
This has left part of their country completely devastated and I hope Parliament will give them a sympathetic hearing in the seminar they are holding here this afternoon.
They have a huge problem in raising world awareness of this former Soviet problem.
We shall also be discussing the problems of the submarine that sank, another part of the nuclear legacy that has been left by the Soviet Union.
Thank you, Mr Provan. I am very happy to welcome this delegation.

Before the start of the vote
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour to table a motion to refer this report to committee pursuant to Rule 144 of our Rules of Procedure.
I shall not go back over the arrangements relating to the debate, but I nevertheless believe that the Commission needs to re-examine this report.
It is no secret that the rapporteur who was initially designated, Mrs Klamt, finally withdrew and did not want her name to be associated with this report, which meant that it was presented by Mr Watson.
I take the view that there are three areas of uncertainty which warrant referral to committee. Firstly, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of reunification.
Is it open to permanent residents, to refugees, to temporary residents?
Secondly, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of family. Are we talking about nuclear families, legitimate families, extended families, polygamous families, cohabiting families ...
(Mixed reactions) But ladies and gentlemen, this list is the result of your own interventions.
As you have even asked for 'homosexual' families to be included, I do not see why you are protesting.
Finally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of the chekcs as set out in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Should checks be carried out on the basis of presumption, or on well-founded presumption?
Should it be targeted or random?
All these definitions must be clarified and that is why, Madam President, I have the honour of tabling this motion for referral to committee.
We have a speaker to oppose the motion.
Madam President, I cannot understand what the PPE wants.
I understand that some Members are against the directive we are going to vote on, but the vote in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms was in favour of this directive by a clear majority.
This morning we held a very fruitful debate with the Commissioner and I believe that, almost a year after the Tampere Summit, not to approve the first proposed directive on harmonisation in justice and internal affairs in the field of immigration, presented to us by the Commission, would be inexplicable and there is no justification for it.
I understand that there are Members who are totally against the right of immigrants to live as families, but that is not the majority position of this House, as was reflected in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms.
I therefore ask that we go ahead with the vote on this Commission proposal.
Thank you, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
I will ask our rapporteur to express an opinion, if he wishes.
.
Madam President, I oppose referral back to committee.
I note that nobody from Mr Gollnisch's group at any point in the committee raised any questions about the definition of regroupment, or of family, or of control.
This matter has been debated fully in committee and debated here in plenary this morning.
I see no reason not to proceed to a vote.
I owe you an apology, Madam President, because I suspect you do not have in front of you the view of the rapporteur on all of the different amendments.
If that is the case I would very happily, before the vote, explain to the House my position on the amendments put forward by the committee.
But as for the amendments put forward for plenary, because they have been the subject of last minute debate, I will leave all of those to the wisdom of the House.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
That is very clear.
(Parliament rejected the request for referral to committee)
Before the vote on the Commission proposal
Madam President, forgive me for butting in at this point.
I have a question for Mr Vitorino before we come to the final vote.
You said this morning that you would endorse Amendment No 19 at today 's vote.
I just wanted to confirm that you will indeed accept Amendment No 19.
Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he would advise us which of the amendments which have been adopted this morning he will accept before the final vote on the legislative resolution.
Madam President, I have to say that the vote was conducted at such a speed that I was hard pressed to keep up with your capacity to reach a decision.
On the amendments that have been adopted, the Commission has its doubts about Amendment No 9, and I believe we should reconsider our position.
I promise to think about it.
As far as Amendment No 19 is concerned, which has been adopted, and which seeks to keep refugees within the scope of the draft directive, but to exclude from this directive on the right to family reunification people who benefit from temporary protection or subsidiary protection, I maintain the position that I expressed before this House during the debate.
We believe that we must keep within the scope of this directive only the refugees who are recognised by the Geneva Convention.
Issues regarding the family reunification of people benefiting from temporary protection and subsidiary protection must be examined in an autonomous legal instrument that the Commission, by the way, is currently preparing, and which it will present to Parliament and the Council next year.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0658/2000) by Mr LuÃ­s QueirÃ³, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on EU external action priorities
Before the start of the vote
Madam President, given that a political group which did not participate in the negotiations of the text in question has signed the text, I would ask you, before the vote takes place, to give the appropriate instructions to the relevant administration service so that this kind of abuse does not happen again.
We must accept that all the groups have the right to express themselves in the House, but the text, in principle, belongs to the groups which negotiated it.
If anybody wants to attach themselves to it, they must have the agreement of all the groups which have produced the text.
Madam President, the compromise procedure is an ad hoc procedure that is not covered by the rules of our Parliament.
But once a text has been tabled, it is up to any Members who wish to do so to adopt it.
I therefore think that the objection raised by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is not a valid one.
Madam President, the MEPs and groups have the opportunity to express themselves in the House, but the proposal belongs to those who produced it and must not be unduly appropriated, since this may give rise to confusion over such an important issue and over possible unwanted alliances with the far right.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, as you know, there is no Rule of Procedure that specifies this detail, but it is customary that those who have presented the text agree to sign it.
This has always been the case in this House.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on EU external action priorities
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change
Before the start of the vote
Madam President, I would like to ask my colleagues in the PPE Group and the ELDR Group if they intend to maintain their motion for a resolution, which contains flagrant untruths.
The discussion we had yesterday evening showed that both the Commission and the Council support the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change.
Moreover, Madam President, you yourself requested it at the European Council in Lisbon on our behalf.
We cannot vote on a resolution when the groups say that neither the Council nor the Commission approves of the idea of creating a monitoring centre for industrial change.
It is a flagrant untruth and I believe that it is only logical that both groups should withdraw their motion for a resolution.
I do not see any sign of them doing so.
Yes, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, you have the floor.
Madam President, the stir which the Bouwman report has caused shows quite well the chaos European decision-making finds itself in and what kind of complex compromises are being struck as a result.
Parliament was divided between supporters of two different solutions.
Eventually, a majority was achieved for one of the solutions, a majority which also encompassed the Group of the European United Left.
In normal administrative relations, this decision by Parliament would be final; not so in the European Union.
A conciliation procedure had to take place.
This procedure between the Council and Parliament resulted in a compromise which is rather noncommittal as long as it is not accompanied by a Commission statement.
This statement explains how the Commission interprets the word "substantial" in Article 8 (1).
Substantial appears to mean 30% here, but this cannot be made explicit in the text itself.
From the outset, there was a battle between a majority which supported 90% and a minority which was in favour of 0%.
This has now resulted in a percentage which is nearer to 0 than 90 and which may not be made public.
Everyone is now agreed that ship' s waste and cargo residues can no longer be discharged at sea but there is substantial disagreement about how this ship' s waste is to be collected and, more to the point, how this collection should be funded.
Around the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, preference was given to funding based on a general levy for each ship. This should prevent anyone from seeking financial gain by not delivering waste at officially designated sites.
Around the Mediterranean Sea, however, there was preference for payment according to the waste collected.
Instead of developing both systems separately to start with and comparing the respective environmental effects, attempts are now being forced through to arrive at one solution for all.
This is prejudicing the northern model.
It would be better if, instead of applying an overall EU solution, this matter could be regulated according to which particular sea was involved.
Without the European Union, it would have been easier to reach an agreement between groups of separate countries for each sea. In this case, the presence of the European Union is not conducive to finding a joint, cross-border solution.
Despite this, my group has voted in favour because this regulation is better than nothing.
I hope a review will take place within the next couple of years so that the original intentions of the Bouwman report can be brought to bear.
Madam President, pensioners and the elderly like the sea to be clean and so, as representative of the Pensioners' Party to Parliament, I voted for the directive which aims to clean up the sea, especially in the vicinity of ports.
I still remember what used to happen when, as a child, I used to go swimming in the sea in Genoa, my native city.
We would often come back up the beach covered in tar like the character in the washing powder advertisement, Calimero, who is always black all over and rightly complains about this.
This directive at last provides for waste collection from ships as they berth in ports, and this is a positive step.
I voted for the report, although it would have been better to regulate what goes on in the Mediterranean ports of the other States as well.
We give so much money to the countries which border on the Mediterranean through programmes such as MEDA: we should request that they set up waste collection systems in their ports as well!

I had the opportunity to express my views on this subject during the March part-session. At the time, it was a very topical subject, as the debate on marine safety in the wake of the wreck of the Erika was at its fiercest.
Today, the debate is calmer, but no less important.
The people of Europe are deeply concerned about the pollution of the seas and the coastlines of the Member States.
The European Parliament echoed these legitimate concerns and amended the directive proposed by the European Commission on the management of waste discharged by ships in such a way as to make Member States aware of their responsibilities.
As an alternative to the principle that the polluter pays, which has proved to be ineffective, Parliament suggested establishing a system whereby all ships would pay a fee whenever they called at a port, whether they used the waste disposal facilities or not.
This fee would help finance 90% of the cost of these facilities.
This system would encourage ships to deliver their ship-generated waste and cargo residues to the port reception facilities rather than discharge them at sea.
It was clear that the Council would not accept such a proposal.
The discussion was then continued, quite logically, within the Conciliation Committee.
Those negotiating on behalf of Parliament and the Council reached the following agreement: all ships calling at a port of a Member State shall contribute significantly (a statement from the Commission annexed to the text considers that this means at least 30% of the costs), irrespective of actual use of the facilities.
The share of the costs which is not covered by that fee, if any, shall be covered on the basis of the types and quantities of ship-generated waste actually offloaded by the ship.
In addition, the Commission shall, within three years of the implementation, submit a report evaluating the impact of the variety of cost recovery systems on the marine environment.
It will, if necessary in the light of this evaluation, submit a proposal to amend this directive by the introduction of a system involving the payment of an appropriate percentage, of no less than one third of the costs of port reception facilities, by all ships calling at a port of a Member State irrespective of actual use of the facilities.
I am satisfied with the compromise we have reached.
This directive is a significant step in establishing a more effective strategy to protect the marine environment.

We are now in the final stages of drawing up this draft directive. Although I am not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the conciliation procedure, I nevertheless accept this compromise which, I am bound to say, is to the credit of the European Parliament and to its skill and maturity in dealing with the legislative process of the European Union.
Aware of the unacceptability of discharging waste at sea and the behaviour of crews who profit from a dramatic accident to discharge their own waste with total impunity, thereby adding to the pollution of the seas, the European Commission proposed focussing its action on installing reception facilities for ship-generated waste in European ports.
All ports must be equipped with such facilities and, in addition, all ships calling at one of these ports must pay a fee towards the cost of collecting and treating this waste, irrespective of actual use of the facilities. Parliament took the view that this fee should cover 90% of the cost but, following the compromise reached with the Council, this was reduced to at least 30%.
This is just a first step. It recognises the polluter-pays principle.
It is a necessary step, but it does not go far enough.
Let us make no bones about it.
If we really want to clean up our oceans and preserve the natural balance for future generations, we must take more radical measures, especially concerning payment for these facilities and the need to avoid distortions in competition between ports. In a word, we must establish a public service for the treatment of waste.
For the time being, I can only recommend that Parliament accepts the results of this conciliation procedure.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is satisfied that, at the suggestion of the rapporteur, who is a member of the group, tighter controls are going to be placed on the establishment of port reception facilities for ship-generated waste.
In particular, it is important that a tax is imposed on each ship to cover at least 30% of the cost of these facilities.
It is not a question of creating 'ecological boats' that are able to treat all their waste at sea, essentially by means of incineration. Such conduct, which cannot realistically be controlled, in fact enables antipollution legislation to be bypassed: allegedly incinerated hydrocarbons and domestic waste are discharged into the sea; there is no selectivity and this only adds to the greenhouse effect.
These proposals are in line with the proposals of the next marine pollution control Directive, for which I shall be drawing up the report on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Furthermore, they provide for the homogeneous behaviour of ships within European maritime space, and they go some way to establishing the necessary facilities in European ports and to financing these facilities.
These provisions must be accompanied by rigorous control and the behaviour of ships must be monitored using the Equasis and Galileo systems, the speedy implementation of which the French Presidency has resolved to promote.
Morillon recommendation (A5-0206/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the recommendation.
I went to Turkey as a tourist this summer to visit the city discovered by Henrich Schliemann, the mythical Troy of the Iliad. While I was there, an elderly Turkish pensioner who had recognised me approached me and, while we visited the ruins of Troy together, he asked: "But why is it that, when the Morillon directive was debated, the amendments requesting Turkey not to build nuclear power stations or, at least, to ensure that its nuclear power stations do not cause pollution, to resolve the Kurd issue and to abolish the death penalty were not adopted?
Why was it that these points were not incorporated into the document?"
This is my minor criticism of the document we have voted on.
Madam President, I voted against the recommendation because I feel that the provision of aid was not made sufficiently conditional upon a genuine renewal of the Turkish State, genuine safeguarding of human rights and genuine protection of minors.
Of course, countries who are in need of aid should receive assistance, but, on the other hand, it is appropriate to ask them to respect these principles first.
The European Parliament must insist on the three amendments:
on excluding nuclear energy in the earthquake region of Turkey, as far as the system of production is concerned;
on protecting cultural identity and abolishing the death penalty;
on contributing to the solution of the Kurdish problem.
That is why I voted for these amendments.
I believe however that the European Parliament should not have changed its stance on the amendments of the first reading: Article 5 (criteria for Turkey' s accession), Article 15 (suspension of cooperation with Turkey if there are obstacles to the issues of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the protection or minorities), Article 35 (annual report on the protection of democratic principles, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, compliance with international law).
Unfortunately, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union crumbled under pressure from the Council, which is promoting an unprincipled realpolitik with the Turkish regime, thereby depriving Turkish citizens of a boost towards democracy, which could be given by the European Union.
The integration of Turkey into the European Union is naturally of considerable interest to European big business, for which the European institutions, including Parliament, are the mouthpieces.
The European Parliament could at least take advantage of the parallel desire of the Turkish Government to enter the European Union to demand such basic measures as the abolition of the death penalty, democratic freedoms and the cessation of the repression of the Kurdish people.
But, even in these areas, the report uses wordings so toned-down that they mean absolutely nothing. Their avowed concern is not to 'offend any sensibilities' .
The sensibility that must not be offended above all is that of the Turkish government, which bombs, devastates and tortures the Kurdish population.
And, whilst the rapporteur of the European Parliament struggles to find a way of highlighting human rights without upsetting the soldiers who trample them underfoot, a Franco-German-Belgian consortium, as was recently reported in the press, is preparing to supply Turkey with a munitions factory.
This is infinitely more revealing of the true nature of the relations between European big business and the Turkish dictatorship than all the insipid claptrap on which we are asked to give our opinion.
During this part-session, the European Parliament has plumbed the depths of hypocrisy.
In the space of 24 hours, you are going to approve a financial package of tens of millions of euros for Turkey and condemn this self-same country for bombing the Kurdish populations of northern Iraq, in violation of another country' s airspace.
And when I say condemn, I greatly exaggerate the import not only of the text but also of your intentions.
What has happened to the respect for human rights, which must condition who the European Union helps or cooperates with, and which you adapt to suit your own ends?
In this particular case, it seems to have sunk without trace and your conscience seems to change with the wind.
It is time your deeds reflected your words.
That would be a pleasant change and, above all, it would give European policy greater coherence and authority.
SchÃ¶rling report (A5-0196/2000)
Madam President, I voted for this report which introduces strategic environmental assessments and therefore provides for particular focus on environmental issues when public works are being built, for I support all that contributes to the beauty of nature and countryside etc., which is important for pensioners as well.
Nonetheless, the report does have some shortcomings.
When States decide to build public works, it should be left to the State in question to decide without excessive regulation whether a public works project is sufficiently environmentally friendly. This is because public works need to be erected rapidly and elderly pensioners do not have time to wait too long!
This text has been lurking the procedural labyrinth for nigh on 5 years.
Although we did not support the amendment aimed at rejecting the Directive, our aim was clearly not to reward those who, in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, had worked on this text for years.
We are not here to legitimise the often strange desires of the technocrats in Brussels to legislate on anything and everything.
We rejected this amendment because companies need a clear framework within which to act.
The sticking point is the scope of the directive, that is, the very definition of the 'plans and programmes' .
The mandatory part of the scope applies to plans and programmes supporting authorisations for projects in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, waste management, water management, telecommunications, tourism, town and country planning or land use.
This mandatory part is supplemented by a selection mechanism, so-called 'screening' , undertaken on the initiative of the Member States (the non-mandatory part).
I acknowledge that protecting the environment and taking it into consideration when evaluating policies is a necessity and even an obligation.
But the Member States, in the name of subsidiarity, are in a better position to ensure that this is carried out properly. We will not support amendments aimed at enlarging the scope of application of the directive, as it must be limited to the plans and programmes that are likely to have significant repercussions.
How annoying it is when attempts are made on all sides to give greater powers to the European Union at the expense of the Member States.
In this case, under the guise of concern for the environment, the rapporteur wants to take charge of all the policies of the Member States.
The importance of taking the environment into consideration when evaluating policies is not in doubt, but to apply the same procedure to it, especially one that is imposed by the European Union, is inconceivable.
We have confidence in the Member States and we defend the common position. The 'environment' alibi is nothing more than the instrument the European Union uses to extend its control in all policy areas.
We are well aware of the powers of the Union, and we know its arsenal.
It uses the environment to infiltrate everywhere; it uses our water pipes to spread its tentacles into national policy.
We say no to this.
Like a number of other delegations, France has stated clearly that it does want the scope of application to be extended to national policies.
Valdivielso de CuÃ© report (A5-0204/2000)
Madam President, I voted for this document, tabled by Mr Valdivielso de CuÃ©, on the new regulation on the MEDA programme.
I am wholeheartedly in favour - and not just because I am here representing Italy - of all initiatives which bring the Mediterranean countries closer together.
Better still, I would like to see an increase in the MEDA regulation' s financial appropriations.
In my own small way, I have created an association of pensioners' parties from the Mediterranean states in order to emphasise how important the Mediterranean is for Europe and the countries bordering on Europe, since countries in Africa and the East which are on the Mediterranean border on Europe too.
This is why I voted for this report.
European Union policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean is geared not only towards developing these countries but also towards increasing the influence of big business.
And these are indeed the purposes served by the MEDA funding programme.
The creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area has no other purpose than to make it easier for European industrial products to infiltrate the markets of these countries and to simultaneously place the riches of these countries under their predatory regimes.
Appeals to the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and human rights are nothing more than the European Union' s customary excuse for meddling in the domestic affairs of other countries.
The structural adjustments that are reinforced from within MEDA are primarily aimed at imposing on these countries the laws of the marketplace and domination by the economically powerful.
The end result is that these countries sink even more deeply into the mire of underdevelopment and become satellites of the European Union due to unequal partnership agreements.
The Communist Party of Greece is a strong advocate of cooperation between peoples based on equal conditions and without interference by one country in the domestic affairs of another.
It especially emphasises the responsibility of developed, capitalist countries for creating the current situation in underdeveloped countries, which is a result of its continuous pillaging of these countries.
This is one more reason for developed countries to help underdeveloped countries to develop their productive base and to increase the standard of living of their inhabitants.
As both the previous MEDA programme and the proposed amendments fall far short of the above-mentioned objectives, the MEPs from the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report by Mr Valdivieslo de CuÃ©.
Europe is going to expand eastwards.
This is written in Agenda 2000.
But Europe has a fluid border to the south, conditioned by its geography.
Boats and rafts arrive along its borders in southern Italy and southern Spain.
They are loaded and sometimes overloaded with Albanians, Turks, Muslims - men, women and children from all the countries around the Mediterranean.
It is a tidal wave that is going to grow year by year.
Europe is going to be submerged, even though at El Elejido in 1999 and in just a few other places, the settled populations have reacted against this flood of nomads.
Not wanting any roll back and unable to achieve containment, European leaders are logically seeking to prevent these nomads from leaving their home countries.
And this is the aim of the common-sense MEDA programme.
Sketched out at the European Summit in Cannes in June 1995, established by the Barcelona Conference of November 1995 in the form of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and implemented by the MEDA Regulation of 23 July 1996, this Mediterranean policy of the European Union is based on a few regional and national investment projects.
It is a meagre amount: EUR 3.3 billion from 1995 to 1999, from Morocco to Gaza and the West Bank, even if, by adding to it the EUR 3.6 million in loans from the European Investment Bank, the financial contribution is greater than the EUR 4.4 billion given by the World Bank.
It is a meagre amount, not only because, in reality, these EUR 3.6 billion in commitment loans are in fact reduced to a collective payment of just EUR 648 million, but also because this step is not commensurate with the size of the problem.
Admittedly, it is good to have moved from bilateral aid to a global, multilateral approach.
Admittedly, for 2000-2006, MEDA II will increase loans of less than 47.1% to arrive at a financial package of EUR 8.5 billion.
European farmers would be happy with an increase that was twice, three times less than that.
But that does not constitute a Mediterranean policy.
A Mediterranean policy is not more programmes and more officials in Brussels to manage them.
A Mediterranean policy that is up to the demographic, environmental, climatic, Islamic and cultural challenge is a grand strategic vision, establishing, integrating, stabilising and organising the Mediterranean around original and intergovernmental institutions with major common sectors to explore: water, the environment, migration, deforestation and so on.
Under these conditions, and with a method and integrated institutions such as a High Secretariat for the Mediterranean, one can talk of a budget, as there will be strategic projects and not tactical sprinklings of small amounts.
But we must act quickly, very quickly, before a colonised Europe has nothing more to share than the decline of peoples who have been deprived of their culture.
The partnership between the EU and the southern Mediterranean States comprises a range of positive elements.
It should be further developed and deepened.
However, the report on the reform of the MEDA programme does not set the right tone on a number of counts.
The European Union is fixated with the idea of concluding free trade agreements with the southern Mediterranean countries, although, paradoxically, they only have a one-sided liberalising effect.
Such agreements have a particularly negative impact on the financially disadvantaged, as existing free trade agreements have shown.
The report concedes that free trade agreements carry this risk.
Why else would it describe, and call for, support measures, with a view to alleviating the negative impact of free trade?
If the risks attending the free trade strategy are acknowledged, but it is pursued nevertheless, then the social, environmental and cultural components of the programme will only ever have repair and damage limitation status, when they ought to be the guiding principle for such agreements.
Furthermore, in order to qualify for subsidies, the MEDA countries must satisfy the Bretton Woods institutions (for example the IMF).
These self-same programmes are notorious for having anti-social strategies directed purely at liberalisation.
The aim of the EU-Mediterranean partnership must be to redress the balance between the northern and southern regions of the Mediterranean area, improve people' s quality of life and promote understanding between the inhabitants of the various regions.
But if free trade becomes the guiding principle, these goals will become nothing more than window dressing, and a handful of wealthy people will once again be the ones to benefit.
I also protest against the fact that the EU-Mediterranean partnership is being misused as an instrument in order to prevent people from migrating from this region to the EU.
For a while now, the European Union has had the 'fight against illegal immigration' and the 'repatriation of 'illegal' refugees written as objectives into treaties with the Mediterranean States, as well as into every agreement with one or more third countries.
In this way, each individual agreement adds one more brick to fortress Europe.
This report is another example of the EU policy of pulling up the drawbridge where immigrants and refugees are concerned.
The countries of the southern Mediterranean region have been declared as the forecourts to fortress Europe.
It is their duty to ensure that 'undesirable persons' do not get into the EU.
I ask myself how the EU can insist on the partner states in the Mediterranean showing respect for human rights and the freedom of the individual, when it does not respect the rights of immigrants itself, gives these people illegal status and wants to keep them away from Europe at any price, even if it leads to their being killed.
This report safeguards, once again, the free movement of goods, services and capital.
Once again, freedom and human rights are trampled underfoot.
I will therefore vote against it, despite the fact that it contains a number of positive elements.
I voted in favour of Mr Valdivielso de CuÃ©' s report, because the Euro-Mediterranean partnership must be based on a MEDA programme that is fully efficient and successful.
As Member for a town that looks on to the Mediterranean, I hope that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is given comparable resources for the period 2000-2006 to those given to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In implementing the MEDA programme, the simplification proposed by the European Commission and intensified by this report are beneficial.
If we consider the appropriation of funds in the first MEDA programme, how can we justify the fact that only a quarter of the appropriations have actually been paid and that it takes an average of four years for payments to be made?
This kind of problem harms our credibility on the international scene and gives European taxpayers a terrible impression of the way in which Community institutions use public funds.
We cannot be satisfied with such a record.
The best we can do now is to back the amendments proposed by the European Commission.
Aid to Mediterranean countries must be provided quickly and efficiently, in line with the European Union' s political priorities.
Mr Valdivielso de CuÃ©' s report, which proposes that the administration and management of projects should be decentralised, that the MED committee should be given new guidelines, and which insists on improving cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, makes a significant contribution to improving MEDA.
Increasing the European Parliament' s participation in MEDA' s decision-making process is another point that I believe to be crucial.
I also deplore the fact that, on an issue as important as changing the MEDA regulation, Parliament only has the right to state its opinion by means of the consultation procedure.
With the amendments that we are proposing in this report, the MEDA programme will have simplified, decentralised and transparent implementation procedures.
I now hope that the Community budget will provide this programme with financial resources that match up to the political ambitions that we are publicly stating for the Mediterranean area.
The European Commission has committed itself to increasing MEDA' s staffing levels, with a view to reaching similar levels of human resources enjoyed by other major programmes such as PHARE and TACIS.
When it comes to looking at the budget for 2001, the European Parliament must ensure that this commitment is translated into action.
With regard to the appropriations allocated to the MEDA programme, I hope that the financial package reflects the political will - which the Council and Parliament have both been trumpeting - to make the Euro-Mediterranean partnership one of our priorities for external action.
Amending the MEDA regulation with a view to improving the decision-making process and simplifying the procedure for implementing projects is an important stage in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
I shall do my best to ensure that the vote on the MEDA budget is another stage confirming the importance we attach to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reports (A5-0194 and A5-0188/2000)
Madam President, I voted for Mr Varela' s report on the Republic of Guinea fisheries agreement, even if prawns and tuna will not look very favourably on this report which regulates catching them.
I gave Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n my opinion when we were talking about the Canary Islands, and he quite rightly said: "Yes, but prawns do not vote, besides which I am a fisherman."
Madam President, this report has shortcomings, in that it gives money to the Republic of Guinea, on the one hand, to help replenish fish stocks and reduce the number of fish caught, and, on the other, to send European Union fishing boats to those seas to catch prawns and tuna.
Well, I think that this is a form of colonialism which must be stopped.
With regard to Mr Varela' s second report, on the Mauritius fisheries agreement, I did indeed vote in favour, Madam President, but I must emphasise that it was not an easy decision.
Why?
Because the Committee on Development and Cooperation tabled an amendment asking for fishermen' s wages and, I would add, their pensions to be monitored.
Unfortunately, this amendment was not adopted.
Now, with this document, we are about to conclude a trade agreement, and we are giving away Union funds but are not requesting to be able to monitor the fishermen' s contracts.
In my view, that is not a good move.
Watson report (A5-0201/2000)
Madam President, I would like to explain the votes on behalf of the ELDR Group.
Our overriding objective was to get this very important report through as the first report communitarising European Community immigration laws and as a matter of justice to third-country nationals.
We have therefore shown solidarity with other like-minded groups and Members.
We supported the Socialist Group amendments to remove beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in the light of the Commissioner's pledge to bring forward a proposal covering them as well as beneficiaries of temporary protection.
We would have preferred beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to stay in as a matter of principle, because they are long-term legal residents, but we decided to assist the passage of the report.
Similarly, we abstained on matters concerning ascending relatives, because, wherever possible, we wish to remove objections so as to secure a clear majority for the report and recognise that the inclusion of such relatives raises particular problems for some Members.
Some of us in my group, however, would have liked us to express a more generous stance.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mrs van der Laan have asked me specifically to mention them in this connection.
My group has deliberately voted to include unmarried partners if the Member State concerned legally recognises such partnerships, as I think three currently do.
We think it to be only justice not to interfere with a domestic decision on legal recognition of such partnerships.
Madam President, I voted against the Watson report, as did the whole of the Group of the European People' s Party, not just because the amendments tabled by the group - of which I have the pleasure of being a member - were not adopted, but also because the pensioners are tired of seeing European Union territory increasingly filling up with third-country nationals who do not have the means to live.
This document lays down that relatives of immigrants who live in certain European Union Member States may come and join their relatives - which is excellent and I agree with this - if the latter have an income equal to the minimum social security pension.
But just one person living on the minimum social security pension goes hungry.
How can an immigrant with such a low income make all his relatives go hungry?
Although the Watson report on the proposal for a directive on family reunification is excessively liberal, it has just been adopted by the European Parliament, with a large majority of 323 votes to 212.
This vote shows just how European MEPs and the Commission, which drafted the original proposal, are both failing in their main duty, which is not to satisfy the whole world, but to protect Europe' s citizens.
This vote also confirms what we have always said about communitising immigration policy by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is being applied here to the particular case of family reunification by means of Article 63(3) of the Treaty on European Union: the transfer of decision-making powers from national level to European level is being used not to strengthen nations, as some have claimed in order to deceive voters, but instead to demolish their defences more completely.
The proposal for a directive on family reunification, as approved by the Watson report, proclaims a Community-level law on family reunification which, in legal terms, does not yet exist at this level and which, in our opinion, should not be made law.
The truth is that the host State does not force the immigrants to move there.
This is a decision taken by the immigrant himself, and if he is received into that State, it is not his place to claim the right to bring in other people.
One notes, moreover, that the preamble to the proposal for a directive refers virtuously to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the international covenant of 1966, which recognise that "the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State" .
At the same time, the so-called Convention which is drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union is stubbornly refusing to take this principle into consideration.
It appears then that recognition of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society is useful when it serves to justify family reunification, but is no longer useful when it could serve to support European families.
The proposal for a directive approved by the Watson report is not content to proclaim this non-existent law.
It gives the title 'applicant' not only to legal immigrants but also to people who have refugee status.
Moreover, the beneficiaries of family reunification are not just the applicant's spouse and children under 18, but also the unmarried partner who is in a stable relationship with the applicant, which will include homosexual couples when the Member State' s legislation treats them in the same way as married couples for legal purposes.
The directive also includes children of full age who cannot reasonably look after themselves, as well as the relatives in the ascending line of the applicant, their spouse, or even of their unmarried partner.
It is quite clear that the floodgates are open wide and that the aim is to encourage immigration on a massive scale that will change the very nature of European societies.
The political classes in each country could probably not have voted for such a text, because they are too closely watched by the public.
They have therefore shifted the responsibility over to Brussels, which is now forced to do their dirty work behind closed doors That is the real job of Europe today.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament welcome the initiative concerning common rules for family reunification, although we have nonetheless voted against a number of points, including the one-year rule.
As a result of this and in view of the Danish reservation in the legal sphere, the Danish Social Democrats have declined to vote in favour of the final proposal.
The MEPs of the Left regret that, because of the Danish reservation, the Danish Government has not been able to influence the directive and is the only government not to have the right of veto, just as we regret the fact that, unlike other countries, Denmark will not make more demands of immigrants to Denmark who wish to reunite their families and require them to be self-supporting and to have somewhere to live.
The draft Directive' s proposal concerning the right to family reunification after one year would not be any problem if, in common with other countries, Denmark were to make such demands, as expressly laid down in the draft directive.
In that case, it would not be the local authorities' task to support and find homes for the people concerned, as it is at present.
As matters stand, the one-year rule cannot, however, be practised in Denmark without significant problems.
We therefore decline to vote on the report, regretfully because we should like to see a common policy, especially in the field of asylum.
.
(FR) Following the progress made at the Tampere European Council in October 1999 on a European area of freedom, security and justice, and at a time when we are discussing the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the report we are debating today is of the utmost importance.
It concerns the issue of family reunification.
This right is currently only recognised by international legal instruments, specifically the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950.
At national level, situations are extremely disparate.
Family reunification enables the family unit to be protected and makes the integration of third-country nationals into Member States easier.
It was therefore crucial to incorporate the law on family reunification into Community legislation.
The European Commission' s proposal therefore sets out to establish a law on family reunification for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in a Member State, as long as they fulfil a certain number of financial and procedural conditions.
I welcome the work of my fellow Members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, who have made a considerable effort to combat the extremely limiting and conservative vision of the first rapporteur.
They have produced a text that is close to the European Commission' s basic proposal which, in my opinion, is on the whole quite satisfactory.
Consequently, those belonging to one of the following categories will benefit from the law on family reunification:
third-country nationals who are legally resident in the territory of a Member State and who have a residence permit, which is valid for at least one year.
refugees, regardless of how long their residence permit is valid, or European Union citizens not exercising their right to free movement.
Those entitled to claim family reunification are:
the spouse or non-married partner of the applicant (including same-sex partners); although it should be noted that the provision covering non-married partners only applies in Member States where the position of non-married couples is comparable to that of married couples;
the children of the couple, whether they are married or not, and whether they are born within marriage, out of wedlock or are from a previous marriage;
the children of one of the spouses or partners are covered, on condition that the latter have actual custody and responsibility;
relatives in the ascending line, when these people are in the applicant' s care as well as children of full age who are also dependants.
I speak on behalf of myself and my 28 colleagues from the British Labour Party.
We have been pleased to vote and to support this report even though, for a variety of reasons, the United Kingdom Government has exercised its right to opt out of this initiative.
As members will be aware, the UK Government was party to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.
There are, however, various practical points and issues regarding sovereignty which the UK takes very seriously and which means it is not appropriate or possible for the United Kingdom to be included at this time.
However this does not lessen the commitment of our Government to the principles of the report and the underlying values inherent therein.
Indeed it is the government's stated intention that the UK should not be seriously out of line with our European partners in this important area of immigration policy.
Labour MEPs have therefore voted in favour of this report and remain supporters of the principles of family reunification.
Of all the countries in the European Union, it is Luxembourg that has the highest proportion of foreign nationals amongst its population, i.e. 37%.
The majority of these foreign nationals, i.e. 87%, are from EU countries.
However, for some time now, the proportion of immigrants from third countries has been increasing more rapidly than that of EU citizens from the 14 other Member States.
Our labour market depends on the presence of immigrants, although the most severe bottlenecks in our labour market are offset by cross-border commuters from France, Belgium and Germany.
Almost a third of the work force, 80 000 people that is, are cross-border commuters.
Over half of the working population does not have Luxembourg citizenship.
These figures illustrate the interest my country has in a sound immigration policy, and, needless to say, in the important aspect of family reconciliation.
It is, of course, one of the Commission 's tasks, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to propose measures on the entry into, and residence, in the European Union, of third-country nationals, primarily with the undeniably admirable aim of bringing about an approximation of the legal provisions of individual Member States on the conditions governing the admission and residence of third-country nationals.
The Commission is right to comment, in its proposal for a directive on the right to reunification, that the presence of family members facilitates normal family life, thereby creating greater stability and enabling the individuals concerned to put roots down in the host country more successfully.
We are aware, and regard highly the fact, that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions recognise the nuclear family as the basic social unit, which deserves protection and support.
Against this background, and notwithstanding the fact that some international agreements do not make provision for the right to family reunification, in principle, I still welcome the Commission proposal for a Community legal instrument in respect of family reunification.
However, we do not want absolute chaos, and neither do we want to create new opportunities for gangs of human traffickers.
Above all, we must ensure that these provisions take the absorption capacity of each Member State into account.
This would certainly not be the case if we were to endorse the report of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in its present form.
The rapporteur was entirely justified in withdrawing her name from the report, which was adopted in committee by 25 votes to 13.
A directive of the kind proposed by the majority of the committee responsible is simply unworkable, dangerous and counterproductive.
Only the amendments put forward by my group and the original rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, could have persuaded me to vote in favour of this report.
I am wholeheartedly in favour of family reunification.
But how is the family to be defined?
