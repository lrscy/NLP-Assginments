As I am sure you know, the Commission has now launched investigations into nine categories of Chinese textile exports to the EU based on import statistics for the first quarter of this year.
In all these categories, import volumes for Chinese textiles have now risen above the âalert levelsâ defined by the Commission.
I always said that I would act on the basis of the relevant data and I am doing so now.
Now that the alert mechanism has been activated, I have set up an experienced task force to conduct a full and rapid investigation into these named categories.
It will reach its conclusions within a maximum of 60 days.
This investigation will determine whether market disruption in Europe and elsewhere really has occurred.
We will also have to consider the actual damage to producer interests, set against the consumer benefits involved.
If it proves necessary and justified, I will use the safeguard powers at our disposal.
A number of other categories appear to give cause for concern, but after careful consideration I have decided that further analysis of the data is required.
This is being undertaken.
In addition, there have been requests for the application of the urgency procedure foreseen by the guidelines.
This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China under the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence that irreparable damage will be caused to EU industry in the absence of such a course of action.
My services are currently analysing these requests.
In parallel, I have actively engaged with the Chinese authorities to give them advance warning wherever possible, to urge them to provide concrete evidence that the measures they have put in place are having an effect, and to explore whether they cannot do more and indeed to urge them to do so.
I have launched informal consultations with China in an attempt to find a sustainable solution for all parties.
This was high on my agenda last week in Paris when I met with the Chinese Trade Minister Bo Xilai.
My message to Minister Bo was that to avoid the EU having to take action, China needs to give a stronger response to curb its export growth in the short term.
I believe that my message was received loud and clear.
I have noted the statements made by the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao yesterday in Beijing and I would like to welcome the fact that China now understands the acute concerns of certain Member States, as Wen Jiabao acknowledged yesterday in Beijing, and that China prefers, as he said, a solution based on dialogue and cooperation.
I also welcome the fact that China considers the need to resolve this issue as amongst Chinaâs primary interests in relation to the EU.
I noted with particular interest the statement by Wen Jiabao that, in addition to the measures already taken to curb textiles export growth, China will take even stronger measures in the near future.
I welcome this, but I also believe that the effects need to be felt quickly if they are to stay our hand in any action that we might consider taking.
It is imperative that China explain in detail, and quickly, the type of additional measures it intends to adopt and what consequences these will have on future trade flows.
I am looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency.
Failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the EU to resolve this issue and could leave me with no alternative other than to act under the WTO.
I have a team of officials in Beijing this week. They are meeting Chinese counterparts as we speak now, to follow up on my discussions with Minister Bo last week and on yesterdayâs statements by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
Let me turn now to other matters concerning WTO implementation.
This is important because the WTO agreement is the lynchpin for the development of our trade relations with China.
China has made substantial progress in implementing its WTO commitments, as set out in its accession agreement, but some issues still raise concerns.
I am addressing these in both a bilateral and multilateral context.
Discussions have met with considerable success in a number of areas, in particular on coke, the construction and automobile sectors, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
However, concerns still remain in the automobile sector, in services sectors such as banking, and in telecommunications.
I raised these and pursued them when I was in Beijing earlier this year and I will continue to do so.
I accept that a particular area of concern is the need to ensure an adequate and efficient level of protection in China of intellectual property rights.
China has shown willing, but the continuing difficulties encountered by European industry in terms of counterfeiting and piracy have made clear that more work is needed.
I am addressing this issue on two fronts, using a combination of political pressure and cooperation, both bilaterally and on a multilateral level.
I am determined to give practical answers to industryâs concerns.
We took an important step forward when the Chinese recently agreed to my proposal to set up an Intellectual Property Working Group.
The intention here is to address problems in a systemic way and on a sectoral basis.
It will include experts from business who know where the delivery problems in Chinaâs laws exist.
But IPR is a worldwide problem, and it therefore requires consideration on a global level.
Within the WTO, the EU, as well as the US and Japan, used the 2004 Transitional Review Mechanism to challenge China on its implementation record of its obligations in respect of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, otherwise known as TRIPs.
The answers given by China demonstrate its commitment to the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, but further efforts are obviously needed and I am committed to helping China make those further efforts.
The EU has also suggested that the Review Mechanism could be usefully complemented by a multilateral discussion within the TRIPs Council, and I intend to follow this up.
But I also believe that continuing to share our expertise by providing technical assistance on intellectual property is an important element of our work with China.
We have recently concluded an EC-China Agreement on customs cooperation.
Another example of assistance is EU financing of training on trademarks for judges.
These are just two instances of the sort of cooperation that will help China build a sound and coherent enforcement system.
Finally, I would encourage European industry to make use of all available tools in the EU and in China to protect its own rights and put the system to the test.
In conclusion, the level of cooperation and partnership that China and the EU are demonstrating in these areas are the building blocks for a dynamic and more effective relationship between us.
Nobody should underestimate the huge potential gains and benefits for us in Europe of such a relationship growing and being soundly based.
There are obviously going to be challenges ahead, and I will ensure that the EU responds in a timely and effective manner.
But there will also be great opportunities for European industry and producers to supply into that rapidly expanding Chinese market.
If we can work together to ensure that a rules-based economic system is respected and strengthened in the DDA, then the rapid economic growth in China will benefit the EU and the rest of the world.
That is why in responding to the question originally put, I say again that we have to combine our short-term management of the problems that are thrown up by Chinaâs expansion with a clear-sighted, longer-term perspective of the opportunities that Chinaâs growth offers Europe.
Â Â  .
MrPresident, ladies and gentlemen, China has, over recent years, become a major player in the global market, and so it has certain obligations to fulfil and bears a considerable responsibility.
This being so, I would like to put a number of questions to the Commission.
Firstly, last year saw 9Â 000 court cases in China involving product piracy.
That is a good start.
What is the Commission going to do to support the Chinese in their efforts to this end?
Secondly, although sentences are handed down, they are often not carried out.
How will the Commission support the Chinese authorities in enforcing the sentences passed on product pirates?
Thirdly, products exported from China are often in breach of patents and copyright.
During Question Time on 8Â March, Commissioner KovÃ¡cs assured me that the EU would offer to send customs officers to China at the EUâs own expense to help their Chinese counterparts in their work.
Has this offer in fact been made to the Chinese, and how have they responded to it?
Fourthly, a steam iron made in China, which bore the CE label but did not meet the relevant standards, recently caused the deaths of two people in Greece.
What will the Commission do to get the Member States, without delay, to put in place effective market controls preventing such products from being put on sale and compelling the Chinese manufacturers to comply with standards and patents?
Fifthly, there are to this day in China many obstacles to European firms.
What does the Commission propose to do in order to effectively remove these barriers to trade, most of which do not take the form of tariffs?
Sixthly, modern weapons contain the most modern of technologies.
What adverse effects on businesses and jobs in Europe does the Commission anticipate if the embargo on weapons â and on the transfer of associated technologies â is lifted?
Seventhly, what is the Commission actually doing to induce China to allow its currencyâs exchange rate to find its own level?
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what Mr Caspary has just said, there are a number of points I would like to address.
I very much welcome the safeguards that have been put in place, and I hope that you can obtain reliable data, including reliable data from the individual Member States.
As I see it, Romania is one example of how it is not that simple to get your hands on reliable data.
I hope that you will then not delay in bringing that data to the Committee on International Trade, so that we who sit on that Committee can discuss it with you and advise you on it.
I also rejoiced to hear that you had, in your speech in Singapore on 29 April, revived an old initiative of this House, that being the demand for closer cooperation between Europe and Asia.
This House did once advocate a free trade area and urged that it should at least begin with one state.
While we now have a very strong presence in Latin America, there are other regions, Asia in particular, that we have been positively culpable in neglecting.
I agree that, where China is concerned, we are paying a bitter price for this.
Our major concern â of which textiles might be described as merely a âsuper-exampleâ â is the unfair competition that, for various reasons, exists in China.
Competition may be deliberately unfair, or the unfairness may very well be involuntary.
What do you propose to do about it?
What can actually be done to ensure that enquiries take a good hard look at such things as disguised subsidies?
You also mentioned intellectual property rights, but there is a good deal more to it than that.
There is a particular case that you have been considering for a very long time.
I would be grateful if you were to say something about it.
This case, moreover, has to do with non-ferrous metals, and this House has for some considerable time been calling for an enquiry into disguised subsidies for these.
In China, in particular, reimbursement of VAT is used to support the local recycling industry.
What progress has been made with enquiries into this?
Might I ask you to say something about this?
Quite apart from all that, it is a good thing that you have done something about investment.
We are right behind you in that respect and wish you plenty of success.
Â Â  . Mr President, too little too late, that is how one can describe Commissioner Mandelsonâs recent announcement that use will be made of the textile-specific safeguard clause which permits Europe to limit imports until 2008.
That decision was taken about a month after the United States had swung into action.
Time and again, the Commissioner has said that trade with China should be seen as a challenge rather than a threat.
Indeed it should be, and I think the European textile industry is prepared to do so, provided, though, that the trading game is played correctly on both sides.
In countries such as China, unfair trade practices, including export subsidies, dumping prices, direct and indirect government support, free capital and illegal imitations and piracy, are endemic.
This aggressive trade policy is making the European textile and clothing sector crack at the seams.
And yet, Commissioner, this sector is still an extremely important industrial sector, with a total turnover of EUR 200 billion spread across 177Â 000 businesses that, post-enlargement, employ 2.7 million textile workers, equivalent to 7% of the total industrial workforce.
In fact, not only Europe, but also a large number of developing countries, are at risk of collapsing under Chinaâs aggressive export policy.
At the end of last year, this House urged us to pursue a more assertive trade policy in respect of China.
That import figures would be alarming could already be deduced from the import products without quota.
I hope that the measures now announced by the Commission will not prove to be too late in the day, and, above all, that they are merely a first step towards protecting our industry, in a manner acceptable to the WTO against unfair competition, from wherever that may come.
Â Â  Mr President, clearly there are very real concerns about the impact of China on other players in the international trading system.
We have already heard about the impact of the surge in textile imports on the EU and the devastation some EU producers face as a result.
But let us not forget the impact on other developing countries.
Chinaâs deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world and pushing global suppliers to reduce their workersâ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive at all costs.
In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage would not longer apply to the clothing industry.
In Bangladesh, the government recently announced that it would increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restrictions on womenâs night work.
Chinese workers themselves do not necessarily have much to gain either, facing seven-day working weeks, very low wages, appalling health and safety hazards and no trade unions.
We are looking here at a downward spiral of social and environmental standards; certainly minimum international standards might help stem that downward spiral.
It is most important for this debate not just to focus on this or that sector, textiles today or footwear or machine components tomorrow.
What we are looking at here is a systemic problem.
It is a challenge posed by a country that has entered the international trading system not just with a comparative advantage but with potentially an almost absolute advantage in just about everything.
It is complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech while China simply does the manufacturing.
Chinese graduates are also moving up the value-added chain.
Very soon we may need to face the possibility that there could be very little that Europe could produce that China cannot produce more efficiently.
The old assumption that while the EU and the industrialised countries keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries while developing nations focus on lower-skill sectors, is now open to huge debate.
The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now.
We need to look again at the old ideas dating from David Ricardo onwards that comparative advantage always works in everybodyâs best interests.
I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles.
I would also like to hear what the Commissioner plans to do about these longer-term systemic issues.
We need a more balanced view than this oral question suggests.
We should be looking at some of the impacts of liberalisation on China itself, because there is ample proof to suggest that many of the poorest people in China face significant losses themselves, particularly in the agricultural sector, as a result of Chinaâs accession to the WTO.
So let us have a more balanced view; a view that looks into the future as well.
Â Â  . â We are not following in the slipstream of those who seek to shirk their responsibilities with regard to the objectives of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks and to the manner in which they conduct those talks, and who, having attempted to impose the blind and brutal liberalisation of world trade, with its extremely damaging economic and social consequences, are now trying to pass the buck and blame China for all of the worldâs evils.
Their discourse seeks to disguise the fact that it is the large economic groups who stand to gain the most from the current liberalisation of world trade.
They are the ones who relocate their production in search of higher profits; they are the ones who, owing to their domination of distribution, come away with the lionâs share.
The textiles and clothing sector is an example of this alarming situation.
China was not to blame for the way in which the WTO talks on the textiles and clothing sector were conducted; the Commission and the Council were.
China is not responsible for the over-valuation of the euro, which exacerbates the problems and hampers the competitiveness of the textiles and clothing made in EU countries.
It is the Council and the Commission, not China, that have thus far failed to activate the safeguard clause, in spite of the appalling situation that the EUâs textiles and clothing sector is currently enduring, particularly in countries such as Portugal.
Instead, they delay this crucial decision.
I therefore ask the following questions: When will safeguard clauses be activated?
When will there be a revision of the Commissionâs mandate for WTO talks?
What we must do is suspend and reverse the current policies on trade liberalisation.
What we must do is ensure a level playing field for trade, by introducing a system that is geared towards genuinely and sustainably developing each countryâs potential, a system that is not based on dominance and dependency, a system that is thus geared towards urgently improving the standard of living for people across the world and towards guaranteeing their rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, the problems of the global textiles sector divide Europe into a north and a south camp.
To put it succinctly, it pits the advent of cheaper textile imports against the maintenance of our own textile sector.
Although I understand that Commissioner Mandelson has to steer a middle course between those in favour and against measures against China, I think it is far too late to launch an investigation now.
The Commission should have utilised the past few years to develop a position on an unencumbered global textiles market and a policy towards that end.
I think that discussion on the temporary introduction of protective measures should focus on the period after 2008 if this House is not to end up having exactly the same debate in three yearsâ time.
The period until 2008 should be used to start a dialogue with the Chinese authorities âa dialogue with the dual purpose of underlining both the importance of a stable global textiles market and Chinaâs WTO obligations.
After all, the WTO grants China rights, but also requires that it tackle, for example, restricted market access in the services sectors in banking and telecommunications.
I wish the Commissioner much perseverance in his negotiations with his Chinese opposite numbers.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the case under examination very closely affects the existence of thousands of companies and the employment of millions of European citizens, including 570Â 000 Italians in the textile industry alone.
On top of that, there is the footwear industry and other sectors all in line to be hit by the Chinese tsunami effect.
The end of import quotas owing to the expiry of the Multifibre Agreement, the entry into force of the EU-China bilateral agreement of 2000 and the counterfeiting of the EC trademark were the subject of three questions that I addressed to the Council and the Commission on 6 January of this year.
Concerned by the consequences, I sought to find out what provisions the Commission intended to adopt, given that the principles upon which the WTO rules are based (the environment, work, non-harmful products, counterfeiting) were being violated by China.
The replies were of a provisional nature and, even today, the Commission â perhaps a prisoner of a mistaken rigour in interpreting the law â behaves more like a notary than a political, governing body.
To all of the above must be added the impact that the REACH Regulation will have on the competitiveness of businesses: Europe is anxious to apply and to export an increasing number of principles and values, which is entirely proper, whilst China and other countries are concerned to produce tights, shoes, knitwear and suchlike at low cost and export them to Europe, with the gratifying outcome for Europe of witnessing the progress and higher levels of employment achieved by exporting countries.
The picture would appear almost complete if we consider that relocations favour large European companies, but impoverish Europe, whose white collar workers and capital, together with equipment and machinery, are emigrating elsewhere, leaving thousands of unemployed workers clinging to the dream of social values.
The Europe of knowledge, research and innovation cannot be divorced from the Europe of competitive production.
It is a matter of cause and effect.
A distinguished and most humble monk, Saint Benedict of Nursia, was fond of repeating the words âPray and workâ to each of his brothers, in order that the abstraction of prayer did not distract from the reality of life.
We must reflect on the extensive resources that we still possess, on the very many regions addressed in Objective 1, and on the support policies.
A new strategy needs to be drawn up, and we need to additionally consider the poverty and needs that exist in Europe itself, including its requirement for harmonious development.
We need to assess, moreover, whether vulnerable regions can truly hope for genuine development and whether they can attract European companies to relocate onto their soil.
That would perhaps be possible if well-equipped business districts and a modern system of tax breaks were created in those very regions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Chinese textiles affair is just one illustration, MrÂ Mandelson, of a much greater problem.
In international trade, two contradictory elements need to be reconciled: firstly, and obviously, the need to trade and therefore to remove barriers; and, secondly, the need to ensure that jobs and social benefits are secure.
In pro-am golf, this problem is resolved by giving the professional a handicap.
In international trade, the handicap of customs duties had been created.
With the GATT and the WTO, decisions have, however, been taken since 1947 firstly to reduce the duties and then to abolish them.
ArticleÂ 341 of the Constitution confirms this.
Clearly, the upshot of this is the Chinese affair.
The solution, MrÂ Mandelson, is to invent a new customs technology.
Instead of reducing and abolishing duties, you, Commissioner Mandelson, need to propose to the WTO that it reduce duties. In this way, the importer would make a customs credit â a kind of economic drawing on the importerâs economy - available to the exporter.
The system would impose a duty on Chinese textiles coming into Europe and provide China with a customs credit which could only be used for purchasing products that had emerged from the European economy.
In this way, a virtuous circle would be created.
The system would resemble the compensated contracts, offshore contracts and Marshall Plan systems but, in this case, the credit is made available by the customs duty itself.
The thorny problem of relocations would thus be resolved in terms of a new customs technology.
Â Â  . It is now the turn of the other speakers on the list: 20 speakers are listed to speak and as per the apportionment of time decided by the groups, the majority of these speeches will last for one or two minutes.
I appreciate that it is highly difficult to deliver a speech within one minute, but we are having problems, some of them technical, linked to the closure of this sitting, and the departure of many Members will be disrupted by a strike taking place at Strasbourg Airport.
I must strictly enforce the speaking time.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the liberalisation of Chinese exports on 1 January 2005 was welcomed by many as a major victory of free trade.
A few months later, we are returning to over-protectionism, both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America.
Many, moreover, have lost no time in calling this trade attack 'Chinese fever'.
In truth, if you think about it properly, this is a war, not a war of impressions, but a war of substance at all levels, which is aggravating Europe's and the United States' relations with Beijing.
We need to comment on one fact here: in the first quarter of 2005, China's economy grew at a rate of 9.5%, due to the explosion in exports, which rose by 35%, increasing China's foreign currency reserves to just over 650 million dollars.
We are therefore debating an economic, historical, cultural and commercial behemoth which today appears to be awakening from a long slumber.
Today China is showing its real strength and its limitless potential in the commercial sector, in trade, in exports, in technology and, in particular in goods, the raw materials for which traditionally have a history which goes back centuries for this country of mysticism with its volcano beneath the ground which is ready to explode.
The attention of the European Union and its vigilance in passing resolutions on relations with China are welcome here because:
- firstly, 9 categories of Chinese products are currently the subject of investigation;
- secondly, China is becoming stronger and stronger on the world political scene;
- thirdly, the European Union is China's most important trading partner and China is the European Union's second most important trading partner.
Consequently, we have strong ties with this country;
- fourthly, China can prove its commitment to WTO rules by improving its legislation on intellectual property and thus controlling imitations and
- fifthly, with this approach and current rates, the WTO estimates that China will have 3/5 of exports in 2015, a position which it held for a thousand years, from 500 to 1500 A.D.
I wonder how the European Union will deal with the Chinese fever giant.
Â Â  Mr President, if Commissioner Mandelson had come to this Chamber in February and said âI am now going to implement the safeguard clauses in the textile agreementâ he would have been a very popular man; he would have won lots of applause in the House, but he would also have been very wrong.
I believe that his approach is absolutely admirable.
He has managed to resist the pressure on him to act precipitately.
The approach that the Commission is taking is correct in terms of making sure that we have all our facts marshalled, that any action we take can be legally justified and, if there is a legal case for taking action, that action will be taken. That is the right approach.
An alternative approach would have resulted in the EU being accused of being protectionist, it would have damaged our relations with China itself and, above all, it would have sent a very bad signal for the Doha Development Round.
So his approach is correct.
I should like to add one caveat, however.
The news today that Americaâs balance of payments has surprisingly improved might be good news for America, but underlying that there is a clear indication that imports from China have dropped dramatically and that the decline in Chinese imports includes a 21% reduction in textile imports.
I do not want Europe to be seen as a soft touch.
I do not want China to think that it has to respond to American pressure, but not to European Union pressure.
So, if the statistics and facts justify EU action, I am sure the Commissioner will agree that he will have to take that action and send a very strong signal to China.
On other issues, I hope that the Commissioner â and I was pleased to hear his comments on this â will keep up pressure on China in terms of intellectual property rights.
The Chinese justification that it is all too complicated, that the difference between regional, national and local structures makes it impossible for China to implement WTO rules, just does not wash because China can do it when it comes to protecting Chinese intellectual property.
China should also be made to do it in relation to European intellectual property.
It is good news that China is part of the WTO.
It is good news that China has to respect rules.
It is our job to make sure, in the long term, that it sticks to those rules.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we call on you today for a particularly firm and timely approach to your handling of this dossier.
You have explained to us what you have done and what responses you await.
Allow us to state that the opening of the inquiry seemed late in coming.
Worrying statistics were already reaching us in January, February, March and April, showing an abnormal â absolutely exceptional â increase in imports from China.
The serious damage caused to the textile industry is obvious, and is one of the conditions cited by the WTO Treaties for implementing the safeguard mechanism.
We believe that China is probing the limits of the application of the Treaty, and Europe must behave responsibly.
We are all pleased at Chinaâs entry into the WTO; we helped to achieve this objective.
Commissioner, we are certainly not calling for protectionist measures or a return to the old ideas of import duties, but for a Europe that stands strong and firm in making China respect the rules to which it has itself subscribed.
It is obvious that this country â I am talking about China â is striving to become the manufacturing centre of the entire world.
Today it is happening with the textile industry, tomorrow it will be the mechanical engineering industry and later on the electronics industry.
Europeâs response will be crucial and will act as a benchmark for future crises in other sectors.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the logic of global free trade has now hit us too.
It is, then, hypocrisy to demand that we be protected against textile imports while ignoring the conditions in the oil and precious metals industries where there are not the same threats against European companies.
What we should do is introduce fair tariffs across the board whereby manufacturers which do not comply with ILO requirements and environmental requirements are obliged to pay.
These tariffs ought then to be returned to the developing countries in order to improve their environment and social situation.
I find it odd that we have to concentrate on protecting large companiesâ intellectual rights in China when it is mainly human rights that need protection in China and when that is of course where we should be investing our energies.
The transition from free to fair trade now demands reform of economic policy as a whole, however, so that trade becomes a tool for human beings, and not the other way around.
The UNâs environmental protection organisation, UNEPO and the UNâs development programme, UNDP should call the shots where the World Trade Organisation is concerned, and not the other way around.
Â Â  â Mr President, the interest which you are showing in the workers and in whether or not China is honouring its important obligations towards the WTO is both hypocritical and belated.
The Commission played a leading part both in the signature of the multifibre agreement and at the WTO and it is on this basis that textile products are being imported from China.
The textile industry and cotton cultivation started to shrink in the Member States of the European Union many years before 1 January 2005, when imports of Chinese textile products were allowed, with painful consequences for the workers.
The WTO is an imperialist organisation which serves the interests of the multinationals and of big business, at the expense of the workers' interests.
They set the particularly strict terms for the accession of China to the WTO, for the purpose, in other words, of opening up its markets, of liberalising the markets and of privatisation, so that they could exploit China's wealth-producing resources and workers.
In exchange, China secured the free movement of its textile products.
The belated interest in workers in the textile industry and other sectors is being expressed at a time when the workers' wrath at and fight against the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in the Member States is growing.
The objective of this initiative is obviously to disorientate and appease the workers intending to vote NO to the European Constitution.
We also note that the warnings about limiting Chinese imports come at a time when pressure from the United States of America and the European Union on Beijing to break the fixed parity between the dollar and the yuan is culminating; in other words, the imperialist centres want China and the other countries of Asia as a huge consumer market for their goods, without any competition from them on international markets.
The danger emanates not from China, but from international competition on the part of the imperialists.
We are fighting for international economic relations on an equal footing; we defend the right of the peoples to choose their own path.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the has reported that, following Thursdayâs meeting between MrÂ Mandelson and the Chinese Trade Minister, MrÂ Mandelson reaffirmed that he does not plan to make hasty decisions in confronting the influx of Chinese products, âThe long-term stakes are too high to allow the Chinese to damage our partnership and a longer deadline is required to make the suitable adjustments.â
Even here today, in this House, when faced with the request from certain countries, including Italy, to take urgent steps to activate the safeguard mechanism, you tell us that you are examining the dossier.
What is the reasoning behind the Commissionâs tardiness?
What are the real interests at stake?
How can it be that the textile industry has been so shamelessly left at the mercy of events and of what has rightly been described as a tsunami?
The Minister for Industry, in the hearing duly organised by MrÂ BaronÂ Crespo, gave a precise account of the figures: 100Â million employees working 24 hours per day.
That is a war machine and you are seeking to confront it with legal technicalities?
That indicates an unwillingness to protect the textile industry and Europeâs small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the invasion of Chinese textile goods, the urgent adoption â and I stress urgent â of the safeguard mechanism is a crucial step.
There is a need, however, also to responsibly think up a strategy for the long-term.
There are six points to which I should briefly like to draw the attention of the Community institutions.
Firstly: a strong commitment to the fight against the counterfeiting of European goods and trademarks, together with a more incisive and effective strategy on intellectual property is vital.
Secondly: an unambiguous policy for strengthening, at European level, customs controls on goods originating from outside of Europe.
Thirdly: the introduction of a non-EU mark of origin, which will also apply to products that are only partially manufactured in third countries.
Fourthly: putting on the agenda a serious discussion of the consequences of the excessive appreciation of the euro.
Fifthly: a European pledge to finally hold a debate on the systematic and unjustifiable devaluation of the Chinese currency (the yuan), in the framework of the WTO.
The sixth and final point: calling on China to comply with international rules protecting workers and human rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, when China joined the WTO in 2001, this was in theory a way of bringing trade relations between China and the European Union into balance.
Nonetheless, this balance is altered when the ground rules of international trade are not respected.
I want to speak first of all about the measures needed â in accordance, let us not forget, with the WTO agreements - to protect intellectual property.
These measures help combat pirating and counterfeiting effectively.
In order to guarantee the future of our textiles industry, it is now up to the European Union to ensure that the agreements protecting textile patterns and designs are respected.
Faced, finally, with what is recognised as market disruption â I am referring here, of course, to what you yourself have confirmed is the spectacular development of Chinese textile products â we need to apply the legal instruments available to us within the framework of the WTO.
Moreover, do you not believe, Commissioner, that it is now imperative, when all the indicators are in the red, to set in motion an urgency procedure enabling safeguard measures to be implemented?
Why are you delaying so long, to the detriment of our industries and to the detriment of the industries in the countries close to us?
There is no making up for lost time.
This is not about implementing protectionist measures. In fact, it is about making China understand that its membership of the WTO entails both rights and duties.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, last weekend, one of the biggest ships in the world docked at the port of Valencia.
It came from China and carried 5Â 100 containers, mostly containing textile goods.
Some people described it as the ship of unemployment, the job-destruction ship; nevertheless, a prominent business leader pointed out that our great challenge was to ensure that that ship did not return to China empty, but full of our products for that immense and growing market.
I believe that that is the great opportunity facing us as Europeans.
In order to make this possible, however, two conditions are essential.
The first is that the openness of the markets and progress of exchanges should be of reasonable dimensions and that the textile sector should be assisted in its process of restructuring.
We cannot allow the creation of a serious imbalance that will eventually destroy the European textile industry and have dramatic social consequences for many European regions.
The second is that we all have to play according to the same rules and that conditions must be reciprocal.
That includes compliance with the WTO agreements, which have been mentioned here by several speakers.
We must also demand that the rules that we must all follow include respect for the ILO conventions and the protection of workers.
I believe that the Commission must respond to the request of five countries of the Union to establish clearly all the products seriously affected by the Chinese influx and that an investigation and consultation procedure must be initiated immediately with China.
Commissioner, I am sure that you have the support of this House to continue working and seeking a negotiated and cautious solution, as you have said.
Nevertheless, it must be made clear that, if there is no appropriate response, the only solution will be to take safeguard measures.
Let us make the rules of the game that we must all play by clear today.
Let us anticipate the changes awaiting us and let us create reasonable conditions so that the European industry can deal with the challenges facing it.
Â Â  âMr President, we Europeans have every right to expect China to meet all the obligations that membership of the WTO implies, but China should also be guided by the spirit of the WTO rules, in the same way that Commissioner Mandelson himself is guided by the spirit of the Constitution, even though the Constitution is not yet in force.
It is for that reason that we welcome the imposition of safeguards.
Compliance with the treaties must be tested and demonstrated.
So far, of course, Chinaâs accession to the WTO has been a triumph not only for China itself, but also â and particularly â for us Europeans.
We should at long last come to see the debate in its global dimension, and not just from the narrow Eurocentric angle.
Commissioner Mandelson has tried to look at it globally.
Calls are made for the return of trade barriers and for tighter controls, but these would be a slap in the face for the European manufacturers who have spent 10Â years campaigning for a changeover from quota-based trade to more competition, and have now been successful.
To return to the special arrangements would be to regress to protectionism, and that, now in particular, would send completely the wrong message.
Nevertheless, minimum standards in the labour market have not ceased to matter; they still do, and it is for that reason that we Europeans should do everything in our power to get the WTO, too, to accept more democratic rules.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the EU is taking a reckless approach to the Chinese way of doing business, and I refuse to be swayed by the argument that textile manufacturers have had 10Â years to prepare for the liberalisation currently underway.
It was not until 2002, after China had joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that it became possible for the EU to determine what the impact of gradual liberalisation would be.
Prices fell by 40%, and China captured 75% of the market in a trice.
There could probably have been no clearer indication that EU trade policy should change course.
Yet that is exactly what did not happen, even though the Member States have entrusted the EU with exclusive power over trade policy.
At present China is ruthlessly crushing the poorest Asian and African countries, where textiles were key to survival.
Dumping prices will mean that one million European textile manufacturers, including tens of thousands ofÂ women in the Czech Republic, will lose their jobs in areas where textiles are a traditional industry.
It is not only the famed Chinese industriousness that makes such prices possible; they are also the result of minimal environmental and social standards, not to mention child labour, and state subsidies and Chinaâs undervalued, state-controlled currency also play a part.
We are opening up our markets, yet textile manufacturers are barred from the Chinese market.
The car factories are ample proof that the principle of cooperative ownership is being violated.
I believe it should be quite clear from what I have said that the WTO rules are being breached.
The EU must use any economic and political instruments it has left to force China to observe the rules of fair competition, both for the sake of sustainable development on our planet and for the sake of the values that prompt us to regulate the European market, even though we know that we are increasing the cost of producing goods in Europe and lowering our competitiveness in the process.
If the EU wishes to boost public confidence in integration, it must form a united front and become a strong partner for the WTO, on a par with Japan, China and the USA.
The Commission, the Council and also this House should view this as a duty, rather than a challenge.
I am delighted that the Commission has realised that the impact of liberalisation needs to be mitigated, but it is not enough to impose 7% quotas for one year.
I would urge the EU to make major changes to its foreign policy towards China, in order to ensure that this policy is in line with the long-term goals of the EU internal market.
I very much hope that we can succeed in this task.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the tone with which you have dealt with this important dossier on trade relations with China â in defence of Europeâs interests, but without that leading to a lurch backwards to the time of impossible and dangerous trade protectionism.
We must pay attention, however, to the textile industry, where I believe there is an issue emerging that is also political in nature.
The importance of events is such that the citizens of Europe are looking to us with great anxiety to find an effective escape route that a united Europe alone can provide.
They will not tolerate any kind of delay or even just the impression of involuntary powerlessness.
It is therefore necessary to immediately adopt useful policies, as you have said.
In addition to opening talks with the Chinese authorities, we must encourage the introduction of concrete provisions, such as labels of origin to encourage consumer awareness, and a more rigorous, intense fight against counterfeiting.
Creativity, innovative technology, and team spirit among the institutions, industry, the social partners and the research world are, of course, equally necessary.
I believe that this Parliament, together with you, will equally be ready to play its part in this possible breakthrough.
Â Â  â Mr President, the accession of China to the WTO and its integration into the global economy are a very positive development.
China is already one of the biggest trading powers in the world and its growth has positive repercussions on the development of many other countries.
However, there are indications and substantiated accusations that China is not fully honouring its obligations under its WTO accession agreement.
It has maintained restrictions in domestic trade and in the distribution of goods, such as state subsidies, discriminatory tax concessions, administrative hurdles and obstacles to the establishment of and access to its market for foreign companies in the services sector.
Furthermore, it is not applying in full the principle of national treatment.
Similarly, there are serious delays in the application of WTO rules on the protection of intellectual, commercial and industrial property and on foreign investment.
The result of all this is reduced access for European companies and the blocking of European exports to the Chinese market whereas, on the other hand, the European market remains open.
In order not to upset trade relations between the European Union and China and to ensure that the voice of neo-protectionism does not prevail, the Commission is being called on to take other initiatives, so that there is a balanced result in bilateral trade, on the one hand, and any unfair practices are lifted, on the other.
The first and best solution is to open further the Chinese market to European exports of industrial and agricultural products and services and, at the same time, to mitigate aggressive Chinese exports of certain products, such as textiles today, tomorrow cars or other products.
The application of the safeguard clauses for which provision is made in China's accession agreement is a reasonable last resort, a reasonable .
Â Â  Â Â Â Commissioner, as I see it there are three issues that require an appropriate and rapid response from the Commission.
The textile, clothing and footwear market provides us with an excellent example of how Chinese imports can destroy a market, and have a knock-on effect on other sectors.
The first issue that needs to be addressed is the length of time it takes the Commission to act, as well as the fact that the misguided decisions it takes are not only damaging, but unfortunately sometimes also irreversible.
The second issue relates to the liberalisation of the EU market, the consequences of which have included a sudden influx of subsidised imports, such as subsidised coal.
This has led to price competition that has given rise to so much concern and has eventually ruined the coal market.
This has made matters even worse for the mining industry, even though the efforts of the latter go towards meeting the EUâs energy needs.
The third and final issue relates to the preferential trade agreements concluded when the EU still had only 15Â Member States.
It is time to revise the customs agreement and the preferential quotas, taking the interests of the enlarged EU into account, as at present the trade displacement effect does not always give rise to the relevant creation effect.
By way of example, agricultural and food products from the United States are still keeping goods from the 10Â new Member States off the EU market.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, since 1 January of this year, some 500 jobs have been lost in Belgium too as a result of the unequalled increase in Chinese textiles imports.
At this rate, it is expected that some 2Â 000 jobs will go by the end of this year, and if nothing is done, this will continue in the years to come.
Allow me to quote two figures, Commissioner, which I received this morning.
These are figures that reflect the increase of Chinese imports in Belgium over the past quarter, from January to April 2005.
Imports of Chinese jumpers have increased by 747% and of menâs trousers by 2000%, which adds up to a 20-fold increase.
The European â and Belgian â textile and clothing businesses have, nevertheless, largely adapted to the new competition.
They have specialised in a number of products, God knows how many, and are thus attempting to respond to the new threat and get their punches in first.
Unfortunately, Commissioner, it is extremely difficult to arm yourself against an opponent who resorts to unfair dumping practices, as has been mentioned several times this morning, and illegal counterfeit practices in particular.
An increasing number of European textile companies are faced with shameless and illegal imitations produced by their Chinese competitors.
I am delighted to hear this morning that you are determined to tackle this scourge.
The question is how quickly you want to act because figures over the past few months show that the situation is critical.
You said this morning in your introduction that you would like to further analyse the information.
What exactly do you mean by this?
I hope that this does not mean further delays.
This debate is not intended to prompt you, MrÂ Mandelson, into taking protectionist measures against China, on the assumption, of course, that such a thing is possible at this stage.
This is an appeal to make it clear to our Chinese friends that dumping and counterfeiting have no place in Europe and are far from being fair trade practices.
It is up to you, the Commission, to see to it that this is done.
Mr Mandelson, the employers and workers in Europeâs textile and clothing businesses are relying on you.
Please do not let them down any longer.
Â Â  âMr President, Commissioner, Europe still has cause to worry about its textile industry.
As a Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workersâ Association, I am only too familiar with the present situation, and with the potential social consequences of the job losses that are threatened.
The degree to which the Member States are prepared to meet the new situation does indeed vary widely.
That there is ever-increasing interpenetration of goods in the global economy is self-evident, and it is of course the case in China too.
Even I can see that, but the rate at which trade is currently being liberalised, accompanied by exports increasing at an unheard-of rate, does of course jeopardise everything.
In Europe alone, over a million jobs are seriously at risk, while on a global scale â and this I say with my vice-presidential hat on â over 30 million textile workers are under pressure, with the threat of their jobs going elsewhere.
That is how things stand on the global market at the moment.
The question is, then, whether the majority of the EU of 25 will, for reasons of solidarity, throw their weight behind protection clauses and whether, now that the textile industry has cried out for help, it might also be possible to get the process speeded up.
September might be too late.
Today, it is the textile industry; tomorrow it will be someone elseâs turn.
It is in those terms that we appeal to you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we need to define measures to protect the textile industry, measures so that the market and trade can operate, and measures to protect consumers.
We need to safeguard these measures by complying with international law and the rules of international trade and, more specifically, through China's protocol of accession to the WTO.
However, in complying with it, not only we can, but also we must activate the textile safeguard clauses.
Our strategy on textiles must, in my opinion, be based on competitiveness, quality and consumer protection.
For the purposes of consumer protection, I think we need to adopt measures to inform consumers about the attributes of products through appropriate labelling, for example with labels of origin, quality labelling, ecological labelling and, most importantly, labelling which indicates the effect of the product on the consumer's health.
As far as competitiveness and quality are concerned, I propose that research be reinforced and focus on:
a) high-quality innovative products,
b) creating research and development centres,
c) research into the effect of products on the environment and consumer health.
Finally, as regards the Commission communication on textiles, which stipulates as a strategic objective that the production chain must be maintained in countries in the Euro-Mediterranean zone, so that resources do not ultimately disappear via these countries, I have the following comments to make:
- firstly, we need to help small and medium-sized enterprises established there to become more flexible and to respond better to consumer demands and
- secondly, the Commission needs to expressly undertake to facilitate trade within the Euro-Mediterranean zone by applying customs duties as quickly as possible and refusing to confine itself to the current bilateral transnational agreements.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for the information he has given us and for the particular sensitivity which he has demonstrated over the last period on the major and serious problem of textiles.
The statistics for the last period sent by the Member States to the Commission illustrated how critical the situation is.
The situation is critical in the Member States, and in Greece in particular, as Mr Mandelson can see from the statistics submitted by the Greek authorities on closures of textile companies and job losses.
I believe that the communication on the part of the European Commission on the guidelines is the right move.
I agree that it is a move in the right direction.
It is a good thing that the Commission laid down alert levels for each category of Chinese textile products.
However, I should like to say that Mr Mandelson should re-examine the planned duration of the investigation to be conducted by the Commission and of the procedure for unofficial consultations with the Chinese authorities.
These periods, these terms must be reduced.
However, I should also like to emphasise that these guidelines should have been laid down earlier.
The Commission had promised that it would submit them last autumn; unfortunately, they were rather late.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are at present importing a very large number of products from China on favourable terms or at low prices.
This does of course increase Europeâs purchasing power.
Europe already has the greatest purchasing power in the world, and cheap imports make us even stronger in this respect.
The other side of the coin is that people are paid very low wages in China and hence have very little purchasing power, so the low level of wages in China puts us at a disadvantage and makes it less likely that we will sell goods there.
It is therefore vital that we should debate market access, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Such access to the market should be balanced and founded upon reciprocity, with both sides being able to learn from one another.
In this respect, the negotiations that are currently in progress are of particular importance.
It is also important that we in Europe should give some thought to what might happen if monetary parity were to begin to be subject to the operation of the market.
The international financial markets are currently characterised by considerable movement and very marked oscillations, and it may be supposed that parity with China will become temporarily flexible, with inevitable consequences for our markets.
As regards subsidies, taxation and dumping, we should give some thought to how we can join with China in finding solutions together, and we should in particular make a start on trade facilitation in order to bring about more transparency in this area in future, making it possible for the customs authorities to work together and for a mutual relationship to be established, such as is customary for equal trading partners.
Each side should see what the otherâs problems are and try to negotiate compromises.
I now wish Commissioner Mandelson a great deal of success in doing just that, believing as I do that this House will be alongside him and vigilant in these negotiations.
Â Â  . Mr President, this has been a very useful, rather balanced and proportionate debate, but I well understand the huge anxieties and sensitivities that are excited by this issue of textiles.
Let me say that, of all the contributions made since the opening remarks, if I had to identify one contribution with which I was most in sympathy and which most corresponded to my own views and approach, it would be that of Mr Calabuig Rull, because stressing that we need to see China as an opportunity as well as a potential threat and that the containers that are heading towards Europe with all these textiles and other goods and produce need then to be sent back to China filled with goods and produce hits exactly the right note.
When I talk about goods and produce I also mean a huge potential and expanding market for European services.
I agree that we need to help the textiles industry in Europe to restructure and adapt, and we are giving that assistance.
I agree that, if China is to have its own growth accepted by the international economic community, then it needs to reciprocate by opening its own markets to othersâ produce and to comply with international agreements.
However, I also agree that, if, in the circumstances of this very sudden and very dramatic surge in Chinese exports, we have to take action on our side in order to manage this transition and to smooth these changes, then that action is open to us to take. It may be limited in terms of its content and its duration.
None of us should exaggerate â especially for those who are directly concerned with these changes â what is at our disposal to do in order to counter this.
At the very least, we can limit the growth of Chinese exports on a temporary basis.
It is not open to us, under the WTO rules, to do more than that.
However, where the facts justify our doing that, I, certainly, and my colleagues in the Commission will not shrink from doing so.
It is easy in a debate like this to talk in generalisations.
What we cannot do is act in generalisations.
We have to act on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of the facts.
Why?
Because we must act in a way that is legally defensible.
The worst course of action for us in the Commission would be to act in a way that we could not subsequently defend, only to find ourselves challenged in the WTO and forced to reverse the actions we have taken.
That would be a tremendous disappointment and setback for those who are most directly affected, and we must be careful.
Therefore, we must enforce the rules, but we cannot invent the rules.
That is what we must bear in mind throughout this.
Also, there is a mixed picture developing in terms both of the impact of import levels on particular commodities and categories of textiles and of the impact on production levels and employment within different parts of the European textiles industry.
Not just in the United States, but in some cases also in Europe, import levels are falling.
In other cases, Chinese imports and their growth are displacing the imports from third countries.
So it is a mixed picture.
In terms of the impact of these trade flows on European production and employment, it is true that, in some cases, the impact appears to be dramatic, based on the facts that I was reviewing with my services only yesterday, facts, for example, from Greece, Portugal and Italy.
There are some very disturbing developments.
I have to take note of those and I have to base my future actions on those facts.
In the case of some of our other Member States, I have yet to receive the relevant data and the relevant information.
Even certain Member States at the forefront of the demands for me to adopt emergency and urgent procedure have not sent me the facts on which I could base such urgent action.
However, I am sure it will be forthcoming.
Mr Caspary, Mrs Mann and Mr Martinez raised interesting questions and ideas, and I will write to them in response in due course.
Finally, the statement made yesterday by the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in which he seems to have decided to give instructions to relevant government departments in China to prepare effective action to curb Chinese export growth, is welcome to me.
We need, however, to look at the reality of these actions, when they are agreed, and consider the impact they will have.
In the light of those, the Commission will consider what future action it will take from here on.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  Chinaâs economic dynamism and its consequences for the European economy has highlighted how powerless the European institutions are to defend fragile industrial sectors such as the textiles industry.
The principle of dismantling the quantitative limitations of the multifibre arrangement was agreed in 1986 when the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round were launched.
At that time, China was not a big supplier of textiles and was not a member of the GATT.
A lot of French textile companies had already relocated to North Africa or Egypt.
When, moreover, the Uruguay Round agreements establishing the timetable and the method for dismantling the quantitative restrictions were signed in 1994, China was not a member of the new WTO, which it only joined in 2002.
Criticism of China cannot therefore conceal Commissionersâ and EU governmentsâ responsibility for the huge difficulties experienced by the textile industry and, unfortunately, extending to other sectors.
What is also scandalous is having agreed, in the name of world trade, to enter into agreements with the largest totalitarian country on the planet, and one which violates all the human, social and economic principles on which Europe is supposed to be built.
Â Â  . My doubts about admitting China to the World Trade Organisation have been borne out by the way in which that country fails to stick to the rules, not only as regards textiles, but also in the case of intellectual property.
By admitting China, we also got Taiwan into the bargain as a member of the WTO, but, of great value though that is, it does not relieve us of the duty to remind China that it has to play by the rules.
Moreover, the question also arises, even if China were to adhere to the rules, of whether industries such as textiles in the EU could compete against low-wage countries.
Europe must specialise, must concentrate on the production of high-quality products, and must focus on deploying high-quality labour.
Only then can we handle the competition on the world market.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0111/2005) by MrÂ Herrero-Tejedor, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the implementation of the European Unionâs information and communication strategy (2004/2238(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are going to vote on in a few minutes time covers, or attempts to cover, two fundamental objectives: firstly, to evaluate the application of the European institutionsâ information and communications strategy, in other words, to look back and see what we have not done properly; and secondly, to propose certain effective ideas that contribute to making the information and communication policy better, in other words, to look ahead and see how we can improve that policy.
I would like to thank all the political groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs â MarÃ­a BadÃ­a, Giulietto Chiesa, Helga TrÃŒpel and Manuel Portas â for the efforts they have made to enrich the report, something they have undoubtedly achieved, and to reach a broad agreement that allows us to vote on a text which hinges on five basic agreements.
We basically agree that we have to ensure that information reaches every citizen, that they receive it via the most modern instruments, that is to say, television, radio, the Internet and the new technologies.
It is not sufficient for us to prepare responses aimed at a few citizens who are already aware of being European and who already know what they need to ask.
We must ensure that awareness of Europe, of what it means to be European, reaches everybody, and that sooner or later, everybody feels the need to ask what the European Union can do for each of them.
We basically agree that, in order to do this, we must ensure that the messages of the European institutions reach the right audiences.
We must ensure that these messages awaken the interest of the citizens, each and every one of them, according to their respective concerns, because it makes no sense to spend a lot of money providing generalised information that is ultimately of hardly any use to anybody.
Every household must receive the message that is relevant to that particular household.
And to that end, information must be decentralised, it must be channelled by means of local and regional media, with the help of good professionals, genuine professionals who are able to give the media the kind of assistance they really need.
We basically agree that the citizensâ legitimate aspirations to participate actively in the development of the European Union will only be met if we are able to touch the emotions of the citizens.
The European Union is no longer an ordinary international organisation with purely financial aims.
It is a community of values. Those values are the very soul of the European Union.
We must make it visible and we must make it attractive.
We basically agree that we can do little from here without the cooperation of the Member States and the national parliaments.
And we basically agree that it would be a mistake not to ensure that interinstitutional cooperation functions properly.
This final point, that of cooperation amongst the different European institutions, has so far led to a very fluid dialogue during the production of this report, an unusually fluid dialogue, I would say, with the European Commission, and we all want this to continue.
But it is not enough to want it. Desires are not enough.
Only facts matter.
It is a fact that, through this report, the European Parliament has tried to bring itself into line with the Commission as far as possible. And the Commission now has two options: either to incorporate Parliamentâs contributions into the new communication about to be issued, or to do without them.
If you chose the first option, we will move forward; if you chose the second, we will take an enormous step backwards.
The ball is in your court, therefore, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, but since I am sure that you want to do the right thing, and since I can testify to your willingness to hold dialogue and to reach agreement, I am also sure that you will be able to take this opportunity for the Parliament and Commission to work together in this fascinating task of communicating Europe.
Amen.
Â Â  . I am very pleased to address today, in this House, the vital topic of communicating Europe to our citizens.
Mr Herrero-Tejedor has done an excellent job in tabling a report that poses the right questions and suggests important answers.
I welcome the rapporteurâs suggestion that this plenary should have a debate on communication at least once a year.
The support of Europeans for the European project hinges on our communication efforts.
We have all known for years â and the ongoing public debates on the ratification of our Constitution show this clearly enough â that despite our common efforts to communicate, Europeâs citizens still say that do not know enough about, or are not interested in, the European Union, and do not understand its role and its benefits for them.
Less than half voted in last yearâs European elections.
Apathy and ignorance are enemies of our democratic foundations.
As our latest Eurobarometer reveals, there is a clear correlation between the level of information and the support for the Constitutional Treaty; 75% of those who know the Constitution well declared they were in favour, while the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution is only 22%.
The conclusion is evident: the need to communicate our projects is crucial for the future of the European Union.
Communicating Europe is a highly complex task because European construction is in itself complex; because the European project is an evolving project and because perceptions of the European project vary and are defined, to a large extent, by national history and circumstances.
Moreover, we should never forget that no communication can be better than the policies it wants to communicate.
More than ever before, the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensively.
That is why the Barroso Commission has made communication one of its strategic priorities.
The foremost priority of the present Commission is connecting with citizens.
However, I should like to add that this is not just the Commissionâs responsibility.
In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Member States.
The Commission will therefore put forward a White Paper on communication. It will identify options and possible solutions to the challenges that have been outlined and will be the starting point of a long-term process of structural reform and change in communication culture, involving all actors concerned within and outside the Commission.
The new approach will follow three strategic principles, which are also taken into account in the draft of the Herrero-Tejedor report that you are debating today.
The first involves listening to people and taking their interests and concerns into account; the second, explaining our policies and their impact on peopleâs daily lives; and the third, connecting with people by communicating more and as closely as possible on topics that are of real interest to citizens.
We have identified five main areas for action.
The first is political commitment and ownership.
Commissioners will engage as key communicators about all portfolios.
They will also get involved in better planning and coordination of communication activities, which will concern all levels.
The Commission will better integrate communication into our working culture and into policy formulation.
The second involves professionalising our communications.
That includes providing an effective and service-minded spokesperson service, improving research through polling and surveying and evaluating the impact of our communication activities.
We must make better use of our tools and provide more and better training.
The third concerns connecting with and responding to citizens.
That involves adapting messages and matching national and local concerns â instead of taking a âone-size-fits-allâ approach â and conveying them as close to the citizen as possible.
As proposed by Mr Herrero-Tejedor, that means using contemporary tools, giving priority to those which are more likely to reach the greatest number of citizens, such as television, radio and the internet; using a language that people understand and a more decentralised implementation; using our representations in the Member States as well as our relays and networks in close cooperation with Parliament and the Member States.
Our fourth focus is on adapting the means to the objectives.
I believe we can all agree that communication is a human-resource- and budget-intensive activity.
We will, therefore, need to allocate financial and human resources in a manner corresponding to our goals.
Communication will have to be considered as an in-built cost in all activities.
All of that will be based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of communication activities within the institutions.
Last but not least, the fifth point is that we need to work together.
We need to work with the Member States and with other actors.
A progressive approach, leading to the possibility of forming an over-arching European Union approach to communication based on real coordination and synergies between the institutions, should be established.
However, we cannot forget other key actors, such as national and regional governments and parliaments, civil society and the media, focusing particularly on the regional and local media in the Member States.
The next step will be the White Paper and the results of the broad consultation process we will launch, which will, hopefully, lead to more consistent and efficient communication with Europeans, which is our common responsibility.
Â Â  . âMr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, information builds awareness, while the lack of information diminishes consent.
That is what we learn from all Eurostatâs statistics, from our day-to-day experience of the public, from opinion polls at home and, of course, also from what is going on around the directive on the internal market in services and the debate on the Constitution.
In no way is it my intention to apportion blame here today, nor do I want to demand anything of anyone.
It is for the EU institutions themselves to actually back up with actions what we have been saying in reports for years.
At the same time, this is not a task for the institutions, but rather for the members, the Member States, the MEPs, the officials, the Commissioners, and for us ourselves.
So it is that, further to what Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m so rightly said, there are a number of things I would like to demand of this House.
Firstly, I demand that every Commission proposal should, from the very outset, specify in clear and precise terms what added value for the public the European regulation in question represents.
Secondly, I demand that the Commission should submit to the Council a communication and information plan as part of the package when it is required to decide on any and every European project.
Thirdly, I demand a plan for the Europe-wide training and in-service training of journalists, to be carried out by the European institutions.
Let me say, fourthly, that it is the Council, to my mind, that is the principal cause of this public relations disaster.
There was in the Convention a three-year debate on the drafting of the new Constitution, and the Council and the Member States slept through it.
The Council and the Member States are not discharging their shared responsibility in the European legislative process, so let us do so, not least in our own countries, in providing the public with comprehensive and timely information.
Fifthly, I demand of us ourselves that we use the funds we are left with for information and communication.
It is intolerable that â as happened in Austria â an information document should be issued on the Constitution without any reference whatever, whether in word or image, to either the Members of the European Parliament or the Members of the Convention.
I demand that more use be made of visitorsâ groups, of exhibition and display facilities and of the translation service, enabling us to actually do the things we want to do.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by stressing the importance of this report by Parliament on the application of the European Unionâs information and communication strategy, and I would also like to thank the Commission for its good attitude, since, for the first time, before its presentation, this strategy has been debated with Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to influence its final content, rather than being restricted merely to responding to it.
The objective should be, above all, to keep the citizens constantly and adequately informed, with a view to promoting their knowledge of, and their interest and participation in, the European Unionâs affairs.
The debates going on in the various countries with regard to the approval of the Constitutional Treaty demonstrate that there is a serious lack of knowledge of the functioning, the policies and the work of the Union.
The result of this strategy should demonstrate to the citizens that belonging to the European Union brings them benefits in terms of their everyday lives.
We must act on many fronts, making full use of the citizensâ preferred media, such as television and radio, since these are best able to reach them in their homes, and, in the era of the information society, it is essential that the Unionâs websites appear in the official languages of the Union and also in the languages with official status in the Member States.
The European citizens have the right to full and impartial information on Community affairs, in their own languages, on the basis of respect for and protection of cultural diversity and as a guarantee of their understanding and involvement in the project of European integration.
If we really want our citizens to be informed, I believe it is entirely appropriate to insist that studies relating to the European Union be incorporated into the teaching syllabuses of the Member States, with a view to promoting a sense and an awareness of European citizenship from the outset.
The Unionâs communication strategy has shown itself to be insufficient and defective so far, and it is therefore essential that the Commission take account of the recommendations in this report by Parliament in the communication that it is announcing for this very month, in order to bring the European Union closer to the citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the level of information on Europe available to European citizens is extremely low, and the reason for that is not technical, but political.
We will vote today on a report concerning the European Unionâs information and communication strategy that is seeking to improve the techniques and methods by which the Union promotes itself.
Between these methods and the citizens, however, looms a wall of indifference, which is spectacularly demonstrated by the lowest ever turnout at the elections in 2004: only 45.7%.
That is not only the effect of an insufficient and bureaucratic communication strategy, but of a Europe that is still very remote from its citizens, who do not know how it is made up, how it began, what its purpose is, whom it serves, of whom it is made up, where it is leading us, and whether it is useful or irrelevant to us.
Let us be clear, this Europe is a construction site, and thus it is obvious that its main features are still not visible.
At present, moreover, it is still a union of major economic, commercial and industrial powers, far more so than a union of populations and people.
Its institutional architecture suffers greatly as a result of it, and the spirit issuing from it in no way fosters widespread participation by the people.
It is also as a result of this isolation that there has arisen the bureaucratic narrow-mindedness that has impeded or obstructed its relationship with the people.
In a Europe of such contrasts, there is not much sense, in fact, in having built one-way, vertical information structures from the centre outwards, since this has imposed a uniform and standardised communication model that has not worked.
It is a model, moreover, in which citizens have to seek out information for themselves and not the other way round: this simply means that no information reaches the great majority of the people concerned.
An effective information centre is required, a general staff of communication specialists.
However, the concept of decentralised communication is also required, originating from the various countries and conceiving this communication in terms of different ways of thinking and languages; a concept of communication that is not solely propaganda.
I am convinced that an effective way of informing European citizens on Europe is to emphasise not only its strong points but also its weaknesses, because it is also from those that the real, but not utilised, potential of Europe emerges.
For this reason, , I believe that it would be beneficial for all 25 countries to turn to a referendum, including those countries, such as Italy, that are not bound to do so.
The result does not matter; in the end Spanish, French and British citizens will have a much greater understanding of Italians.
This is a legitimate method of communicating in Europe; legitimate because it is democratic.
Â Â  . âMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am persuaded of the importance of the communication strategy, which must, of course, be more than merely a technical procedure; it must also communicate the spirit and underlying concept of Europe if we really are to win the public over.
We simply have to explain to the public that nowhere in the world is there anything like this project in the development of which we share, that it brings them benefits, that it is all about cooperation, mutual understanding and peace, and that it is political, for only then will we be able to inspire them with any sort of enthusiasm for it.
What we need, then, above all, is to get information to people where they are, using different kinds of information stands, with which we have to make both Parliament and the Commission present to the nations.
I also think more use needs to be made of the opportunities afforded by schools, which would, if appropriate, involve modifying curricula.
I do not see this as propaganda, but as political education and information â in the best sense of the word â focussing on European political integration and on Europeâs understanding of itself.
I also agree with the suggestion that a hotline should be set up, that prizes should be awarded for good ideas, that more journalists should be invited and that now really is the time for us to put the European Constitution campaign centre stage.
There should be more debates in the Member Statesâ parliaments, and in these we too should participate.
There is one problematic aspect that I would like to mention.
We all agree that European information and ideas have to be transmitted via the media, but I am firmly convinced that the right thing to do is to continue â perhaps by means of joint projects â to support existing television stations, such as EuroNews, rather than to set up a Parliamentary TV channel, which I do not think is really going to appeal to people.
Instead, we should support, and concentrate our resources on, the other communication technologies available to us, with which people are already familiar, rather than pour money into a European Parliament broadcasting station, with which we would reach fewer people than if we were to opt for another, cooperative, approach.
Â Â  . â I feel that Mr Chiesa hit the nail on the head when he said that there was an enormous chasm between the European institutions, their leaders and the citizens.
This can be resolved first and foremost by means of good policies and, less so, by means of good techniques.
Where our opinions strongly diverge, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, is that when we say it takes two to communicate, we do not mean that one side provides the information and the other takes it in.
This is a primitive concept that is still prevalent in the opinions expressed by Europeâs leaders.
I should like to make three comments about the report, which makes great efforts to reach points of consensus or convergence.
All culture is communication, yet the reverse is not true.
We therefore disagree that the EU and the institutions can finance fictional works, films and artworks in order to disseminate and promote European ideas.
Commissioned works damage culture, damage creativity and, in so doing, damage Europe.
My second objection concerns the dividing line between information and propaganda.
It is one thing for us in this House to seek to involve the institutions in referendum campaigns, but the truth of the matter is that we are talking here about communication, of which the primary objective is to guarantee the adversarial principle, the right of reply, yet this is not mentioned in the proposal before us.
Thirdly, there is the issue of using public resources and money intelligently.
The concept of a parliamentary channel is bureaucratic and dated.
It is a terrible idea.
Contrariwise, the right way forward is to invest in Euronews, in information built on the foundation of editorial freedom; this is the right way forward, the way in which we can see news stories that we do not like.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I have tabled 25 amendments to this report on the strength of what has been said in this House.
What is the dividing line between information and propaganda?
It is not very clear.
I call on the Commissioner and the citizens of Europe who are following this debate to ponder certain terms included in this report, such as âpersuasionâ, âpromotionâ, and âinsistâ.
Such terms make me fear that the boundaries between information and propaganda are at times dangerously crossed.
The concern that emerges from this is that we are selling the European brand as if we were selling a can of Coca-Cola or a pair of shoes.
If it is the case that in Italy, where they did not want a referendum, citizens are not familiar with the European Constitution, or in Spain, where they actually approved it by a large majority, 80% of Spanish citizens were not acquainted with the European Constitution, I believe that any construction project that starts from the top and not the bottom is inevitably doomed to fail.
Above all, I shudder at what I hear regarding our supposed need for more money and a new publicly owned European television channel, and the need for cash prizes to be awarded to film makers so as to make us proud to be European.
I would point out to Members and to the Europeans who are listening to us that EUR 250 million has already been spent annually on communication on Europe.
This sentiment must originate from the bottom and not the top.
Billions of euros can be invested, but if there is no genuine democratic process then no one will take pride in being European on the basis of a Parliamentary report.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done.
Todayâs debate illustrates that we are still some way from being able to say that the EU institutions provide appropriate information and communicate well with the public.
The information provided must also be reliable, and our citizens must be treated as equals and individuals.
Most importantly, this information must reach those who need it, as well as those who are simply interested in knowing more.
A further problem to be overcome is that information is not always available in all the official languages.
I would add that transparency and a lack of bureaucracy should be the governing principles of information provision.
This is rarely the case, unfortunately.
I should also like to comment on a number of issues relating to the Constitutional Treaty.
As I see it, what is needed is clear and objective information on this Treaty, rather than propaganda, whether for or against.
The Constitutional Treaty is an extremely detailed document, and the result of numerous compromises.
Our citizens should therefore be provided with information they can trust, and the starting point should be good translations.
Â Â  Mr President, this report claims that the Commission has a political responsibility to support ratification of the Constitution.
However, it also calls for Jesuitical schools propaganda and using British taxpayersâ money to support the ratification process.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m told this Chamber on Tuesday evening that people will get what she chose to call âinformationâ about the Constitution, but I doubt it will point out, as eminent constitutional lawyers already have, that the Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States.
Whenever before did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new constitution on them, except after defeat in war?
Nor, I doubt, will the British be reminded that, in our country, the State draws power from, and answers to, the people.
In the European Union, the State now seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it.
Nor will it remind the UK that our rights and freedoms are our birthright.
They are not in the gift, or at the discretion, of a passing parade of political nonentities.
The proposed Constitution has done us a great service: it has crystallised the threat.
We are beyond discussing legislation, and it is time you recognised that you are seeking to become masters in someone elseâs house, and that is intolerable.
Â Â  There is a saying: âWhat we donât know, we fear.â
This applies also to familiarity with the European Union and its institutions.
Yesterday we debated the future of Europe 60 years after the war.
The majority of speakers emphasised in different ways that Europeâs greatest achievements since the war have been preserving peace, reconciliation among nations, cooperation and acceptance of our diversity.
Yet this peace is not a self-evident thing, and we will also need to strive for it in the future.
Democracy is a highly challenging assignment, which allows a person great freedom.
And for that reason it is all the more important to have good, effective and objective information, so that we might more easily make correct and intelligent decisions.
I welcome the appeal to European Union institutions for an improvement in the conditions for accredited journalists and the working relations with them, since the high costs mean that particularly newspaper and television houses in smaller countries cannot afford direct coverage and reporting from the sessions of its institutions or training for their journalists so they might have a greater familiarity with the working of the European Union.
On Spring Day in Europe this year I participated in a number of fascinating events organised in Slovenian schools.
Students together with teachers had prepared cultural programmes, exhibitions and round tables.
At these meetings I gained the feeling that young people are ultimately interested in what we do in the European Parliament, how you can obtain employment in European Union institutions, what jurisdiction the EU has, and what the constitution will mean.
I therefore welcome the proposal that Member States include in their education programmes a familiarisation with European institutions, since no information can be effective if we do not have appropriate prior knowledge of a given topic.
There also needs to be a reworking of the âEuropaâ website, so that all the official languages will indeed become equal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, as we have already heard from many speakers, confidence in the European Union and in its institutions is certainly not as high as it might be.
What underlies this is that great lack of information, of which many of my fellow Members and I are constantly reminded at various events, and with which, indeed, we are reproached, and so it is for us to endeavour to improve matters.
It cannot be right, as we approach so important a decision as that on the European Constitution, that there should be no campaign of information and explanation, or at least no long-term one.
It is irresponsible of us to allow such ignorance in this area, resulting in a great deal of popular disquiet as a result of the various misinterpretations, some of which we have just heard from various sides of the House.
We also have to ask ourselves how efficient our current information and communication strategies are and how many members of the public they reach.
There is a need not only for better cooperation between the institutions but also for structured partnership with the Member States.
None of us can do it on our own.
We need to look at and consider the various technical developments that have been achieved in the fields of radio, television and the Internet.
There should also be more scope for European information in the regions, although this does of course presuppose willingness on the part of those with responsibility for them.
As it is in schools that people are enlightened, and that knowledge is extended and deepened, the education ministers must make it their business to create a permanent place in the timetable for the European Union and its institutions.
We were told yesterday â in speeches that were very different but all good â about how successful we have been in recent years in making European policy and moving the peace project onwards, but we can cope with whatever the future brings only if we involve the public, keeping them informed and expecting them to accept their share of responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fact is that it is not only ordinary people, but also politicians in the Member States, opinion formers and Members of Parliament who know very little about what the European Union is, what it does, what it is for and what decisions are taken here.
Concealing the measures of help to people that have been adopted in the European Union, they in some cases, either through ignorance or bad faith, deliver a single message that consists of explaining that a proportion of the problems they are unable to resolve are due to the EU.
I therefore believe that a communication strategy, as well as many other things mentioned in this report, should in the first place be aimed not only at ordinary people but also at opinion formers and politicians in the Member States, beginning with members of the national parliaments.
Secondly, it should have a clear and very precise purpose: that of bringing it home to people what goes on in the EU.
It should not, as is sometimes the way of things, just be about anthems, flags and varieties of European music, such as the Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony.
It is a question of counteracting the negative publicity of so much national policy by letting people know what takes place in the EU and how it benefits their lives.
Â Â  MrÂ President, information conveys what is happening objectively and is good for a democracy.
PR and propaganda are about selling something for which there is no demand.
The Commission was reasonably successful in maintaining the balance between information and propaganda but, unfortunately, the report is along the lines of more propaganda.
Naturally, there is always a desire to appear in a positive light, but EU institutions need to be classed in the same category as authorities that are obliged factually and correctly to describe rules, laws and the work they do.
I am therefore opposed to paragraphÂ 5, according to which universities are to spread the EUâs values instead of critical thinking, analysis and knowledge.
I object to paragraphÂ 9, which is all about pure product placement, something we usually try to restrict.
The calls for a European Parliament TV channel are unrealistic.
It is better to have fair conditions for public service television and tougher rules to combat media concentration.
Â Â  Mr President, communication is a two-way process.
I sit on the Committee on Culture and Education, which, through its rapporteur, will of course dutifully produce a report for us all to vote on.
I have little doubt that the report will eventually pass through this place and find its way onto the statute books of every Member State.
Is anybody listening â here, in this Chamber, or out there, in the real world?
No one out there can affect that process; no one in here can originate or terminate reports that come our way, so why should anybody care?
But the Commission wants them to care, so it decides to spend millions of euros on propaganda â for that is exactly what this is.
Paragraph 40 summarises the EU strategy of deception and propaganda.
In one breath it is declared that the Unionâs institutions have a duty to inform citizens clearly and objectively about the proposed Constitution, yet in the same paragraph it is decreed that these same institutions have a political responsibility to support ratification.
How, then, can objectivity figure when the final objective has already been decided?
And you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt!
My colleagues in UKIP and I will not be supporting the ratification of the Constitution or this shameful report, which admits the true problem but is designed to overcome it by propaganda and lies.
I have said before, if the EU is the answer it must have been a silly question: that much you can communicate!
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a real gem of official propaganda in which the Commission and the governments surpass themselves in building their new world.
The foundations of European policy are characterised by utopia, demagogy, political correctness and the absence of any reference to the values on which our civilisation is based.
To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EUâs communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a âEuropeâ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder.
Children, obviously seen by the fervent supporters of Europe as being more malleable, are the preferred target of this communication.
A promise is even made to them to define the soul of this new Europe - an odd term, âsoulâ, when you have rejected any Christian references in your draft Constitution.
As a cherry on the cake, the possibility is raised of allocating financial bonuses to media that have apparently been able to communicate the European idea and European values.
Corruption is being reinvented, as it were, but at European level.
That is a good start!
In France, we are well placed to make a judgment about the way you view information.
In the middle of the referendum campaign and in contravention of electoral law, 14Â 000 advertising hoardings have been erected on which selected and abbreviated articles are to be read, urging a âyesâ vote.
We think all this is extremely worrying for the future.
Â Â  â MrPresident, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, only a matter of metres from here stands the Arte Studio, one of the most modern studios in Europe.
It would be appropriate for us, when sitting here in Strasbourg, to cooperate with it in enabling the European public to see what is being done for them here.
Communicating to the European public the added value that this House and its Members provide is one of our most vital tasks.
One of the main problems is that the topics discussed in this House are very complex and wide-ranging, so journalists need incentives if they are to relate better to European issues.
I suggest that we should award prizes for the best journalistic writing about what we do here, about countries and about worldwide issues.
It is, as has already been said, of the utmost importance that we give our attention to journalists and to education.
Again and again, I am surprised by the enthusiasm shown for our work by visitors to this House and by the positive frame of mind in which they leave it.
That should continue to be the case in future.
We should also try to make it easier for schools to access European material in the new library programme that we have developed.
There are a lot of excellent DVDs, which do a very good job of describing the work we do.
Members should be given the opportunity to access these EU-made productions in order to make them available to schools, universities and interested parties.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen,
when I was in PÃ€rnu recently, in my native country, I was touched when an elderly woman came up to me and thanked me for providing information about the European Constitutional Treaty.
It was her request that in future there should be significantly more information about the European Union.
For this reason, I am fully in agreement with rapporteur Herrero-Tejedor that the provision of information about the European Union should be increased.
The rapporteur has drawn attention to the great amount of room for improvement, from the content of the information communicated to a competition for original communication ideas.
I agree with the idea that the mass media should be involved to a greater extent, and naturally the catchword here is television, this being the medium that most influences and engages society.
We should, however, engage in a little introspection.
Do we in Parliament do enough work ourselves?
I would like to illustrate my point with an example.
Since the end of last year, Parliament has lacked a public relations officer who is fluent in Estonian.
For half a year, Parliament has not issued a single Estonian-language press release on its website â it is fortunate that this is the case only for my native language.
At the same time, however, I would like to ask specifically: âWho in Parliament is responsible for this question, and in what way?â
First impressions often shape our perception of things for many years to come.
In the same way, the new Member Statesâ perception of the European Union is being shaped today.
I am convinced that Parliament needs to provide a good example by respecting agreements on cultural diversity and language policy.
The observation of these principles also presupposes continuous Estonian-language media work; in other words, that a sufficient number of public servants and translators and interpreters should be hired from new Member States as soon as possible, in order to ensure a smooth bilateral exchange of information.
Finally, I would like to note the fact that the Estonian media is represented in Brussels by only one correspondent; as a result of this, the absence of Estonian-language reporting at Parliament is doubly bad, and needs to be solved immediately and without delay.
Thank you for your attention!
Â Â  âMrPresident, in Europe is all our hope, but its prospects are not good, to judge by what is said in the debates in those Member States preparing to hold a referendum.
What is the cause of this?
It is not just about the work we do; rather, the cause is to be found in broad public opinion, and particularly the way in which it is reported in the media, for it is primarily they, rather than us alone, that influence the climate within which public opinion is formed, and so that is where we must start.
Much as I am in favour of the efforts to standardise school textbooks and of the adaptation of information to the groups for which it is intended, what matters is that our public relations work â that done here in the European Parliament and also by the other European institutions â should become more professional.
It is still the case, for example, that nothing dramatic happens in this House that might be of interest to journalists and would make the proceedings clearer.
Our votes are held quite separately from our debates.
What this means is that we have to get the fourth pillar of democracy, the fourth of the four powers, the media, more involved.
That is what we must aim for.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor.
Allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on a subject as fundamental as the implementation of the European Unionâs information and communication strategy.
I should like firstly to emphasise the context in which we are led to express an opinion on the EUâs information and communication policy.
A number of us have for some months been closely involved in referendum campaigns for the Constitution.
The very many public meetings in which I participate never cease to bring it home to me how little knowledge many of our fellow citizens have of the European Unionâs basic rules and policies.
I therefore wish to support this report and emphasise three crucial points in it.
First of all, there is a real need to pay greater attention to the content of the messages in order to arouse peopleâs interest on the basis of their individual concerns.
The recent televised debate between President Chirac and young French people again emphasised the degree to which political leaders were struggling to highlight the positive impact of the European Union on our fellow citizensâ daily concerns.
It is obvious, moreover, that only a system of decentralisation can facilitate access to information for a greater number of Europeans.
I should like, for example, to testify in this House to the excellent work done by the European Parliamentâs Marseille-based information office in my region.
Finally, I am convinced that, as emphasised by the report, the information and communication policy will only be effective when knowledge of the European Union and its institutions is integrated as a subject in its own right into the Member Statesâ school curriculums.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is definitely an extraordinary challenge to communicate in a European Union of 20 official languages, with a very complex structure, which is an evolving project.
It is also a political arena with all the different views reflected, as is demonstrated here all the time.
In ending this debate, I would just like to repeat my thanks to you for your views.
From much of what has been said, and some of the very good ideas we have heard, I can see there is convergence with what we are now preparing in the White Paper.
But I must just repeat that communication â and this is also addressed to MrÂ Portas, for example â is a two-way process.
It has to be a dialogue; it has also to involve listening to citizens.
That is my second point and I mentioned it in my introduction.
One of the guiding principles has to be to listen better to citizens and their concerns, otherwise we will not succeed.
I agree with those who have said that propaganda will not work.
Scaremongering will not work either, so I think we have to be very careful in designing our information activities.
I underline what has been said by Mr Karas and others.
This is something for all players.
It has to be integrated at the very start of the process of preparing different proposals.
We have also received some very good ideas including journalist awards.
A number of things have been mentioned that we will follow up.
When our White Paper has been published, we will soon have a chance to come back with a number of these principles and very concrete proposals.
Thank you for the debate.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a brief point to make arising from Rule 126 and those following it in our Rules of Procedure.
Yesterday â in some cases as late as after 11 a.m â meetings that had been scheduled weeks ago to happen between 3 p.m and 5.30Â p.m were cancelled at short notice. This was done at the Presidentâs behest in consequence of the plenary debate due to be held at 3Â p.m.
While I very definitely do see why yesterdayâs debate was so important, I do not understand why I, as chairman of an intergroup, was informed as late as 11.10Â a.m that it was due to be held, while other Members were notified between 8.30Â a.m and 11 a.m.
Nor am I sympathetic when cancellations occur at such short notice and the President, who had given this instruction, was seen, at 4.15Â p.m. in the courtyard within the tower, toasting a number of visitors, at a time when we were required to be in the plenary and were not allowed to gather in the intergroups, working parties and other bodies.
I regard this as unacceptable.
Â Â  I note your statement.
I, for my part, think that it was noted in the agenda, but I shall contact the competent authorities.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 130, 152 or 166 with regard to the delay which is being caused today by the debate.
I do not wish to delay this House for long, because delay is the problem.
However, how much longer are we to go on fixing times for votes, which today was to be noon and then became 12.10 p.m. and is now going to be 12.20 p.m.?
This House should operate properly and within the Rules.
Today there is a strike at Strasbourg airport and many Members are unable to make proper travel arrangements.
The Cash Office tells me that upwards of 150 Members, each Strasbourg part-session, are losing half a dayâs pay because they have to leave early to catch their only flight. I ask that the Bureau of this Parliament consider bringing the votes forward on a Thursday so that we may vote in time to catch aeroplanes.
Â Â  I shall make that request known to the Bureau.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, further to Rule 73 of our Rules of Procedure, I would again like to say that lawyers take the view â as indeed do I â that this reportâs adoption by the committee was not lawful, and that we ought not to be permitted to vote on it now.
I have already made this point on several occasions.
Legal action will be taken.
While I take part in this vote, I do so under protest.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to clarify the situation.
The oral amendments contested by MrÂ Martin were submitted to the committee members one day before voting.
We had voted on several of them, when Mr Martin started to raise reservations on two occasions, without giving a clear Rule as a point of reference.
Therefore, I went ahead with the vote with the full support of my committee.
Â Â  A decision by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has therefore been taken on the basis of ArticleÂ 151, paragraphÂ 3, and we shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the position of the rapporteurs and of the PPE-DE Group is that the amount of the reserves for Parliamentâs estimated expenditure should be reduced by 20 million euro, that is, the amount of the joint general and buildings reserve should be reduced to 70Â 456Â 885 euro, as compared with the 90.5 million euro put forward by Parliamentâs administration.
This reduction in expenditure complies with the policy of thrift, and the Budget Committee has backed it.
The Greens have tabled two amendments, and as rapporteur I would like to draw your attention to the following. In the event that the first amendment by the Greens, concerning increasing the general reserve to 19.5 million euro, is adopted, and if at the same time the Greensâ second amendment concerning the withdrawal of 10Â million euro from the buildings reserve is rejected, the 20% ceiling on European Parliament expenditure will be exceeded.
In order to prevent the ceiling of 20% of heading 5 being exceeded, I call on you to vote against the first and second amendments by the Greens.
Â Â  . As we know, the Aarhus Convention entered into force on 30Â October 2001 and 19 out of the 35 parties to the Convention are EU Member States.
These countries therefore have a special responsibility to create the mechanisms needed to implement it.
Accordingly, at the second meeting of the parties, due to take place in Almaty, Kazakhstan between 25 and 27Â MayÂ 2005, measures must be taken that pursue the legislative work leading to the implementation of its proposals.
In common with the rights already enshrined in the Convention, it is also important to lay down precise provisions ensuring that the public is properly involved in the decision-making process concerning GMOs, and directives guaranteeing public involvement in international fora.
Those provisions and directives will act as an instrument, by means of which the parties can improve public participation, at regional and global level, in other conventions and treaties dealing with issues relating to the environment.
Â Â  We believe that the national parliaments should decide of their own accord upon their respective positions during the conference in Almaty on the Ãrhus Convention.
The Member States need independently to determine their attitudes to participating in the decision-making process concerning GMOs and to establishing a funding system designed to guarantee funding on a predictable basis (paragraph 4).
Those countries that have not ratified the Ãrhus Convention must, of course, take an independent decision as to whether or not they wish to do so.
In our view, the European Parliament should not be lecturing or advising them on this matter.
Â Â  . One of the key factors in developing public policy, and action on a public and private level that is conducive to protecting the environment, is collective and individual awareness of the importance of environmental issues.
This issue, so often wrongly portrayed as a concern held exclusively by left-wing party-political organisations, is by nature an issue that conservative parties and politicians must be, and indeed are, greatly concerned about.
Informed public debate is, moreover, the best way to combat environmental demagogy, which does exist, and those policies that overlook our obligation to the present and, more importantly, to future generations.
Â Â  . The resolution adopted today in Parliament welcomes the decision to hold a Seminar of Governmental Experts, in order to discuss the EUâs role in the fight against climate change, to discuss support for research and development on sustainable energy and to discuss limiting polluting emissions from road, air and sea transport.
We support this, but wish to underline that effective measures must be put in place and the political will must be there for the Commission and the Member States to take part in this effort.
Consequently, proposals must be tabled on a future strategy based on the Kyoto Protocol, on technological innovation and on developing environmental technology.
As the resolution states, we also deplore the fact that various countries have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including the United States of America, which is responsible for most of the emissions.
Lastly, I must point out that there must be greater financial support for adaptation measures in developing countries and the least-developed countries, although it is true that the developing countries should not follow the example of the industrialised countries in terms of pollution.
Given that all countries have the right to appropriate development, they must be granted the necessary backing for that appropriate development to take place.
Â Â  Global climate change constitutes a problem we believe there are good reasons for dealing with at international level.
The EU is one of several international organisations that have an important task to perform in this connection.
We question, however, why the European Parliament needs to call upon the Member States and the future Presidencies to act in a certain way on climate issues.
The resolution contains political views concerning energy issues and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as instructions as to the way in which third countries such as China, India and the United States should act.
We are voting against this resolution.
Our reason for adopting this position is that we believe that the national parliaments should decide of their own accord upon their respective commitments and positions concerning political issues and do so within international organisations.
The report contains exhortations from the European Parliament to the Member States and third countries as to how they should act on the very important climate issue.
That is something to which we object, in spite of a number of good intentions in the proposed resolution.
Â Â  . The Kyoto Protocol is rightly seen as an extremely important instrument in the field of climate change.
It is important, however, that the statements of principle and commitments to meet obligations of various kinds, which are often publicly repeated, are followed up by practical action.
When it comes to the environment, as with most other issues, good intentions are rarely backed up by actions.
Speaking about them is not in any way the same as following them up.
I therefore feel that the way forward is through serious and dispassionate study of the political and geopolitical struggle.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain from voting on this matter.
Many of the wordings are extremely commendable. We object, however, to the EUâs efforts to play a foreign policy role by making declarations concerning humanitarian disasters in the world.
We do not believe that the EU should adopt positions on international issues on behalf of Member States and are of the view that the national parliaments should formulate their own attitudes to international issues.
We support the Swedish Governmentâs position on the Sudan issue.
Â Â  Important though it is to improve the conditions in relation to democracy and human rights in Central Asia, we believe that this is not a task for the EU because this region is not in the EUâs immediate vicinity.
These tasks are better carried out by a pan-European security organisation such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
We welcome the declarationâs wording about strengthening the role of the OSCE but cannot support the declarationâs basic purpose: that of strengthening the EUâs foreign and security policy. We therefore choose to abstain from voting.
Â Â  . As distinct from the experience of the European countries under Soviet domination, most of the countries of Central Asia have not followed a path worthy of our applause or satisfaction; far from it.
Throughout the region, there are sound reasons why we are active in demonstrating our concern and why we are channelling all of our political efforts into creating a large democratic area that is characterised by freedom and respect for human rights.
The EUâs experience, both with countries that have joined the EU and with neighbouring countries, has shown that, on this issue, and in this geographical area, the EU has the potential to exert a positive influence, which it must do with courage and determination.
Â Â  First of all, I would like to thank Mr Elmar Brok, who prepared the draft resolution on this important issue.
The expanded European Union unifies Member States having different histories and past experiences, and they possess different approaches towards relations with Russia.
In this Parliament there are also members with different opinions on this matter, and therefore I would like to express my pleasure that we have succeeded in adopting the resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War by such an overwhelming majority of the votes.
There is not a single family in my country which would not be affected by the soviet occupation.
The second occupation.
Therefore, our resolution adopted today is also about every family in Lithuania.
Thank you, colleagues.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted for the resolution on the sixtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
In this resolution the European Parliament has honoured the soldiers who died on all fronts during the Second World War.
We should note in particular that this resolution consolidates, in written fashion, an understanding of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and the Stalinist Soviet Unionâs dictatorship in eastern and central Europe.
Today we would like to reveal the whole truth about the Second World War, regardless of its unpalatability to any of the parties involved.
I believe that this resolution, which also contains an appeal to make archive documents accessible for research throughout the world, will be a starting-point for substantial joint work in the future.
Fabrications and speculations persist only in the absence of truth.
We must not allow this to continue any longer!
I call for the continuation of investigation into the truth about totalitarianism, regardless of ideology.
I call for this truth to be made public!
Historical truth also demands international condemnation of Soviet totalitarian Communism.
Therefore, in full awareness of my responsibility towards voters from my party, the New Era Party, I voted for this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with regard to the motion on the end of the Second World War, the Italian delegation has voted in favour of the resolution, despite having many doubts about its content.
We voted out of a sense of responsibility and because we recognise that it is the product of a compromise among the various trends within Parliament; we stress, moreover, that it is not the responsibility of Parliament to write, comment on, or confound history.
For this reason, we regret the inexplicable absence in the text of any reference whatsoever to the European Resistance, which played a significant part in the defeat of Nazi-Fascism and in establishing freedom in this continent.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted for Mr Brokâs resolution.
However, bearing in mind that this is a very important step forward, the EUâs historic approach is still not fully balanced and the victims of communism still have a second-class status.
Therefore, for the future, we need to have a complete knowledge of the history of Yalta and its consequences.
This is also important for EU-Russia relations.
We should urge Russia to assess its own history â including the reoccupation and annexation of the Baltic States â and to apologise for the crimes the Russian Soviet totalitarians committed.
Â Â  Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the resolution.
As a German, I am grateful to all those who freed us from National Socialism when we, unfortunately, were unable to throw off its yoke ourselves.
It started by depriving the German people of their rights, blinding many of them, and then plunged nearly the whole of Europe into war and violence.
As a West German, I am grateful to those who liberated us, above all the Americans, without whose presence for decades democracy would not have been able to establish itself within our borders and elsewhere.
Along with the victims who suffered up to and including 8Â May, there were, in Europeâs Eastern half, victims after 8Â May: the innocent victims of a change of dictatorship from National Socialism to the Soviet tyranny that it took 45 years to bring down.
The Russia of today should acknowledge that people from Tallinn to Leipzig, from Warsaw to Varna, could not accept that what the Soviet Union imposed on them after Hitlerâs demise was freedom.
Along with them, the Germans to the east of the three Western zones paid far more for Hitlerâs crimes than we did, for we were fortunate enough to be able, very soon, to play a part in the project that was and still is the answer to all the challenges of totalitarianism: the European Union.
So let us, in future, make a better job of things in Europe!
Â Â  Mr President, the resolution on the future of Europe contains part of the historical truth.
I congratulate our colleagues here.
The remarks made about the War and post-war relations also mention the captive nations left behind the Iron Curtain.
In 1988 and 1991, the Russian people were considered, and often acted, as one of those captive nations, striving for democracy on the same side of the barricades with us, the Baltic nations, against Soviet totalitarianism.
Mr Putin does not remember that because, at the time, he was still acting against Germany.
Todayâs leadership of Russia is not making much of an effort to turn that conception of self-determination from the political and moral status of formerly captive nations to that of a nation.
Therefore, the dismantling of the former captive nations is treated now in Moscow as the greatest tragedy for one of them.
Allegedly, the Russians were different from others in their prisons.
Such a misunderstanding is not just insulting and spiritually destructive for the ordinary Russian people, but also harmful for sincere cooperation.
Mr President, you have a difficult task in this undertaking to urge the current Russian leadership to abandon their legacy of Soviet mindset and stop deploring everyday Russiaâs captivating past.
Our resolution opens the way for that.
Â Â  Distinguished Mr President, I voted for the resolution âFuture of Europe Sixty Years after the Second World Warâ and I want to thank all of my colleagues who supported it.
This resolution is a huge moral satisfaction for all who experienced the sufferings of World War II and any violence after it.
Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten.
I thank on behalf of my father, Å tefan KÃ¡nyai, who experienced almost nine years of hell in a Russian gulag.
It will be a source of knowledge for young people, who, thank God, have not experienced a war, to learn a lesson from the past and build a free and peaceful future of Europe.
Â Â  We object to wordings inserted into the text as contributions concerning the EUâs future and method of working.
There is a belief that the building of a federal EU will create peace, with NATOâs role in Europe and the world being simultaneously reduced.
There are also many other things to add to a resolution dealing with the end of the Second World War.
Canadaâs important role in the final victory must not be forgotten.
Nor should the American presence in Europe in the post-war period be forgotten in the context of preserving peace.
We particularly object to the wordings in paragraphs 1, 7 and 8 of the draft resolution.
In order to honour the victims of the war, we have, however, chosen to vote in favour of the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  . The resolution adopted today by the majority of the Members of this House is not about the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Fascism.
The actual aim of this resolution is to condemn the Soviet Union.
It is an attempt to airbrush out of the picture its decisive role in the defeat of Nazi Fascism in 1945; its defence of peace and its opposition to the brutality of imperialism; its role in the enormous advances in the standard of living of millions of workers; its solidarity with dozens of peoples seeking to gain their independence and sovereignty; and its contribution towards their release from the yoke of colonialism and towards the correlation of forces that took place after the end of World War II.
This Parliament resolution is an appalling and shameful exercise in revisionism.
Among many other serious problems, it is at the very least a distortion of history to say, as the resolution does, that âEuropean integrationâ helped to get rid of fascism in Portugal, when Portugal was a Member of NATO from the outset; when the fascist regime benefited from the connivance of the governments of many countries taking part in the so-called âEuropean integrationâ; and when those countries supported the colonial war effort undertaken by the Portuguese fascist regime.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted in favour of this Motion which commemorates the suffering of the millions who died at the handsÂ of Nazi tyranny.
We fully endorse gratitude expressed in the motion for those who gave their lives in the liberation of Europe.
In particular, we give thanks for the bravery and sacrifice of the millions of British men and women who, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, played such aÂ crucial part in liberating so many people.
We endorse the motion's recognition of the freeing of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism and their fight for liberty.
The enlargement of the European Union to include the former Communist states is something British Conservatives have long sought.
Their role in our future is of vital importance.
However, we requested a number of separate votes in this motion where the text refers to âEuropean integrationâ, a term associated with political integration.
British Conservatives acknowledge that the EU has made a significant contribution to peace among the nations of our Continent.
But, we believe that the EU shouldÂ develop as a partnership of independent nation states, not as a single federal entity.
Â Â  . Today, this House adopted a resolution about the future of Europe 60 years after the Second World War.
The resolution attempts to give an overall analysis of European history over the past 60 years, including Nazism, Stalinism, occupation, freedom, and much more.
Much as I agree with the gist of the resolution, the European Parliament is a political body rather than a congress of historians.
Our role cannot be to type out on a word processor, in the space of a week and a half, an analysis of recent European political history.
We should stick to what we are good at, and it is for that reason that I have abstained from the vote.
Â Â  . Whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the second world war in Europe, this document amounts to a re-write of history, even stating in the title that World War 11 ended on 8th May 1945, which it did not as the world still faced Japan.
The addition of propaganda that the EU is somehow involved in the subsequent peace is objectionable to me and to the seven members of my family who fought in that war against the Axis.
I note that on the schedule this resolution was entitled âFuture of Europeâ whereas the actual resolution is entitled â60th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 8 May 1945â.
The EP should be specific when making resolutions.
For the above reasons, I voted against this resolution.
Â Â  .â We voted against the disgraceful resolution which uses Goebbels' methods to pervert and distort history.
The communists and the Soviet Union, who were at the vanguard of the resistance, the sacrifices and the defeat of fascism, are being slandered by the very political powers which nourished, supported or tolerated the rise of fascism.
Today, in calling the liberation of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Red Army a new occupation, they are giving political support to the restoration of Nazi symbols; they are giving a political alibi to the SS collaborators and fascism in those countries.
Fascism was born of capitalism.
The attempt to pervert history is an attempt to poison the conscience of younger generations, so that they accept the crimes of imperialism today, and to stop them fighting to overturn them.
This rabid anti-communist attack will not stop society from moving towards socialism.
The message of the victory over fascism is alive and topical.
It is directly linked to the united fight of the peoples against imperialist barbarism.
We remember that, however strong the fascist axis appeared to be, it did not avoid being crushed and did not prevent the red flag with the hammer and sickle from being hoisted on the Reichstag, symbolising its defeat by socialism.
The same fate is in store for the unfair, exploitative capitalist system.
Â Â  Distinguished Mr President, I voted for the resolution âFuture of Europe Sixty Years after the Second World Warâ and I want to thank all of my colleagues who supported it.
This resolution is a huge moral satisfaction for all who experienced the sufferings of World War II and any violence after it.
Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten.
I thank on behalf of my father, Å tefan KÃ¡nyai, who experienced almost nine years of hell in a Russian gulag.
It will be a source of knowledge for young people, who, thank God, have not experienced a war, to learn a lesson from the past and build a free and peaceful future of Europe.
Â Â  . We all feel the widespread revulsion at the horrors of World War II, and feel the need to recall what the human race, communities and individuals were capable of doing.
We therefore sincerely share the feeling that this occasion should above all serve to say: never again.
What is more, this is the root of the establishment of the EU.
Other memories should not be overlooked, however.
For the countries of Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic States, the celebration of the end of the war is not exactly a celebration of freedom, in light of the fact that the liberators were the Soviet military, which did not start to leave until 1989.
Consequently, while it may seem irrelevant to mention the Soviet Empire in the same breath as the end of the war, it is not irrelevant from the point of view of that part of the world, given that one blended into the other.
Furthermore, how is it possible to celebrate the liberation, as though pretending that the liberation was not followed by occupation?
We cannot.
If we want peace, we need the truth.
We therefore celebrate the end of the Second World War, but let us not think that the horrors finished there.
Other peopleâs memories must also form part of our memory.
Â Â  I was opposed to this debate ending with a resolution, and I have to say that the poverty of our document confirms my fears.
I have therefore chosen to abstain.
The debate was valuable and enlightening and no doubt one of the most important we have held within this new Parliament, which constitutes an enlarged Assembly following the reunification of Europe.
What we have is a mosaic of histories that together spell History writ large. The debate has been enriched by the vision and perception of all those who have taken part in it and cannot, almost by definition, be the subject of a compromise document.
All those in this House who have already negotiated resolutions of this type know that they are only a patchwork made up of each negotiatorâs contributions.
What may work for the drought in Spain is at a loss to account for the complexity of the most crucial chapter of our European history.
The compromises mean that this document no longer has any force and no longer communicates any message. I personally should have liked it to have concentrated, for example, on paragraphÂ 1, which contains its key message: to be aware of our past so that we never experience anything similar again, to keep this memory alive, to teach people about it and to pass it on.
It is a challenge in anticipation of the day when half of our young people do not even know the name of Hitler.
Â Â  . Whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the Second World War in Europe, this resolution amounts to a re-write of history, even stating in the title that World War II ended on 8Â May 1945, which it did not as the world still faced Japan.
UKIP MEPs have therefore felt obliged to vote against this resolution.
Â Â  . While the Resolution has many positive points, for which I voted in favour, there are significant omissions and false emphases.
The victory of 1945 would not have happened but for the steadfastness and courage of the United Kingdom and the British Empire fighting on alone and holding the German forces at bay for over a year after the fall of France.
The Soviet communists were, of course, allies of the Nazis for the first 20 months of the War.
After the War, the freedom of the West was guaranteed by the continuing engagement of US forces, through NATO, in the security of Europe.
The United Kingdom contributed disproportionately to the success of this enterprise.
And we should not underestimate the enormous contribution of certain key, resolute individuals - Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II - to the eventual collapse of Soviet tyranny.
The anniversary of the end of the War should not be used as another opportunity to eulogise the role of the EU, a Project with some profoundly undemocratic aspects and which is heading in the wrong direction.
The process of European integration is driven by a small political class and is certainly not âthe result of a free decision by the peopleâ.
Â Â  . I reject the resolution for the following reasons.
Firstly, it takes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Germany and Europe as an opportunity to advance revisionist views of history by treating Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as equivalent.
Secondly, this assumption of equivalence minimises the crimes committed by German fascism, notably the extermination of Europeâs Jews; it is evident that the resolutionâs object is to relativise this temporary abandonment of civilisation.
The resolution makes no reference to the decisive contribution of the Soviet Union to the victory over Fascism.
Sixty years ago, the world was liberated from Nazism, in the name of which, and with the support of business and industrial interests and a large proportion of the German people, the incomparably inhumane industrialised destruction of the Jews was decided upon, the whole of Europe plunged into war and millions of people killed.
The most brutal means, including torture and the murder of tens of thousands, was used to put down the anti-fascist resistance, which consisted largely of Communists and Social Democrats.
To take, today, the commemoration of the end of Nazi rule as an opportunity for depicting 1989 as the actual day of liberation, is to trivialise the Nazisâ regime of terror, to slander the Soviet Union and the immense sacrifices made by its people and the Red Army, and to encourage the resurgence of nationalism, right-wing extremism and the growing tendency to relativise the Nazisâ crimes in Europe.
It is quite another signal that is needed, in the shape of an unequivocal and explicit commitment never to allow fascism another chance in Europe.
Â Â  The rapporteur talks in vague terms about upgrading existing services, creating new services, making technical adjustments and expecting âfine-tuningâ and extra resources for information offices, mainly in Romania and Bulgaria.
The text selected for voting on is unclear but can only be interpreted as a request for additional appropriations.
We are opposed to increased expenditure, particularly when it is a question of proposals entailing increased administrative costs and further money for a budget heading that is often used for pure propaganda.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  For 2007-2013, the European Commission proposes approximately EURÂ 1Â 000 billion in appropriations for seven years, that is, commitment appropriations to the tune of 1.24% of Europeâs GDP.
In terms of European budgetary expenditure from 2007 to 2013, our committee entered into a simple accounting debate about whether, over seven years, EURÂ 1Â 022 billion was to be expended, as desired by the European Commission, EURÂ 987 billion, as proposed by our rapporteur or EURÂ 977 billion, as desired by those countries that are the biggest contributors.
Instead of losing EURÂ 3Â billion each year, France may lose EURÂ 5Â billion or even EURÂ 7Â billion.
At USDÂ 2Â 500Â billion per year, the United Statesâs annual budget is 20 times greater than Europeâs.
That says it all: Europe, with its global agenda and minuscule budget.
Seeing this, everyone appreciates that this distortion will be untenable.
As from 2014, two issues will arise: the explosion in the European budget and the advent of taxation.
These are the two areas on which our committeeâs resolution is silent, leaving the taxpaying electorate to vote on the European Constitution while remaining oblivious to the budget.
Â Â  . This report on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2006 falls within the scope of consolidating the last enlargement and preparing for the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
Given that it proposes to make more efficient and streamlined use of budgetary appropriations, to make the next budget more comprehensive and better explained with a view to bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, and to enhance the quality and efficiency of its work, I have decided to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  We are in a new cycle of international trade negotiations.
It is staggering that we were continuing to negotiate for ever more liberalisation of world trade without ever properly taking stock of this liberalisation in economic and social terms.
The European Union is the only political entity in the world that respects the WTOâs rules.
It is the most open market there is, and the least protected against, for example, dumping, unfair practices and counterfeiting.
It too often refuses to take the required retaliatory or safeguard measures, as in the case of Chinese textiles.
At the same time as opening our economies to out-and-out competition from around the world, the EU increases the number of regulations that put our companies at a disadvantage in the face of such competition. It also makes scarcely any effort to open up to European exports those markets that are closed to them due to exorbitant customs tariffs or regulatory barriers.
The ECB does nothing for the rate of the euro, which is notoriously overvalued, is a drain on our exports and still facilitates low-price imports.
The rapporteur is right.
World trade is not fair.
With the collusion of the Commission, its main victim in terms of unemployment, an increase in poverty, company closures and the undermining of social stability is, however, Europe.
Â Â  We support the reportâs general purpose: that of liberalising international trade.
This is something that must not, however, jeopardise basic social and environmental requirements.
We also support the calls to phase out the export subsidies in the EUâs common agricultural policy (CAP) and give the less developed countries quota- and duty-free access to the EUâs market.
These calls are incompatible with the wording in the report to the effect that âthe European agricultural modelâ must not be questioned (paragraph 16).
The liberalisation of trade policy must go hand in hand with fundamental reform of the CAP.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote in favour of the report on the assessment of the Doha Round following the WTO agreement.
The general tenor of this report is constructive, because Parliament is giving its support to free and fair multilateral trading systems within the framework of sustainable development.
We cannot, however, support paragraphs 16 and 17.
The planned reform of agricultural policy is absolutely necessary because it is a first step on the way towards fair world trade.
We are opposed to all the attempts to make it more difficult for developing countries to sell their products within the EU.
Access by the developing countries to the EUâs market must be given priority over continued agricultural aid.
Â Â  . The agreement reached in Geneva, July 2004 was vital for keeping the Doha Development Round on track.
However, the Geneva agreement merely set out a roadmap.
The really difficult decisions are still to be made.
The EU must show serious intent with regard to ending agricultural subsidies.
Third countries must make concessions on market access for non-agricultural products.
Pressure must be removed from developing countries as regards services and the so-called Singapore Issues.
A successful agreement on world trade this December in Hong Kong could do much to reduce poverty and despair in the world.
Â Â  . The development of international trade is one of the most effective weapons in the fight against inequality between countries.
The surest way for people to achieve progress, peace and human development is for them to have the opportunity to produce, to place what they produce on the world market and to be able to acquire new products, based on fair competition rules, on proper monitoring, on respect for the principles of defending human rights, on protecting the environment and on sustainable development.
It is therefore up to governments to act responsibly, with determination and with awareness of the importance of what is at stake.
Â Â  . The implementation of the European Union's information and communication strategy is of the greatest importance given that public awareness of EU matters has in the past often been affected by a lack of consistency, particularly in Member State government dissemination of information, and by polemical reporting in some sections of the press.
I shall be recommending to my national delegation colleagues that they abstain on the overall vote for a number of reasons including the section of the report concerning ratification of the European Constitutional Treaty.
This must primarily be a matter for each Member State to decide.
It is by its very nature a controversial issue and public opinion could be unduly influenced one way or the other if it were felt that pressure were being exerted from non Member State sources.
Â Â  . A good information and communication policy should improve citizensâ perception of the EU by raising their awareness of the European dimension of citizenship and by showing them the practical benefits in their day-to-day lives of belonging to the Union.
I regret that the EUâs information and communication strategy has fallen well short of its objectives.
According to Eurobarometer, the level of public knowledge of basic EU matters is very low and there was a record low turnout for the last elections to Parliament.
I therefore endorse the idea of creating a decentralised information system, whereby the information goes looking for the citizen.
This will be complemented by an interinstitutional strategy aimed at strengthening the EUâs image and at stepping up cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, in order to make the best possible use of human and material resources.
This must also involve the Member States and national governments, in conjunction with the European institutions, so that we can derive the maximum benefit from the institutionsâ common strategy, and thus ensure maximum impact at local and regional level, which would be to the benefit of the Union and all of its citizens.
Â Â  . The EUâs information and communication strategy must always be objective and respect pluralism, cultural diversity and human rights.
The events we have witnessed, particularly recently in the context of the so-called draft constitutional treaty, have been examples of neither objectivity nor pluralism.
What we have seen is a major propaganda campaign that does not respect pluralism and the different opinions held by the Members of this House, nor does it take into account the spectrum of opinions held by the public.
This report is a clear example of manipulation dressed up as the EUâs information and communication strategy.
Take Article 40, for example: âhave the political responsibility to support the ratification of the Constitutionâ.
This disregards the fact that people have different opinions, even when it is known that in various Member States around half of the public is opposed to this draft constitutional treaty.
It also overlooks opposing opinions.
Unfortunately, various proposals that would have improved the report were rejected in the vote in plenary.
We therefore had no choice but to vote against.
Â Â  What is âfactualâ information and what is âfalseâ information about the EU?
What is information about the âEuropean ideaâ?
Obviously, information about political institutions bears the imprint of political values.
Facts can be distorted, and a mere selection of facts can be presented in order to influence people.
