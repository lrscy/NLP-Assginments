MrÂ Straw, the December Summit will be the last chance to provide Europe with a substantial budget and to thus give hope back to all those who believe in Europeâs future.
Yet, this will also be the last useful moment for the British Prime Minister if he is not to go down in history as the man who contributed to the failure of Europe and if he is not to go down in history as the one who deliberately turned the page on Europeâs political union.
Â Â  Mr President, if I may say so, Mr President-in-Office, the Hampton Court Summit was the biggest embarrassment that any Presidency has ever come up with.
Far from making progress with the pressing problems of the Financial Perspective and the debate on the Constitution, these items were removed from the agenda.
Even its chosen theme of âSocial Europeâ was one to which the Summit found itself unable to do justice.
There was no discussion of any of the policy instruments for a social Europe, whether minimum standards, labour legislation or the means whereby unemployment and social exclusion may be done away with.
What you have proposed, Mr Straw, is particularism, and does nothing to advance the cause of social Europe.
Instead of action, you offer only ideas; instead of pro-active measures to address globalisation, you have come up with knee-jerk responses like this idea for an anti-shock fund.
Our aim, though, must not be the creation of a backward-looking Europe, but rather of a Europe that can face the future with confidence.
Â Â  â It is not enough simply to note that there are social problems in the EU and around the world.
As my group said at the informal meeting held at the end of October, it is crucial that we analyse these problems and change the policies that are at the root of this problem.
The truth of the matter is that what we have heard here offers no assurances that policies will be changed, even though it is widely acknowledged that there is growing discontent among the citizens and that there are serious social tensions in a number of countries, right here in the EU.
Rather than much-needed proposals to provide an adequate response to these serious social problems, the Council puts the accent on the all too familiar neoliberal blueprint, namely the Lisbon Strategy, with its liberalisations and privatisations of public services, along with even more precarious working conditions.
The infamous proposal for a directive creating an internal market for services is one such example, as, in some cases, is the Stability and Growth Pact, hammering a further nail in the coffin of the workers and the small and medium-sized enterprises.
As competition is seen as the be-all-and-end-all, precedence is always given to measures aimed at creating competition between workers in order to try to drive salaries and other social benefits further and further down.
Hence the emphasis on greater labour flexibility, mobility and support for relocations, which shed jobs and lead to greater unemployment and a more precarious labour market.
As demonstrated by the huge growth in the profit margins of the major economic and financial groups in the EU, current policies are essentially geared towards pandering to the wishes of the Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of Europe (UNICE).
What we have heard today follows the same script.
Even when people talk of creating a favourable environment for companies, we all know that the companies in question are only the large ones.
Mr Mandelson made this perfectly clear here yesterday in the answers he gave regarding concerns about the consequences of the liberalisation of international trade in industrial sectors that are vitally important to the countries of Southern Europe, such as textiles, clothing and footwear, which are being used as a bargaining chip in World Trade Organisation negotiations to obtain benefits for high-tech sectors and services.
This is a trend that must be reversed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the Heads of State or Government meeting at Hampton Court were debating in a vacuum.
On the great social, economic and political issues, which have been mentioned in many of the previous speeches, the results achieved were decidedly sparse.
While cities are burning across half of Europe, I feel it is terrible that they should talk in such general and imprecise terms about immigration and about the social and economic crisis, which are in fact the cause of what is happening in Paris, Strasbourg and Brussels.
The challenge that the young rioters have set us is, instead, a very serious threat, and one that we should consider carefully when we talk about immigration.
I certainly do not mean to put the blame on those young people, but rather on those who drew up these mistaken policies, those who still talk about immigration in such bureaucratic, general and superficial terms.
We have fallen short in the immigration challenge.
Our immigration policies have been a failure for Europe, and I consider it our duty to acknowledge the fact and to debate it.
I believe this summit should have set an example in this respect, and the solution proposed by the Commission â allocating a fistful of cash to the Paris â is not, in my view, an adequate answer.
Instead we need to address the causes, change our policy and stop making insane decisions, such as making it easy for people to bring in their families or even easier to take up nationality.
In essence, what we need is a sensible immigration policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the talks held by the Heads of State or Government at Hampton Court represent a significant acknowledgment of the difficulties that the European Union is currently undergoing.
The fact that the 25 have recovered their composure after the tensions of recent months and that they are willing to bring the negotiations on the financial perspective to a close by December should be seen in a positive light.
I should like, however, to draw the Councilâs attention to the fact that agreement must not be reached by taking the lowest common denominator and, above all, that Parliamentâs position must not be ignored.
The priorities identified by Tony Blair for revitalising Europe â research, innovation and life-long learning â are proposals worth endorsing and are in fact contained in our report on the financial perspective.
In addition, the need for a European energy policy, the increase in Community aid for immigration transit countries and the globalisation compensation fund are priority aims for Europe, though they require adequate funding.
The citizens of the Union are aware that no government on its own can provide answers to the most serious of todayâs problems, such as unemployment, the lack of job stability, the loss of competitiveness, international terrorism and illegal immigration.
Only Europe can respond effectively and guarantee well-being and security for our countries.
A meagre budget will not allow us to address these challenges, but the October European Council was an encouraging start.
That is why we are looking to the December summit with moderate optimism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have looked up the word âinformalâ in my French dictionary.
Informal, in French, means badly formed and inelegant.
This adjective was used by Montaigne in 1580 to describe something that was difficult to define.
I will let you be the judges of the Hampton Court summit and the ghost of Catherine Howard.
You have not had much luck in the UK Presidency.
France has said no and the United Kingdom is being asked to relaunch Europe.
I think that is asking a lot.
Having said that, over a number of years, a number of landscapes have opened up to our citizens, with which they have been living and have had to live, namely the reunification of Europe, the Constitution, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the single market and the single currency.
When I think of our fellow citizens, I have the feeling that Lisbon is not fulfilling this role.
Today, there is a vacuum.
When it comes down to it, I do not dispute the priorities of the summit: that is not the problem.
The real problem is the connection with the citizens: it is as if there used to be something we shared that has now disappeared.
I think that the next summit or the ones after that should enable us to rediscover a landscape that we can share with our citizens.
Of course, this brings to mind the cohesion of the 25 Member States, which is sometimes called the Marshall Plan for those who are joining us, because endless enlargement and greed for funding do not escape the notice of the citizens.
That is no good at all.
In my opinion, it would be worthwhile, in spite of everything, to restore the word âharmonisationâ to the European vocabulary, given that it is, so to speak, an endangered species; this is also unfortunate, all the more so as there are still areas that need to be harmonised.
We are not going to harmonise everything, but it is still possible to make progress in certain areas.
And if we forget to do this, if we neglect this word and this value, the citizens will distance themselves from us.
Finally, another topic is close to my heart, that of exchanges between young people.
I have looked at the statistics.
In 2005-2006, Europe is funding 280Â 000 young people as part of three programmes: Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo.
However, there are 58Â million of them.
Multiplying the corresponding budget by 10 would not cost us too much, particularly given that it is on these young people that we must stake European awareness.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to deal with two specific points and then comment more widely on the debate.
Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen asked me about the Court of Auditors and she asked for a yes or no answer.
My apologies, but I have to give a yes and a no because this matter is in the hands of finance ministers, and you know what they are like!
The answer is that the Ecofin Council on 8Â November adopted conclusions listing a range of actions for both the Commission and Member States.
They talked about a roadmap which they said was vital, not least because it focuses greater attention on Member Statesâ responsibility to improve their systems of auditing and to take responsibility for the money spent in their countries.
My judgement is that where Member States have control of the money, they ought properly to account for it as well.
If they do not have control of it then the European Union will have to account for it, but I am with you on encouraging our finance ministers to get a grip on this.
Nevertheless, this is the responsibility of the Commission and of this Parliament together.
We all have responsibility for this.
On the issue of transparency, which Mr Kirkhope raised with me, we will shortly be circulating an options paper with ideas for improving transparency, and essentially will be putting two options before the Council.
It will be up to the Council to take a decision on the basis of a simple majority, as with all procedural issues, so I am glad to be able to satisfy you in this respect, Mr Kirkhope, if not in any others.
Colleagues here have been very frank, so I will be frank in return.
My problem with what a number of colleagues have said is that people refer to the need for change and then say that the future for the European Union nevertheless lies in the past.
All I can say to colleagues here is that globalisation is a fact of life.
The French, my comrade friend, may not like it, but we either have to deal with it or it will engulf all of us.
I did not invent it, President Barroso did not invent it and nor indeed did President Chirac, but it is a fact of life.
It has come about as a result of other policies that we have pursued over many years, namely to build up the World Trade Organization, to encourage free trade and to lift countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America out of poverty, meaning that they now want to share in trade and they want to work to their competitive advantage, just as we have done in the past.
That means that the old European economic and social model will not work to deliver prosperity, social justice and jobs in the way it used to.
This is a big challenge, especially, if I may say so, for the country you represent, and for a number of others on the continent.
However, I simply do not understand why you continue to clutch at old methods, such as inflexible methods of labour regulation, including the Working Time Directive, which may have worked in the past but which cannot work for the future.
France is a country which knows that, and it is for that reason there is a higher level of evasion in France than in other countries.
France is one of those countries which goes in for saying, as we understand it, that people can be assessed on whether they work 48Â hours a contract rather than 48Â hours an employer.
We do not want to be lectured about our employment practices when we enforce the law, even if it is inconvenient, by countries which bang the drum for enforcement and then go through the back door to ensure that the law is not enforced.
This is a fact, and this Parliament undermines confidence in its own measures if it turns a blind eye to what is going on when everyone knows that this has happened.
Moreover, it is better to be flexible.
There is no European-wide requirement to set a minimum wage, which in my view is a fundamental human right.
There is no requirement on it, however, and it is left to national governments.
Some countries have a minimum wage and some do not, so why should there be a requirement across Europe regardless of national circumstances and the nature of employment contracts, to set limits on working hours when the test for that ought to be health and safety?
The countries that apparently have slightly longer hours actually have a better health and safety record than some other countries, including, my friend, your own.
Turning to the important issue of the budget, I listened very carefully to President Barrosoâs speech.
He said that the defining issue of the British Presidency will be the financial perspective, which is a test of whether Europe is on the move.
It certainly is a test of whether Europe is on the move, but we do not regard it as the defining issue.
If you asked me to bet on what historians will judge to be the defining issue of this Presidency in ten or twenty yearsâ time, I would not bet on it being whether or not we reached agreement on the financial perspective in December, although I hope we do.
I think it will be judged on the fact that on 3Â October we agreed to start negotiations with Croatia and Turkey.
That is what will help to shape Europe for the future.
I would remind colleagues that the last financial perspective was not agreed until the equivalent of the March Council 2006, rather than the December Council 2005.
We very much hope that we can reach agreement, but it is going to be difficult.
Why?
Well, Mr Jonckheer spoke of not allowing this issue to be dominated by national egos.
I agree with that but would say to colleagues â and they know this to be true â that this debate is bound to be dominated by the different national perspectives and by whether a country has traditionally been a high contributor or a net recipient of funds from the European Union.
That is a fact.
If one ignores that or abuses those of us â including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and a number of other Member States whose citizens have real concerns about the amount they have paid in the past and the amount they will pay in the future â by saying that this is all about national egotism, we will not get anywhere.
I would remind those colleagues from Belgium that their country has been a net recipient, despite the fact that it is a wealthy country, and will continue to be so under any of the exemplifications of the budget between 2006, 2007 and 2013.
Luxembourg â a country that I like very much â is the richest country in Europe but will continue to be a net beneficiary.
If we were in that happy position we would be saying to the Presidency: âCome on, do a dealâ.
If the only issue was whether we ended up with EURÂ 3Â billion or EURÂ 6Â billion in our pockets, that would be easy.
The problem, however, for a number of Member States â and not just the United Kingdom â is that we have historically been very high contributors.
I am just saying this so that colleagues can understand the problem we have within the United Kingdom.
We might as well lay our cards on the table and be frank.
The problem is that over the latest financial perspective the UK has paid EURÂ 39Â billion, France has paid EURÂ 28Â billion, Italy has paid EURÂ 24Â billion and Germany has paid EURÂ 77Â billion, which is another extreme.
However, the UK has still paid EURÂ 39Â billion, which in population terms is much more than those other two countries.
Spain has benefited by EURÂ 48Â billion and Portugal by EURÂ 14Â billion, so that puts a different perspective on things.
I agree that we have all got to pay our way for enlargement.
With any, even the most minimal, change to the financial perspective, or no change at all, the United Kingdom would be paying another EURÂ 11Â billion â getting on for another third more â towards the next financial perspective to pay for enlargement.
The issue is not whether the United Kingdom or the better off countries pay a bit more for enlargement â though some better off countries would not pay anything extra â but of how much more one pays in a context in which the United Kingdom has, over the last 20Â years, paid 2.5 times the equivalent of say France or Italy, notwithstanding the fact that our GNIs have been equivalent over that period.
That is the problem.
We are working through it.
We see our responsibility as being to the Union as well as to our publics.
No one can accuse my Prime Minister of not being courageous or of not being very committed to this Union, as we have done a great deal.
I just wanted to make that clear so that everyone understands the difficulties we all face.
The last thing point I wish to make, on a more hopeful tack, is that President Barroso spoke very eloquently about the fact that the European Union has to do less in some areas and more in others, and I think that is exactly the right way of looking at things.
This is not about a minimalist Europe, because Europeâs achievements have been astonishing over the last 60Â years when one recalls the condition of conflict which had characterised Europe for three centuries prior to that.
When I look around other areas of conflict today, particularly the Middle East, with horror, it reminds me of the Britain that I grew up in as a young child just after the war and of the even worse conditions that existed on the Continent.
That is the European Unionâs achievement.
What we have to do for the future, however, is to build on that achievement and recognise that the challenges are a little different.
One of the areas in which we can do the greatest good, and are doing so with the great leadership of Javier Solana and the Commission, is in the field of foreign, defence and security policy.
Take what was agreed yesterday by Condoleezza Rice and Javier Solana.
Take the fact that the European Union is now the third party in that agreement to allow Palestinians to travel in and out of Gaza and the West Bank.
We were not always regarded by the government of Israel as the third party in such matters.
Take what we are doing together with respect to Iran, take the joint declaration we have just agreed with Afghanistan and take the tangible increase in aid of Africa.
It is here that we can see real progress being made by Europe collectively.
It is in this area, as well as in many others, that we need to do more, and at the same time rebalance what the Union does compared to what national, regional and local government does in respect of domestic policy.
This Presidency has been a great privilege for us, Mr President.
I have certainly enjoyed it, and I look forward to another six weeks of interesting times here in Strasbourg, Brussels and in other cities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the UK Presidency and Tony Blair are actually victims of the great expectations that the UK Prime Minister raised in his speech to this Parliament on 2Â July.
Obviously, the greater the expectations, the greater the subsequent disappointment.
Time is running out, results are thin on the ground, and I do not think the UK Presidency should be surprised at the criticism that Parliament is levelling at it in this debate.
In fact, rather than an informal Council, this was an insubstantial Council: instead of debating the European social model last month, as it should have done, it found itself holding a discussion about the four corners of the world, without coming to any decision.
I am not going to set fire to myself in public for the Constitution, but I think that the limitation of having six-month presidencies is emerging very clearly.
Every presidency in fact inherits the previous presidencyâs agenda and adds a new layer of commitments, thus increasing the list of decisions to be made and reducing the chapter of decisions adopted.
We continue to add ingredients to the cake, but the cake never leaves the oven.
I should like to mention an example that I put to President Barroso yesterday evening.
It is true that Europe has been through other severe crises in the past.
I am not nostalgic for the Europe of six, nor do I believe there is a golden age to long for.
However, when your girlfriend leaves you when you are 18, life seems very harsh but you know that things will carry on anyway, whereas when a marriage fails at the age of 45, with five children and a mortgage to pay, everything is more complicated.
It seems to me that Europeâs situation at this point in time, post-enlargement and pre-Constitution, resembles the second case much more than the first.
I am not frightened of the institutional crisis, the financial perspective or the Lisbon Strategy in themselves, but I am afraid that all these elements together may be extremely damaging to the European Union.
The UK Presidency still has six weeks to bring its work to a close, and I hope it will be able to leave a positive message for tomorrowâs Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, normally I would complain that one minute is not enough to sum up a presidency in its latter stages, but not in this instance.
UK Presidency: no progress.
It is interesting that Mr Straw commented on the sparse attendance here and made an extremely limp attempt to be humorous about it.
The fact is that most of my colleagues had better things to do than to listen to him give the same speech today that Tony Blair gave at the start of the Presidency and then repeated with minor variations just a couple of weeks ago.
I had hoped, had Mr Straw still been here, to ask him the same question that Mr Alexander failed to answer when I put it to him directly a couple of weeks ago, but I will ask it again.
Will the UK Presidency give an assurance that the interests of Scotlandâs fishing communities will not be traded away in the interests of something more important to Whitehall in the mess of horse-trading it has stored up for itself for the December Council, and for the subsequent Fisheries Council, which will be almost the last act of the Presidency?
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I object in principle to the setting up of the so-called globalisation fund as a response to the challenges of globalisation.
This is simply sweeping the problem under the carpet, and indicative of the populism of politicians who are afraid to tell the citizens the truth that globalisation is, was and will be here to stay, and that while it may lead to some job losses it will also, and in particular, lead to fresh job opportunities being created.
There is much to be gained from globalisation, but only in a flexible free market environment in which working is worthwhile.
European policy is often at variance with this idea, inviting citizens to be passive and sometimes even rewarding laziness.
The EUâs share of world trade has dwindled over the past 10Â years, while that of the United States, and in particular China and India, has skyrocketed.
This is how the free market rates the EUâs policies, and yet the leaders of the 25 once again react with redistribution policies, which might act as a sticking plaster for the present, but under no circumstances are they a long-term remedy for the future.
I am convinced that instead of wrangling over the protectionist globalisation fund, the EU Member States should as a matter of urgency reform their labour markets.
Putting off such reforms undermines public support for free market policies and creates a breeding ground for nationalism, xenophobia and racism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Alexander, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is facing an identity crisis, a loss of its values and general disillusionment.
For the first time in a long while, Europeans are afraid that their childrenâs standard of living is going to be lower than theirs.
How can we react and provide a response to these major worries?
The Hampton Court summit claimed to be a stage in these considerations.
I am afraid that it produced very little in the way of concrete results since, even if the questions raised were justified, specifically âdo one or more European models exist in a globalised world?â, the response given to this question lacks clarity, to say the least.
Europe has been plunged into this crisis because it does not know what it wants.
It is divided: for some, the sole aim is to turn it into a commercial area without customs barriers, in short a Europe running behind the train of globalisation with an endlessly expanding Union.
Others have a different vision, a political ambition for Europe to be defined by its borders and by its projects, in order to assert itself and to share its humanist values in an unstable world.
French MEPs belonging to the (UMP), like the vast majority of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have made a clear choice to fight for the latter vision to prevail, aware of the challenge to which we must rise.
Franceâs proposals, broadcast throughout the EU by PresidentÂ Chirac on the eve of the summit, have the merit of placing the emphasis on the need both to complete the single market, to promote solidarity between the Member States and to guarantee the emergence of a Europe of grand designs.
In order to contemplate a relaunch of Europe, however, the European Council must first remove a basic obstacle, because, given that almost all of the Member States have reached a common opinion on the financial perspective 2007â2013, on the basis of the negotiations undertaken by the Luxembourg Presidency, they absolutely must reach an agreement by the end of the year.
Any other debate would be nothing but guesswork.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to raise a point of order, in accordance with Rule 65(c), if I remember correctly.
We have just been listening to the British Foreign Minister.
I would like, via your Presidency, to ask the Conference of Presidents the following question.
My colleague has just spoken for one minute.
Her Britannic Majestyâs Minister with responsibility for European affairs is with us.
How can the European Parliament allow itself to be limited to just one minuteâs speaking time to respond to him?
Could you perhaps speak to your colleagues in the Conference of Presidents, to decide what approach should be taken in future?
Â Â  Thank you MrÂ Beazley, I think we have understood your argument.
It is the political groups that divide up the speaking time.
If they want to give their main speakers 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, they have the right to do so, and the opposite is also true.
The time taken by the Commission and the Council is not counted, but both of them, I have observed, are careful not to abuse this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who have appreciated and still appreciate the efforts made by this Presidency to try to revitalise Europe, with its hopes and its challenges, at this difficult time.
It has done so through actions and commitments, including practical ones.
I refer to the positive outcome of the Turkish question, which would not have been possible without a strong commitment from the UK Presidency, and to its ability to give direction, vision and some clear objectives that were subsequently put into practice, at least potentially, at Hampton Court, namely universities, energy, security and defence policy.
Precisely from looking at those great ambitions and the few concrete results achieved, however, I must say that I am increasingly convinced â and I invite you all to reflect on this as well â that there is an enormous contradiction between the potential of that Europe and the illusion that such results can be achieved by a Europe that has less money than it needs and, above all, is unwilling to change its rules.
What I mean is that, even if we only want to achieve half of those objectives and we want to treat each other fairly, we have to deal thoroughly with the core issues of the crisis.
Addressing those issues implies having more resources, which will have to be used better; it also implies having less intergovernmental Europe and more integrated Europe, more political Europe, meaning new rules for the Commission, precisely so that we can achieve the objectives that we have already set ourselves.
The only possible way forward now is to design a new institutional architecture and to share policies to an ever greater extent.
Maintaining the , which is perhaps the UK Presidencyâs greatest achievement, will inevitably lead to a renationalisation of policies, aggravating the crisis, increasing governmentsâ powers of veto and diminishing the ability of summits to reach decisions.
I hope, therefore, that these six months will succeed in convincing even the most sceptical that it is not enough to have good ideas and to show willingness: we must also realise that either we have the courage to change by taking a leap forwards along the road to integration, or we die.
Â Â  Mr President, I would be fascinated to know at what stage the British Presidency realised that to have adopted as its logo a flight of birds heading towards Europe was a mistake!
If the British Presidency does not secure a deal on the future budget perspectives, it will not be regarded as a success.
I agree that movement has to be made on the issue of agriculture.
While the British Presidency has to recognise that, at some point, it is going to have to compromise, it is also important for other Member States to realise that they must give too.
At some point the French â above all, it seems â must give something to enable those seeking a deal to be able to point to future changes and reviews of the agricultural policy, not just to help the UK out of a difficult situation but to help the world secure an agreement on the Doha Development Round.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you are aware of the increasing impatience with your presidency and of the growing sense of disappointment.
Your period in office may well not yet be at an end, but most of it is already over.
It is not only Tony Blair whose absence we regret, but I do wonder whether he had perhaps recognised at last that there is more to a successful presidency of the Council than two good speeches.
Above all, though, we regret the lack of concrete results, constructive proposals, and serious negotiations with this House in order to resolve problems and hammer out answers to peopleâs questions.
The only way we will create trust is with a new togetherness and sustainable solutions.
It may be that your Foreign Secretary let something slip when, instead of looking forward, he said, âThe important thing about this Presidency â Croatia and Turkey â is already behind us.â
Let me ask you this: are those really the things that the people of Europe see as priorities?
Are those really the issues for the people who have no work, or for the Europe that must be made more competitive?
No, I say, they are not.
Perhaps they have their priorities wrong.
Declarations of intent alone do not make for a successful Presidency.
All six of the points that emerged from Hampton Court may well be right, but most of them are not things that the European Union has the powers to deal with.
If you want us to achieve the things that you yourself postulate, then give us the powers, give us the money, and do not stand in Europeâs way as it moves towards political union, or in the way of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Let me turn to the Financial Perspective.
Between your proposal and our own there is a difference of EURÂ 70 billion.
Between your proposal and the Treaty, there is a difference of EURÂ 2 billion.
Between your proposal and the Commissionâs, there is a difference of over EURÂ 100 billion.
Tell the people what it is that you intend taking away from them before you start pretending to be on their side ...
Â Â  Mr President, the Hampton Court summit showed that the European Union needs fundamental reform.
The European Union needs to harmonise research and development, to significantly increase expenditures on education, to liberalise services and put in place a common European energy policy, and it needs all of these at the same time.
We have the diagnosis, but European leaders have so far failed to provide the answers.
We know what we should do, but not how these aims can be achieved.
We do not have the resources to do it either.
We cannot have more Europe with less money.
Agreement has still not been reached on the Financial Perspective 2007â2013, which could be a disaster for us, the new Member States, as we stand to lose two-thirds of our possible financial support.
This is why the financial directive is so important for us.
I also think it is important, since Mr Tony Blair has attacked the common agricultural policy, that the way forward for us is not to demolish existing Community policy, as cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy are major achievements of the European Union.
Rather than demolishing these, more Community policy should be implemented in other areas.
The big question is how to do all this.
Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny proposed that, alongside Community policies, we should establish coordinated cooperation, which would mean harmonising national policy in the different areas.
This would not mean new Community policies, but would help to improve cooperation, be it on energy, be it on research and development.
I call upon Mr Barroso and the Commission: let us help Europe heal its current crisis and let us move forward in the area of coordinated cooperation.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the British are famous for their nerves of steel, their reserve, their calmness, their peculiar sense of humour and also for their emotional self-restraint.
I was therefore very surprised to hear LordÂ Bach say yesterday that if a compromise on the REACH regulation is not adopted before the year is out, he will consider it both a personal failure and a failure on the part of the British Presidency.
I should like to take this opportunity today to ask MrÂ Alexander whether we will hear that he shares these sentiments.
If the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is not adopted before the year is out, will you too consider this to be a personal failure, on your part and on the part of PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Blair?
Tony Blair gave a fine speech to the House in Brussels in June, and his analysis of the crisis in which Europe finds itself was worthy of publication.
Unfortunately, during the following months and subsequent ministerial speeches we have heard nothing but increasingly pale repetitions of the Prime Ministerâs proposals.
My impression is that the British have lost the will to fight for the realisation of their vision of the European Union.
Instead, they have decided to muddle through this six-month Presidency as best they can.
Unfortunately, they too have been infected with the European disease of impotence and paralysis.
At the same time, however, I have to admit that after the questions and speeches of Members of this House had left him with no other option, Mr Straw finally started to talk about business like a normal human being, which is how a politician should talk.
Europe can only be built by means of effective action and decisions that will be forever writ large in the history of our continent.
The way in which the Presidency is putting off the debate on the Financial Perspective until the last minute, as well as preparing the budget proposals behind closed doors and talking in Orwellian newspeak about the problems of civilisation faced by the world instead of holding a hard-hitting debate on the business at hand, amounts either to time-wasting or to a deliberate attempt to pass the hot potato of the budget on to Vienna in December.
The most important task we face today is the Financial Perspective.
Estimates suggest that if this Perspective is not adopted, the new Member States will receive EURÂ 10Â billion for development in 2007. If it is adopted, however, this figure will rise to around EURÂ 22Â billion, with an additional EURÂ 3.5Â billion for Romania and Bulgaria.
These countries would therefore lose out on around 60% of the money they could potentially receive.
I would ask you to take this Financial Perspective seriously, and to embark on effective measures to ensure that it is adopted in December.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing the outcome of the informal meeting of the European Council at Hampton Court, and not the performance of the six-month British Presidency.
I am content with the outcome of Hampton Court.
The meeting clearly identified six areas that are crucial to Europeâs survival and success in the globalised world, which included science and research, investment in our universities, energy policy, global security and the common foreign and security policy.
Let us take a look at the energy situation, for example.
Europe is increasingly dependent, already to the tune of 65%, on one source and that source is in very unstable regions, either former Soviet territories or the Middle East.
We therefore need a common energy policy, and a common foreign and security policy, although first and foremost we need money to finance these common policies.
At this point, I should like to call on the British Presidency to channel all its efforts into achieving a fair and well-balanced deal at the December summit, not only for the new Member States but also for the old ones.
That would be the biggest achievement of the British Presidency, which will be under discussion on 20Â December.
I believe that the outcome will be a positive one.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Straw proudly told us that we have had 48 ministerial speeches during the British Presidency but I have to say that we have very little to show for any of them.
I am amazed that with just a month to go before it comes to an end, the UK Presidency is still talking about agendas, strategies and timetables.
I speak for those many people of East Anglia who want to see action, security, prosperity and a real change of direction in the EU, rather than empty promises.
Citizens of many countries have woken up to what has been happening in their name.
They seriously question the nature and direction of the EU project.
People want more local control over their own lives, but our governments continue to cede powers to regions and to Brussels.
I ask you: what sort of relationship with what sort of Europe is right for our people and our nations in this first half of the 21st century?
That vital question is never asked by our government or by the EU institutions.
It should perhaps have been the central question at Hampton Court.
The fact is that at Hampton Court there was no fundamental reappraisal of the European Union.
It just carries on regardless.
There is no end to unhelpful legislation.
Mr Straw mentioned the working time directive and the temporary workers directive.
There are dozens more such irrelevant and interfering items of EU legislation on the stocks.
What is being done about all this?
The budget was mentioned.
Pretty fundamental, but still unresolved.
In comparison with a similar sized economy such as France, the United Kingdom already contributes disproportionately to the EU budget and that is after Margaret Thatcherâs rebate.
Apparently you want us to pay more.
Meanwhile our nations and societies are being dangerously fractured as a consequence of catastrophic asylum and immigration policies.
Instead of creating and sustaining world class centres of academic excellence, we are destroying them through lack of funding and misconceived class-driven doctrines.
Our armed forces are desperately over-stretched and lack key items of equipment.
At the same time gallant officers and soldiers are hung out to dry by a government-inspired system that cares little for their wellbeing but everything for its own political agendaâŠ
Â Â  Mr President, the Hampton Court Summit was to discuss how Europe could do better in the world.
People in Ethiopia voted in their masses in May under EU eyes, but the first results did not please the ruling party.
Suddenly, the observers were obstructed, media openness was suppressed and demonstrations were banned.
People were brutally repressed in June: over 40Â were killed and 5Â 000 arrested.
Despite that, a few weeks later, PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Meles attended the Gleneagles Summit hosted by the British Presidency.
In September, several governments and the President of the Commission sent him messages of congratulation.
On 1Â November, another bloodbath took place: 58Â elected leaders, journalists and NGO members are in jail and, according to the Prime Minister, face the death penalty; dozens more were killed, hundreds wounded and thousands were arrested.
Yet, a few days later MrÂ Meles was officially wined and dined in Germany.
President-in-Office, why does the Council send contradictory signals instilling a sense of impunity in rulers who violate human rights and democratic principles, rulers who may then choose to go to war with neighbours to divert attention?
Did you consider this at Hampton Court?
Can the President-in-Office say that Europe is doing enough and doing its best for human rights, democracy and development in Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa?
Â Â  . Mr President, it is an honour to conclude this debate today on the discussions that took place at Hampton Court.
It is a particular pleasure for me to be speaking alongside President Barroso.
The debate following the departure of Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was taken forward by Mr Pistelli, who spoke of the European Union being like a family.
Clearly, on the basis of our brief discussion this afternoon, it is a family within which, like any other family, there can be disagreements from time to time.
But I certainly concur with his view that there are challenges that we face in the weeks ahead.
A rather less lofty point was then made by Mr Hudghton.
As a fellow Scottish representative, a Member of Parliament representing a Scottish seat, I would happily spend all day debating with him why backward-looking nineteenth century nationalism offers no future to any part of Scotland, nor to any group within Scotland.
But I, unlike him, am aware that I speak today for the Presidency of the European Union rather than simply rehearsing domestic political disputes between our parties.
MrsÂ BoboÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡ spoke of the opportunities provided by globalisation.
With that I certainly concur; that was a central focus of much of the constructive and useful discussion that took place at Hampton Court.
MrsÂ Sudre emphasised the need for agreement on future financing by the end of December.
As the Foreign Secretary made clear, we are working towards that aim.
Indeed, a number of other speakers addressed this continuing issue of the importance of reaching agreement.
I will say a word about that in a moment.
Mr Zingaretti generously acknowledged the importance of Turkish accession.
For that I am grateful.
It reflects the distinctive approach taken by Jack Straw as the Foreign Secretary, whereby â somewhat similar to future financing â questions were raised as to the strategy the Presidency was adopting.
I am glad to say that on the occasion of 3Â October we secured the outcome for which so many of us had worked for so long: seeing the accession talks beginning both with Turkey and Croatia.
I hope that we achieve a similar outcome in relation to future financing.
Mr Davies, who has now left the Chamber, again emphasised the importance of future financing.
On the basis of the British motivation and indeed the British capacity to deliver the deal, what matters is not the will of one country â of the Presidency â but the willingness of all Member States to work together to find a consensus.
If what mattered was simply the motivation of the Presidency, we would have seen agreement reached in June rather a situation in which five Member States were unable to accept the Luxembourg proposals.
Mr Karas questioned the importance of enlargement in the face of enduring significant competitive challenges that we face, such as unemployment.
Surely the very point that he makes about enduring unemployment and the need for us to address those challenges, makes the case for Hampton Court.
It is necessary for Europe to have a clearer sense as to its future direction before we would be able to try and secure the consensus we want on the basis of the financing of the European Union.
Mr Tabajdi offered a qualified welcome to particular aspects of the work programme that was agreed at Hampton Court and Mr Sonik quoted to me the earlier remarks of my ministerial colleague, Lord Bach.
I am sorry to disappoint him: as regards future financing, there can be no guarantees that agreement can be reached.
What I can guarantee is that the British Presidency is earnest in our endeavours to try and reach that agreement, but critical days and critical discussions lie ahead.
It is important for all the relevant parties to recognise how significant the progress reached since June â where disunity rather than unity was the hallmark of the conclusion of the discussions â will need to be.
MrÂ RouÄek said that he was content with the outcome of Hampton Court and argued for an honest, fair and well-balanced deal on future financing.
With that I would have no disagreement.
I disagree with many of the points that were raised by MrÂ VanÂ Orden, who has now left the Chamber.
He ranged very widely indeed while claiming to speak for the people of East Anglia, before having his microphone switched off.
Suffice it to say that he did not have the chance during his speech to acknowledge the invaluable work that had been undertaken by the Commission in the course of the British Presidency on exactly that issue of better regulation.
Today I pay tribute to the personal commitment of President Barroso and indeed to Commissioner Verheugen in driving forward this agenda during the British Presidency.
MrsÂ Gomes raised important challenging points in relation to human rights, democracy and development within Africa.
Again, I would simply return to the progress that was made by European Union development ministers back in June, when we effectively agreed to double the level of overseas direct assistance provided by Member States from approximately USDÂ 40Â billion to USDÂ 80Â billion.
I would re-emphasise the commitment reached at Gleneagles between 6Â and 8Â July effectively to double the aid being provided to Africa. I would reflect again on the very constructive and unified approach taken by European Union Member States at the Millennium Review Summit which took place in September of this year.
I should like to echo a point made earlier by Mr Davies, that those of us who are sincere and genuine in our commitment to help the developing world recognise that there is a continuing challenge that lies ahead of us in the remaining weeks of the British Presidency, which is to try and have an ambitious and balanced outcome to the Hong Kong ministerial meeting that will take place in December.
I can assure Members that this remains a continuing priority of the British Presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, to sum up, there will be a defining issue for the British Presidency: to get an agreement on the financial perspectives.
I think that message was very clearly transmitted to the British Presidency today.
I understand what the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said before he left about other issues that were very important and that will have strategic consequences.
Precisely because of that, it is important to get an agreement on the financial perspectives, because this will be the first test for the enlarged Europe.
Let us be frank.
There are some people who believe that with 25Â Member States we cannot work and we cannot deliver.
There are some people who believe that a greater Europe will be a weaker Europe.
I know that is not the idea of the British Presidency, I know that is not the idea of the Commission.
We believe in this greater Europe we are now building.
We believe it is a great achievement that we now have 25Â free, democratic Member States â as we have.
However, we cannot do enlargement on the cheap.
We need resources for this new Europe that we are helping to consolidate.
That is why it is crucially important to have an agreement on the financial perspectives, because if not, if we do not have that instrument for what people are asking of the European institutions, there will be, and I really believe this, a crisis of confidence that will be reinforced in Europe.
And this not only applies to the current situation in Europe, but also to the future of Europe, future accessions to Europe, to our capability to build a Europe.
However, for a greater Europe we need greater politics.
And that is the point.
Are we ready?
Are we able to do it?
Can we deliver?
That is why I urge the British Presidency to do everything in its power â and I well know the energy and commitment of your Prime Minister and indeed of all your officials â to get an agreement.
Of course everyone has to move: it is not only the responsibility of the British Presidency.
Of course it is not.
But I really believe the key to the problem, or it would be better to say the key to the solution, is in your hands.
You can achieve that agreement, at least among Member States.
We came very close in the last formal European Council: we can do it.
It is crucially important and it is my duty and my responsibility, as President of the European Commission â which has to represent the general European interest â to call on the responsibility of all leaders in Europe to make the best efforts to achieve that compromise.
Let me tell you very frankly, President-in-Office, from my contacts with all the Member States â which, because of my responsibility, I have to keep on a daily basis, especially with the new Member States â I know they look to you and to the role of your Presidency with this expectation.
In fact, everything that we have done so far has been, from my point of view, a great contribution for Europe.
As I said in my previous statement, I think that the Hampton Court Summit was a good summit, it made a good contribution to that new, emerging consensus about a stronger, more modern Europe.
However, the test in the minds of the new Member States, the test for a major proportion of the European public centres around whether we can really show that we are on the move on those concrete questions.
That is the great challenge.
So let us do our best, let us ask all the Heads of State and Government to be ready to compromise; let us ask the British Presidency to do its very best.
I believe it is possible.
It is difficult but it is possible, and the real test for our leadership is to make possible that which is necessary and I believe we can do it.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the recent statements of the President of Iran, MrÂ Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted to be able to address the Parliament in this important and timely debate on Iran and I am delighted to be speaking alongside my good friend Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in this important discussion.
During the last debate on this subject in this House on 12Â October I used those same words in indicating that discussion on Iran was timely.
I now feel that this debate is perhaps even more timely than the debate on 12Â October because international concern about Iranâs policies remains high and I believe that Iran is facing crucial choices about its future.
It is right, therefore, that the European Union should be active in shaping that debate.
Iranâs decisions about its relations with neighbouring countries can affect the security and prosperity of peoples well beyond the region of the Middle East.
It is important for the security of the region and beyond that Iran now makes wise choices.
As all Members of this House will know, Iran elected a new President in June of this year.
I believe that the international community, and particularly the European Union, must maintain its dialogue with Iranâs new government.
We have a responsibility to encourage those who now hold power to make choices that are in the best interests of that country and the region as a whole.
As I said the last time I had the privilege of addressing this Parliament, Iran is a land of genuinely vast potential.
It has a young, educated and entrepreneurial population.
It has immense natural resources, in particular oil and minerals.
I suggested that the combination of these factors should make for a vibrant economy and society in any country if its government can create a culture of opportunity based on the rule of law.
Today, more than ever, there is a real need to encourage the growth of such a culture within Iran.
I know that many honourable Members of this House were, as I was, outraged by the recent remarks made by the President of Iran about Israel.
These are deeply troubling statements.
Moreover, they have been made against the background of mounting concerns about Iranâs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, its human rights record and its commitment to countering terrorism.
Let me turn first to those specific comments.
As you know, on 26Â October, President Ahmadinejad addressed a conference in Tehran on the subject of a world without Zionism.
In his speech he is reported to have called for Israel to be wiped from the map and said âthe Islamic world will not let its historic enemy live within its heartlandâ.
The European Union led the international response which was swift and, I am glad to say, unequivocal.
The Presidency statement issued on behalf of the European Union Heads of Government meeting at Hampton Court on 27Â October strongly condemned President Ahmadinejadâs remarks.
Josep Borrell said on behalf of this esteemed body that you were âdeeply shocked, sickened and revolted by this statementâ.
He spoke of total condemnation by the leaders of your political groups.
I know that Hans-Gert Poettering, who will be speaking in a moment, also expressed his concern at these comments at that time.
Today in this debate we are being called upon to discuss these remarks and their implications.
Calls for violence and the destruction of any state are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community.
The Presidency summoned Iranâs chargÃ© dâaffaires in London to protest at these remarks, and many governments across our Union of 25Â nations did likewise in their national capacity.
I welcome the swift response from the wider international community, including from governments within the Middle East region itself.
Saeb Erekat put it eloquently on behalf of the Palestinian authority when he said he hoped President Ahmadinejad will focus on adding Palestine to the map rather than calling for Israel to be wiped from the map.
Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, spoke for the world when he stated that Israel is a long-standing member of the United Nations, with the same rights and obligations as any other.
Under the United Nations Charter, Iran, like other members of the organisation, has undertaken to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
I hope that President Ahmadinejad will recognise the damage that these remarks have caused to its standing in the international community and withdraw them unconditionally.
His remarks are a further reminder of the imperative for Iran to take steps to address international concerns about its intentions in relation to the nuclear programme.
Iranâs nuclear ambitions were discussed by European Union foreign ministers when we met in Brussels on 7Â November.
At that meeting the Council reiterated its grave concern at Iranâs resumption of activities at the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and urged Iran to implement all the measures requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board.
These include a reinstatement of the full suspension of all fuel cycle activities.
The European Unionâs preferred approach remains the resumption of negotiations within the framework agreed in Paris last November.
The European Union has urged Iran to take the steps necessary to make this possible.
A satisfactory resolution of the issue of Iranâs nuclear ambitions is of fundamental importance to the international community.
A nuclear-armed Iran would add greatly to instability in the region and it could do irreparable damage to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the rest of the international non-proliferation system.
Turning to the field of human rights, we continue to be deeply concerned by the serious and continuing violations by Iran.
We continue to hear reports of juvenile offenders being sentenced to death.
Iran continues to restrict freedom of expression and to imprison political prisoners, such as the investigative journalist, Akbar Ganji.
Iran continues to persecute religious minorities, including the Bahaâi Community.
I know from our last debate on this issue that this is a matter of ongoing and profound concern to many Members of this Parliament.
We therefore urge Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law.
It is disappointing that the EU-Iran human rights dialogue has not been held since June 2004, despite repeated attempts â I can assure you â on the European Unionâs part to agree dates for the next round.
It is important that Iran take steps to resume substantive discussions under the dialogue.
I welcome the resolution on human rights that Canada tabled last week at the United Nations General Assembly.
European Union Member States have agreed to co-sponsor it.
Iran must demonstrate by its actions that it is willing to improve respect for human rights.
Iran can begin to do this by fulfilling its obligations and earlier commitments in relation to juvenile executions and by permanently releasing prisoners of conscience.
I hope that Iranâs government does this without delay.
Turning now to terrorism, the Council remains concerned by Iranâs approach to terrorism.
The fact that President Ahmadinejadâs comments were made on the same day as the horrific attack at Hadera in Israel, for which Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, should reinforce for us all the lesson that incitement to violence and the terrorism that it breeds are despicable and unacceptable acts.
The European Union has encouraged Iran to join, without reservation, the international consensus on the necessary existence of two states â Palestine and Israel â living peacefully side by side within recognised borders.
The European Union stresses that support for Palestinian terrorist groups is unacceptable.
All states have a responsibility to work together to combat the threat of international terrorism.
I believe that this is genuinely a crucial time for Iran and for its government.
The recent remarks by President Ahmadinejad have focused attention upon Iran and its position in the world.
It is imperative that this attention be channelled constructively into effective influence on Iran to address its policies on the nuclear issue, terrorism, human rights and regional and other questions, including the Middle East peace process.
The international community can have most influence when it is united.
I believe our united response to President Ahmadinejadâs remarks about Israel has been successful in putting Iranian policy on this issue directly under the spotlight.
As foreign ministers of the European Union said on 7Â November, the evolution of the long-term relationship between Iran and Europe must depend on action by Iran to address effectively all the European Unionâs areas of concern.
It is up to Iran to determine through its actions whether its long-term relationship with the European Union will improve or deteriorate.
Â Â  . Mr President, even though I am repeating something that has already been said, I would like to do so because I think the matter is so serious that it is necessary to do so.
There was indeed a very broad and very speedy reaction from all the different European institutions.
President Barroso reacted immediately on behalf of the European Commission by issuing a very firm condemnation in the clearest possible terms.
We know that the President of the European Parliament has also condemned this statement very forcefully and, as Mr Alexander has already said, the European Council also issued a very strong declaration from Hampton Court.
I also reiterated in public that Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejadâs statement on Israel was shocking and completely unacceptable.
It has also rightly been condemned in the strongest terms across the international community.
I would also like to thank the Presidency for having associated our heads of delegations in statements made by the Presidency, together with the Commission, especially in the Arab countries.
The Foreign Ministers further reiterated this collective condemnation of calls for violence and for the destruction of any state.
They also concurred in the fact that âsuch comments cause concern about Iranâs role in the region and its future intentionsâ.
There is a long, very ugly string of precedents at political rallies, military parades and other events, going all the way back to the early years of the revolution.
But when they are made in the current delicate climate, and especially by the Head of State himself in connection with a conference entitled âThe World without Zionismâ, I think it really is time to draw a red line and to remind the Iranian President of the responsibilities that come with being a member of the family of nations.
On the most burning issue, the nuclear track, we still believe that engagement is far preferable to brinkmanship, confrontation and isolation.
We therefore support the efforts by the British Presidency, France, Germany, Mr Javier Solana and like-minded partners to bring Iran to a fuller cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Dr El Baradei
In this regard the next meeting of the board of the IAEA will be crucial.
Clearly we all want to avoid Iran becoming a nuclear weapons state.
But this is not the only area where we would expect the Iranian Government to deliver.
Iranâs attitude towards the Middle East peace process in particular is very important.
Since the launch of our EU-Iran comprehensive dialogue, the successor of the critical dialogue, that has been identified as one of the major issues of concern, along with weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and human rights.
During Mr Khatamiâs presidency, we used this channel of engagement to good effect.
Even though Iran did not officially acknowledge the existence of Israel, we registered some positive signs and a better appreciation of the whole Middle East equation.
In particular, it was stated that Iran would not obstruct the peace process and would not pretend to be âmore Palestinian than the Palestiniansâ.
But the intemperate remarks by President Ahmadinejad came as a setback.
Among the many condemnations it triggered, I was particularly pleased to note also that the Palestinian Authority representative, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Mr Saeb Erekat, displayed real statesmanship by recalling that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority had recognised the State of Israel, with which they pursued a peace process.
Thunderous neo-revolutionary warnings by the Iranian leadership to other Muslim countries not to recognise Israel seem curiously out of step with the modern world and may very well backfire.
Over the past months, the EU has invited Iran to reactivate our tracks of dialogue, by holding sessions of both the comprehensive dialogue and the human rights dialogue.
I strongly hope that Iran will recommit itself to these processes and seize the opportunity to clarify its position, dispel misunderstandings and start restoring an overall confidence that has been badly damaged by recent remarks.
Although today is not the occasion, one could speak at length about human rights and the positive expectations that were initially created during the first years of Mr Khatamiâs presidency, and then about the subsequent negative trend that has regrettably cemented itself.
Improvements are indeed badly needed and the European Union obviously cannot remain silent on the matter.
I believe that we should try to build bridges with the Iranian people and I prefer to think that not all Iranians identify with the remarks and the line taken by their leaders.
Freedom of expression and association in Iran are eroding.
We should continue to monitor closely, for instance, the treatment of individual cases, such as that of Mr Akbar Ganji.
But as the Council clearly stated last week, âthe evolution of the long-term relationship, avoiding a deterioration between Iran and Europe, will depend on action by Iran to address effectively all of the EUâs areas of concernâ.
That includes Iranâs attitude towards the Middle East peace process.
The ball is now in the Iranian Governmentâs court.
As a basic prerequisite we expect the Iranian Government to exercise responsible leadership, both domestically and internationally.
Iran has remarkable historical, cultural and geo-political assets, as well as immense natural and human resources.
This entails special responsibilities in order to foster peace and stability within a particularly volatile neighbourhood.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, our group has asked for this debate, and I would like to express my warm thanks to the other groups for having agreed to it without further ado.
What President Ahmadinejad of Iran said on 26 October about wiping Israel off the map is so monstrous that it must be condemned in the strongest terms.
We know that the Ayatollah Khomeini, who led the Iranian revolution, took a similar line, but we are now all the more grateful to the former President Khatami for distancing himself from it.
To Israel â of which I have been critical on several occasions in this House â we say that, when something touches, as this does, in such a way on the security, stability, and integrity of Israel, then Israel enjoys our unconditional support, and that any and every attack upon Israel or attempt at destabilising it amounts to an attempt at jeopardising Western civilisation and constitutes a declaration of war upon Europe and the world at large.
Of that, the Iranian Government must be made aware.
I find this development in Iran so very disappointing precisely because I was spending a whole week in Iran at the time that Ahmadinejad took office, and I was still under the illusion that not everything would turn out to be quite so bad as it looked.
It is, however, precisely because things have turned out so badly that those who, with a great deal of goodwill, wanted to give the new government a chance must, today, say loud and clear: ânip this in the bud!â â and that is the position we must adopt.
The tragic thing is that this behaviour on the part of what one must call the new Iranian regime does nothing to help those whom it is intended to help, namely the Palestinians.
It is not only the Israelis who have a right to live within secure borders; we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have always acknowledged the right of the Palestinians to do so as well.
What the President of Iran is doing puts the Middle East peace process as a whole at risk, and that is bad news not only for Israel, but also for the dignity of the Palestinian people.
Following our criticisms of Ahmadinejad, I saw on German television demonstrations in Teheran, with men wearing suicide belts, something that in itself constitutes an incitement to terrorism.
While in Iran, I saw a magazine in which young people were called on to sign up as suicide bombers or freedom fighters â you can call them what you like, but that is still an incitement to terrorism.
I was told yesterday that Iranian childrenâs television programmes were showing Palestinian children wearing these suicide belts, so to speak, setting Iranian children an example and encouraging them to volunteer for these sorts of suicide missions.
Yesterday, too, a British colleague told me that two people had been hanged in Iran as a punishment for homosexual relations.
All this shows that what we are dealing with here is a reversion to the worst of the Middle Ages, and we must get the Iranian leadership to see the error of their ways.
Both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner mentioned the civil nuclear programme.
That is something to which Iran is, of course, entitled, but it does not enjoy our trust, and we can be virtually certain that the development of civil nuclear power will one day lead to its being used for nuclear weapons, which we, as a European and global civilisation, cannot allow to be placed in the hands of people whose outlook can be regarded as medieval.
This morning, I urged the Russian Government, through one of its representatives, to do everything in its power â for it enjoys a degree of influence on Iran â to bring about, at last, transparency in all these questions touching on nuclear energy; the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have made similar demands.
We must be very vigilant where Iran is concerned.
Iran must itself be aware that it is throwing away its chance of playing a major geographical and strategic role.
Iran has a major role to play in the peace process in Afghanistan, the peace process in Iraq, in relations with Syria, Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine.
The Iranians are a great people, many of whom took no part in the election because they feared the worst and could not prevent it.
There are people of good will in Iran, and we should not forget them.
Iran needs a good future, and it is to be hoped that its President will come to realise that he needs to adopt a civilised approach in his dealings with both people and states around the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we too endorsed the need to hold this debate, because we want the serious remarks made by the Iranian President, MrÂ Ahmadinejad, regarding the existence of the State of Israel to be met with a firm, unanimous response from the European Parliament.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that the seriousness of what has happened should not be underestimated, since those words were uttered at an extremely sensitive moment in the Middle East situation.
The truth is that fortunately, within days, we heard the statements by the former leader MrÂ Khatami, which ran in a completely different direction.
In fact, he came out against any kind of crusade, war or violence, declaring them immoral.
Returning to the Middle East, on the one hand hopes have been raised again for a peace process that will lead to the emergence of the Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel, a solution that for us has never been and will never be an issue.
On the other hand, however, we realise that this process has many enemies and that terrorism is in fact backing those who do not want a solution to this tragic situation.
Peace, democracy, freedom and social justice are the values that we want to prevail in the Middle East, and we want Europe to play an ever greater role in making that happen.
We therefore welcome the fact that the European Union has accepted responsibility for controlling the border at Rafah, which we hope may soon become one of the borders of the Palestinian State.
Iran is a great country and we do not want it to isolate itself from the international community.
Quite the opposite: we believe that the decisions it makes, starting with a clear and incontrovertible rejection of nuclear weapons, can help bring about peaceful stability throughout the region.
Israel and Palestine are linked by a single destiny and wiping out Israel would mean wiping out Palestine.
I say that because it is time to unmask those who help to maintain the Palestiniansâ tragic situation by pretending to uphold their rights.
Unlike President Ahmadinejad, we shall strive to add a new state to the map of the Middle East.
Lastly, let us assure Israel that Europe cannot forget the Holocaust, because that would mean denying the very reasons for its existence as a political project.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will echo some of what my fellow Members have been saying before me, but I think it is important to show that all groups in this House are unanimous in their condemnation of recent events in Iran.
Iran is a cradle of civilisation and has made an invaluable contribution to mankindâs cultural, artistic, religious, intellectual and scientific heritage.
When Iran became an Islamic republic, it was isolated for decades.
The European Union has taken the lead in bringing this isolation to an end, and a comprehensive debate has been set in motion about such things as economic relations, international cooperation and human rights.
Since President Ahmadinejad took up office, however, there has been a clear and perceptible setback in the shape of the sentencing of juveniles to death, renewed persecutions of journalists and human rights activists and the recall of 40 ambassadors.
Recent statements by the President â who has congratulated suicide terrorists and said that Israel must be wiped off the map â are completely at odds with the Charter of the United Nations, are deserving of condemnation and are wholly unacceptable not only politically and in terms of international law, but also, and above all, from a humanitarian and moral point of view.
Israelâs right of existence within internationally recognised borders and in safety alongside a viable Palestinian state is not a matter of dispute.
Iran would do well to contribute to a solution in the Middle East and to stop supporting international terrorism.
The latest statements by its President threaten to plunge Iran, which is indeed a big country, back into isolation and, in any case, prevent it from playing a leading role in its region.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, that of the Greens, is also glad that we will be adopting a unanimous resolution whereby the European Parliament will make clear that anyone â whether an organisation or a state is immaterial â who questions the right of Israel to exist or preaches hatred of it will find no acceptance in this House, and that such attitudes are firmly rejected.
The Commission and the Council, too, have spelled out the serious problems that we face.
President Ahmadinejadâs speeches make it clear that we Europeans can do nothing to stop a hatemonger mobilising thousands of people the length and breadth of his country; that is not our task, neither is it our field of activity, but I do nonetheless appeal to those in power in Iran to consider whether they might play a positive role in the international community by giving their backing to the right of both Palestine and Israel to exist, rather than allowing their President to make their rich country an international pariah.
Hence my appeal to the people of Europe and to this House: we must draw distinctions.
Iran is a fascinating country with a young and well-educated society.
There are also, in Iranian society, active womenâs organisations that fight for womenâs rights.
Iran is also represented by such a man as Akbar Gandji, whose life is at risk because he refuses to submit to censorship.
Iran is also a society full of webloggers and journalists attempting to remain in contact with us and to reveal the truth about their countryâs regime.
Iran is also the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, who has addressed this House.
Iran is also the lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, whom we once invited to this House and who is now in jail.
It is to this other Iran, then, that we should try to stretch out a hand.
We should not make the mistake of breaking off contacts with its civil society now, of shutting the door on it.
That is precisely what people like President Ahmadinejad want us to do, and that is why we must not do it.
We have committed ourselves to human rights, to peace and to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
That is our way.
That is only the dialogue ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Iranian regime prevents any opposition within the country.
It violates human rights and barbarically sentences people to death by hanging etc. A long list of the regimeâs crimes can be drawn up, but such crimes are clearly not enough for this regime.
Now, the Iranian President has made terrible statements about another state.
He has talked about annihilating the State of Israel.
His doing so is, of course, completely unacceptable and must be condemned by everyone.
I assume that we are a unified Parliament that supports the condemnations both of this statement and of the Iranian regimeâs human rights violations.
There is a danger that the Presidentâs statement will make the work to bring about peace in the Middle East that much more difficult.
At the same time, we must also demand that the State of Israel comply with the UN Security Councilâs resolutions, that Israel immediately withdraw from the occupied territories and that Israel assume its share of responsibility for a two-state solution and thus finally accept an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
In this context, we must also criticise the State of Israelâs construction of a wall in the Palestinian territories.
This is a wall that, among other things, separates farmers from their land and pupils from their schools and that prevents people who are ill from getting to hospitals.
This wall must also be taken down.
Â Â  . Mr President, Iran is developing a nuclear programme that it does not need since it is sitting on a sea of oil.
It is clearly intended to provide the country with nuclear weapons.
The President of Iran thinks that Israel should be wiped off the map.
The ability of the West to deal with the threat posed by Iran has been severely restricted by the war in Iraq, a war Britain entered into because of the lies and deceit of our Prime Minister, Mr Blair.
We all hope that the situation in Iran can be resolved peacefully, and this is certainly one of those cases where the West needs both to speak softly and to carry a big stick.
Unfortunately Britainâs big stick â its armed forces â is being merged into the euphemistically named European Defence Identity, i.e. a European army.
If accomplished, this will prevent Britain from being able to embark on any independent military actions in the future.
But once again, the EU assumes the attributes of a political state in order to address this problem and its pretensions are fully supported by a minister of Her Majestyâs Government.
Meanwhile, this Parliament continually calls on both France and Britain to decommission their independent nuclear deterrents.
If they did so there would not be the big stick that might ultimately be needed in any negotiations with Iran.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the expressions of hatred and violence uttered by the Iranian President, aiming at wiping the State of Israel off the map, are a threat to the whole civilised world.
Iran is a country of 68 million inhabitants, has an area of 1.7 million square kilometres and is a major oil producer.
Its current president is trying to turn it into a state that represents the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism, that supports or does not condemn terrorist acts, and that is preparing to produce nuclear energy without the backing of the international community.
If the Iranian President does not clearly change his stance, he will be a threat not only to Israel and the region, but also to all of us, to peace and to democracy.
Such a threat demands the strongest possible response.
The unilateral nuclear rearming of Iran must be stopped in line with our resolution of 13Â October 2005 and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 7Â November.
We must also seek a diplomatic solution to dispel the legitimate concerns about Iranâs nuclear programme.
If this threatening trend in Iranâs policy does not stop, we shall have to speak firmly of diplomatic and economic consequences, because these statements inciting violence against a democratic sovereign state are a danger to the democratic community as a whole.
As institutions, however, we should continue to foster relations with the people.
We express our greatest solidarity with the State of Israel, which has also received statements of support from that part of the Islamic world that rejects terrorism, as well as the spontaneous support of the citizens of many of our countries.
The pursuit of a lasting peace means that we must resoundingly condemn and take the necessary action against all those who instigate hatred and violence.
We call on our institutions to pay even greater attention to the opposition movements in Iran, which are denouncing the methods that this violent, repressive regime uses even against its own people.
Â Â  . Mr President, it has once again been a high-quality debate on an important subject, similar to the last time we had an opportunity to debate these issues in this Chamber.
A number of speakers including the Commissioner and Mr Poettering have underlined the significance of the Iranian Presidentâs statement for the wider Middle East peace process, and with that I would concur.
President Ahmadinejadâs comments caused concern about Iranâs role more widely within the region and indeed about its future intentions.
The fact that these comments were made on the same day as a horrific attack on Israeli citizens should reinforce for all of us the lesson that incitement to violence and to the terrorism that it breeds are despicable and unacceptable.
Frankly it is clear what Iran must do.
It must renounce groups using terror and violence, including the kind of sickening propaganda that was referred to by MrÂ Poettering, and support a solution to the Palestinian question based on the principle of two states living side by side in peace and in security.
There is no reason why an Islamic political system such as Iranâs should deny fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of choice and freedom of expression and there can be no excuse for any system abusing human rights, as a number of speakers have made clear in the course of their contributions to this debate.
On the wider nuclear issue, Iran must provide objective guarantees that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
The governments of the European Union are now in close consultation with each other and key partners such as the United States, Russia, China, India and South Africa about the next steps.
We all look to Iran to reinstate the suspension of uranium conversion activity which it agreed to last year and which the IAEA board itself has said is essential for confidence to be rebuilt and we urge Iran to come back to talks on long-term arrangements on the basis of the Paris agreement.
On 7Â November, as speakers have mentioned, European Union Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the Unionâs support for a diplomatic solution to international concerns over Iranâs nuclear programme which should include an agreement on long-term arrangements.
Such a solution would help create the climate we believe to be necessary for a better relationship with Europe generally and the international community as a whole.
Working and engaging with Iran is of course a challenge, but we must do our best to meet that challenge in the important weeks and months ahead.
Our preference remains to aim for a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperation and our shared interests, in that Europe wants to see Iran realise its potential and to grow and prosper.
That is certainly what its young population deserves and that is, as Ms Beer said, why it is important to keep open the links so that the other Iran, as it was described â the more open Iranian society to which speakers have addressed themselves today â can welcome the efforts which are being made to maintain that dialogue, certainly by the Commission and by others.
But a relationship of this sort will also need to address the European Unionâs main concerns, including, of course, nuclear proliferation and human rights.
In conclusion, on behalf of the Presidency, let me say simply this: Iran stands at a critical juncture.
The world is watching to see how its new government faces up to the very important choices that it has to make in the weeks, months and years ahead.
We from a European Union point of view will continue to encourage Iran to address international concerns about its policies and about its statements.
I hope that Iran does this and that its relations with the wider world and the European Union in particular are therefore able to evolve in the direction in which I believe this House wants them to develop.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0339/2005).
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am conscious that your direction to honourable Members also, no doubt, includes the Presidency, so I shall endeavour to keep my answers as brief as is appropriate, given the range of questions that we have been asked.
In response to QuestionÂ 1, the assessment of the impact of international agreements in terms of companies relocating and restructuring is not within the Councilâs competence.
The Council does not have any forecasts for the restructuring of companies.
The European Social Fund is the main financial tool through which the European Union supports Member Statesâ employment policies within the framework of the European employment strategy.
Set up by the Treaty of Rome, it is the longest established Structural Fund.
The Structural Fund supports measures to improve employment opportunities and to develop human resources and integration into the labour market in order to promote a high level of employment, equality between men and women, sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.
Furthermore, the Council will be taking forward discussion of the Commissionâs proposals for a globalisation adjustment fund, which could provide assistance for those affected by economic restructuring.
Rural development also makes European Union funding available in parallel with national funding for developing rural areas.
In 2007 to 2013, this money will focus on increasing the competitiveness of European agriculture, food and forestry, land management and the environment, and quality of life and diversification in rural areas.
Thus the European Structural Fund and rural development funding provides the tools to help workers adjust to the situations referred to by the honourable Member.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to ask the Council representative if the restructuring fund will have specific funds and if the British Presidency has already used the open method of coordination in order to make new proposals for the management of restructurings.
Â Â  . I would start with the basic point, which is that, clearly, the level of funding is contingent upon the wider conversation about the future financing of the European Union.
We have had a long and useful debate in the course of the afternoon which, while apparently directed towards the Hampton Court informal Heads of Government meeting, in reality strayed into the issue of future financing.
I would simply reiterate the points made by the Foreign Secretary when he was speaking here earlier this afternoon in saying that we are sincere in our endeavours in reaching a conclusion to those discussions on future financing in the course of the British Presidency.
However, the specific details of specific programmes are obviously contingent on the resolution of that matter.
Â Â  . Data concerning the effect on the international market of national measures to tax passenger air traffic are limited.
Were Member States to adopt national measures for the taxation of passenger air traffic that were not compatible with the internal market, measures could be proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee under ArticleÂ 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
However, it remains the right of Member States to set tax rates according to their own national circumstances.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Nevertheless, the question concerns the effect that the introduction of any kind of tax on air passenger transport will have within the internal market.
You are from an island, as I am; this measure, although it would not affect countries which only have a continental structure, would have a very negative impact on the island regions and, above all, on those which are a very long way from the central nucleus of the European Union.
This is therefore an issue that probably warrants consideration by the Council, in agreement with the Commission.
Â Â  . I would certainly not want the impression to be left in this Chamber that somehow by dint of geography Britain is isolated from the mainstream of the European Union.
Indeed I hope many of our efforts in the course of the Presidency have challenged that impression.
As I suggested in my initial answer, there is provision within the Treaties for action to be taken when necessary by the Commission.
Nonetheless it remains a matter for individual Member States to make decisions in relation to taxation, as I sought to declare.
If the honourable Member is suggesting that further action needs to be taken either at Member State level or at European level, I am not convinced that would necessarily relate to issues of taxation as distinct from potential other public policy remedies for the problems that he claims to have identified.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
I think it would be wrong if we keep on looking at this question strictly from the point of view of taxation, we must also look at it from the perspective of the free movement of persons and services, two of the essential freedoms of the European Union.
Let me give you as an example my own country â Malta.
To buy a ticket from Malta to Brussels it costs around 104 Euros if you get a good price, taxes and surcharges on it amount to 126 Euros, that means 121% of the price; between Malta and London 200% of the price, are taxes and other âchargesâ.
We must look at this seriously, it is not possible that travelling, especially from remote and isolated places, be considered in any way as a form of luxury.
We cannot go to âmainland Europeâ by car, what can we do then, swim?!
That means that we have to look at it from the perspective of freedom of movement.
Â Â  . I would simply reiterate the caution that I emphasised earlier as to the legitimate remit of the Council in these matters.
There is, as I said, provision for the Commission to take action in particular circumstances, and Mr Muscat is right to recognise that free movement of services is one element of the original Treaty of Rome.
However, to counterbalance the rather negative construction that he has placed on the present position in relation to air fares in one particular Member State, it is important to recognise that some of the measures taken at European Union level in recent years have resulted in very dramatic drops in the price of tickets that are being charged to European Union citizens to travel elsewhere within the European Union.
Only this morning I had the opportunity to travel to Budapest where I was hearing directly about the seventeen daily flights now available between a number of regional airports in the United Kingdom and Hungary.
That would have been inconceivable only a matter of years ago, and the European Union deserves credit in recognising the extent to which it has contributed towards the new opportunities that are afforded to many citizens to travel, which have now been enjoyed by many citizens in recent months and years.
Â Â  Last month I tabled a question for this session of Question Time to the Council on a related subject, that of EU kerosene tax.
In response to the question as to what the Councilâs position on EU kerosene tax was, I was told that because it had not received a proposal from the Commission, the Council could not take position.
I have here documentary evidence that the Commission has made proposals to the Council.
The issue was last discussed in the Council by the Luxembourg Presidency, prior to the British Presidency, which British ministers would presumably have attended.
Can the Council Presidency please tell me whether this is a case of incompetence, or is there a secret agenda to introduce a kerosene tax?
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member there is no secret agenda as far as I am concerned.
On the other hand, if he would like to share with me the information he has waved before this House today I shall certainly look into the matter that he has addressed and I will make sure that a reply is forthcoming to him.
Â Â  . The Council is not in a position to give information on the state of individual Member Statesâ decision-making concerning the signature of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.
The convention has to date been signed by five Member States of the European Union: Austria, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.
No Member States have ratified the convention.
It is noted that part of the convention is under EC competence and will therefore need to be signed and ratified by the EC.
The Council is currently considering an action plan on trafficking in human beings to develop a comprehensive and strategic European Union approach on this issue.
The action plan will build on the conference held on 19 and 20Â October, âTackling human trafficking: Policy and best practice in Europeâ, organised by the United Kingdom Presidency, the Commission and Sweden.
Â Â  That is rather inadequate.
The Commissionâs recent communication said that victim protection is the top priority, but Member States tend to lump trafficking together with illegal immigration and prefer to make victim protection conditional on being a witness.
That is why they dislike the convention.
The advice that I and colleagues received from the police is that victims will cooperate with police voluntarily once they and their families are safe.
Police are dismayed that the chances of a successful prosecution of traffickers are being undermined by a policy of deporting victims as illegal immigrants or making assistance conditional.
Mr Blair said recently that you need powerful reasons to turn round and say ânoâ to the police.
Why are 17Â EU Prime Ministers â and you are now telling me it is actually 20Â Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair â saying ânoâ to the police by refusing to sign up to this convention?
Â Â  . I would first like to repeat to the honourable Member the point that I made at the beginning that it is not for me, representing the Presidency in the course of today and in the course of this debate, to speak in terms of the decision-making of those 20Â Prime Ministers that she identifies.
I would however say that it rather ill befits her to suggest that there is a conflation between illegal immigration and human trafficking when the conference that I described on this important issue of human trafficking was entitled âTackling human trafficking: policy and best practice in Europeâ.
This was a matter which, as I said, was taken forward by the British Presidency and therefore the allegation that she seems to be levelling that there is somehow a profound and perpetual confusion between illegal immigration and human trafficking seems, not least on the basis of the title of the conference, to be refuted by the evidence.
Â Â  Following on from that, I think the reason my colleague said what she did was because the UK Presidency seems to view this as a security and stability issue rather than a human rights issue.
Further to what the President-in-Office has said, could he try to make sure that the Council discussions on the EU action plan on trafficking is in the public domain, because we do not have any information about it at present.
Could he also give reassurances that at least the minimum standards that are written into the EU Convention against trafficking are put into that EU action plan?
Â Â  . Let me assure the honourable lady that there is widespread support for the aims of the Convention on Action against Human Trafficking and that European Union Member States want to see concerted action to tackle at source what is undoubtedly an abhorrent trade, in order to protect and support the victims of which she has spoken and bring those responsible to justice.
I can assure the honourable lady that the United Kingdom, as Presidency of the European Union, has prioritised work on combating human trafficking, and the EU Action Plan for best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings has been the focus of our efforts.
We have held not one but two conferences on the subject.
That action plan will, I can assure her, address the whole cycle of human trafficking and specifically recognises the importance of a human rights and a victim-centred approach.
So, I hope that, on the basis of the answer that I have been able to offer, some of her concerns over the approach that the British Presidency has taken on this important issue transpire to be misplaced.
Â Â  . The proposed deletion of the indicative amounts for tobacco products and alcohol constitutes only one of the elements of the relevant Commission proposal amending the arrangements for products subject to excise duty.
Indicative amounts are used as an important indicator of whether the quantity of excise goods carried across borders is for commercial reasons or for private consumption by non-taxable persons.
They are not in themselves an obstacle to the rights of cross-border shoppers.
The Commission proposal has been discussed on several occasions in the relevant bodies since it was transmitted to the Council, with no indication that Member States would agree to abolish the minimum indicative levels.
The Presidency therefore does not believe that further discussion of this issue would be productive.
Â Â  Would the President-in-Office not agree with me that a single market in the European Union, in which goods, people, services and capital can move as freely across European borders as they do within Member States, is a vital policy objective?
Would he agree with me that we should prefer tax competition between Member States to harmonisation of tax rates across the EU?
If he so agrees, can he see any justification for any limits or guidelines as to how much in the way of excisable products our citizens can take with them across our borders?
Â Â  . It is refreshing to hear a point of view being put forward in this Chamber that differs so much from some of the allegations normally levelled against the British and the British Presidency.
The free movement of goods and services is, of course, reflected in the original treaties of the European Union, and one of the focuses of our work in the course of our Presidency has been the completion of the single market.
We have sought to take forward, and continue to seek to take forward, work in relation to services.
Indeed, countries who at times in the past have questioned our pro-European credentials have been some of those most critical of our efforts to continue to advance discussions in relation to the issue of services.
On the specific issue that the speaker raised in relation to cross-border shopping, let me simply say that the Presidency fully supports the rights of cross-border shoppers.
At the same time, though, we are committed to tackling those who abuse freedoms that would otherwise be enjoyed by citizens right across the European Union.
We are determined to tackle abuses of the freedoms within the single market by those who engage in illegal activities such as smuggling.
Guide levels are therefore essential to assist customs authorities to distinguish between genuine cross-border shoppers and smugglers.
On the more general point with which he concluded his remarks, I think the rather robust case which was put by our Foreign Secretary in terms of the limits of harmonisation within the European Union earlier this afternoon is an eloquent testimony as to the British Governmentâs view on the appropriate balance between harmonisation and competition within the European Union.
Â Â  Would the President-in-Office agree that guidelines are precisely that â guidelines â and that if individuals can prove that what they are importing is for their own use then, even if they exceed the guidelines, they would not be outwith the law?
Also, would he agree that the guidelines exist to ensure that the single market functions in this area and that, if we did not have the guidelines, the very objective that Mr Purvis wants might be undermined, because the guidelines are there to stop the abuses that the President-in-Office referred to?
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member that we take seriously the kind of abuse of which he speaks so eloquently.
Speaking for a moment from the United Kingdom point of view rather than the Presidency point of view, it is the case that in the United Kingdom we have the highest guide levels of all the Member States of the European Union.
We, like every Member State, apply sanctions to those who bring in excise goods that are not for their own personal use with the intention â exactly the intention to which the honourable Member refers â of evading the duty that would otherwise be due.
These sanctions, I believe, are proportionate to the nature of the offence.
Therefore he is right in recognising that guidelines are exactly that.
Â Â  . The Council has never debated this question and it is not within the sphere of its competence.
Â Â  I must say that I find the lack of any legal justification in terms of European Community law and the European Convention on Human Rights somewhat distressing.
There is little to reassure me about the welfare of my constituents.
The President-in-Office will be aware that, since February 2005, non-EU/EEA nationals have to obtain Home Office permission to get married in the United Kingdom.
Its effect is that we are talking about a limited number of couples.
Would the President-in-Office be prepared at least to convey to his Home Office colleagues my request that an amnesty be granted to such couples, at least where it is recognised that there is a genuine and subsisting relationship, and that the requirement to travel to the country of origin in order to apply for spousal residence be waived?
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member that I have concerns for the welfare and interests of her constituents, not least because we share constituents, representing as I do the constituents of Paisley and Renfrewshire South in Scotland.
I am respectful of her experience, not least in the field of constitutional law, but I would simply state what seems to me an obvious point, i.e. that my responsibilities today are not to explain or to articulate the position of the British Government in relation to this particular policy issue, but instead to outline the position of the European Union Presidency of which Britain holds the chair at the moment.
I would therefore be perfectly content if the honourable Member would wish to write to me on a bilateral basis on the specific points that she has raised in order that we could ensure that a reply be directed towards the Home Office in the United Kingdom.
But I would hesitate to go further than that, given that it is not really the appropriate focus for our discussions in this Chamber this afternoon.
Â Â  I note that in relation to the question on alcohol guidelines the Minister commented on UK practice, so I am sure he is prepared to do so on this subject: does this practice in the UK not jar with EU free movement rules in the developing concept of European citizenship?
If one of my constituents who has been caught by the new rule and whose marriage is accepted by the government moves to France, she would have the right to have her husband with her.
So, the bizarre effect is that couples get greater protection of their right to family life in an EU country other than their own.
There is a strong European dimension to this, so I believe it is apt to ask the UK Minister to answer as Presidency.
Â Â  . Well, Mr President, it was a valiant attempt in the supplementary to try and draw us into a discussion of Britainâs domestic policy, but I think the appropriate response, and one which is genuinely respectful to this Chamber, is to address ourselves to the points that have been raised in responding as the Presidency.
I have already made an offer to one of the Memberâs parliamentary colleagues that if she wishes to write directly to me, I will facilitate the correspondence being passed on to the Home Office in the United Kingdom, but I think, not least given the constraints of time always upon us during Question Time, it is important that we focus on questions to the Council at this stage, rather than to continue what is an appropriate discussion within respective Member States.
Â Â  . In reply to QuestionÂ 6, the Council shares the concerns of the honourable Member regarding restrictions on freedom of expression, including on the internet in China.
The European Union has most recently expressed these concerns in the context of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which took place on 24Â and 25 October 2005 in Beijing.
The European Union has also repeatedly raised this issue in other bilateral meetings, including at the highest level.
With a view to Chinaâs signature and the process of ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is of particular importance that freedom of expression be guaranteed in line with international standards.
ArticleÂ 19 of the ICCPR was therefore the subject of a recent legal seminar of European Union and Chinese academics and practitioners that took place in Beijing in June 2005 in the context of this dialogue.
The joint recommendations that resulted from that seminar were handed over to the Chinese side during that last dialogue.
As part of the dialogue and in the context of the European Union guidelines on human rights defenders, the European Union has raised with the Chinese authorities a number of cases of individuals detained for peacefully expressing their opinions, asking for more details on their fate and pressing for their release.
Â Â  Mr President, grateful though I obviously am to the Council for this response, I cannot shake off the impression that the Chinese Government, barring a few benevolent statements, is doing very little in specific terms.
I have the impression that the Council and the European Union are, to some extent, applying double standards and that China is being generously humoured on account of its numerical strength and our clearly enormous economic interest in it.
I personally think that the Council should adopt a tougher, more principled and more courageous policy where very basic human rights and the fundamental free expression of opinion are concerned, and would ask it, if possible, to revisit the specific case I have mentioned and perhaps, in this specific case, to contact the Chinese authorities.
Â Â  . The supplementary question ranges more widely than simply the specific case and the concerns regarding censorship of the internet and questions as to whether there is an effective response to the European Unionâs pleas and discussions with China in relation to human rights.
There is a fundamental choice to be made as to whether isolating any one country with which we have disagreements on standards of human rights is the right way forward.
The European Union has taken a view historically that to have a structured dialogue and to have engagement is the best means of effecting the kind of change I am sure all Members of this Parliament would wish to see.
The dialogue has, for example, encouraged China to become more involved in international human rights mechanisms, including the ratification in March 2001 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
China received the European Unionâs Special Representative on Education in 2003, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2004 and we very much hope that China will receive the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture this year.
I can assure the honourable Member that the dialogue is both very open and very frank and, as I sought to reflect in my initial answer to his question, this is a dialogue that takes place not simply at official level but at the very highest levels of the contact that exists between the European Union and China.
Â Â  . The Council shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member regarding the fact that for the past 11 years the European Court of Auditors has been unable to give, in its annual reports, a statement indicating that there was a reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of most of the underlying transactions.
However, for the 2004 accounts the Court was able to give assurance on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions for pre-accession assistance as well as on own-resources and administration.
For the first time, the Court has been able to conclude that the Integrated Administration and Control System â IACS â has reduced the risk of error for most agricultural expenditure to an acceptable level.
I can assure the House that the Council has consistently attached great importance to this issue and has regularly expressed its concern about the level of errors in transactions underlying payments and weaknesses in the control system.
As Members of the House will know, the Council has examined the recent Commission communication on a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework, which is part of the process towards a positive statement of assurance.
The UK Presidency and the Commission established a panel of experts which helped prepare a draft Council conclusion on this issue.
The Council adopted conclusions on 8Â November 2005, confirming that achieving a positive statement of assurance is the European Unionâs objective and listing a series of recommendations for action by the Commission and by Member States.
The Council considers those conclusions to be an important step towards a positive statement of assurance and will continue to support the Commissionâs efforts to contribute actively to improving the financial management of the European Union at all levels, but the decision lies ultimately in the hands of the Court of Auditors.
Â Â  . I accept that in your reply you acknowledge that there have been some improvements, but I hope that the Presidency will also accept that we have had lots of recommendations for action before but been a little bit short on action.
Very briefly, the information note from the European Court of Auditors says on pageÂ 7 that the adaptations and validations necessary to ensure the full implementation of the new accounting framework have been delayed.
Why, and for how long?
On pageÂ 8 it concludes that CAP expenditure was still materially affected by errors.
Why?
It adds that on internal policies the risk of errors will persist unless the legal framework is changed.
Will it be changed and when?
We should all accept that these problems are not the fault of the Presidency.
But will the Presidency accept that it has a responsibility to press for actions on these recommendations and could it perhaps write to me on the specific points that I have just raised?
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member that these are matters that we take extremely seriously.
Indeed in the remarks that were made by my ministerial colleague the Foreign Secretary in this House this afternoon, he made clear that âfailure to sign off accounts for the eleventh successive year, which is very poor, affects the climate of debate in all our countriesâ.
So at every level of the British Government and in the course of our Presidency, we have recognised the need to take forward work on this issue.
That is why we have been working with the Commission to improve financial management and control of the budget.
In January 2005, the Commission introduced a new accounting system, which should offer the Court of Auditors better information as the basis for giving a positive opinion on the presentation of accounts.
The new system, I understand, will be used to produce the accounts for 2005.
The Presidency also secured Member Statesâ agreement at the 8Â November ECOFIN Council on a package of further proposals for improvements in financial management and control, known as I described in my earlier answer as the roadmap, which the Commission has put forward.
So I can assure the honourable Member that this is not simply a matter of concern to the British Presidency, but one which, in the course of that ECOFIN meeting and in support of the renewed efforts of the Commission, we have been determined to take forward.
He is generous in acknowledging the fact that this problem, because it is a real problem for the European Union, long predates the British Presidency.
I hope that in the course of the six months of the British Presidency, we will have been able to play our part in resolving what has been a long-standing issue, which has brought no credit to the European Union and on which I hope a way forward can be found in the months and years to come.
Â Â  Would the President-in-Office accept that there are few, if any, individuals in Brussels stuffing their pockets with money?
Would he also accept that most of the complaints that the Court of Auditors brings forward concern systems and procedures, and not fraud in its narrow sense, and that if fraud does occur it is generally in donor countries or, indeed, sometimes in the Member States of the European Union?
Â Â  . The honourable Member is of course right to acknowledge that although the European Court of Auditorsâ report concerns the European Union accounts, 80% of the spending under that is in fact implemented by Member States through agriculture and structural funds.
However, we must be take care not to simply deploy that argument in case we are perceived to be complacent in the face of the challenge we face.
I would simply reiterate the point the Foreign Secretary made earlier, which is that, in the hands of those who are hostile towards the very idea of the European Union, the failure to sign off the accounts for the eleventh year is ammunition which we should certainly endeavour not to provide in the years ahead.
It is certainly true that action needs to be taken at Member State level rather than simply at the bureaucratic level within Brussels, but that should not in any way provide an excuse for the action that other Members have called for not being taken both in Brussels and at Member State level.
All of us with an interest in building and sustaining support for the European Union and its efforts amongst European citizens have a strong vested interest in seeing this long-standing problem being resolved.
That will involve action at the Member State level, but it will also involve the kind of important work that we took forward at Ecofin and which, I am glad to say, has the support of the European Commission.
Â Â  I wish to follow Mr Martinâs observation to the Presidency-in-Office, because the President-in-Office used the expression âhas brought no credit to the European Unionâ, as if somehow the European Union is a different institution from our national institutions.
I simply should like to emphasise the fact that the reason the Court of Auditors has found it difficult to sign off the accounts is not because of corruption in the European Union â as distinct from the Member States â but because the Member States do not assist the European Union to give the sort of valid accountancy that the Court of Auditors and EU institutions require.
I wish to ask the President-in-Office to give the public confidence that, of course, we must be scrupulous; but it is not somebody elseâs fault: it is our Member Statesâ fault.
Â Â  . With the greatest respect to the honourable Member, I disagree that the best way to tackle this problem that has existed for 11Â years is somehow to get into an apportionment of responsibility which suggests that one is better than the other, or vice versa.
The challenge, surely, is to recognise that there is a shared problem.
It would simply be disingenuous if I were to suggest that this does not present a very considerable reputational risk to the European Union, not least in the way that this failure to secure a statement of assurance for the eleventh year running has been presented in newspapers in a number of countries across the European Union, rather than get into a âwho is right, who is wrongâ argument.
The challenge is to find solutions that reflect the respective responsibilities of the Commission, the bureaucracy in Brussels and the Member States, but it is not an adequate response to the fact that, for 11 years, a statement of assurance has not been forthcoming simply to say that this is a matter for Member States and therefore there is no shared responsibility to find a way forward.
There is a shared responsibility on all of us who wish to see statements of assurance being forthcoming in the future to take the very kind of practical steps that the Commissionâs proposals represented and that, I am glad to say, we advanced during the British Presidency at the recent Ecofin meeting.
Â Â  . I welcome the question from the honourable Member who I know has a long-running interest in the issue of comitology.
He will know that discussions of the Commissionâs amended proposals resumed once more only in September so I hope that he will understand that it is too early at this stage for me to give a definitive answer to his question on behalf of the Council.
The working group considering the Commissionâs revised comitology proposal has met three times so far and will meet twice more under the British Presidency.
I understand, however, that discussions are going well.
Â Â  May I just thank the Presidency for its answer and urge it to persevere.
If we manage to find a solution to this issue which has beleaguered the Union for many years, we will be making a notable contribution to our endeavours to regulate better.
So much now comes to three readings each in Parliament and Council that really ought to be delegated to the executive.
But we will not delegate unless we have the guarantee that we can, if necessary, call things back, in the same way that the Council can.
Equality between Parliament and Council is the key to this.
If there is better opportunity for scrutiny, we will in turn be willing to delegate much more readily.
Â Â  . I pay due tribute to both the experience and expertise of the honourable Member on this matter.
I find myself in concurrence with his view, both as to the importance of this issue and to the fact that we need to persevere.
I can assure him that, from a Presidency point of view, we are persevering on this important point and will continue to do so.
Finally, I just wish to reiterate that, notwithstanding the fact that these discussions only resumed in September, I am glad to say that real progress has been made in the discussions that have already taken place.
I am optimistic that further substantial progress can be made in the two remaining meetings during the British Presidency.
Â Â  . All governments face the challenge of dealing with the current unprecedented threat of global terrorism.
However, there is no choice to be made between security and human rights.
Without security there are no human rights, and without human rights there is no security.
Following the attacks in London on 7Â July this year, the Council held an extraordinary meeting on 13Â July.
At this meeting the Council adopted a declaration on the European Union response to those terrible bombings.
In the declaration the Council made it clear that, and I quote directly: âthe attacks are an affront to universal values on which the European Union is based.
Central to those values is a commitment to democratic and open institutions and societies governed by the rule of law within which people of all faiths and backgrounds can live, work and prosper together.
The terrorists who reject that commitment and seek to use violence to impose their ideas will be defeatedâ.
They added thereafter that the European Union was strengthening, and again I quote directly: âits commitment to combating terrorism and upholding the fundamental principles of freedom, security and justiceâ.
Â Â  Thank you for your response.
I accept that this is a matter in which there ought to be more choice and it is an issue of striking the right balance.
What I would like to know is: in what way does the detention of persons without charge, the refusal to provide meaningful information for the reasons for detention and the removal of a lawyerâs right to take meaningful instructions in such matters either reaffirm these values or assert their validity?
Â Â  .
I would suggest respectfully that the honourable Member is trying to tempt me into discussions as to the approaches or suggested approaches of one Member State or another, when my responsibility today is to speak on behalf of the Council.
I can assure him that from a Presidency point of view the statement that I shared with Parliament and which was agreed by Council Members on 13Â July is a strong basis on which, as a united front, we can confront the threat of international terrorism.
Let us be very clear: the terrorists want to deny us not just life, through their vicious and unprecedented attacks on us, but also our way of life.
That is why I think the statement made by the Council on 13Â July is such a strong reflection of pan-European sentiments as to how we should deal with these challenges.
Â Â  . The Council has not discussed the level of Member Statesâ defence budgets as this is a national responsibility.
As regards defence capabilities, ways are being sought to improve them by increasing levels of research spending, as well as research collaboration, tackling capability gaps and training.
For this reason, and following up on the discussion at the informal Heads of Government meeting in Hampton Court, the Presidency has asked the High Representative, in association where appropriate with the Presidency, the future Presidency and the European Commission, to take forward work in this particular area.
Working with the Presidency, the High Representative will present a summary of his initial orientations ahead of the December European Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Presidency is fully aware of the importance of reaching an agreement on the new financial perspective by the end of the year and will do everything it can to facilitate this.
This has been something of a recurring theme of the discussions in the Chamber this afternoon.
To this end, the Council undertook a series of bilateral consultations with Member States during the summer and discussions on this issue resumed in the Council on 7Â November.
They will continue, of course, at the General Affairs Council on Monday, 21Â November.
The Presidency will continue to work towards an agreement, but until such time as it might be ready to submit to the Council an overall compromise proposal, it cannot comment on what such a proposal might or might not contain.
Â Â  â Mr President, do you intend to notify the European Parliament, before the December summit, of the compromise text prepared by the Presidency?
Given that the United Kingdom played a leading role in June in overturning the agreement, is the Presidency sincerely willing to move so that an agreement between the twenty-five can be reached?
Have you considered in the Council that the British Presidency is in danger of proving to be one of the most inefficient and unsuccessful in the history of the European Union?
Â Â  . My colleague the Foreign Secretary indicated that this was the 47th appearance of a British Minister in the course of the Presidency before this Parliament.
I can assure the honourable Member that I will be back in my customary place in the course of the further plenary sessions of this Parliament.
Our Prime Minister has committed himself to coming back to speak to Parliament.
Whatever other criticisms or scepticism may be directed toward the British Presidency, a lack of discussion with the European Parliament is perhaps not one of the most forceful.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I will take advantage of this opportunity as I have drafted my own question on the same matter, Question No 17, which there may be no time to answer during this Question Time.
I would like to ask if it is possible that this compromise proposal will also include a cofinancing procedure for agriculture, in order for agreement to be reached on scrapping the United Kingdomâs special rebate?
Â Â  . I admire the opportunism of the honourable Member in seizing the chance of a supplementary to raise the issue he was going to bring up in QuestionÂ 17.
I would simply, perhaps disappointingly, reiterate to him my earlier response to the effect that it really would not be appropriate, given the delicacy and importance of the issues that are being discussed and that will be taken forward in the course of our Presidency, to try and draw out a particular element of the potential package around which we hope to secure consensus in December.
Â Â  . I can be brief in answer to this question.
The Council has never debated this question and it is not within its sphere of competence.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the ongoing debate on transparency and openness in the Council and the exchange of views between the United Kingdom Presidency and Members of the European Parliament on this issue, a first discussion took place in COREPER, the Permanent RepresentativesÂŽâ committee, on 19Â October.
The Presidency is currently exploring, together with the incoming Austrian and Finnish Presidencies, a series of possible measures aimed at further increasing legislative transparency in the Council.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office.
Let me say what an enormous relief it is to have a few minutes of not debating REACH in endless groups around this Parliament â a few minutes only, I fear.
I see that Mr Kirkhope is not here, but I am conscious that he raised this issue in an earlier debate.
I should like to personally thank the President-in-Office for his efforts in this matter.
I recognise that he is doing what he can to promote the agenda.
I have here a copy of a letter from Mr Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark, stating that he supports a change in the rules of procedure.
I suspect that similar letters could be obtained from Estonia and Sweden to start off with.
We already know the British position.
That is four votes and you need only another nine.
I know the Council prefers to do things by consensus but in order to achieve something of real substance â a real change â should the Presidency not push this to a vote at the next General Affairs Council and name and shame Member States that do not support this position?
Â Â  . I am intrigued by the advice being offered by the honourable Member.
A strategy of not seeking consensus and naming and shaming is a curious line of argument to advance but I think it indicates the seriousness of the strength of feeling among many honourable Members of this House on this important issue.
The position of the British Government on this matter has been stated by none other than our Prime Minister, but he is right in recognising that the United Kingdom, although acting as Presidency, is not the sole actor on this stage.
I fear I will disappoint the honourable Member by pointing out that, because the agenda for Monday is so heavily charged, as not only defence ministers but also development ministers will be involved, we will not discuss transparency next week.
An options paper will be issued in the coming days and it will be discussed by the Antici Group before a discussion in COREPER II.
COREPER I will also feed into that process so I am grateful for the generous words of the honourable Member.
I can assure him it is a matter on which we are making continued efforts but we are convinced that the way forward is not to address it on 21Â November at the forthcoming General Affairs Council, but to seek to make what will be important progress in these other fora which I have described.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, you were intrigued by the questioner.
I am intrigued by your answer in pretending that the British Government stands in favour of more transparency.
I have in my hand the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee report published on 24Â October.
It contains an answer setting out the British Governmentâs position in response to the proposition that there should be meetings of the Council held in public.
It says: âthe Government believes that it would not be possible for the European Council to reach agreement on difficult issues which cannot be resolved by the Council of Ministers if it is obliged to work in the full glare of publicityâ.
So, what is the real stance of the British Government?
Are you in favour of transparency, or are you in favour of avoiding working in the full glare of publicity, as this answer suggests?
Â Â  . I will answer the honourable Member by saying that, not least as befits the country holding the Presidency of the European Union, the answer will be provided in terms of the Presidency's proposals, because what matters is not the view of one country but the view of the Member States.
When we issue proposals in the coming days, setting out to partners the possible options for increasing transparency in the Council, I can assure the honourable Member, who has spoken with eloquence in terms of the importance he attaches to this issue, that we will be discussing this paper with the incoming Presidencies and also with the Council Secretariat.
These options will be taken forward in COREPER, as I said previously, on the basis of the options paper at the Antici meeting later this month.
That, I believe, is the constructive way forward to ensure that we get the outcome which so many here seek.
Â Â  Is the Presidency aware of the long history of this issue in that this Parliament has pressed for the Council to meet in public when acting as a legislature ever since it was first elected in 1979?
Indeed, the British Presidency in 1976, when represented in the Energy Council by one Tony Benn, took the initiative of saying that Council should meet in public when acting on legislation.
Would he recognise that we have made a lot of progress together in our gradually evolving Constitution, in that the Council now at least publishes the results of all its votes on legislation and grants the public a right of access to documents, but that it would be worth going one last extra step and actually meeting and voting in public when adopting legislation?
Â Â  .
I defer to the honourable Member in terms of the detail of his historical understanding of this issue, reinforcing the longstanding interest that the Benn family has taken in this matter.
It might be of interest to the honourable Member to be aware that this is a matter in which I have been in discussion with Tony Bennâs son, because he is now one of the United Kingdomâs representatives on the Council of Development Ministers and therefore has a direct interest in the position that we take in that and other Councils.
I am glad to say that his observations reflect quite the weight of history that lies behind the important discussions that we are taking forward with Member States at the moment.
In answer to the earlier question, I would simply reiterate the point that our own Prime Minister made when he addressed the European Parliament early in the course of the British Presidency: it is that impulse that has driven us to take forward the discussions at COREPER and that we now anticipate we will take forward in the days ahead.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, I apologise to you and the Presidency itself for being late.
I spoke with Mr Hilary Benn on Sunday about this very matter when we were at Remembrance Day in Leeds.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office what the position is regarding what I was told by Mr Blair â and indeed what I was told today by Mr Straw â concerning how we go forward with this issue of openness and transparency in terms of the Council.
I was told by Mr Blair that it would be fine to go ahead as long as it was within the rules.
I was told by Mr Straw this afternoon that two options were being considered.
I would like to know whether those options are within the rules or whether we are looking at a change in the rules.
Â Â  . I am grateful to the honourable Member for reinforcing the contemporary nature of these discussions amongst British politicians.
I cannot claim to have spoken to Hilary Benn in quite as recent days as he has, but I can assure you that, when I meet him at Cabinet tomorrow morning, I will search out what he told you at the Remembrance Service in Leeds on Sunday.
In relation to the point he makes, however, he will have to wait just a little while longer because, before he re-entered the Chamber this afternoon, I was sharing with other colleagues the process that we are taking forward now: as he knows, there was a discussion at Coreper earlier in the course of the British Presidency.
It will not be discussed on 21Â November at the General Affairs Council.
We have instead decided to set out an options paper which will be issued in the coming days of our Presidency and will then be discussed at the Antici before discussion at COREPER II.
COREPER I will also feed into this process.
If it would be of help to the honourable Member, I shall certainly ensure that he receives a copy of the options paper when it is issued.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to refer the honourable Member to the Councilâs reply to his question H-0692/05 of 28Â September.
In my reply, I stated that ArticleÂ 2 of the Fisheries Agreement initialled on 28Â July 2005 indicates that it applies âto the Moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Moroccoâ.
This delimitation of the geographical scope of the agreement is identical to the delimitation in the previous agreement that expired in 1999 and does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara.
The initialled agreement is now in the ratification process, which is expected to lead to its formal conclusion in the first quarter of 2006.
Â Â  I wish to thank the Council for its answer.
The problem with it is that it means that the EU has concluded a fisheries agreement whereby the EU will fish in the waters of Western Sahara, which is a country occupied illegally by Morocco.
None of the EU Member States recognises Moroccoâs sovereignty over Western Sahara.
However elegantly one puts it, there is no getting around the fact that you have concluded, or are on the way to concluding, an agreement that indirectly approves Moroccoâs sovereignty over Western Sahara due to the fact that the agreement extends to include negotiations concerning the occupied countryâs natural resources.
I think that this is deeply inconsistent and immoral.
I therefore wonder whether there is not a lack of unanimity regarding the Councilâs policy in this area.
Â Â  . Let me assure the honourable Member that the political status of Western Sahara is being dealt with within the framework of the United Nations.
The Council is offering the UN its full support in finding a satisfactory resolution to the question of Western Sahara, and hopes that a resolution of the situation will be forthcoming.
As I stated earlier, the fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara.
As with the previous longstanding agreement, the new EU-Morocco fisheries agreement applies to âthe Moroccan fisheries zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Moroccoâ.
The fisheries agreement does not in any way prejudice that issue of the status of Western Sahara, as the honourable Member suggests.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, I do not think that one can, as Mr SjÃ¶stedt has just done, simply describe Morocco as an occupying power.
I would ask you whether the problem of the Western Sahara is not a relic of our own, European, colonial past, and whether we ought not to try to understand both sides â the Moroccans and the other factions â if we are to bring about a real compromise solution that takes account of Moroccoâs interests too.
Â Â  . Let me assure the honourable Member that we are looking for a genuine solution but we recognise that this genuine solution â the political status of the Western Sahara â is being dealt with in the framework of the United Nations.
The United Nations enjoys the Councilâs full support in seeking to find that genuine and satisfactory solution to the question of the Western Sahara.
We certainly hope that a resolution of this situation will be forthcoming.
Â Â  Questions 16 to 36 will be answered in writing(3).
Â Â  Parliament is concerned at the human rights violations in Tunisia that have come to light at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).
On a visit to the country earlier in the year, and in a statement made in September, the President expressed his displeasure at the repression and harassment meted out to NGOs and the media in Tunisia, and pointed out that this runs counter to the spirit of the EU-Tunisia association agreement.
The information society represents a huge opportunity for freedom of expression and the peaceful exchange of ideas, and enables people across borders and cultures to be brought closer together.
What should have been a celebration of progress turned sour as a result of the harassment of human rights defenders from Tunisia and abroad and media representatives, and of the restraints on activities in defence of human rights and democracy in Tunisia that have been developed on the Internet.
Parliamentâs delegation to the WSIS led by Mrs Trautmann will express our position at the meeting itself and at the parallel citizensâ summit set to take place this week.
We deplore the authoritiesâ attempts to stop this peaceful event from taking place.
As Parliament made clear in its recent resolution, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all those working peacefully towards the development of democracy and the rule of law in Tunisia.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0304/2005) by Mrs Scheele, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing humane trapping standards for certain animal species (COM(2004)0532 C6-0100/2005 2004/0183(COD)).
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her very honest and assiduous work and I should like to say that the proposal for a directive being debated is designed to introduce standards to safeguard relatively humane trapping conditions for the animals trapped.
This proposal is dictated by the obligation for the European Community to give international commitments to Canada, Russia and the United States.
These international commitments and obligations derive from the agreement on international humane trapping standards signed in 1998 between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation and from another agreement of similar content signed between the European Community and the United States in the form of agreed practices.
The agreement with Canada and Russia, which has already been ratified by the European Community and Canada, will enter into force immediately after its imminent ratification by Russia, a procedure which, according to the Commission's official information, has already been set in motion.
Consequently, unless the relevant Community legislation is adopted, the European Community will not be in a position to honour its international commitments when the agreement enters into force.
The scope of the proposed directive is truly restricted.
Nonetheless, if it is adopted, it will provide a framework for the adoption of common standards in the European Union in order to limit unnecessary suffering and distress for the animals trapped.
The proposed standards are based on the results of serious scientific work within the framework of the International Organisation for Standardisation and, more importantly, have been adopted by the World Conservation Union.
The proposal also makes provision for the Member States to be able to maintain in force and apply stricter national provisions.
Furthermore, the draft directive adds to and does not subtract from existing standards on the basis of current Community legislation.
For example, the ban in the European Union on the use of leghold traps based on Council Regulation 3254/91 will continue to apply even after the new directive is adopted.
I must emphasise that, during the course of the procedure, we are willing to examine the relevant amendments in order to take account of the concerns expressed by various political groups and numerous animal welfare organisations and the Commission intends to continue to work in this direction.
The rejection of the proposal will mean that the European Union will be left without any trapping standards in the immediate future and that the European Community will be unable to honour its international obligations.
To close, I should like to stress that I shall take account of Parliament's opinion and I shall evaluate the positions formulated both in Parliament and in the Council.
On this basis, the Commission will decide on possible action, including the possible withdrawal of the proposal.
At the same time, the Commission is planning to prepare a study with a view to updating the scientific basis for any proposal on the adoption of trapping standards.
The relevant consultations with the interested parties will, of course, also be included.
Finally, I should like to express my wish to maintain good cooperation with you in the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a very tense debate on chemicals policy, it is a great relief to get back to considering a topic on which there has already been a very broad majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and on which I assume there will be one tomorrow as well.
As Commissioner Dimas said, the Commission proposal of 2004 is the instrument whereby the international agreement is to be implemented.
My proposal that it be rejected was adopted virtually unanimously by the Environment Committee, with 47 votes in favour, 3 against and 2 abstentions.
I will now proceed to explain why mine was one of the votes against.
As the proposal is covered by the chapter on environmental policy, the European Union is obliged to take the latest scientific knowledge as the basis for the legislative proposal.
Such a basis is absent; all that has been done is to incorporate, almost word for word, the agreement negotiated ten years ago.
There are also legal incongruities between the proposal and other EU legislation, including, for example, the directive on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes and the habitats directive.
The Commission proposal would allow the trapping and killing of animals protected by the habitats directive.
There are, as we all know, certain circumstances under which trapping methods and traps may be necessary, but we stated from the very outset that it was inappropriate to describe the directive as laying down humane trapping standards.
The proposal is very weak and will do nothing to reduce the suffering of animals caught or killed by means of traps.
The Commissioner has himself made clear, and I do myself believe, that we have to recapitulate a certain amount of history if the firm rejection by Parliament is to be understood.
It was in 1989 that Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a ban on the use of leghold traps in the European Union and on the import of furs and fur products from countries in which they were used.
By way of a response to this, a regulation on this subject was adopted in 1991, which prohibited, with effect from 1995, the use of leghold traps and the import of the furs of thirteen named species from third countries.
This ban does not apply where one of the two conditions is complied with.
That is also the reason for this international agreement.
Suitable legislation or administrative regulations are in force to prohibit leghold traps except where the methods used to catch the animals listed meet internationally agreed humane trapping standards.
This EU regulation would make it a matter of the utmost necessity that trapping standards be established at international level in order to obviate a ban on imports.
It was threats on the part of the USA and Canada to contest these import restrictions before the WTO that resulted in the negotiation of an agreement between the EU, Canada, Russia and the USA, which only the EU and Canada have so far ratified.
The trapping standards prescribed in the agreement reflect norms already in force in Russia, Canada and the USA and can in no way be categorised as humane.
It was as long ago as 1997 that the European Parliament adopted a report that described the international agreement as wholly inadequate in terms of either animal welfare or the environmental objective and expressed the view that it was wholly unacceptable that the European Union should sign up to it.
An agreement offering not even the most minimal guarantee that the other parties would abandon the use of leghold traps within a speedy and specific timetable is not one that should even be put forward for serious consideration.
This House adopted this report by a large majority in 1997.
So much for the historical review.
I hope we will, tomorrow, get a broad majority for the rejection of what I regard as a very poor proposal from the Commission, and also that the Commission will demonstrate that it has some grasp of what democracy is and will withdraw it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, for the cooperation in the drawing up of the report we are considering today, which was very fair, indeed positively agreeable, even though we were not of one mind on every issue.
We did, though, eventually agree, and so I can say, quite simply, that there are many roads that lead to Rome.
This item on its order of business is characteristic of what makes the European Parliament peculiar.
We are concerning ourselves with the transposition of an international agreement between Canada, the USA, Russia and the EU, even though this agreement was â as the rapporteur said â rejected in 1998.
Only in the European Parliament can such a thing happen.
Speaking personally, I do not find this situation so problematic, having, at that time, voted in favour of the agreement or, to put it another way, against its rejection, because I was confident that the participating countries actually would maintain the standards required, and because I was keen that these countriesâ indigenous peoples should not lose their livelihood and should be able to live from trading in skins and pelts.
That is certainly defensible on the grounds that trade was freed up, but something else that was achieved â and this was another reason why I voted in favour at the time â namely that cruel traps that tormented animals were banned, some of which, leghold traps, for example, were no more than instruments of torture.
What made this achievement possible was years of pressure exerted by the European Parliament, by the Commission, and also by the animal welfare organisations.
The Commission directive that we have before us today contains all the measures of the agreement that facilitate trade, by which I mean primarily the import of animal skins and furs into the European Union.
It is for this reason that we believe that its implementation would have an impact on the internal market and should therefore be subject to Article 95 as its legal basis.
The fact that this is not the case is another reason for us to vote against this report.
Even though my amendments did not attract the support of a majority in this House, I should nonetheless like to bring them to the Commissionâs attention.
It may be that the time is not ripe for certain regulations.
I proposed that these Commission proposals should find their way into a regulation calling on the Member States to transpose the agreement, and consequently committing them to all that it would entail â reporting and so on â as well.
I regard this as the right approach.
I also agree with the rapporteur that we need to make improvements to the parameters and also require research, but this is not a task for the European Union, but rather for the Member States, where conditions vary so widely that due regard must be had to subsidiarity.
That is why we have rejected the Commission proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will do my best.
Today â or rather tomorrow, in fact â we face a very tricky decision.
We will be voting in favour of rejecting the Commission proposal, but I, for one, will do so reluctantly.
We in this Parliament have a duty to contribute to the legislative process and we will be rejecting the proposal tomorrow without giving an indication as to how things should be done instead.
That is, to my mind, a missed opportunity.
It appears that all parties had grievances.
Some thought the proposal was going too far, while others felt it did not go anything like far enough.
We ought, though, to decide one way or another.
The Commission would also have something to use as a basis if it tables a fresh proposal to implement the international treaty.
I must, of course, also say a word about the muskrats.
Needless to say, the Dutch dikes must be protected.
We cannot promote animal welfare that is at the expense of our safety.
I am not all that keen on drowning sets, though, and I would urge you as yet to review the trapping of muskrats and the methods used for it.
To my mind, the following conditions must certainly be met before drowning sets can be installed.
First of all, we must have reached plague proportions and, with it, damage to the dikes.
This damage is evident in a number of locations in the Netherlands, namely in Frisia and South Holland, but in Brabant, this damage is far less pronounced.
The second condition is that the drowning set is only to be used if prevention has proved ineffective or is impossible to implement, and the third condition is if no animal-friendly alternatives are available.
Whilst it is disappointing that Europe will not table a workable directive in the short term, it is not the end of the debate.
Neither should this, to my mind, spell the painful end of muskrats.
For the time being, it is up to the Member States to take their own measures.
I would therefore urge you to thrash out alternatives and reduce the animal suffering to a minimum.
Rejecting this directive should not be an excuse in the Netherlands not to enter into the debate of muskrat control, and while I am on the subject, I should like to thank Mrs Scheele for triggering an enormous discussion, which we would not have had without her amendment.
So let us therefore see the present situation in a positive light and do something that this House has not yet done by seizing the chance to make prevention a priority, developing the necessary alternatives, so that the Netherlands can make an important contribution to a fresh legislative proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group supports Mrs Scheeleâs proposal to reject the Commission proposal.
I think that she has demonstrated beyond doubt that this is an example of bad legislation.
For example, the drafting of standards which traps must meet has not been underpinned by sound scientific research.
The criteria to be met by traps and tests for the same are arbitrary.
It is, of course, difficult to measure the suffering of animals.
Where does stress end and the battle for life begin?
Moreover, especially in the catch involving live traps, the proposal does not cover the humanity of alternative methods that might have to be used to kill the animals.
Animals often drown in a different way, are clubbed to death or kill each other.
There is inconsistency between this proposal and the Habitat Directive.
Certain animal species that are protected under the Habitat Directive â I would particularly mention the ban on catching and killing such wild animals as the otter, beaver, wolf and lynx â are also listed in the annex to the proposal on humane trapping methods.
What are we to make of this?
Other animals too that fall within the scope of this proposal, including the marten and the badger, are protected or preserved in certain areas.
In connection with this directive, I too cannot help but briefly mention a typically Dutch safety issue, namely the protection of its low lands from flooding by dike breaches.
On account of its way of life, the muskrat undermines dikes, which forms a real threat to safety and public health in the Netherlands.
While that animal is a foreign species and should, of course, be controlled in the most humane way possible, there is at the moment no useable and more humane method of control that is as effective as the drowning set.
A ban on the drowning set â and I can imagine that the proposal will at some point return to such a ban â makes the effective control of muskrats impossible.
Dutch safety and public health would be at risk as a result.
On behalf of the muskrat, we must also find more humane trapping methods that can be used, but until such time as suitable alternatives are found, I think a clear exemption position for the Netherlands or for a situation in which safety is at risk, would be welcomed.
I would like to finish off with a comment of a more general nature.
In the European Union, we are indulging in animal protection .
A great deal is happening in the area of, for example, cutting down on animal tests.
