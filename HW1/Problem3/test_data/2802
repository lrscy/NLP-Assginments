If the social process were to be squeezed out, integrated overall solutions would soon be replaced by the perspective of the employer alone.
The result would then be conflict and strife instead of constructive cooperation.
I would therefore urge the Commission to stick by the Lisbon decisions, which emphasise both economic growth and social integration, which give just as much weight to the quality of working life as to the quantity of work produced and which make full employment, viewed in the light of sustainability, a prime objective.
I also want to underline the value of the open method of coordination, which invites the Member States to take part in a learning and development process that can be far more effective than the traditional way in which legislation is steered through. The method is still in its infancy.
It needs to be developed and implemented more consistently, especially within the individual Member States where it can be combined with entrepreneurship and development strategies that create both jobs and a qualified work force.
I should finally also like to address the absent Council of Ministers, which will meet on 8 October and say that it is not enough to take certain steps to simplify a bureaucratic European cooperation process.
There is also a need to set political priorities and to take practical initiatives that will lead to action and that are based on the decisions taken in Lisbon.
We also need important changes in the Member States if we are ever to obtain a coordinated and effective European employment process.
We therefore require a bottom-up process to complement the present top-down process at European level.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication being debated today is based on the evaluation by the Commission and the Member States of five years of the employment strategy in practice.
The results are important and I should like to reiterate a number of them.
Ten million jobs have been created in Europe, as the result both of economic growth in previous years and efficient reforms on numerous job markets.
We have seen important structural changes in most Member States, qualitative changes in employment policies and numerous countries have made progress in energising the job market, preventing long-term unemployment, introducing the most employment-friendly tax systems yet, gradually adapting education and training systems and introducing more flexible labour standards.
What is important about the employment strategy is that the driving force behind it was the management of basic objectives.
The Member States had common objectives and used the open method of coordination.
Much still remains to be done and this is set out every year in the Commission's common report and guidelines.
Your motion contains some very interesting ideas on how we need to proceed and we need to draw on what we have learned to date so that we can make a number of changes.
I fully endorse the three priorities which you have set: first, the need to increase the rate of employment in relation to the Lisbon objectives, secondly, the question of the quality of work and, thirdly, the need to reduce inequalities on the job market, and here I would highlight the question of inequalities at numerous levels, the gaps on the job market, be they skills gaps, inequalities at regional level or inequalities between the two sexes.
As far as inequalities between the Member States and the new countries after enlargement are concerned, I disagree with the proposal in the explanatory statement that we should operate with two parallel strategies.
We need a single strategy and common objectives, although naturally we shall use national recommendations to differentiate our message and accommodate the peculiarities of each country.
The European Parliament and the Commission also appear to agree on the need to rationalise the procedure.
One important priority is to ensure the strategy continues to be efficient and discriminating.
The philosophy we propose is fewer guidelines and a stronger medium-term strategy, more stable guidelines; to put it simply, fewer guidelines which are valid for a longer period of time.
Again, one question which arises when we talk of updating is the scope of future guidelines.
What will their scope be?
Will they relate specifically to the job market or more globally to all the basic factors which influence employment policies?
We take the view that they should have a broad scope which covers the main factors which influence the level and quality of employment in our economy.
As far as the management model, the method used to manage and administer the employment strategy is concerned, I totally agree that we need to incorporate the employment strategy at all levels of national planning.
We have seen interesting examples of regional and local employment strategies over the past 5 years, local action plans on employment have been submitted, and this was a successful initiative.
The commitment and contribution of the two sides of industry is very important.
Of course, our initial evaluation is that not every means of involving them has been exhausted and that important efforts are needed.
And as far as the involvement of civil society is concerned, it is still early days as regards any decisive involvement of civil society in employment policies.
I agree that the national parliaments have a vital role to play.
The parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already organised events with national parliaments on exchanging experience and information and we believe that this should continue but that, in future proposals, starting with the debate in the Convention, the national parliaments should play a more important part in national action plans and the European Parliament should play a more important part in the European procedure.
My last comment has to do with bringing the European Employment Strategy into line with the general economic policy guidelines, as proposed in our communication of 3 September.
We hope that, in adopting this proposal, which I presented to Parliament the day it was adopted, we will achieve greater cohesion between the two strategies, without calling the independence of the employment strategy in question.
The purpose of the communication taking stock of the strategy, together with the communication on rationalisation, is to start an open debate on the future of the European employment strategy.
After five years in practice, I think that your report has made a valuable contribution and that the Council will do likewise at its meeting on 8 October, when one of the basic issues of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be the debate on the evaluation and the future of the employment strategy.
As you know, the official proposal on the 2003 guidelines on employment will be submitted next April, together with the proposal on the general economic policy guidelines.
In the interim, there is time enough for everyone to take part in this procedure and express their opinion.
In order to broaden and facilitate this debate, the Commission intends to publish a further communication in January which, as far as the timing of specific proposals is concerned, will come halfway between the communications already approved and the proposal for the 2003 guidelines.
This means we shall have two-and-a-half months in which to conduct an in-depth debate.
We eagerly await your proposals and, if we draw on experience from the past five years, we shall be able to improve the employment strategy dramatically.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the European Employment Strategy was adopted five years ago it was seen as an important step towards combating unemployment.
All in all, its four pillars have passed the test.
The first, employability, includes developing skills and qualifications.
The second concerns the adaptability of the individual to the ever-increasing demands in companies and society.
The third is entrepreneurship with the aim of job creation, and the fourth, equal opportunities, is one of the most important pillars, which, like the others, needs to be developed further.
The very ambitious aim is to make the European Union into the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, but this is not only significant in terms of the economy; there are also clear implications for social policy.
In 1997 there were 17 million people unemployed in the European Union.
Last year there were 13 million.
This year, however, the figures are clearly rising again.
This is particularly noticeable in my own country, Germany.
We must not become accustomed to these high figures.
In some countries, however, there has been an increase in employment and women in particular have benefited from this.
Nevertheless - and here is the rub - the jobs concerned are mainly part-time and lower qualified jobs.
The Member States must, by creating the appropriate conditions, by policy-making and by negotiating constructively with the social partners, create higher quality jobs, in particular in the full-time sector.
We are still miles away from achieving the ambitious goal set in the Lisbon Council Conclusions of an employment rate of 70% or 60% for women between 2000 and 2010.
In my opinion, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we criticise the fact that the Member States still have not set any employment rates for women in their national action plans.
In the NAPs no significant suggestions are made for improving performance in the equality initiative.
On average women earn 76% of the hourly rate for men.
The social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.
To create jobs, women also need to be encouraged to found firms or become self-employed through targeted support.
What does this involve?
Reducing the burden on business, simplifying the formalities, particularly at the start-up phase, and setting up funds.
It also involves securing access for women to education and vocational training.
Gender-specific discrimination must therefore be combated energetically.
We call for these steps to be included in the national action plans in the future so that their results can be monitored.
In the Committee on Equal Opportunities and Women's Rights we addressed one further interesting issue: how better to reconcile work and family life.
Progress has definitely been made in the Member States.
However, in many cases working conditions are not sufficiently family friendly.
There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other dependents and in general there is a lack of flexibility.
The main points in my opinion were accepted unanimously by the lead committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank Herman Schmid for his concise report and for his ability not only to seek compromises but also to put them into practice.
My work in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was not the only say that I had in the Schmid report, because I was also the shadow rapporteur for my group, the PPE, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Despite a willingness to establish common ground, there were quite a few differences of opinion.
That is why we will be tabling amendments again tomorrow in the plenary. Let me give you an example.
Since the Luxembourg employment summit, which was initiated by the highly successful Council Presidency of Jean-Claude Juncker, we have all endeavoured to achieve better coordination of economic and employment policy.
Agreed!
However, we must not ignore the fact that it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the practical measures.
That is where investment is made, but unfortunately all too often withheld.
That is where the competence for taxation, social security and other charges lies.
There social policy is at home with different national traditions.
We do not agree that the open coordination method needs to be extended to all areas of social policy.
Although it is necessary to strengthen democracy and involve as many stakeholders as possible, we must not have it extended haphazardly to any number of players in civil society, because there is a risk, Commissioner, that Members of Parliament, at both national and European level, and the social partners will be sidelined in the process.
That would be wrong.
I hope that we are successful in winning the support of other groups for this and other important amendments.
If so we will have a majority not only in the committees but also in the plenary tomorrow in favour of Herman Schmid's otherwise expert report.
Mr President, I am delighted that we are having a debate on this vitally important subject.
It is clear that many Member States still have much to do to reduce high levels of unemployment.
It is very easy to set targets and to make promises - as Chancellor SchrÃ¶der has found out - but the jobless need action and not words.
I agree with the rapporteur that job creation is a major challenge.
I disagree with his conclusions that we need the Commission to examine anew the causes of low economic growth and to submit suggestions to reverse it.
The causes are clear, the actions required are clear.
What is needed is the political will to make it happen.
There is, however, no solution to unemployment in strengthening the role of the social partners to quote the rapporteur 'in all matters' regarding the organisation of work and working conditions - though I am sure the trade unions are always looking for such an opportunity.
The social partners may well have a very useful role in some countries and in some cases but, given that the majority of employment growth is coming from SMEs whose employees are beholden neither to big business nor to big unions, it is hard to see how such a move would be positive for job creation.
Certainly we must all put job creation at the top of our own agendas.
I earnestly hope that colleagues from all sides of the House, and indeed the Commissioner, will reflect on this when we are voting on the Atypical Workers Directive in a few weeks time.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mr Herman Schmid for his extremely valuable cooperation in preparing this report. He has been very constructive.
I share the Commissioner's view that the employment strategy has been successful, as far as we can see.
During the five years that it has been applied, unemployment has gone down, the number of jobs has increased and, for example, the active labour market policy, which was previously being conducted at a very low level in Europe, has now been considerably improved, partly through lifelong learning.
Big improvements have taken place.
Nevertheless, there remains a lot to be done, just as the Commission's document states.
Unemployment is still too high.
There is a big gap when it comes to education and lifelong learning.
Those who already have a high level of education also help themselves to most of the education offered in the labour market, and those who have least education do not obtain as much.
There are also big regional differences within Europe.
The overhaul and improvement of the employment strategy are necessary therefore.
I myself think that the pillar structure has been valuable as a structural instrument, because some parts of the pillar structure have been more successful than others.
The employability pillar has been relatively successful, and the equality pillar has also been successful in the sense that female employment has increased, even though a lot remains to be done.
On the other hand, the adaptability pillar, which is a little more difficult to understand, has not been as successful.
This is nonetheless an important area we must continue to work on, for it is this which has an influence upon working life, the working environment and lifelong learning out there in the workplace.
All these factors must be improved in the future.
It is good that the Commission is now proposing to coordinate employment policy and economic policy, but I share Mr Herman Schmid's view that social security too, in relation to which we also have a European process, must be involved in this coordination.
When coordination takes place, no area must be given precedence over another.
It is easy, both at national and European levels, to allow economic policy and the economic process to take precedence over the socio-political dimension and considerations relating to employment policy.
That must not happen. They are equally valuable processes which must be treated equally when coordination takes place.
I regard open coordination as a complement to legislation, not as an alternative to it.
We must, however, improve the actual way in which the open method of coordination is applied.
Since there is no qualified majority in the Council on the issue of the objectives, it is reasonable for the European Parliament to have the right of co-decision concerning these objectives.
When it comes to the national action plans, I share Mr Herman Schmid's outlook.
It goes without saying that they must be debated and decided upon in the national parliaments.
It is only fair that we should have democratic control, both at European and national levels, where these important issues are concerned.
It is also important to involve other actors. Of these, the two sides of industry are perhaps the most important of all.
It is important for them to be involved in devising policy, both at European level and at the other levels.
It is also important, as mentioned in our proposal, for the candidate countries to be integrated into this process at an early stage.
There are a number of differences between the candidate countries and our own countries, but there are also similarities.
Demographic developments and the demands they make upon the labour market are similar in the candidate countries.
Consequently, the candidate countries need to be involved in this process soon.
Moreover, we want to see a clearer link between employment policy and existing economic instruments, namely the European Social Fund and Equal.
The employment strategy underlying those instruments must be made clear; clearer, that is to say, than it is at present.
In general, we are encouraged by the developments in this process but, as mentioned earlier, institutional changes are needed: better coordination and a strengthening of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments.
We must not forget, however, that economic policy, employment policy and the respective councils must be accorded equal value.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by sincerely thanking Mr Herman Schmid for the very expert way in which he has overseen the preparation of this opinion.
Thanks to his knowledge, expertise and focus, we have obtained a very stringent report.
I also very much agree with his observations to the effect that the European employment policy must be organised to a greater degree from the bottom up rather than from the top down.
That is a matter on which I agree with him, in spite of the fact that our political starting points are otherwise very different.
We have all of us raised the issue of whether the European employment policy has worked, and we have of course genuinely obtained a situation in which countries are speaking more of a common language in some areas.
Unemployment is nonetheless still high in many countries, and it has almost become a persistent feature of countries that set the trend.
There is a lack of structural reform and not enough ability to comply with the employment strategy.
What ought therefore to happen?
The answer is that we must strengthen the employment strategy by making it more open, because it is important for governments to commit themselves to the strategy on behalf of their electorates.
It is important that we simplify the employment strategy and make its objectives clearer, and the Commission and the Council are both thinking along those lines.
It is the correct path to go down.
Rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated, we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication.
It is important that we involve the local and regional authorities and both sides of industry.
That is something for which Parliament has fought, and it has now become an integral part of the European employment strategy.
As pointed out in this opinion, it is both desirable and important for us to involve the national and regional parliaments so as to broaden the public debate and enable national politicians to assess the employment strategy, see what is being done in other countries and learn from their experiences.
On the other hand, I think that open coordination should continue to be intergovernmental, and it must be flexible.
Employment policy is a national competence, and that is a fact that must not be changed by the back door.
It is therefore important that no change be made by the back door to the character of employment policy by, for example, giving Parliament the right of co-decision.
That is not something we can support.
It is also essential to ensure coordination with economic policy.
Success in employment policy will of course be synonymous with success in economic policy.
Many countries struggle with large budget deficits which they would not have at all if they were to abolish large-scale unemployment.
There must therefore, of course, be better coordination, and I am able to welcome the initiatives the Commission is working on in this area.
Mr President, Commissioner, on the basis of the information concerning the implementation of employment guidelines, the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes several improvements, emphasising job creation and training.
In the extension of his report on the local dimension of employment adopted by Parliament in July, Mr Schmid rightly insists on the need to develop local and regional job markets.
He makes a series of other proposals with which I agree, and I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating him.
Having said that, I still want to emphasis that, although the European employment strategy has gradually transformed conditions for drafting and implementing national employment policies and enabled better coordination with economic policies, it has not, however, contributed to kick-starting growth or fundamentally changing the employment situation.
So, is this a question of method or a matter of choice?
The Heads of State and Government have opted for liberal choices by favouring the speeding-up of deregulation and liberalisation, wage moderation, and flexibility and insecurity in the labour market.
I therefore believe that the chasm has deepened between the stated objectives on employment and social life within our committee here and the guidelines for the economic policies implemented in each EU Member State.
Allow me to give a few pertinent examples.
In France, restructuring is being speeded up, and redundancies and relocation are being imposed in several sectors.
A substantial number of redundancies are due to take place in the new economy following the bursting of the IT bubble.
Thousands of Vivendi group employees are anxious.
They know that they will not have the same redundancy payments as their former employer, Jean-Marie Messier.
Daewoo, which received bonuses and subsidies in Lorraine, is now moving to China.
Total Fina Elf, which has made huge profits, is skimping on compensation to casualties of the AZF disaster in Toulouse and is considering a social plan involving 1500 employees of its subsidiary, Atofina.
Alcatel has announced 23 000 job losses by the end of 2003.
In the textiles sector, within Alstom and Avantis, businesses have closed or are starting to close.
Under these conditions, I believe the problem we are facing is not so much juggling economy, employment and social considerations as the possible need to review the economy.
Every day, experience shows us that there can be no true social and employment policy that responds to employees' interests, the needs of the people, while economic policies remain tightly corseted by the stability pact and remain based on exacerbated competition and reduced labour costs.
Yes, the subject of employment is at the heart of citizens' concerns and we must do all we can to combat unemployment effectively and create jobs, which to my mind means we must put an end to the dominance of the financial markets.
No real progress can be made, however, if the citizens themselves are not involved in decisions, if there is no effective social dialogue on the challenges of European construction, which are far more wide-reaching than the institutional aspects currently being addressed by the Convention.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmid, thank you for the report and thank you for looking into the situation.
I should like to make a few critical observations.
Firstly, as has been mentioned a number of times today, we are now on the brink of a slow but steady economic downturn.
Member States where, until recently, an economic miracle was unfolding - the Netherlands being one example of this - are now faced with rapid decline in employment, while the same measures are still being applied.
It is actually regrettable that we talk about creating 10 million jobs - in the knowledge that this largely depends on the economic climate - but cannot gauge accurately whether, and if so, how, this is related to policy.
However, we still believe that measures to assist reintegration into work, for example, can definitely have a sustainable effect.
If these were not in place, we would be in trouble. But as I said before, we are not certain.
Meanwhile, the Luxembourg process has, in fact, been overtaken by the Lisbon process to a certain extent, and there are a number of other processes running parallel to it as well.
We believe it is useful to maintain the four-pillar structure as it is now, not least because a number of underlying guidelines have not yet been elaborated.
I will mention two.
The first one, which falls within the pillar of adaptability, is quality of labour and quality of the organisation of work.
I find it distressing that we have been talking about creating more jobs for years, yet far too little attention is being paid to the whole aspect of better-quality jobs.
We have wonderful documents on the subject, but this is as far as it goes.
We have no further details worked out, no plans to put them into practice, certainly no programme, and we have no money put aside for this.
This is distressing at a time when one takes part in a fifty-plus fair and is surrounded by hundreds of people, and one talks about the need for increasing participation of the elderly in the labour market.
Statements you hear at a time like this are: 'So what are the jobs involved?
Will I be required do the same job as I did before?
No, never, give me voluntary work any day'.
Or you may be facing cross-border workers in a room of 600 people who say: 'Yes, very nice, this free movement between Belgium and the Netherlands, but how about adapting the social security systems?'
This is an underdeveloped area.
I could quite easily go on like this for a while and fill my 3 minutes very quickly.
I think we should persist with the open coordination method, but should at the same time consider very critically whether it should be applied to other areas, and many more, without any further consideration.
Finally, on the issue of policy coordination, it would be good to work on this very hard in the near future.
There are debates coming up in the short term about how we will be coordinating this.
I will monitor very closely whether the subordination of the employment guidelines compared to the overall guidelines for economic policy, as enshrined in the Treaty, is not overshooting its target too much and whether the right balance is maintained.
I think this is urgently required.
This could mean that we will need to bring elements of current economic policy into line with a number of elements of these other objectives.
This means balancing things out, in my view.
Finally, it is patently clear that parliaments must be interviewed and called on more extensively in order - how shall I put it - to lower the level of this sort of work across the European organisation.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his tremendous work on this report.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for some of the hints she has given us on what she hopes to achieve in the coming year with regard to these guidelines and strategies.
No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs.
Any model where a forced system of state employment or superstructure artificially creates employment is doomed to failure.
This is because underlying economic development, which ensures that long-lasting, quality jobs can be created, is not there.
There is, however, a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects.
However, when the role of the entrepreneur or business in creating jobs is taken away, then the reality of the employment-creation quandary is undermined.
When the overall aspects of the different economies within the European Union and throughout the world are considered, those which have created the best and most numerous jobs are those which focus on five key issues.
Firstly, a strong social partnership model whereby all the actors at a national level are involved in determining broad economic policy, as well as social policy.
Secondly, where incentives are given to entrepreneurs and to businesses to invest in new jobs, in new infrastructure and in research and development, giving a longer-lasting guarantee to the creation of manufacturing in other service jobs.
Thirdly, a very solid and continuously evolving education and training system, because the real tools we should use to adapt our workforce to the present, as well as future, conditions are those of education and knowledge.
We often hear in this House and other establishments about the idea of lifelong learning.
What does it really mean?
Mr Bouwman mentioned that middle-aged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them.
There is a depth of knowledge within the European Union, amongst people between the ages of 45 and 60, that is going untapped, a resource that is being lost because of ignorance, because of a lack of innovative thinking or simply because of a lack of a properly-structured training programme to allow them to adapt to the new market forces and employment opportunities available.
There is an old saying: give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for life.
That must be the underlying basis of our strategies with regard to the quality of jobs, work and employment opportunities available - the kinds of skills that we give to people.
The fourth point concerns competitiveness.
It may not be a popular thing to say in this House, particularly when we are discussing social affairs, but unless an economy is competitive, it is not going to be able to deal with the fractures of the market in which it is operating.
It is not going to attract inward investment from companies and it is not going to be able to prevent the relocations of industries from that economy to other economies where there is more competitiveness or better conditions.
My last point, which is not often mentioned and which is not paid due recognition, is flexibility - the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
Who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first started that the numbers of people in employment in the European Union in the information technology sector would be as high as they are today?
Likewise, who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first implemented that the number of long-term unemployed would still continue to be the same five years later?
If anything, we have failed those people who are the most vulnerable - the long-term unemployed - by what we have put in place over the last five years.
We have failed them, failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available.
When we look at the overall strategy a number of things jump out - colleagues on the other side of the House may disagree with this interpretation, but this is my opinion.
Firstly, we need to narrow down the guidelines.
We need to ensure that they provide the ideal focus needed to attack the areas that we recognise as being the most important.
Secondly, we need to give a longer timespan for the guidelines to work.
Instead of revising them every year, why not make it every three or four years to ensure again that they can be seen to operate within the mechanisms and systems that they are emerging from?
Next, as many speakers have mentioned, there is a need to coordinate the broad economic policies with regard to employment strategy, to ensure that the two match.
Some people say that there is a tension between these two ideals.
However, in reality, unless they are working in parallel and in coordination with each other, maximum results will not be achieved, i.e. maximum economic growth and development and maximum employment of those ideals.
My last point is that we need to continue investing in people, because no matter how many figures and statistics are put before us the bottom line is that we are talking about one single individual person who has lost out on an opportunity within the European Union.
If, by our discussions here tonight and our work over the next year each of us could get one single person into a quality job we could achieve a lifetime's work because we have helped our fellow human beings to help themselves and they in turn can be the trainers, educators and ambassadors of the future.
Tomorrow we must give this report a ringing endorsement, but we must also ensure that we do not tie our hands.
Future ideas must be flexible and able to adapt to the new society.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in implementing the European Employment Strategy, the European Union is seeking to establish the medium-term objectives of full employment, integrated into a context of political coordination, for every Member State.
Mr Schmid, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate, highlights the positive effects and also some of the less successful aspects of the European Employment Strategy in the last five years.
One of the problems that needs to be resolved is the poor transposition of the Strategy at the decision-making level in the field of employment.
The open method of coordination is an important instrument for the implementation of this strategy.
As everyone knows, this was designed for sectors in which the Member States retain their autonomy.
Differences still remain, however, between national interests and European interests, hence the suggestion that every government should incorporate the national action plan into the development of common policies in the field of employment.
The active support of the social partners and their contribution to the implementation and the integration of the Strategy's priorities into their annual programmes is particularly relevant in areas such as lifelong learning, active ageing, equality between men and women and the modernisation of the organisation of work.
Account must also be taken of the consequences of enlargement for the current labour market in the European Union.
If we are going to be able to improve the current situation between the common global policy at European level and the adoption of policies at national level, adjustments must be made to economic development, by harnessing human resources and creating new institutional structures, but also by strengthening the entrepreneurial spirit.
In Portugal, the National Employment Plan transposes the content of the Strategy to the Portuguese situation in an attempt to respond to the new challenges.
In recent years, the Portuguese labour market has generally performed well.
Structural weaknesses still remain, however, which only a coordinated medium and long-term strategy, with the active participation of the social partners, will enable us to overcome.
Amongst these weaknesses I would highlight:
the low level of training,
the significant effects of long-term and extremely long-term unemployment,
the existence of a group with special difficulties in rejoining the labour market, comprising young people, older workers, women, ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities,
a sectoral and entrepreneurial structure with serious shortcomings,
low productivity,
considerable regional inequalities.
Lastly, I should like to emphasise that, in order for economic and national employment policies to be effectively coordinated and coherent, and to guarantee the effective achievement of the European Employment Strategy, the possibilities of the open method of coordination must be improved and exploited, without losing sight of the requirement for this method always to make transparency its top priority.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a successful European project which five years ago still had a host of detractors and which has earned the right for its fame to spread beyond a handful of experts.
Since 1997, around 10 million new jobs have been created.
This is not enough, in terms of either quantity or quality.
We agree, however, that the Employment Guidelines need to be made more efficient; they must not be extended, but they need to be more transparent and they ought to have more binding force.
We do not wish, for the time being in any case, to change the pillar structure.
However, we do think that it ought to be overhauled.
In previous years, Parliament has often offered new suggestions with this in mind and also pointed to shortcomings.
We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented.
We are aware that some Member States put up so-called passive resistance to the Commission.
For once this too needs to be clearly stated.
The assessment of the first and fourth pillars was favourable.
With your permission, I should like nevertheless to examine this with a more critical eye.
On the basis of my own experience in the Member States I would say that the first pillar - employability, which deals above all with further education and training - is still far too haphazard, arbitrary and shortsighted.
We need continuous professional training, and at the end of the day this means employees having a right to further training, and not only when they are 50 or 55 years old, but also when they are only 30 or 35.
The fourth pillar - equal opportunities - has been warmly praised.
I believe that the considerable success we have been able to see here is also due to the fact, Commissioner, that equal opportunities policy has been supported on several occasions by anti-discrimination legislation.
Entrepreneurship and adaptability are still judged to be deficient.
It seems to me that many employers still have not even realised that they too are expected to show flexibility and make changes.
The European Social Fund is certainly an effective instrument, but we Europeans should also link it to the fulfilment of certain obligations by the Member States.
We will probably not be able to manage without European sanctions in the long term.
Commissioner, my group stands by your side.
The national employment plans are often still seen as secret government documents, their contents unknown to national Members of Parliament and the public.
That is why, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, we need codecision at EU level and legislative proposals to provoke debate and decisions at national level.
As social democrats we will be happy to support you in this quest.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, employment is the key instrument in counteracting social exclusion.
That is why this is, in my view, such an important item on the EU's agenda.
I should like to thank Mr Schmid and Mr Mann warmly for the critical eye they have cast over five years of European employment strategy.
It is of crucial importance to us in Parliament to have our voices heard now, particularly because it is reported that the Commission will be producing a proposal for employment guidelines in 2003.
I, for my part, should like to make the following observations.
In its report, the Commission admits unhesitatingly that the European employment strategy cannot take all the credit for the increase in employment over the past couple of years.
This worries me greatly, because at present, we are clearly heading for a recession, and this is exactly a time when we need an effective strategy.
If, therefore, it is not clear whether the policy works, is it useful to retain this strategy?
The question also arises as to what exactly the European Union's role is.
Is it a matter of subsidiarity?
It is therefore high time sound indicators were developed and the statistics were updated more effectively.
Only then can we really discern what works and what does not.
In the meantime, it is a fateful sign that the Court of Auditors will, on Friday, have very critical things to say about the EU's local employment projects in terms of the objectives, how they are monitored, and the inspection of financial resources.
And then there are women.
From the Commission communication, it appears that older employees and women still get a rough deal in the area of employment.
Although over the past five years, employment for women has increased by 4.3% to 54.9% - a very minor increase after all - the jobs involved are mainly part-time and without any real prospects.
The glass ceiling may have become a little more fragile, but it is still in place.
However, it is of course completely unacceptable that wage differences still amount to an average of 16%.
In addition, one of the main headaches for the working woman is combining family with work.
Although Member States have paid increasing attention to parental leave and childcare over the past few years, I think that more is needed.
In many Member States, the public is struggling with the notion that the husband can also apply for parental leave.
The househusband is viewed with suspicion.
I think it is up to the Union to try to change this.
In terms of best practices, I believe that a country such as Sweden can certainly be held up as an example.
Finally, the older employee too is still given too little consideration.
Lifelong learning often passes them by, while this is, in fact, very important.
It is extremely important, in my view, to develop a sound, effective and verifiable strategy, certainly in the light of the pending enlargement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the balance-sheet of five years of the European Employment Strategy demonstrates that major shortcomings remain in the creation of quality jobs with rights.
Most of the jobs created during these years have been precarious, part-time or very short-term, and which fail to guarantee that equal rights and opportunities will be complied with.
As stated in the report by Herman Schmid, whom I wish to congratulate on his work, unemployment remains at high levels, and long-term unemployment in particular is one of the main causes of social exclusion in Europe, to which we can add precarious and poorly paid work.
Women are still the worst affected, with average salaries still being considerably lower than those of men, and women still experience considerable difficulty in being promoted to more senior and executive positions.
The continuance of the restrictive monetary policies of the Stability Pact, the cuts in public investment, the insistence on privatisation, specifically of public services, relegate social and job creation policies to second place, and this is the current situation.
Priority is still also being given to Community policies in the fields of competition, fisheries and agriculture that fail to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises or family-run smallholdings and of small-scale and coastal fishing, which contribute to exacerbating unemployment and prevent quality employment from being maintained.
The same thing is happening with the restructuring and relocation of undertakings, specifically of multinationals, in a flagrant breach of respect for workers' rights.
It is particularly significant that there is widespread lack of knowledge in the Member States about the European Employment Strategy and that their national plans do not contain quantitative objectives, specifically employment rates for women - as defined at the Lisbon Summit - and nor are these plans being presented in the national parliaments or debates held on their content.
Account must, therefore, be taken of these issues if we are to achieve positive results in the creation of jobs with rights.
Mr President, this debate is nearing its end and I think that we are all agreed that the employment strategy has not borne fruit everywhere, or at least not the same fruit.
But what is important is that all the Member States are starting to change the way they design their national policies, mainly by shifting their priorities from managing unemployment to managing an increase in employment.
Mr Schmid's report highlights a series of issues which our committee voted in favour of, the purpose of which is to supplement and enhance the Commission communication so as to strengthen this strategy which started in Luxembourg.
I should like to focus in my speech on a number of issues which other honourable Members have also raised this evening.
First of all, the involvement of local regional authorities and non-governmental organisations is less than satisfactory.
The Commissioner referred to local action plans submitted and implemented by local agencies which might set an example, but they are, I think, the exception rather than the rule.
I think, as Mr Andersson said, that we need to study these examples and find out exactly how and why they benefited some regions and not others.
I should like to mention something that has happened in my country, which has made me sit up and think.
Greece is preparing for local and regional elections and absolutely no-one has highlighted the part which local agencies can play in creating jobs.
Everyone trumpets how important they are in keeping the place clean, creating green spaces, with the odd allusion to social policy for good measure; but never that they can mobilise local forces and create jobs.
And as for non-governmental organisations, they are even worse off and, unless they are officially involved in social dialogue, local society will not, I fear, look on them as serious, efficient partners.
Another issue is unemployment among women, which the spokesman for the Committee on Women's Rights, Mr Mann, highlighted.
I think that here too, despite the increase in the number of jobs, the Member States need to show serious commitment and consistency in adopting quantitative targets for making qualitative improvements to women's jobs and creating new jobs.
This relates directly to the issue raised this evening, an issue which I too vigorously endorse, namely the need to coordinate employment policy and social policy.
It is here that the serious question of creating the conditions needed in order to reconcile work and family life raises its head.
This is a question of social policy, for which the Member States are responsible; but it is also a question of social responsibility, an issue of concern to the European Parliament and for which the social partners are responsible.
So, as we can see, huge efforts are needed to ensure that the employment strategy operates at several levels, not forgetting the serious role which national and - where they exist - regional parliaments should play; because employment policy really is an issue to which they have paid scant attention.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's stocktaking exercise illustrates very clearly how important it has been even to reflect on strategies at European level because, although responsibility for labour market policy lies with the national governments, when it comes to economic policy and social policy it really is time that we recognised that the internal market has contributed to making our national economies interdependent and at the same time to creating interdependent living and working conditions, with the result that we are quite simply compelled, as the European Parliament, as a European institution, also to find an adequate response to this challenge.
That is why this stocktaking exercise actually does nothing other than invite us to join up procedures even more closely, and to support the Commission's streamlining initiative in economic, employment and social policy so that we gain even better instruments in these fields.
We have to make it quite clear that we agree that if we wish to respond successfully to the challenges coordination has to be a European task.
After all, these challenges are greater than ever before when we see that successes in employment are being cancelled out by weak economic growth and that poor labour market figures are in turn dampening growth.
We must finally get used to the idea that we need to have an economic policy at EU level that also has to meet employment policy objectives, and that we need to pursue a modern EU employment policy that secures sustainable and high-quality growth for everyone.
This bond needs to be emphasised as we look towards the future.
I have to say that quite honestly I really hope that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference will succeed in making a breakthrough in this regard, so as to enshrine the Lisbon process in a constitution, in particular with the aim of full employment.
Allow me to make three further comments on practical and comprehensive actions which seek actually to increase employment intensity in the European Union and which are in particular also very important from an economic policy point of view.
Firstly, employment intensity can certainly also be increased further through taxation measures, for example by applying low rates of value-added tax to labour-intensive services.
It is disappointing that so little progress has been recorded here.
In addition, it should also be said that initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises need to be more closely interlinked than has been possible in the past.
Thirdly, and this concerns the Employment Guidelines in particular, we should also consider whether we might establish a link with the guidelines in competition policy, that is in policy on state aids, where we of course have specific rules, so as to have exemptions to the ban on state aid when small and medium-sized enterprises are being promoted or jobs created.
The approaches found there are, however, not necessarily reflected in the Employment Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines are not necessarily reflected in these rules either.
In my view this is really vital, because aid is also a significant aspect, just as competition policy as a whole is an important policy area for promoting employment.
Mr President, at a time when unemployment is high in the countries of the European Union, it is vital to draw up a European employment strategy.
First of all, however, such a strategy should prohibit all large companies from making mass redundancies along the lines of those currently being implemented by the extremely wealthy trust, Alcatel.
Everyone knows that the responsibility for unemployment lies principally with these large companies, which are not only failing to create the extra jobs they should, but are eliminating jobs purely for the benefit of shareholders.
Furthermore, any employment strategy should commit the Member States to taking the initiative in creating the hundreds of thousands of jobs lacking in all the Member States of the European Union, in hospitals, the public transport sector, the postal sector, or in education.
It would also be in society's interests for the Member States to set up large-scale projects to build low-cost, high-quality accommodation.
The current policy, however, which consists of privatising public sectors left, right and centre, is exactly the opposite.
Under these conditions, talk about an employment strategy is nothing but pious hopes.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank my colleague, the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, and congratulate him on the guidelines he has proposed in his report, with which we largely agree.
In fact, like many of my fellow Members, I consider that the European employment strategy we have known over the past five years has, to varying degrees, perhaps, depending on the regions, been effective and has benefited the citizens of Europe.
However, I believe the time has now come to review its structure and also to propose a new strategy that takes full account of the coordination of macro-economic, social and employment policies.
From this perspective, we have just reviewed every aspect of European employment strategy during the last five years and proposals have been made regarding the guidelines to follow.
I would like to focus on three points.
The first point concerns the necessary relationship between the European employment strategy and national employment plans and in this respect, I believe it is a question of the relationship with citizens and the understanding citizens may have of European strategies that affect them.
In actual fact, this relationship takes place through the intermediary of the national parliaments, both in giving their consent and in implementing the European guidelines.
In this regard, I believe the situation to be something of a paradox.
The employment situation is deteriorating.
The European Union's efforts to set up employment strategies should target people in difficulty.
However, those who should be able to benefit from the actions are in fact the most disillusioned, the most critical and those who least understand our positions and the proposals we are making.
I therefore think that if we try to implement a coherent strategy, which fully involves the national parliaments by allowing them to debate national employment plans and make them their own, we will contribute to democratising European procedures, in particular with regard to the European employment strategy, and legitimise our actions in the eyes of the European citizens.
The second point - on which, I believe, everyone agrees - is that, in order to be effective, the European employment policy should really be an integral part, in socio-economic terms, of European policies.
The objectives of full employment, education, lifelong learning, all of which have been cited, are in fact parallel objectives which largely fall outside the scope of the guidelines for each sector alone.
Lastly, in conclusion, I think we need to review the subject of the social instruments used by Europe.
In fact, even if we reach an agreement on the objectives to be achieved, we still need to provide ourselves with suitable instruments with which to implement them.
On this subject, I believe we must reconsider using the codecision procedure and majority decision-making with regard to employment policy.
Although the open coordination method has proved useful, I believe it must be used to complement the other legislative instruments, as was originally intended.
Mr President, I should like very briefly to thank Parliament and everyone who has contributed to this important debate during the course of the Commission's efforts to present the new, post-evaluation employment policy.
Serious account will be taken of Parliament's proposals and opinions and I should like to touch on four points which were raised several times this evening.
The first is the basis on which the employment strategy is being developed.
It is a combination of competitiveness and cohesion.
Clearly, the employment strategy takes account of the needs of companies, both large and small, and the needs of the workers.
The doubt expressed by a number of honourable Members as to the extent to which it fosters competitiveness is, I think, somewhat exaggerated, given that, if nothing else, the employment strategy has resulted in what are also business-friendly job market reforms.
The need to achieve competitiveness and cohesion at one and the same time means, as several honourable Members have pointed out, that we need to couple employment strategies and policies and social policy; in other words, they cannot be segregated and we need to take account of social policy issues every step of the way.
The second point is the framework, cooperation, updating the employment guidelines and the financial package.
Important and serious proposals and approaches have been voiced.
I would point out, as several honourable Members have said, that the employment strategy needs to be discriminating, its scope needs to be clear and it should not be incorporated into the economic guidelines.
The third point is involvement.
One of the basic problems we identified during our evaluation was the involvement of national parliaments, which need to assume a more important role, and of social partners and of local authorities, as regards the regional and local application of the employment strategy.
Finally, I should like to refer to the method itself as a tool, as Mrs Gillig quite rightly pointed out; a tool which we are using for the first time.
The open method of coordination has no separate entry in the Treaty; however, it has been a very successful method, which is why we have used it in another two procedures, exclusion and pensions, and we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference will perhaps give us the chance to finalise it and use it more efficiently in other policies.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2002) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union (2002/2026(INI).
Mr President, this is the second time that social policy and policy on equal opportunities for men and women have been scheduled so late in the day.
This is acceptable once in a while, but I should nevertheless like to ask those who draft the agenda to switch things around and to schedule economic policy and agricultural policy, for example, this late on the agenda, which would allow us to discuss our reports in the afternoon and prevent Mrs Diamantopoulou and us always having to sit here burning the midnight oil.
I shall now turn to the report.
Why has a report been drafted on the representation of women among the social partners?
Firstly, because there has been an enormous increase in the number of working women.
Women constitute 42% of the total workforce in the EU.
This same increase is not reflected in the bodies that have a say in policy.
These are the structural bodies of the social partners themselves, their chairmen, their secretaries-general, their executive committees, their general meetings, their negotiation committees, and so on.
Women are underrepresented in these. Even where social partners function as delegates in advisory bodies, these delegates are very rarely women.
Despite this, the social partners require - and we grant them this with pleasure - a large proportion of the power in Europe and the Member States, for it is, of course, a fact that the collective labour agreements they conclude, and which therefore also affect women, generally have force of law.
Indeed, a large proportion of legislative authority, namely that related to labour, has been passed on to them.
This is permissible, provided that the social partners are representative.
If they are not, then this is not really tolerable.
I maintain that they are not representative.
When, while 42% of women are in the labour market, not even 25% of women are represented in the administrative bodies of the unions, a figure dropping below 12% or 10% in some administrative bodies, and if, for example, employers' organisations have 1% or 2% of women in their administrative bodies, then I maintain that these social partners are not representative of the labour market.
Hence the report.
We would therefore ask first and foremost that data be collated and that a database be set up that tracks the presence of women amongst the social partners, for it is extremely difficult, Commissioner, Mr President and fellow MEPs, to obtain these figures.
This is not too bad for the trade unions since they themselves keep track of these figures to some extent, but this is practically impossible for employers.
If you were to ask any Member State what the proportion of women is in employers' organisations, you would not get a reply, any figures or data.
Either this is due to unwillingness, or the data is not available.
It is therefore essential to set up a database.
I know that the Commission is in the course of setting this up and that a research mandate has been issued.
This mandate, however, runs over four years, and I hope, Commissioner, that it will not be four years before steps are taken.
If we have to wait for the figures, it will be a long time before anything happens.
In my view, the Commission, the Member States and the social partners must pursue a policy that is similar to that in the political world.
Fortunately, political parties have gradually been convinced of the fact that the political bodies must be representative of the people in their country.
If 50% of those people are women, as is the case in all countries - and it is often more - then the political world should be a representation of those women too.
This is policy both in Europe and in the national Member States.
The same cannot be said, unfortunately, of the social partners.
This is why a series of measures is being proposed in this report which must be implemented either by the European Union or the social partners themselves, with a little pressure from the Member States, in order to achieve an acceptable level of representation of women in all negotiating bodies and in the bodies of the social partners, also with the aim of allowing women's issues to be discussed during the negotiations.
It does indeed speak for itself that those who are around the negotiating table are most sensitive to their own issues; this is always the case.
This is also normal, for they are most familiar with their own issues.
This is similar to organising a negotiating table with disabled people; they too would be very sensitive to the issues affecting disabled people, and they would be right.
This is also true of negotiating tables attended only by men.
They are very sensitive to their own issues and not so sensitive to those of women.
Hence our theory.
I urge you, Commissioner, to adopt a policy that addresses this issue as a whole.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Smet for this report, which shows that very little progress has been made as regards the representation of both sexes among the social partners and that discrimination is alive and kicking.
It is a disgrace that huge trade union organisations in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of members, do not even have token representation of both sexes and that there are entire trade union executives made up only of men.
The number of women on the job market has risen but there has hardly been a commensurate increase in the number of women in trade union organisations, where fewer than 25% hold executive positions, even though over 40% belong to a trade union.
On the employers' side, as Mrs Smet said, the situation is even worse, with the lowest proportion in Belgium, with 1.5%, and the highest in Finland, with just 19%.
Of course, there has been an increase in the number of working women over recent years, but remember that Beijing concluded ten years ago that, if we continue at this rate, we shall achieve equal numbers in 2500 years.
So what can we do at European level?
Clearly this is not an issue which can be resolved through legislation or binding measures.
The Commission, as you have already heard, has selected a researcher to monitor statistics and record them throughout Europe, because at present the only records we have are from the national representations; we have no analytical sectoral representation and no breakdown by Member State.
This statistical exercise will last 4 years, but we shall be able to use the data from year one and it will be especially helpful in finding out where we need to intervene by networking, by exchanging practices, by working together and by giving incentives to trades union.
The second point is that we need to agree on specific quantitative targets and timetables for the involvement of women.
The social partners, who are due to present their common agenda at Christmas, intend, as far as I am aware, to include the question of equality as one of the common issues which they will endeavour to resolve over the next few years.
So if the social partners at European level present a common agenda at Christmas and include the question of gender equality, it is important that we then set specific quantitative targets and timetables.
The Commission is still aiming for equal representation of men and women at all levels, including in the committees it sets up, but, to tell the truth, few women are involved even in the Commission unions.
Before I finish my intervention, I should like to point out that the question of the lack of involvement of women, as Mrs Smet has explained, is a question of democracy, it is a question of representation, it is a question of neglecting half the population, neglecting half the force and half the talent of European society.
We really do believe that, with the employment strategy and social dialogue, we can make progress, but Europe cannot push ahead alone if the social partners themselves fail to assume a large part of the responsibility, which is why we also need their initiative here.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her own-initiative report and for highlighting an issue which has been more or less forgotten at both European and national level.
It is true that we have little information on the under-representation of women in social partner structures and on their lack of involvement in social dialogue negotiations.
It is also true that this deficit, this problem, is not acknowledged in political circles.
In fact, while we often hear about the absence of women from parliaments, from governments, from local and regional authorities, we rarely hear about the absence of women among the social partners.
So we too need persuading, as European institutions, as national governments and as social partners, that the involvement of women in decision-making procedures within the social partnership will not merely add credentials to their authority and quality to democracy; it will also, in the final analysis, promote our development objectives, since it will help increase employment, improve the quality of work and increase productivity and competitiveness.
As far as the involvement of women in decision-making processes is concerned, it is the only opportunity to take account of the demands of women, both employed and unemployed, to develop social responsibility for the benefit of working women, to create the conditions needed to develop creativity in the workplace, to take account of specifically female aspects and to deal with wage differentials, which is the most basic problem of all.
So we need a broad information and awareness-raising campaign in every direction and to motivate working women themselves, because they too must take their share of the responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Smet, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on her excellent work and on her supreme willingness to take into account the wealth of suggestions made during the debate in committee.
The balanced participation of women in decision-making bodies is an issue which is frequently raised and with regard to which Europe has often emphasised the need to take measures, and this issue has by no means been resolved.
As the Commissioner said, there is a democratic deficit here in all areas of society - economic, social and political.
This report seeks to take stock of the situation in the social and political fields, of the representation of women among the social partners.
With regard to this matter, the first thing that becomes clear is the lack of systematic data.
There is very little information available about the participation of women inside the organisational structures and internal decision-making bodies of the social partners, while even less information is available about the gender-specific composition of delegations of negotiators in the social dialogue.
Moreover, there are no statistics available about the advisory bodies in which social partners are represented.
The European Trade Union Confederation has made genuine efforts to compile statistics, but it encountered many difficulties because of the poor cooperation of the national trade unions.
In any case, these studies reveal a pyramid structure, in which about 40% of the total number of trade union members are women, and the percentage falls to less than half that figure the nearer one gets to the decision-making structures at the top of the pyramid.
There is even less information available regarding employers' organisations.
All this means that women are very poorly represented in negotiating delegations, which has an impact on the success of the equal opportunities policy too.
Indeed, in recent years, at the request, not least, of Europe, a number of strategies have been implemented, tailored to the situations of the different Member States, which have led to an improvement in the situation, although it still remains wholly unsatisfactory.
In Italy, for example, a policy of positive measures has been implemented within the trade associations, facilitated by legislation and by the funding of specific training projects, to encourage the participation of women in administrative bodies, and, in many cases, this has resulted in organisations including quotas in their statutes.
It is true that all this has yielded significant positive results but they have been almost exclusively at local level: progress stops when we reach national decision-making levels.
There is a direct link between the participation of women in decision-making bodies and negotiating bodies and the pursuit of an equal opportunities policy.
This connection is confirmed, not least, by the results of research promoted by the Dublin Foundation on the subject of 'Equal Opportunities and Collective Bargaining' in the Union, which stresses that the participation of women negotiators has yielded positive results in terms of reducing the existing inequalities, increasing the attention paid to reconciling work and family life and tackling the issue of wage inequality between men and women.
It is therefore necessary, as Mrs Smet's report calls, for the European Commission to make a start on the compilation of data and the establishment of a database relating to the representation of women among the social partners so that indicators can be established with a view to increasing the influence exercised by women in decision-making bodies, to create a database relating to the results of collective bargaining in the context of equal opportunities and to use it for the dissemination of best practice, and to urge the social partners to create networks among women negotiators and women administrators with a view to their exchanging experience and expertise and, in their employment policy, to develop further the role allotted to them in the promotion of equal opportunities.
The development of the social dialogue at European level will certainly yield benefits in terms of influence, effectiveness and success in the pursuit of the objectives if more gender balance is developed at all levels, including in the socio-economic context.
Mr President, Commissioner, although the European institutions have in various documents highlighted the need for a more balanced and proportional representation of women in the various decision-making structures and political and social bodies, also where the social partners are concerned, the fact is that profound imbalances and enormous inequalities still remain, as Mrs Smet's report points out, and as Commissioner Diamantopoulou confirmed a short while ago.
And although where the social partners are concerned only incomplete information is available, the meagre data available on the participation of women demonstrate that at executive level, the percentage of women is low, with women being clearly under-represented in the upper echelons of organisations, which weakens democracy and makes it difficult to achieve real equality of rights and opportunities, which we incorporated into the Treaties and into various Directives to which we refer on a daily basis.
We therefore support the initiatives proposed in this report, both those that seek to obtain a greater knowledge of the current situation (and the need for data collection has already been mentioned here), and those intended to achieve a more balanced representation of men and women among the social partners.
We call for timetabled performance targets to be established - on the quantitative and qualitative representation of women, both in internal decision-making structures and in collective bargaining, including at the forthcoming trilateral social summit - and I now wish to draw the Commissioner's attention to this matter - and also for reports to be drafted on the progress made and the impact of the measures adopted.
Objective conditions must be established, however, to ensure that the participation of women in the social and political bodies becomes a reality.
The Commission must also create a database and good practices must be disseminated, including in the joint report on employment, sharing information on the participation of women, and specifically in collective bargaining, and also on the progress made in the field of equal opportunities.
This information, this analysis and this approach must be formalised in the various reports on the social sphere and on employment.
Mr President, in all of the European Union's Equal Opportunities Action Programmes, for example the Fifth Action Programme for 2001 to 2005, great importance is attached to there being balanced representation of men and women in decision-making bodies.
While good statistics are available in parliaments and national institutions, there are still not any satisfactory surveys of the social partners.
In both the unions and the employers' organisations women in leadership roles are in a tiny minority.
There is no doubt that this needs to be changed, but please not at a snail's pace.
In the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have unanimously called on the social partners to set precise targets as soon as possible with a view to improving the quantitative and qualitative representation of women.
As part of this, deadlines should be agreed for their implementation.
Databases should be created so as finally to provide a precise overview of female representation in expert fora and decision-making bodies.
A further long overdue measure is the creation of posts for equal opportunities officers in all of the Member States.
Whenever change is initiated, however, intensive awareness-raising is required.
In training courses and at conferences on gender mainstreaming, women's structures in the social partners should be visible.
Positive measures need to be developed in the form of action programmes within organisations.
Women's networks should be created and should communicate with each other.
They should exchange experiences and pass on information about projects to each other.
These projects were successful and are therefore worth replicating and the others failed and we should try to understand what we can learn from them.
An important component is responsibility at executive level right up to the boardroom.
There are therefore sufficient reasons for drawing up this own-initiative report.
The vote in the Women's Rights Committee was unanimous and is testimony to the exemplary work of our rapporteur, Miet Smet.
I too can fully endorse this assessment of her report.
Mr President, the most striking statistic I have heard tonight is the one from the Commissioner when she indicated that it would take 2 500 years for us to reach a position of equality for women if we continue at the same pace.
I wonder how much faster we need to move in order to achieve this equality within the next hundred years, which even then would be quite a long period to have to wait.
It strikes me that while we talk consistently, and correctly, about the need to create equal opportunities in the European Union that in a very real sense that is a secondary objective to treating people with equality, because there is a distinct difference between the question of equality for every single human being and the idea that they should also have equal opportunities.
Without equality there can be no equal opportunity and that has to be fundamental to our approach to this issue of women participating in decision-making.
One of the issues that must be addressed if we are to ensure that women - and in particular working women - can participate and that they get time off work in order to pursue trade union activities, is that of employers being extremely reluctant to allow workers to have time off to pursue either training or trade union activities.
This is increasingly the case, even before one deals with the question of allowing either men or women time off to have babies or to look after children.
I am not surprised by the statistic which indicates that there has been a decline in the number of women participating in employers' organisations.
The only slight criticism I would have of some of the statistics in the report is that they are out of date.
That is not the fault of the rapporteur, it is down to the fact that we do not have consistent and systematic collection of proper data.
One of the keys to making progress in this area is to have affirmative programmes, action plans and targets.
Critical to it also is a programme of sensitising people in trade unions and in employers' organisations to the fact that there is another half of the human race who are entitled to equality as of right and not just as a privilege.
Mr President, the only point of the fallacious symmetry established between the under-representation of women in managerial organisations, on the one hand, and trade unions, on the other, is to show that there are still far fewer women in managerial organisations than in trade unions, even though managers face no material obstacles to this other than the misogyny of the managerial environment.
On the other hand, it would be extremely cynical to reproach workers' organisations for not including women in their number, when female workers throughout the European Union have the problem of insufficient or non-existent crÃšches and nursery schools.
As the rapporteur is a former minister, she would be better advised to use her influence to encourage the Member States to implement an extensive programme for the creation of crÃšches, day nurseries and nursery schools, employing a sufficient number of staff.
That would certainly not solve the problems of female representation in the managerial bodies of trade unions, but it would create better conditions.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Constitution of my country solemnly states, in Article 14, that all 'Spaniards are equal before the law, without any discrimination for reasons of birth, race, sex, religion, opinion, or any other political or social condition or circumstance'; and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in Article 20, Chapter III, states that 'Everyone is equal before the law'; and in Article 21 that 'Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex,?..shall be prohibited', and other circumstances are stipulated; and Article 23, under the heading 'Equality between men and women' lays down that 'Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay.
The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.'
If we compare these general principles, these solemn declarations, with social reality, with the everyday world we live in, specifically in terms of the achievement of women's equality in the field of representation amongst the European Union's social partners, one conclusion immediately springs to mind: there is still much to do.
Mrs Smet's excellent report expresses this perfectly, and I congratulate her on her work.
Women make up approximately 40% of the members of the trade unions in the European Union, but there is no proportionality between their presence within the membership of the trade unions, on the one hand, and within the decision-making and governing bodies of the trade unions, on the other.
Furthermore, women, although the data on this is rather imprecise, make up a minority in the upper levels of company organisations.
Declarations of intention without commitments are not sufficient to turn the principles I have mentioned into a social reality.
We therefore need strategies aimed at increasing the presence of women amongst the social partners and I believe that an artificial system of quotas is not the right or desired solution or approach.
A fairer society - in a European Union in which 42% of working people are women - cannot tolerate an under-representation of women in the bodies and structures within which social interlocutors meet to define, regulate and agree on issues relating to social policy.
Perhaps women themselves are partly responsible for the situation being analysed here.
I believe that the horizontal integration of the gender dimension into the different policies, the action programmes - preferably measures to reconcile work and family life - the efforts of the social agents themselves, training and information, measures to stimulate the participation of women, positive actions and action programmes, are ways to achieve equality and this, in turn, is a means, an instrument, for building a better, fairer and more caring society through social dialogue.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this excellent report, Mrs Smet, whom I congratulate on her magnificent work, highlights the insufficient participation of women among the social partners in the European Union and the consequences of this for the implementation of equal opportunities policy.
In order to remedy the glaringly obvious shortfall in the representation of women in the decision-making structures and bodies of the social partners, three measures, in particular, are to be emphasised.
First: we need to know where we are now and where we want to be.
Hence the need to ensure that we have statistics that give us a true picture of the situation and which can provide a basis for the creation of action programmes and the drafting of evaluation reports;
Second: knowledge and training are the keys to individual and collective progress.
The preparation of women for leadership duties must, therefore, be a priority.
This aim can best be achieved through the creation of centres for the dissemination of specialist knowledge.
Third: the social partners must provide training actions to raise awareness of equal opportunities and this issue must always feature on the negotiating agenda.
In my country, for example, the rate of women in employment has been steadily increasing and is one of the highest in the European Union.
Nevertheless, such changes are not matched by the level of women's participation in the decision-making processes and many inequalities still persist.
With regard to access to executive positions, only 2% of women occupy the posts of departmental heads and managers, which rises to 3.2% at more senior levels.
We are also seeing the insufficient participation of women in positions of greater responsibility in union life.
Reliable data are difficult to come by, as has already been stated here several times.
Lastly, I wish to remind you that various studies confirm that the presence of women in decision-making bodies and in collective bargaining has a very positive impact on the implementation of equal opportunities policy.
Therefore, the balanced representation of men and women, apart from being a democratic imperative for the social partners, will lead to a more favourable working and organisational environment.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bastos.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.48 p.m.)
. (PT) I wish to express my agreement with this recommendation for second reading and with the consequent adoption of the Council common position, which I believe is of crucial importance to the promotion of road safety.
As advocated by Mr Hatzidakis, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate on his excellent work, increasing road safety by limiting the speed of the vehicles used in both passenger and freight transport, is to be welcomed.
The Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the directive in force - Directive 92/6/EEC - and the phased installation of speed limitation devices reflects a constant concern of Parliament, which is the promotion of road safety in the European Union, to which I have always subscribed and which I continue to call for.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to adopt the Council common position as rapidly as possible and without amendments, given that most of the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken into account, whilst new elements have also been incorporated, which have helped to improve the clarity of the text under our consideration.
Tourism and the way in which travel agencies operate has changed dramatically in the last 25 years, following the adoption of the special VAT arrangements for this sector.
At the same time, the activity of travel agencies has undergone a profound change.
The special arrangements defined in the sixth Directive are finding it increasingly difficult to match the current needs of this sector.
The myriad derogations from which various EU countries benefit and the privileged situation of third-country travel agencies with regard to VAT has led to unfair competition or to the practice of the most powerful companies setting up branches in third countries - Switzerland, for example - in order to avoid their tax obligations to the European Community.
The Commission proposal warrants our vote.
I therefore propose a practical method of collecting VAT imposed on third-country travel agencies that sell products in the European Union or to individuals resident in the Community; the same method, in fact, that Parliament adopted for electronic commerce.
I also propose a method of improving the competitiveness of travel agencies when selling tourism products within the Union to residents of third countries.
. (PT) My vote against the report does not overlook the fact that the Laeken Summit of December 2001 reaffirmed the need for the EU's Member States to adopt a common policy in the field of asylum and immigration by 2004.
I am actually sensitive to the need for coordination procedures to be established in the field of asylum policy and even, for the sovereignty and the competences of the Member States to be respected, with regard to the permanent incorporation of a method of coordination in the field of asylum in order to encourage the convergence of national systems.
I am not indulging in hyperbole, however - especially in an extremely sensitive area such as this - and I regret the fact that both the rapporteur and the specialist committee have opted for a hyperbolic and frankly excessive approach, which goes far beyond what is necessary.
This is why I voted against the report.
And ultimately, this is the underlying reason for my final rejection of the report, which should serve as a warning for the future: in striving to achieve too much, the basic needs may suffer.
This budget is simultaneously delightful, detrimental and disastrous.
Delightful because of the amount: EUR 100 billion.
This is the highest budget we have seen since 1958.
Detrimental with regard to agriculture.
The percentage of agricultural appropriations in spending as a whole is being relentlessly eroded and, in particular, the appropriations authorised in financial forecasts are never used to the full.
Over ten years, if we add up the annual differences between the agricultural budgets implemented, on the one hand, and the agricultural budgets voted for and the estimated agricultural financial forecasts, on the other, the equivalent of an annual agricultural budget has been spirited away.
The EUR 40 or so billion that have been stolen from European farmers could have been used to save our apiarists, promote our wines and create a European fund against natural disasters.
In the Languedoc area, for example, where flooding in September destroyed 4000 hectares of vineyards.
Disastrous, because 2003 will be the last year before we jump into the bottomless pit of globalisation without a safety net.
It is the year of Cancun and the WTO Ministerial Conference that will seal the world agreement on agricultural free trade.
It is also the year in which there will be real conflict over the CAP review, with a powerful ally for Mr Fischler in Renate Kunas.
It is also the beginning of our descent down the slippery slope of enlargement, with the accession of the Eastern European agricultural countries bringing unknown costs in real terms.
Outcome of World Summit on Sustainable Development
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development;
report (A5-0237/2002) by Mrs HulthÃ©n, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme [COM(2001) 580 - C5-0164/2002 - 2002/2072(COS)].
In opening this debate, I am pleased to be able to give the floor to President Haarder, formerly one of our fellow Members and Vice-President of the European Parliament, who will now speak on behalf of the Council as President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, thank you for your very friendly welcome.
The World Summit in Johannesburg took place from 26 August to 4 September 2002. There was a very high level of participation from parliaments, NGOs and trade and industry.
The Danish Presidency - the Danish Minister for the Environment - attached great importance to remaining in close contact with participants from the European Parliament. I believe a number of you present here will be able to confirm this.
I would like to compliment Parliament on Mr Lannoye's report, which was adopted in April and was an important document in the whole process.
We faced a great challenge.
As a leading player, we had to encourage the viewpoints established at the previous Council meetings of Environment, Development and Foreign Ministers in Seville.
We had to achieve a good outcome and obtain the greatest possible influence, and that was not a particularly easy task in view of the many viewpoints and divergent interests with which we are all familiar.
As you know, the decision to hold the summit was taken by the UN General Assembly in autumn 2000, the same year in which the Millennium Summit adopted the eight Millennium Goals for reducing poverty by 2015.
The mandate from the General Assembly for Johannesburg included identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development, as well as policies and means of supporting developing countries and countries with transitional economies in their efforts.
In parallel with the lead-up to Johannesburg, two other international conferences were held at ministerial level: the WTO's ministerial conference in Doha in November 2001, which adopted the agenda for the negotiating round on trade and development, and the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March, at which an historic agreement was entered into on funding and good governance.
At the same time, for the first time in many years, new and substantial promises of aid were given by the rich countries.
From 2006 onwards these assurances will increase the total aid volume by around 25% annually.
Within the EU, we greatly desired to establish development targets in a number of areas that were not covered by the Millennium Goals or by previous agreements.
We wanted to insist on the results achieved previously with respect to human rights, workers' rights, equality and good governance, and we wanted to ensure effective follow-up.
In a number of aspects these desires were satisfied, and I will now mention the most significant of these.
As regards globalisation, we attached importance to reflecting the positive opportunities that exist as a result of globalisation and to emphasising the social dimension and corporate responsibility.
We were able to define the combating of poverty as crucial for sustainable development in a context that encompasses not only increasing prosperity but also access to clean drinking water, sanitation, energy, better health and equality.
We were able to establish a number of practical objectives, with deadlines for achieving them, within the areas of poverty, health, the environment and natural resources.
One of the most important of these is the objective of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation by 2015.
This should be seen as a supplement to the Millennium Goal of halving the number of people without access to clean drinking water by 2015.
Other targets adopted were restoring and regulating fish stocks at sustainable levels by 2015, ensuring absolutely minimal risk and harmful effects on health and the environment from the production of chemicals by 2020 and substantially reducing the loss of biodiversity by 2010.
In addition, there is an agreement to establish a ten-year framework programme for sustainable production and consumption which tackles the crucial problem of the separation of economic growth from deterioration of the environment.
The most difficult negotiations conducted were without doubt those concerning the target for sustainable energy.
No practical target, with a deadline for achieving it, was adopted due to opposition from the USA, Japan and the OPEC countries in particular, but we did obtain an objective of increasing the global proportion of sustainable energy at the earliest possible date.
What is worthy of note, however, is that we succeeded in gaining substantial acknowledgement of the advantages of sustainable energy at an international summit for the first time.
This is the greatest pronouncement adopted to date in this area.
Furthermore, in cooperation with a number of other countries, the EU submitted a declaration to continue working on this issue.
These goals and objectives from Johannesburg together with the Millennium Goals provide a concrete agenda for our work on national, regional and international efforts over the coming 10-15 years.
The assurances on trade and subsidies given at Doha to increase market access for developing countries and support the phasing out of subsidies which distort trade were confirmed.
Johannesburg placed greater political focus on the actual WTO process and its significance for developing countries.
We now have a great duty to live up to these expectations in the forthcoming negotiations.
The agreements reached at Monterrey on financing for development and the significance of good governance in attracting investment and funding were affirmed.
Those donors that had promised new funding in Monterrey confirmed this.
Moreover, a number of EU countries took the initiative at the summit jointly to procure further voluntary contributions of approx. USD 80 million in order to increase the Global Environmental Facility to a level of USD 3 000 million, the original target for the top-up.
Finally, we were able to establish that the social dimension is to be promoted and that the consensus achieved previously on the role, rights and equality of women is to be adhered to.
The EU submitted a declaration on this, since the issue of the role of women was not given as strong a position as we would have liked.
Importance was attached to the national responsibility for good governance, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We succeeded in establishing that the national sustainability strategies - which may be formulated as poverty strategies - must be ready for implementation in 2005.
I would also add that indigenous peoples were also mentioned in the declaration.
With regard to partnerships, the ground was prepared for greater interaction between the public sector, private organisations and private businesses in the implementation of the goals set.
In addition, the EU launched two new ambitious initiatives within the priority areas of water and energy, namely 'Water for Life' and 'Sustainable Energy for Poverty Reduction'.
I agree with Parliament that the crucial thing is implementing this, turning words into deeds.
Johannesburg created the momentum for more effective implementation of the agenda on sustainable development.
The private sector will be more involved.
There was a clear message from business that in their investments and production they accept their responsibility for local communities and the environment.
International follow-up will be carried out under the auspices of the UN.
This is an important issue on which we must continue working.
The World Bank and the World Trade Organisation should also be involved.
These words must be turned into deeds.
The Presidency attaches great importance to effective follow-up of both the internal and the global dimension of the EU's obligations for bringing about sustainable development.
In this context we have a particular duty to follow up our own initiatives in respect of water and energy.
Finally, I would like to mention that yesterday the ASEM Summit was held between 25 European and Asian Heads of State and Government.
In preparation for this summit I presided over a conference of Finance Ministers from these countries last Thursday and I am pleased to report that much of the agenda that we have discussed here was discussed with our Asian partners, and that it was decided to initiate a series of preparatory activities between the EU and Asia so that we can ensure that progress is made in CancÃºn and elsewhere where the WTO process is to be continued.
Lastly, I would like to say that it is important that, when we talk about these things, we in Europe realise that, although we may be major players, we need partners who want the same things as us.
And both I and Commissioner Pascal Lamy are very pleased that we got as far as we did with our Asian colleagues last week and yesterday.
I therefore believe there is reason for a hint of optimism as regards the opportunity to make further substantial progress in the year ahead.
Mr President, we welcome this opportunity to present the Commission's assessment of the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg concluded three weeks ago.
It is in a way rather early to make a definitive assessment of the outcome.
Time and our own committed efforts will tell if this summit will deliver where Rio de Janeiro did not.
As we said repeatedly at the end of the negotiations, we have the words and it is now the duty of all of us to turn these words into effective deeds.
I will not over-simplify and try to sum up the summit in one word as either a success or a failure, but overall the Commission believes that we can be satisfied with the results of Johannesburg.
We succeeded in adding new momentum to the cause of sustainable development and the outcomes of the summit take us in the right direction.
Of course people will draw comparisons with the Rio Earth Summit of 1992.
The immediate assessment of some NGOs and others in the period after Rio was that it had been a failure. Now it has come to be seen as a defining moment in the fight for sustainable development.
The Rio Summit was very different from Johannesburg in some important respects. Most importantly, the political climate in 2002 is very different from ten years ago.
Against a difficult political backdrop it fell largely to the European Union to champion the cause of sustainable development in Johannesburg.
We were, you might say, almost the only engine in this whole process.
Let me remind you of how the European mandate was determined.
In preparing for the summit, the Commission issued two specific communications, one in February 2001 entitled 'Ten years after Rio: preparing for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002' and a second communication in February 2002 entitled: 'Towards a global partnership for sustainable development'.
Building upon these communications the Council adopted several sets of conclusions in 2001 and 2002 in which the European Union's negotiating platform for the World Summit on Sustainable Development was defined.
It is worth noting specifically the Development Council conclusions of 30 May 2002, which list in detail the EU's priorities.
The European Parliament also issued its opinion in a resolution adopted on 16 May 2002.
In substantive terms, we worked to undertake further steps towards the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.
Poverty eradication was the over-arching theme to which we linked all the concrete issues.
The Union argued that we had to show real commitment by setting quantifiable targets, with timetables and monitoring mechanisms, in the Implementation Plan.
Let me now focus in particular on some key achievements reached in Johannesburg, which Mr Haarder has already mentioned, but which I think are worth noting again.
The first element I would like to highlight is that a set of new targets has been agreed as part of the Implementation Plan.
I will mention five.
First, halving by 2015 the proportion of people lacking access to basic sanitation - this currently stands at three billion people, half of the total world population.
This new target complements the Millennium Development Goal on access to clean water.
Second, a commitment to minimise harmful effects on human health and the environment from the production and use of all chemicals by 2020.
Third, a commitment to halt the decline of fish stocks and restore them to sustainable levels no later than 2015.
Fourth, a commitment to begin implementation of national strategies on sustainable development by 2005.
Fifth, a commitment to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010, as earlier agreed by the parties to the Biodiversity Convention.
The endorsement by all Heads of State and Government is a major achievement.
The agreement to establish a ten-year framework for programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with industrialised countries taking the lead in this global effort, is another important result.
On globalisation, as has been said, the summit agreed on concrete actions to enhance the role of trade for sustainable development, for example by encouraging trade in environmentally friendly and organic products from developing countries and by strengthening international action for corporate responsibility.
The EU's objectives on energy were addressed in the Council Presidency Conclusions of 30 May 2002, in which the EU reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating the achievement of the millennium development goal of halving the number of people in extreme poverty, and other millennium development goals, by 2015, through the provision of adequate, affordable and sustainable energy services.
In line with its general position in favour of a focused and result-oriented implementation plan, the European Union also supported, among other things, the establishment of a quantitative, time-bound target to increase the proportion of renewable energy within the overall energy mix.
Although we were ultimately not able to get a specific target for renewable energy sources in the Action Plan, we did reach an agreement to increase urgently and substantially the global share of renewable energy sources.
We also agreed to take joint actions to improve the access of the poor to energy.
Those agreements will be regularly evaluated and their progress reviewed.
In addition, the European Union launched a 'coalition of the willing' on renewable energy.
This includes countries and regions willing to set themselves targets and timeframes for the increase of renewables in the energy mix.
This coalition maintains pressure on the unwilling, and should give a boost to the development of renewable energy throughout the world.
Significantly, this coalition will set a renewable energy target representing a floor as opposed to a ceiling.
Linked to this, there have been positive developments on climate change.
Those who have already ratified Kyoto have confirmed their commitment to entry into force at the earliest possible date and others are urged to join as soon as possible.
The announcements made by Poland, as well as by the Russian and Canadian Prime Ministers, mean that the Protocol should enter into force very soon.
The European Commission spoke with one strong voice in Johannesburg.
As Commissioner for the Environment, I shared with Poul Nielson (Commissioner for Development) the responsibility as chef de file in the preparations for Johannesburg.
We both participated in the high-level negotiation sessions at ministerial level at the WSSD Summit.
Coordination was further enhanced by the presence in Johannesburg of the President of the Commission.
I am now pleased to hand over to my colleague Poul Nielson who will speak, amongst other things, about the need for follow-up and implementation of our WSSD commitments.
Mr President, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has correctly said that I will be talking more specifically about trade, finance and follow-up, but first a few general remarks.
One needs to keep in mind that Johannesburg was a UN conference.
This means delegations must reach consensus.
Not everybody gets everything.
As Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said, we are in a different political climate than in 1992.
It is almost as if NGOs and the Group of 77 had given up expecting constructive multilateralism from the United States; as if the US is not part of the equation for sustainable development.
That attitude is not possible in the negotiation rooms, where the US, of course, is a real player, as we could see when the US and OPEC members joined forces in resisting targets on renewable energy.
But Johannesburg did result in consensus, and that in itself is positive.
Let me address trade issues in more detail.
I have noted some concerns here.
The negotiations were indeed difficult.
Developing countries focused on trade and on subsidies in agriculture.
This forced the EU to put in a strong effort to safeguard Doha as the place to discuss the substance and to avoid, in general, a derailing of the multilateral agenda.
I have noted point 6 in the motion for a resolution, and I would like to point out that I think this is a correct reading of this problem.
We succeeded in avoiding this derailing of the multilateral agenda, but of course we had to use up negotiation capital defending what everybody had in fact internationally agreed less than a year ago.
What is very encouraging - and you could call this 'EU leadership' - is that we avoided a repetition of the disorganised 'agenda overload' that was in fact the cause of the breakdown in Seattle.
When NGOs say that Johannesburg was a failure because it didn't reopen Doha and Monterrey, this is a self-constructed and unnecessary misunderstanding of what Johannesburg was about.
The fact that some MEPs seem to share this misunderstanding does not help much.
Doha dealt with trade in November 2001.
Monterrey dealt with financing in March 2002.
This helped Johannesburg succeed.
The multilateral agenda was better organised for Johannesburg.
This enabled us - despite the difficulties I mentioned - to focus in the end-game on the core issues of the Johannesburg Summit.
The EU will continue to promote its positive agenda on trade for the benefit of developing countries.
There are plenty of things to report here:
First, we are ahead of other major trading partners on market access, thanks in particular to 'Everything But Arms'.
Second, on Friday, the EU and the ACP countries launch negotiations on Regional Economic Partnership Agreements under the Cotonou Agreement.
I can go into more detail if you have questions about this.
Third, last week, the Commission adopted a communication on trade and development, addressed to Council and to this Parliament.
It sets out what needs to be done to help developing partners benefit from national, regional and global trade.
It responds, within less than a month, to the Johannesburg Political Declaration and the call for increased Trade-Related Assistance.
The relevant Doha provisions are quoted throughout the text.
The Johannesburg text also calls for the successful completion of the Doha Agenda, placing the needs of developing countries at the heart of negotiations, but without interfering with its negotiations on subsidies and tariffs.
On subsidies, the Johannesburg text directly quotes the Council's conclusions.
The text also reaffirms the text on access to medicines and TRIPs.
In short, the Johannesburg text on trade and finance is in line with the mandate given by the Development Council on 30 May.
That is not a bad result.
The message from southern delegations was nevertheless loud and clear: 'The North must show that it is serious about Doha being a development round'.
That is a rather useful reminder which we, from the Commission side, welcome and find meaningful.
Regarding finances, Johannesburg fully reconfirmed the millennium development goals, also adding a few new, important targets.
Sustainable development remains the core objective of the Johannesburg political declaration, and this gives us a coherent framework for implementing the outcome of all major UN conferences.
The fight against poverty was given high priority throughout the chapters of the Plan of Implementation.
It is a step forward that the summit explicitly prioritised fighting poverty in pursuing targets such as access to energy, water and sanitation, and equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity.
We therefore have sound, common yardsticks for whether the community of nations is doing enough.
The agreed language on finance ensures a dynamic post-Monterrey process, thereby maintaining the pressure for more ODA.
You will not be surprised to hear, however, that I think donors should be doing a lot more.
If you want concrete answers as to where the EU is going, you should look at 2003 fiscal budgets for each of the EU Member States.
That is what I will do.
Regarding the role of the European Parliament - there has been some debate on the role of Members of this Parliament at the summit, and on collaboration with the Commission.
Since some of these remarks have been made in public, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly react.
The Commission was pleased to accept a substantial presence from the Parliament in the Union's delegation, as has been the case for all major UN conferences.
Members followed the summit actively and interacted with the Commission in briefings, summit events, side-events and so on, all in the interests of representing Europe.
As agreed between the institutions, Members of Parliament participated in delegations as observers and did not take part in negotiating sessions.
There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg.
I think I should repeat this. There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg.
The Commission did its best to support the parliamentarians.
They were kept regularly informed of negotiations, and the Commission listened carefully to their views.
Debriefing meetings were held on a daily basis by senior Commission officials.
This demonstrates the importance we gave to a transparent flow of information.
Both Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and I participated in this process, and I personally met the Parliament delegation three times during the summit, not to mention the Parliamentary side-events I attended, including two events organised by the Green party.
All of this was done within the current framework, a framework referred to explicitly in President Prodi's letter agreeing to parliamentary participation.
I pointed out to Members of Parliament raising this issue in Johannesburg during the summit, as I had to, that we had not come there with new rules and that it was not in our power in Johannesburg to change these arrangements.
Any such changes require a tripartite decision involving the Commission, Council and European Parliament.
If being a loyal custodian of what has been agreed to makes one ancient, I prefer that, rather than trying to be modern if that means not being able to respect what has been agreed to.
Now a few words on follow-up.
Partnerships between governments, business and civil society will be necessary to deliver the commitments made in Johannesburg.
We welcome the more than 200 partnerships launched at the summit.
These partnerships will hopefully bring additional resources and expertise, and mobilise action at all levels.
But it is the quality and size of the partnerships that matter, not the numbers as such.
The Cotonou Agreement is 'only' one partnership, but it covers 15 EU Member States, 77 developing countries, and has a financial protocol of EUR 15.2 billion.
We are not starting from scratch.
The European Commission will focus on securing strong EU implementation of the two EU-wide partnerships on water and energy launched in Johannesburg.
During the summit, the EU signed with its African partners a strategic EU-Africa partnership on water and sanitation.
In conjunction with the EU Water Initiative, this is an important step towards the development of concrete actions building on strong ownership and commitment from African partners.
More generally, it is clear that the effective implementation of the outcome of Johannesburg means translating intentions into action through development cooperation undertaken regionally and nationally as well as locally.
The EU must continue to take the lead.
The European Council has already agreed to review, at its Spring meeting in 2003, the EU strategy for sustainable development, with a focus on putting into practice the commitments undertaken in Johannesburg.
To prepare this review, the Commission intends to submit proposals building on the communication 'Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development' issued earlier this year.
Internally, one of the main issues to be addressed in the synthesis report for next Spring's European Council should be how to move towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns in the EU.
I would conclude by saying that the European Union can be satisfied with the role it played in Johannesburg; and by stressing 'European Union'.
The cooperation between Commission and Council was also a very positive experience.
The EU clearly came with the longest wish list. But of course, the higher the level of ambition, the greater the scope for disappointment.
NGOs and the press focus on these shortcomings.
So be it. But as responsible politicians, we must be careful not to draw the conclusion that we, for this reason, should be less ambitious in the future.
The Commission does not believe the EU - and indeed the world - can afford to be less ambitious.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission.
I want to begin in a positive mood and say that I fully agree with the Commission and the Council that we should not be too critical and negative about the result of the Johannesburg Summit.
It is not possible to measure the gain that nonetheless results when we see that more people have access to water, proper sanitation, food and an environment with fewer chemicals.
I think that we should say that this really is a gain and that we should share the credit together, for, had it not been for the European Union, I think that we never would have got as far as we did in Johannesburg.
This is also perhaps where part of Parliament's frustration lies.
Ever since the period before the Gothenburg Summit, we in Parliament have worked actively for sustainable development.
Many have compared our wish list to some sort of Christmas tree with an overabundance of decorations.
We have nonetheless been agreed on the requirements and on the process we wanted the Union to implement in order to make the necessary changes.
Our frustration stems from the fact that we can see that the results have not yet been achieved.
If our wish list is considered to be an over-decorated Christmas tree, then one could well say that the result from Johannesburg is more like a Christmas tree with no needles - but nevertheless a Christmas tree.
Our frustration also expresses itself when we are not able to make use of our abilities and our knowledge at summits.
I still think that this message is one that the Commission should take note of.
It is a matter of the attitude between Parliament and the Commission.
This fact is, however, worthy of a much smaller degree of frustration than the situation we actually ought to be frustrated about, that is, the situation the world finds itself in.
This is the problem we really ought to discuss today.
The problems that might exist between Parliament and the Commission as to who should say what at the international meetings can be taken up in a forum other than this Chamber, and we should now concentrate on the problem that we actually need to do something about.
It is good that there is emphasis on us now having to start on the real work.
We must ensure that the commitments and promises that the EU made in Johannesburg now find expression in our actual policies and that they are visible in our budget.
I should like both the Council and the Commission to return to Parliament in February to report on what has been done up to then and what will happen in future so that the commitments from Johannesburg can be implemented.
In this connection, I will naturally emphasise aid.
The Member States fall embarrassingly short of the standard when it comes to international aid.
There are few who actually come up to it.
I would also like to say a few words about the other commitments that the EU has made, for example at Kyoto, and about how things are looking with our own climate programme, which the Commission approved about a year ago, a two-year programme that comprises one half of the strategy to combat climate change within Europe.
We come back to the other half, the trade in emission quotas, in October through Mr Moreira da Silva.
It is a pity that we cannot also discuss emission quotas in this context, but I will, however, say something about the report that the Commission published about one year ago.
We have made good progress with what the Commission has put forward, but the Commission's programme is lacking a great many important parts.
Agriculture policy, for example, is still not included, but this could perhaps be included in the programme now since one year has passed.
With regard to our targets and the 8% reduction we want to achieve, the principle must still be that climate policy should form the basis of energy policy.
This should govern the formulation of our energy policy in future.
We must ensure that this is expressed in our research programmes and in the directives that the Commission has promised, such as the directive on public procurement with regard to energy.
Transport remains the biggest problem.
There are no good solutions, a fact that could be described as embarrassing.
Less embarrassing are the local examples.
The car-free day all over Europe on Sunday is witness to an enormous commitment of a kind that we should make much more often than we have in the past.
Mr President, I speak in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion on the European Climate Change Programme.
Commissioner Nielson, I was astonished by the self-satisfaction you radiated during your contribution on the outcome of Johannesburg.
There is little evidence to justify it, and your abuse of the press is of no use and makes no difference.
I wish to speak on the Climate Change Programme, and with specific reference to the ten of its forty-two points that are to be implemented over the coming two years.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has welcomed this programme as a whole, as we take the view that it is not enough for measures to be taken by the Member States alone.
There can, though, be no doubt that responsibility for adherence to the climate change objectives rests primarily with the states that signed the Kyoto Protocol, that is, with the Member States of the European Union, that burden sharing is a voluntary agreement within the European Union, and that the measures proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament must not be allowed to frustrate these objectives.
That is why the Committee on Industry takes the view that what matters in evaluating the measures is that the most efficient and cost-effective should be taken first.
It is, then, about not providing just for any old measures that cost a lot of money and put the European Union's industrial competitiveness at risk, but rather about making a start where everything can be put into effect as quickly as possible.
There are, as yet, few proposals on how to go about this.
Two have been received, one on biofuels, which are the right thing but expensive, and another on emissions trading, on which latter subject the Committee on Industry has made an emphatic call for a voluntary pilot stage up to 2008, and for such trading not to be enforced before that date.
It is my belief that this objective and these considerations have to be looked at from the point of view of industry policy.
I have been preceded on the floor by four speakers from the Scandinavian states.
I believe it to be the common responsibility of us all not to lose sight of our industrial policy objectives and our economy's competitiveness, no matter how necessary it is that we support to the utmost a sensible European climate change programme.
Mr President, I am going to speak about the Johannesburg Summit. With regard to the HulthÃ©n report, my colleague, Peter Liese, will address this issue.
Unlike what many tried to do, and which amounted to condemning the summit to failure even before it began, Parliament set out for Johannesburg with considerable ambition: in other words, we did not join in with the cynical approach of those who sought to lower expectations before setting off in order to be able then to make small victories appear to be major ones.
We adopted this approach for two reasons: first, because this is what the world required.
The world is in a state of emergency, in both the environmental and the social fields, and so achieving a merely reasonable result at the summit was not acceptable to this Parliament.
Second, because this was an opportunity that did not arise ten years ago and which will not arise in the next few years.
It would, therefore, have been a tragic mistake not to take advantage of this opportunity.
We set out, then, with considerable ambition and with a great spirit of unity and of solidarity between all the political groups.
And at the end of the summit, I must say that although we moved in the right direction and we went further than Rio, we achieved less than what was needed.
Admittedly, some results were achieved, but these are by no means sufficient to reverse the signs of unsustainability afflicting the planet.
On the positive side, in addition to what the Danish Presidency and the Commission have highlighted in terms of timetables and targets, specifically for poverty, water and health, I would highlight as equally positive the change in the character of the summit.
Whereas in Rio we did not get beyond the concept of sustainable development, Johannesburg was associated with action.
The nature of the summit took a qualitative leap forwards.
Secondly, a qualitative leap was also taken in terms of concepts: sustainable development made a very close link between the environment and poverty.
And I think that another qualitative leap was the desire to eradicate poverty and, at the same time, to put a brake on environmental degradation.
Thirdly, in terms of the actors: reversing unsustainability stopped being an obligation of nations, of states alone.
With the huge number of partnerships approved, the participation of civil society has been guaranteed.
Both the public and private sectors are committed to this objective of sustainable development.
On the negative side, it was obviously a disappointment that no quantified targets were set for renewable energies or for reversing lost biodiversity.
I would, however, add a point not mentioned either by the Danish Presidency, or by the Commission, and which I believe is negative: it is the fact that no boost was given to institutional reform in the field of the environment.
This summit could have been used to ensure the 'greening' of the existing institutions, such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, but also to launch new institutions that place globalisation at the service of sustainable development.
I am thinking, for example, of a World Environment Organisation.
This issue was not mentioned or discussed, and played no part in the summit, and this was deplorable.
I have one last thing to say, also on the negative side, with regard to Kyoto.
Many people have placed Kyoto on the positive side of the balance-sheet of this summit.
I would put it on the negative side.
It is true that Russia, Canada, India and China made very fine declarations with regard to the future.
What was expected of this summit, however, was not declarations or intentions about Kyoto: what was hoped for was for the summit to lead to the practical implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
And ten years after the Rio Summit, Kyoto has still not begun to exist in practice.
I wish to say one last thing about the role of Parliament and our relationship with the Commission and with the Council. We tend, at these summits, to praise the Commission and to criticise the Council.
This time, things were reversed: our relationship with the Danish Presidency was excellent, transparent, highly cooperative and, unfortunately, this time, with the Commission, we did not see the same level of cooperation that we have grown accustomed to at the conferences on climate change with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
We have always enjoyed excellent cooperation at the summits on climate change.
Unfortunately, this time there was neither transparency, nor cooperation, nor sufficient collaboration.
Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Johannesburg was indeed a summit at which it was no longer the fine and already so often enunciated words that mattered, but the commitment to definite actions.
I believe that this was also timely, as what we know to be necessary has long been an item on the agenda.
If it is the worldwide acceptance of sustainable development that we are about, then it goes without saying that this involves the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of social cohesion in many countries of the world, that being the foundation stone for sustainable development and for environmentally responsible behaviour.
So it is that I find it all the more regrettable that the current American administration behaves as it does, making use of every tactical evasive trick in an attempt to forestall definite commitments with the ultimate aim of causing its own economic interests to prevail.
I believe that this has to be said with the utmost clarity, especially in the light of how the European Union, the driving force behind this summit, tried to get the right questions onto the agenda and also to get to grips with the right targets for implementing sustainable development.
This has, unfortunately, been only partly successful, mainly because the world's largest industrial state blocked it.
The EU provided the driving force and indicated the right way to go, notably on issues of water supply, sanitation and environmentally friendly production.
I also found the daily discussions with the Commission good and appropriate, and am also grateful to the Presidency of the Council for, on three occasions, having very in-depth discussions with the Parliamentary delegation, although it is still Parliament's demand that the leader of the delegation at least should take part in the EU coordination meeting tomorrow and be able to observe and comment on the actual negotiating processes.
If, however, you point the finger at the right issues, three fingers are generally pointing back at you, and that is also true on this issue of sustainable development.
One of these fingers is our agricultural policy.
How, indeed, can we go on the offensive in demanding changes in production worldwide if our agricultural policies and subsidies stand in the way of fair dealing, if our agricultural subsidies are many times in excess of what we give as development aid?
Second finger: what about a system of fair trade for the world?
To judge by the situation that coffee growers currently find themselves in, there is a need for bold revision of the trading system and also of the international financial flows, which have to aim at fair investments rather than the maximisation of short-term profit.
The third finger, without a doubt, points to the issue of sustainable policies in our own activities.
How successful are we in fact in pointing the European Union's transport systems and private households towards sustainability?
We will have credibility in the eyes of the world only when we ourselves can make it clear that what we demand of others we also put into practice ourselves.
That is why the climate change programme that we are discussing today is an important building block towards combining environmental policy channels with economic performance and social justice.
Mr President, the question today is to what extent the Johannesburg Summit achieved actual results, and what the EU's role was in this.
Has any progress been made in this ambitious area?
Have new definite objectives, and above all, timeframes, been set?
Have old objectives been confirmed?
A question that is even more important, in my view, is: where do we go from here?
Will we go into action worldwide?
It is high time we did!
Taking an overall view and considering the climate in which the negotiations were held, my group takes the view that the outcome is reasonably positive.
It could have been worse.
However, we certainly have a few points of criticism.
I want to make it clear, though, that we are particularly positive about the role that the European Union played.
It was a pioneering role, certainly as regards worldwide commitment to ensuring that a million people have access to basic sanitary facilities and, in their own way, be given human dignity, better health and a better living environment.
Furthermore, we reached agreement on curbing overfishing, dangerous chemicals, and made multinationals accountable for destructive practices.
These too are all firmly on the agenda.
We also welcome the commitment concerning gender mainstreaming.
We also believe that the liberal ideas, on which we have insisted for so long, are firmly embedded in the plan of action.
I am, of course, referring to the fight against corruption, maintaining the rule of law, democracy, human rights and good governance.
In our view, these are crucial elements to address before we can embark on new partnerships with developing countries.
On the whole and considering the climate, we should count ourselves lucky that we managed to persuade the world not to go in for any backtracking, despite the strong opposition from the United States and some other countries.
Indeed, they displayed an unwillingness to reach reasonable agreements.
The US, in particular, managed to dig its heels in at every opportunity.
This is beyond me.
It is mainly thanks to the EU's united stance that any progress was made at all.
I saw it with my own eyes: it was the EU at its best.
A true world player.
A trend setter.
The EU set the agenda time and again.
This is why we should pay tribute to the negotiators.
We also have some criticism.
In our view, the EU skated over the subject of sustainable energy too quickly.
In our view, the new partnership for energy should have been launched in a better way and should have been discussed beforehand in Parliament.
My final point relates to political legitimisation, which concerned me, and I agree with my fellow MEPs.
I shall not go into any more detail.
It is a missed opportunity that the EP did not act more clearly as Dritte im Bunde [Third in the Alliance].
Finally, however, I should nevertheless like to express my thanks, respect and appreciation.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, at the close of the Johannesburg Summit, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, stated that this type of conference cannot be expected to produce miracles.
I must add that the results of previous conferences, Rome and Monterrey, to be specific, did not give rise to such expectations either.
We agree, however, that it is legitimate to expect more than what was achieved.
And, basically, considerably more was needed.
Obviously, we do not wish to play down some of the objectives that were sketched out and also some of the time targets that were adopted, particularly in terms of access to drinking water and to basic sanitation, in terms of the use and production of chemical products or the recovery of fish stocks.
Not to mention other objectives which had been previously enshrined and which have now been reaffirmed.
However, and at the same time, we cannot ignore or gloss over the clear failures seen in other fields, specifically in the field of renewable energies, to which the European Union has been so committed, but in which the results fell far short of our expectations.
Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the means and even the commitment crucial to realising the objectives adopted remained largely undefined, especially if we take account of the deadlines that were set.
Despite the fact that, as has been mentioned, some new objectives were defined, nothing relevant or practical was put forward apart from the insipid Monterrey commitments in the field of financial resources, either in terms of public development aid or of debt cancellation.
We are aware that a decision was taken to create a solidarity fund designed to eradicate poverty.
We also know, however, that this fund has a purely voluntary basis which is not, therefore, binding.
We cannot, therefore, expect great results of it.
At the same time, this fund demonstrates the clear failure by the developed countries to provide the public aid to which they committed themselves some decades ago.
In other words, given the lack of adequate resources, we might once again be in the field of good intentions, such as many of those declared in Rio and which experience has shown have gone no further.
Fundamentally, however, the Johannesburg Summit produced no clear and objective definition of the direction to be taken in order to achieve the realisation of the central objective of the summit, and which it took, incidentally, as its motto: sustainable development.
We would really like to see, in this field, a level of commitment, a degree of responsibility and a clarity with regard to targets similar to those that have been adopted at the trade summits.
It is clear, however, that neither the will nor the political priorities are the same, especially on the part of those that determine the outcome of these events.
And, with regard to this, it is worth pointing out that Secretary of State Colin Powell set the tone by making the very limiting statement that trade is the driving force of development and that Johannesburg is an important step on the path that lies between Doha and the future.
Much of what happened in Johannesburg can be understood in the light of these two statements placing the entire emphasis on trade.
Mr President, the lack of success of Johannesburg was due to the change in the political climate.
This change in the political climate is taking place not only in the US, but also in the EU because we have a much more trade-dominated political agenda than we did in 1992.
The Verts/ALE Group today considers that we will no longer be credible in the eyes of the G77 countries if we do not change this and add four cornerstones to our international policy.
Firstly, monitoring is not sufficient.
We need a binding agreement in the EU on 0.7% of ODA.
Secondly, we must stop export subsidies on agriculture.
Thirdly, we must progress in Europe in the area of production and consumption patterns.
Fourthly, we must stop trade dominance and restore a better balance between multilateral environmental agreements and trade, and also introduce binding agreements for big business with regard to their corporate and social responsibility.
If we look at the way the negotiations were handled in Johannesburg - and this is another reason for its lack of success - in the first week we had a Commissioner who was primarily interested in trade issues.
There may have been very good reasons why the Commissioner for the Environment was only able to attend for some 48 hours, but on top of this we had a Commissioner who had determined a substantial part of the negotiations, without any democratic scrutiny, in secret negotiations months ahead of the whole summit.
Finally, we were less well prepared with regard to the energy partnership than we were on the water partnership.
That was another reason why we were not able to move ahead quickly on this and you, Commissioners, signed a letter in which you tried to readdress the question of the role of nuclear energy in this partnership.
Can you give us a clear message that we in Parliament will be much more involved in the future of this partnership, as we requested in our report?
Mr President, what we are left with after Johannesburg is little concrete progress and a muddy outlook for future global work on sustainable development.
What should have been the climax of the Johannesburg summit - the political declaration - ended up being a weak mish-mash of the special interests of various countries which does not dare mention human rights directly, which leaves it up to the corporations themselves to check whether they are meeting their responsibilities and which erased all mention of the promises made at Rio not having been met.
A declaration that never managed to grasp the nettle and change the circumstances that could really make a difference to the poor people of the world.
Neither the EU nor the USA had the will to make concessions to the developing countries in the area of aid and trade.
Both Mr Lange and Mr Turmes have mentioned the EU's agricultural subsidies, which are quite fundamental.
Consequently it was also difficult to achieve improvements in the areas of the environment and human rights.
So that was the outcome of hours of negotiations behind closed doors - in sharp contrast to several sections of the declaration, which talk about the broad involvement of partners.
The Johannesburg Summit provided confirmation of ten years' experience of the USA as a player in global environmental and development policy.
First they water down the agreements, then they still do not sign up to them anyway.
Unfortunately, the EU does not have much to boast about either.
'Let us enter into an agreement capable of replacing darkness and despair with light and hope for hundreds of millions of people,' said Mr Rasmussen in his speech at the summit.
Sadly, I find it difficult to see where these fine words are reflected in the final outcome.
Water and sanitation - yes, those are positive things, but if we look at the promises made at Cairo, for example, and at how few of them have been met, I would like to see things implemented before I dare to trust in these promises.
Do global summits still have a role? Yes and no.
As long as the rich leaders of the world have no real intention of bringing about improvements for the poor people of the world, the money can be spent on better things than expensive conferences and summits.
It will take more than pipe dreams to feed the poor properly.
Mr President, the world at large is slowly getting tired of hearing reports on environmental summits with feeble outcomes.
Rio still managed to be the bearer of great hopes, at least as regards theoretical approaches and fine words.
The deeds that ensued were so disappointing that the environmental movement around the world has been virtually struck dumb.
Kyoto was at least able to formulate an objective. The length of the periods of time leading up to implementation is such as to induce paralysis.
Johannesburg was another disappointment in terms of what had been expected of it.
Every failed summit does more harm than good, as it brings on a mood of resignation.
Despite all this, I would like to mention the positive things about Johannesburg.
For the first time, the European Union set out a practicable way ahead and a definite strategy in the form of the development of renewable energy sources.
It is of course a matter for regret that the global one per cent increase was not adopted, but the EU now has the chance to live out and demonstrate, within its own borders, the way in which conversion to renewable energy sources makes everyone a winner, in that, by doing so, we will not only be mitigating climatic disaster, but will also be creating five times as many jobs as we would with traditional use of energy, preserving resources around the world, using renewable energy sources to develop technologies that we can export.
Let us bear in mind that two billion people in the world have no electricity.
It is now for us to work hard at demonstrating by our actions that we are actually achieving the objectives set by the White Paper for renewable energy sources.
I would like to point out that we are rather behind in our aim to double their use by 2010.
I wish to inform you of the progress of our work.
We should have finished this part at 10 a.m., which would have given us 45 minutes of free debate between the Members present in the Chamber.
I regret to say that hardly anybody respected the speaking time, with the - greatly appreciated - exception of the President-in-Office of the Council.
Now, before we start this part of the debate, the two Commissioners have asked to speak - in response to Mrs HulthÃ©n's speech, I imagine - and they will speak later on as well.
I invite the two Commissioners to be brief in their mid-debate contributions.
On a point of order, Mr President. I think we should ask the Commissioners to reiterate their positions at the end of the debate rather than while it is in progress.
Now it is the turn of the MEPs!
Mr Liese, the two Commissioners are already scheduled to speak at the end of the debate.
I am quite aware of that.
However, they have explicitly requested the floor now and I cannot refuse.
Mr President, we are totally in your hands.
We can do this in whatever way you want.
I would like to thank the two Commissioners for their amenability.
In actual fact, I too found the idea that they should make three contributions to the debate a little odd.
The two Commissioners will, therefore, respond at the end, after the free debate which is about to take place and the second speeches of the speakers from the political groups.
Mr President, I am speaking on the HulthÃ©n Report in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, but I cannot be anything other than astonished at Commissioner Nielson's behaviour in particular.
What has been reported by the Members of this House who were in Johannesburg, and also his conduct here today, make me wonder whether it makes any sense to let a Parliamentary delegation take part in such summits in this way.
Let me turn now, though, to Mrs HulthÃ©n's report on climate change, which is excellent and for which I thank her.
One might say that this topic has been whirled back to the surface by the floods in Germany and in neighbouring countries.
Although we cannot say that this actual flood was a product of climate change, we are all aware that such events will occur more frequently if we do not take prompt action now.
This makes the European Climate Change Programme important, but the actual measures so far proposed by the Commission are insufficiently ambitious.
Emissions trading is a highly controversial topic in this House, and the Commissioner knows that Mr Moreira da Silva has my firm support in his efforts at improving the Commission proposal and preventing it from being watered down.
The Commission proposal on emissions trading is, however, only a part of a comprehensive strategy.
Too little has been done to date in the areas of transport and the Budget, and, if we are not careful, this can even result in grave distortions, for example, to the detriment of railways and to the benefit of HGV transport.
We are still waiting for the proposal on the energy efficiency of machinery.
If we are to have a comprehensive strategy on this as well, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi should waste no time in submitting a very ambitious proposal.
I would like to draw Members' particular attention to item 16 in the HulthÃ©n Report, which has to do with the abolition of subsidies that harm the environment and the climate - a difficult topic, but we are sticking with it, dealing as it does with the introduction of a revenue-neutral pollution-related levy for all areas to which emissions trading does not apply.
This means that industry, if it wants to campaign against emissions trading, has to ask itself whether it would, in its stead, prefer this pollution-related levy, and I do believe that we will then have a hard-headed discussion on this issue.
Mr President, I welcome the part of the proposed resolution relating to health and meeting health targets.
Firstly, the reduction of the prevalence of HIV-AIDS - a disease that has reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years - is an absolutely essential target.
There are reliable estimates to say that if the present state of the disease continues, every other 15-year-old girl in South Africa will die of HIV-AIDS.
One way to combat this is through further development of microbicides.
This particular form of preventive treatment can be singled out because, unlike conventional methods of protection, it allows women to take responsibility for its use.
The problem is that investment in their development is not sufficient and such treatments are still several years away.
There is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials.
The second point is to draw the attention of colleagues to Parliament's own work on the Sixth Framework Programme.
Through this programme the European Union has given high priority to combating poverty-linked infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
Finally, I should like to mention access to medicines.
I hope the present contretemps about TRIPs and possible barriers to the most modern medicines will be overcome very shortly.
There is also a shortage of generic medicines, the cheaper medicines and other forms of treatment, which are just as important in countries where poverty is so rife and where water standards are so poor.
