This change would not bring any improvement at all in conditions of public health, just an increase in the revenue of extra-Community companies, and, worst of all, it would have a considerable negative impact on employment levels in European tobacco-growing areas, in other words in the south of Europe, where more unemployment is the last thing they need.
To sum up, it is right to oppose advertising in the interests of public health but, for goodness' sake, let us not start proposing once again to cut aid to Community growers.
Mr President, I wish to join with all those who have expressed gratitude to our rapporteur, who did indeed have to go against his own instincts in order to be able to put this compromise before us, and I am also grateful to him for having incorporated in these compromises amendments that Mrs Roth-Behrendt and I had submitted.
I can therefore support the essence of the lines the committee has taken.
Perhaps we should take another look at one or the other of these amendments, if they really do, as it were, again jeopardise the legal basis as given.
In essence, the considerations on which our amendments were based were that the internal market has a legal basis that allows us to make regulations on advertising only if that advertising has an impact across borders, and, moreover, to a substantial degree.
I agree with Mr Lechner that this is not automatically the case with newspapers and magazines.
I also think we are insisting that sponsorship agreements both in culture and in sport have to make allowances by means of proper transitional periods.
I also think that the right to freedom of information is meant to matter to us.
On it, indeed, depends the economic basis of both the traditional media - and major daily newspapers are telling us what is going on here - and also the new media.
I join with Mr Medina Ortega and with all those who regret the fact that we have no better legal basis for health policy in the European Union than that which currently governs the internal market.
I would also like to observe that the Convention working party on the powers of the European Union proposes that it should in future no longer be possible to have recourse to legislative measures relating to health policy in the EU, but that only so-called support measures should remain feasible.
I hope, Commissioner, that this will give you a reason to drum up support from the Commission for a reshaping of the Convention's proposals on this subject.
Mr President, we at the European Parliament must respect the principles of the rule of law, which means that we must uphold judgments of our European Court of Justice.
As we know, with regard to tobacco advertising, this court of law has previously nullified a directive on account of there being an incorrect legal basis.
That does not surprise me, because during the debate of this first directive, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, under my chairmanship at the time, had clearly stated that the European Union had no powers to issue a directive of this kind.
In short, the law has rights too.
I should therefore like to thank Mr Medina Ortega warmly on his achievements as rapporteur on this occasion.
I should like to stress straight away that I shall be backing him during the vote.
After all, the rapporteur has ensured that the directive to be issued now is legally watertight.
It is true that the European Union can impose a ban on tobacco advertising on the Member States if there is a clear cross-border effect.
However, I should like to add that it seems to me to be necessary that the ban on tobacco advertising, if it has a cross-border effect, should be put on an equal footing across all Member States.
Member States that take their own initiatives at present distort the internal market's organisation and often cause a competitive disadvantage for themselves.
I would take the example of my own country, Belgium, and the sponsoring of major sports events in Belgium.
Our country has already issued a law which bans any form of tobacco advertising from 2003 onwards.
As you can see, this goes much further than the currently proposed European regulation.
Is this wise?
I think that a general European regulation, as proposed by our rapporteur, should, on account of its general application, ensure that unilateral measures with often unfortunate consequences are avoided in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall not repeat what my colleague Mrs Hautala has already said.
It is clear that my group and I share her point of view.
I would simply like to add to what Mrs Berger said.
I feel that the Commission should put forward a proposal to the European Convention to change the Treaty's existing legal bases in the area of public health.
Mrs Berger was right to stress the fact that the working group to the Convention has submitted its conclusions which attracted severe criticism in the Convention's plenary session.
I feel that we absolutely must be able to legislate in the area of public health, as the arguments put forward here regarding subsidiarity do not hold water.
On the one hand, the Council and the Community institutions are preserving their powers of appreciation as to whether or not it is appropriate to legislate.
On the other hand, if we look at the studies carried out by the World Health Organisation, it is evident that in order for a ban on advertising to be effective, it must be applied thoroughly and comprehensively.
The solution to be followed is that of global legislation in this area.
We must at least have the means to pass European legislation, without which - and I refer back to the previous debate on media concentration - what will happen is that economic players will play the national legislation card against the others.
This argument also puts the case for European legislation.
Mr President, while I listened to the Commissioner as carefully as I always do, in my mind was the thought that this is another case of a never-ending conflict between our desires and our capabilities.
Indeed, it is easy to let emotions take over when we discuss matters such as this, but I would remind you that this is a legislative House and that we have to respect the rules we make.
I therefore agree with the position expressed by Mr Medina Ortega in the conclusion to his speech to the effect that, when we draw up the new version of the Treaties, we must reflect once and for all on the European Union's competences in this field.
The lengthy analysis in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was a very serious process.
With the first advertising directive having been annulled, the second proposal, although less comprehensive, is still wide-ranging and, in our opinion, it still leaves ample room for further recourse to the Court of Justice.
In terms of primary law, the draft presented does not fully respond to the issues arising from the Court decision.
I feel that, if we are to do the job properly, two minutes are not enough to go into the complexities of legal issues.
I will therefore limit myself to two very brief points.
The first concerns the prohibition on advertising in the press, with regard to which the general statement deriving from the decisions of the Court of Justice on the advertising of tobacco products to the effect that a ban on advertising can be contemplated, in principle, on the basis of Article 95, should probably be understood according to the very narrow Court interpretation of the Community's competences in the area of the internal market and not as a kind of carte blanche for the issue of a general ban on the advertising of tobacco products in the press. This is as the current legislation stands.
The second point is the ban on Internet advertising.
As regards the ban on tobacco advertising through information society services, it is difficult to perceive any potential future barriers to the freedom to provide services or distortions of competition.
At best, such a ban can be based on the need to avoid the possibility of a further ban, and at this point, this means that the principles of Community competence and responsibility are being overturned and reduced to competences in principle, and that is extremely dangerous from a legal point of view.
Mr President, Commissioner, just how harmful tobacco is can be judged, for example, from the fact that people say that if tobacco had been discovered now it would definitely have been banned because it causes so many public health problems.
It does seem strange that we appear to be finding excuses for how we might continue advertising at European level to make this product, as wretched as it is in terms of public health, more tempting for people.
We are now in a situation where we have to pass a directive that is unsatisfactory, but we have already heard the history of this matter.
It was unfortunate that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market got no further in this: we have had to accept a very unsatisfactory outcome as a compromise.
On the other hand, this directive is being dealt with under the Hughes procedure with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Commission proposal was unanimously supported by that committee, so we might say that, as a result, the majority strongly back the Commission proposal.
These unfortunate decisions, which the Committee on Legal Affairs has arrived at, can certainly then be amended in the vote on Wednesday.
As, however, we cannot be satisfied with this proposal, even though it is all we now have, it is vital that we should accept Amendment No 26 tabled by Heidi Hautala, which would make it possible to preserve legislation in those countries where it has advanced further.
Mr President, Mr Maaten was right to focus on the content of the debate.
In this connection, I regret that his report is not being debated together with that by Mr Medina Ortega today.
I think that this would certainly have benefited the scope of the debate.
As Mr Tsatsos pointed out, tobacco kills.
In Europe, it claims 548 000 victims a year, or one every minute.
Mr Maaten was right in saying that a tobacco advertising ban works and is lawful.
May I add a few examples?
Norway has had an advertising ban in place since 1975. This has led to a drop in consumption by 31%.
There have been similar trends in Finland and New Zealand, where a ban since 1978 and 1990 respectively has led to a drop in consumption by 34% and 33% respectively.
We should also condemn the anomaly that, although we give tobacco growers EUR 1 billion every year, we find it difficult to produce a comprehensive strategy to restrict the use of tobacco.
Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the link between the tobacco lobby and politicians.
I would ask you to endorse the amendments by Mrs Stihler and others, also backed by myself, which call for the introduction of a registration system of donations from the tobacco industry to political parties and politicians.
Mr President, whatever some fellow MEPs may claim, this debate is not about emotions.
What it is about is the extent to which, and the way in which, we can, and are willing to, remove the existing barriers to the organisation of the internal market in the field of tobacco advertising.
Anyone who has read the judgment of 5 October 2000 knows that the Court of Justice has specifically opted for the first directive to be repealed altogether, because, on the one hand, it recognises that there is actually room for the legislator to take harmonising action and, on the other, because, as the Court, it did not want to take the place of the legislator.
This was a wise decision on the part of the Court.
I hope that we as co-legislators will act as wisely.
This means for me that we should endorse the Commission's proposal without any amendments, for the alternatives are inferior.
If we were to restrict tobacco advertising even further than has been proposed by the Commission, our ambition would run up against the bounds of our authority, and we would risk a new judgment.
If we do not go as far as the Commission, then we would be making a political U-turn, for did we not indicate in 1998 that we wanted to go all out for maximum public health protection?
The Commission's draft directive respects the bounds of the authority.
This is not simply my political, but also my legal conviction.
It may be a light-weight version of the first directive, but we have to live with it for legal reasons.
We should not go as far as turning this light-weight version into an ultra-light-weight version, however.
This is unnecessary and would affect our political credibility.
Let us therefore approve the proposal as it stands.
This is what people expect from us and that is also what we are definitely competent to do.
Mr President, at this point in the debate, there is not perhaps a very great deal new to add, but I shall nonetheless have a try.
It is very important to create common basic conditions and rules for tobacco advertising.
In a situation where these do not exist, there is often scope for discretion, and different actors proceed as they themselves think best.
That is why it is good that we now have proposals that are also considered capable of operating legally.
There are many difficult considerations that must be taken into account if we are not again to end up in the same situation as we did with the previous proposal for a directive on tobacco advertising.
The public health perspective is very important when it comes to the way in which tobacco is marketed.
By regulating the marketing of tobacco, public health can be protected.
At the same time, it is important, however, to send out the right signals, above all to children and young people.
Tobacco is an addictive product that causes over half a million deaths per year within the Community.
By being very restrictive when it comes to tobacco advertising, we can help stop young people taking up smoking, prevent suffering and save human lives.
According to Article 95.3 of the Treaty, the Commission 'will take as a base a high level of protection' in its proposals concerning the setting up of the internal market and its operation.
It is undoubtedly the case that tobacco advertising increases consumption, both by encouraging children and young people to take up smoking and by deterring existing smokers from giving up or reducing their daily consumption.
Studies have also shown that children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to tobacco advertising and tobacco-related sponsorship.
A partial ban on advertising is not, therefore, enough to protect public health.
Mr President, I would like to contribute to the debate this evening on behalf of my colleague, Lord Inglewood, who is a victim of the famous deer incident which has extensively been referred to already.
I would like to focus on the principles behind the proposal, rather than the detail, which has been covered very comprehensively by colleagues.
This is a long-standing issue and it arouses understandable emotions.
It is perfectly reasonable that Member States should wish to control tobacco advertising and sponsorship and the Commissioner was quite right in his opening statement where he particularly focused on directing advertising to young people, to try and control new smokers coming into the smoking market.
But I would argue still that the zeal to do this must not override the principles of the European treaties.
We all know that the first time this was tried the Commission was too greedy.
It exceeded those treaty powers and it lost the entire directive.
In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - and I remind colleagues that this committee was right the first time round - this proposal runs the same risks.
That is why we invite you to support our amendments.
If you do not support them, you carry the risk of the whole directive falling.
The second point I wish to make concerns the whole question of subsidiarity.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's proposal ensures that Member States take that responsibility.
It derogates those powers to Member States.
Mr Fiori said earlier on that it is not what we want to do, it is what is appropriate in the circumstances.
There is a lot of talk about subsidiarity at present.
Many colleagues are engaged in debates on subsidiarity in the ambit of the convention.
This is a real test of that.
You may want to do something, but it is not necessarily in the competence of the European Union to do it.
That is what we are saying in this case.
That we should not discourage Member States from doing it.
This is the real test of how serious you are about the principles of subsidiarity.
That is why you should support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's line when we vote on Wednesday.
Let me first of all deal with some of the technical issues.
Looking at the important question of the Commission's attitude to the various amendments, there are 26 amendments being proposed.
The Commission can accept amendments 3, 10, 22 and 26 in full and amendments 8, 11 and 17 subject to some minor rewording.
All the others, the Commission rejects.
Throughout this debate, we have heard from many speakers and it is quite clear there are different views.
Indeed there are different views in Member States.
They have in fact sought to regulate the advertising of tobacco products.
I am convinced that there is a correlation between the legal rules in Member States on advertising and the figures for adult consumption of tobacco in those Member States.
If you look at one of the Member States with the highest level of tobacco consumption, Germany, with 37%, it has a fairly lax approach to advertising in its national law, as compared with Sweden, one of the Member States with the most restrictive advertising legislation.
Sweden's rate of adult tobacco consumption is 19%.
So there is quite clearly, in my view, a correlation.
A number of you spoke about that in your contributions.
It is a question of attacking the image of smoking.
Mrs Alvarez Gonzalez referred to the different views of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Environment Committee's desire for public health to be promoted as an important basic consideration in determining these issues.
Those who spoke on the other side of the argument, if I might describe it as such, are seeking to have legal certainty, which, as a lawyer, I would say is not at all unreasonable.
It is an objective that I would seek to pursue myself, not just as a lawyer but as one of my responsibilities as a Commissioner.
We have done that.
We examined very closely the judgment of the Court of Justice in the first advertising directive case.
When the Court looked at the facts of that case and gave its judgment, it clearly said that there were good parts in the legislation and bad parts.
It went on to say that because they were so inextricably bound together, to attempt to extract the good from the bad, to retain the good and eliminate the bad, would amount to legislating by the judiciary and that cannot be done.
That is why the legislation was annulled.
I brought the judgment back to Brussels.
I told my staff to follow it closely and we brought a new draft regulation.
Referring only briefly to one part of the Court's judgment, paragraph 98 says in principle that a directive prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in periodicals, magazines and in newspapers could be adopted on the basis of Article No. 100a - now Article 95 - of the Treaty with a view to ensuring the free movement of press products on the lines of Article 13 of Directive 89/552, the television without frontiers directive prohibiting television advertising of tobacco products in order to promote the free broadcasting of television programmes.
The Court has spoken clearly on the subject.
We have followed that carefully in our drafting.
In response to Mr Lechner, who said earlier that there was no evidence of a distortion in the market, I must say that there is plenty of evidence of this.
In the Commission we get letters regularly from people complaining from both sides of the argument, indeed even from the industry, about a distortion in the market because of the different regimes in Member States in relation to this issue.
Mr De Clercq made reference to the movement away from Spa of the Formula 1 championship race.
That is another clear distortion of the market, because Belgium brought in a law which they are saying forces them to move away from Belgium.
That supports my argument that we need to have a level playing field in Europe.
We need to have harmonised legislation on this issue throughout the European Union so that one Member State cannot be played off against another.
This is also my answer to Mr Harbour.
It is not a subsidiarity issue for the very reason that a Belgian has been pinpointed in a particular way and has suffered a loss.
So not only does the Court say it can be done, the Commission says it ought to be done.
But do not just take my word for it.
The Committee on the Environment Committee says that we should have this legislation in the way I have described and I am sure it would agree the few amendments that the Commission concedes.
Even when we look at the first report from the very hardworking Mr Medina Ortega, the rapporteur, there were three suggested amendments and I would have accepted any one of the three.
If I read between the lines of what he has said, and forgive me if I misinterpreting him, I certainly got the impression from his reference to the compromised amendments that he was not speaking with great enthusiasm but was identifying the fact that this House was divided.
Of course, it is.
So maybe we can draw the conclusion that the first thoughts of the rapporteur on this issue, which are closer to those of the Committee on the Environment and to mine, might well be the ones to follow in this debate.
Let us not leave it there.
We have had a number of discussions on tobacco in the Council, including the preliminary discussions on the framework convention on tobacco control, and the breakdown there is 14 to one.
One Member State takes the view that this legislation either should not go through or it should go through in such a form and with such amendments that in my opinion the heart is cut out of the legislation or amendments are added that leave it vulnerable to challenge in the Court of Justice yet again.
So what do I say to those Members of Parliament who are undecided about this?
I would say to them they should follow the views that are expressed by the Court.
Follow the advice of the Commission.
Follow the views of the experts in this House, the Committee on the Environment, and follow the first thoughts of the rapporteur.
Think to what extent will Parliament be on its own if it either votes down this legislation or votes it through with the kind of amendments that are being proposed.
It might not be quite alone, but it will be alone with one Member State, the Member State that happens to have the highest consumption of tobacco amongst adults in the European Union.
That is the choice and therefore I would suggest to those who are undecided on this issue how you should cast your vote.
I would suggest you cast it in a way that puts people's health first, rather than becoming engaged in a pointless debate about the legal niceties when the issues have been resolved by the Court of Justice and those who have examined this issue closely and believe that legal certainty does exist, to the extent that is necessary to support legislation designed to protect public health, as Articles 95 and 152 say.
Both the Commission and Parliament have a duty and an obligation, in this decision-making and law-making, to promote the highest levels of public health.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0367/2002) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (9754/3/2002 - C5-0424/2002 - 2001/0095(COD))
Mr President, I am taking the floor instead of Mr Lipietz, who should have been presenting this report on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with his customary flair.
Unfortunately, Mr Lipietz was unable to come to Strasbourg for this sitting for pressing personal reasons. I am therefore taking his place, being a member of the same committee and of the same group.
We are all aware that financial conglomerates own a substantial proportion of the domestic financial markets of many Member States.
Some of them belong to bigger groups that are present on the EU's financial markets.
If the businesses belonging to conglomerates of this type were to face financial difficulties, they could seriously affect the overall financial system.
At the present time, these cross-sector financial groups are not adequately regulated by current legislation.
Therefore, we can only welcome the fact that the Commission, in the spring of 2001, presented a proposal for a directive to bring in the supervision of financial conglomerates such as these.
The events of the past year, such as the collapse of e-commerce, numerous financial scandals, including the highly publicised collapse of Enron, and also increased pressure on insurance companies in the wake of 11 September, have inevitably highlighted the need for better regulation of this sector.
The Commission proposal and the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs received Parliament's firm support at first reading stage at the beginning of this year.
The Council also made swift progress on this dossier by reaching a common position shortly afterwards.
The outcome of the Council's deliberations is also extremely encouraging.
Parliament can most certainly welcome the fact that the Council has retained almost all the elements contained in the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading and that the common position has taken sufficient account of the main concerns expressed by Parliament.
Despite the fact that there are a few areas where the common position could have been improved further, your rapporteur's major concern is to see this new and enhanced regulatory framework implemented as soon as possible.
He therefore proposes - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved this position almost unanimously - that the common position be adopted in its current form.
This will enable us to ensure that European conglomerates will, in the very near future, be governed by the most up-to-date, most efficient and most effective regulation and controls possible.
Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the speed and quality of Parliament's work.
I must also commend the rapporteur on his excellent work.
Financial conglomerates are important players in European financial markets.
A significant number of them are also systemically important groups.
If such a group were to face financial difficulties it could seriously affect financial markets and people's savings.
Currently the supervision of such groups is not adequately regulated in European financial legislation.
The directive will therefore address an important loophole in our financial legislation.
Its adoption will contribute to financial market stability, the need for which has been demonstrated dramatically over the past months.
The Council has also recognised the importance of this directive and has unanimously agreed on a common position.
The common position has taken into account Parliament's main concerns expressed at first reading and is faithful to the objectives and the spirit of the Commission proposal.
For all these reasons, I commend the Council common position to Parliament and urge its rapid adoption.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur very warmly for his work and for the prompt joint implementation of this directive.
It is of great importance to the European financial market, to the internal market, and to financial services.
In particular, we have to see to it that there is no recurrence in Europe of cases of the magnitude of Enron or World Com.
It makes a fundamental contribution to the stability of Europe's financial markets.
The success of a regulation of this sort is in the financial institutions' own best interests.
The conglomerates are of course houses offering services in the fields of securities, insurance and banking.
We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments, relating in particular to the choice of methods of calculation available, but these were subtle distinctions.
At the end of the day, we are very satisfied with the draft as a whole, which should be adopted in this form.
I would, though, especially like to point out an innovation in this directive, one that is of great importance to us in terms of the overall discussion of financial supervision in Europe.
I refer to the role and structure of the so-called coordinator, who is in future to be appointed for a financial conglomerate.
An increasing number of such conglomerates are coming into being, for example, in my own country, Germany, by the buying-up of Allianz Versicherung by the Dresdner Bank, thus creating a classic conglomerate which is also active right across Europe.
This coordinator is expected in future to be part of a country's own supervisory authority and to make sure that the work of Europe's various supervisory authorities is coordinated, and that accounting standards are the same.
He is to ensure, on the one hand, that unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided, but also, on the other, that information concerning this conglomerate is exchanged, thus enabling a better grasp of the conglomerate's complexities.
I believe that the good and important thing about this is that it gets us closer to answering the question of what shape financial supervision in Europe will take in future.
Being myself at present unable to feel at all at home with the idea of a European super-authority to deal with financial supervision, I believe that we should extend this idea and concept beyond financial conglomerates to other fields and thereby gain useful experience before we give consideration to an overarching authority.
I believe that the Conglomerates Directive can, in this respect, lead the way and give a good example.
Therefore, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can tell you that we will be voting in favour of this directive.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, financial conglomerates can give rise to whole new combinations of risks, and that is something to which we must of course respond.
A number of European countries, such as Great Britain and Sweden, have overall financial supervision and have already had good experience of how it works.
Overall financial supervision makes it possible to deal with the same risks in the same way.
That represents progress towards greater competition neutrality on the financial markets.
Supervision of this kind also continues to guarantee that consumers and workers are better protected when such conglomerates collapse.
Across the world, the financial markets have moved closer together.
This became clear when it was via the financial markets that the American economic downturn was transported to Europe faster and with greater force than even the experts had reckoned with.
What is true of economic downturns is also true of crises in the financial markets: neither is now a merely regional problem.
Supervision of financial conglomerates has as its objective greater stability on the international financial and capital markets.
It must, however, be borne in mind that cannot be achieved only by means of a regulation covering only the territory of the European Union.
I do think that the directive will lead to discussion in the Member States as to what the 'right way of implementation' is, as, on many points, it makes no provision for specific rules, allowing instead wide-ranging discretion for the national supervisory authorities.
It is positively dangerous for a directive primarily intended to apply to conglomerates that operate internationally to be transposed into national law in different ways from one state to another.
This will involve national law on supervision imposing responsibilities on conglomerates or removing them from them, and this will affect competitiveness to a high degree.
Finally, I would like to express my concern that, by sorting out questions of detail, the Supervisory Authorities' Committee will end up leaving a decisive mark on the substance of the law on supervision, and that this means that what Parliament wants becomes less important.
Mr President, if the Council is concerned about the collapse of e-commerce, financial scandals and the resulting deterioration of the situation, there is good reason to be!
The people who have good reason to worry are the employees who have already been made redundant or are about to be made redundant by the companies concerned, even though they are in no way responsible for the anarchy of your economy, which is as unfair as it is irrational.
Confronted with this genuine evil, however, the only solution being proposed is to strengthen prudential rules or to improve supervision, as if the financial conglomerates could be supervised from above by the political authorities responsible for protecting them.
So as to prevent the mere sound of the word 'supervision' from angering the financial conglomerates, the report promises them that the directive will respect the need for confidentiality.
And so, those who pretend to believe that a few prudential rules and a few coordinators who have no real power can eradicate speculation, scandals and financial crises from the capitalist economy will be those who therefore vote in favour of this report.
Even a vote by the European Parliament cannot turn an insipid recommendation into a magic potion to ward off the evils of capitalism.
Your economy based on the quest for private profits and on competition is even more unpredictable than the weather. Although we can predict unsettled weather three days in advance, who can predict the ups and downs of the stock market from one day to the next?
By voting against this text, we are expressing our opposition to an economic system which is stupid and dangerous for society.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, greetings from the United States of America, from where I returned yesterday from a meeting of the delegation responsible for Parliament's relations with the US, where we had further in-depth discussions with representatives of the US Congress and the US Securities and Exchange Commission specifically on the issue of regulation of the financial markets.
This Directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate has been something that has been of immense interest to companies in the United States too.
Enron and similar finance-sector scandals shook the confidence of investors and market operators in the stability of financial conglomerates on both sides of the Atlantic.
Events in the past few years have undeniably shown that the financial services sector needs to improve its regulation and supervision.
The business and financial markets are global markets.
European legislation thus also has an obvious impact on how financial conglomerates operate in third countries, and vice versa.
For this reason it is absolutely vital that legislators and regulating authorities in the European Union and the United States hold ongoing, intensive talks with one another on how workable the regulations and laws are and the need for change.
For example, many of us Members of the European Parliament have taken a critical view of the securities legislation package passed at the end of October by the US Congress, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and in particular the additional obligations it places on companies in the EU.
We still have much work to do to make the mutual recognition of systems possible and stop a jungle of multiple regulatory systems from spreading.
In return, companies in North America must make their views known with regard to how EU legislation affects them.
Many of them opposed this proposal for a directive because they considered it would make things unnecessarily difficult for them in the EU.
The final outcome will hardly satisfy all parties, but we can at least be satisfied that the debate on both sides of the Atlantic has been conducted openly.
In the future too we must take account of all legitimate points of view in order to ensure that global markets operate seamlessly.
The Council has now arrived at a common position.
It is a positive sign that the Council accepted almost all Parliament's amendments at first reading.
I tabled some amendments at second reading that would have brought the legislation on threshold values in the directive closer to the realities of the market.
Our rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, however, is proposing that the common position should be approved without amendment so that work on implementation might begin without delay.
I am prepared to accept this proposal and I shall support the rapporteur provided that the provisions of the directive can be assessed regularly in terms of their viability and revised if need be.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report (A5-0380/2002) by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy ('roadmap') [COM(2002) 181 - C5-0330/2002 - 2002/2174(COS)]
report (A5-0360/2002) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission setting out a Community Action Plan to integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy [COM(2002) 186 ?
C5-0331/2002 - 2002/2175(COS)].
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as deadlines draw near that are decisive for the future of the CFP - leading to its objectives, terms and conditions being redefined - I feel it is crucial that Parliament firmly reiterates the five principles which served as the main theme of my report and which the Committee on Fisheries wanted to highlight with a view to fully integrating environmental protection requirements into the new common fisheries policy.
The first principle is that nothing will be done without the fishermen.
Those working in the fisheries sector are the first to be concerned about the protection of the marine environment and the first to be aware of the need to safeguard it.
They are also the first victims of any impairment of the environment as shown unfortunately by the latest oil spill, which has today caused despair amongst the fishermen of Galicia.
Three years after the Erika disaster, which struck the VendÃ©e region and Brittany, it should not have been possible for the Prestige, an out-dated, dilapidated vessel, to be allowed to sail Community waters.
Our report stresses the need to implement swiftly and comprehensively the packages of directives specifically named Erika I and Erika II.
We refuse to consider fishermen to be predators, to which they are occasionally likened - I might add, wrongly so. On the contrary, this committee grants fishermen the status of wholly legitimate players in environmental protection and stresses that any measures taken without their backing are more than likely to be inappropriate and ineffective.
The second principle is that we should base decisions regarding the management of fish stocks on scientific knowledge that is as sound and accurate as possible.
The economic and social consequences of these decisions are so great that they cannot be taken lightly.
That is why I welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has retained the request to instruct the Commission to draw up a precise action plan with a view to improving the current but very inadequate system of stock evaluation by integrating into it the practical, empirical and pragmatic knowledge of fishermen, as well as checks on landings and by placing the interdisciplinary nature of biological and socio-economic sciences at the very heart of the process of formulating scientific opinions.
The third principle proposes to retain flexible, reversible management instruments such as TACs and quotas, so that the fishing effort can be adjusted to match the state of resources, in preference to rigid instruments that have an irreversible and socially dramatic impact such as the scrapping of vessels.
The fourth principle calls for fishing gear and techniques to be improved with a view to reducing discards, by-catches and the impact on habitats.
Of course, such measures cannot be adopted in a uniform and centralised manner but must leave enough scope for initiatives from professionals working in the sector.
Fishermen, their professional organisations and coastal communities must be given a right to experiment.
Initiatives in this area must be recognised and encouraged.
This is how very promising experiments on the Atlantic coast came about.
I shall mention, by way of example, those experiments aiming to adapt fishing vessels and gear so that they may be used to collect marine debris or oil spills or even the creation of artificial reefs to facilitate the development of breeding or rest areas for maritime fauna, or even artificial fertilisation techniques in the open sea for sea bass.
My report proposes that such experiments should be eligible for state funding.
The fifth and final principle states that state aid for fleet modernisation, the aim of which is to improve working conditions, on-board safety, energy savings and the quality of fisheries products, is perfectly compatible with the protection of the marine environment.
I am pleased to have been broadly supported by the Committee on Fisheries, which retained all of these positive and constructive proposals, thus rejecting the very negative vision of fishery activities, which strongly permeated the Commission communication.
I hope that Parliament, by voting overwhelmingly in favour of this report, will make it clear to all that the protection of the marine environment will be achieved by working with the fishermen rather than against them.
That is why, instead of adopting accusatory positions, instead of speaking constantly about an industry in decline and of a makeshift policy, the Committee on Fisheries preferred to send a message of confidence and hope to those working in the industry to consolidate their growing respect for the quality of the marine environment, a quality that is one of the crucial objectives that the new common fisheries policy is bound by duty to pursue.
Madam President, I read with attention the report adopted by the Committee on Fisheries on our action plan on environmental integration.
We are happy to note that our views are rather more convergent on this issue of environmental integration than on other reform aspects.
We clearly share the same goals in respect of such important fields of action suggested in the report as environmental protection, improvement of research, including the integration of fishermen's experience, specific measures for specific problems, the implementation of an ecosystem approach, aids to modernisation, industrial fisheries, sustainable aquaculture and so on. In fact the Commission has already started or planned several initiatives to respond to these requirements.
Allow me to outline some of them.
We have requested the ICES to study in 2003 the possibilities for operational procedures to integrate fishermen's experience and knowledge in the assessment and advisory process.
We agree that specific situations require specific measures.
We do not apply the same combinations of management instruments in the Baltic as in the North Sea or the Mediterranean.
We do not intend, either, to set the same targets for different fleets.
To achieve the targets set out in Johannesburg, we are in the process of implementing the bio-diversity action plan with a view to halting bio-diversity decline by 2010 and it is through the reformed CFP that we intend to rebuild stocks sooner than 2015.
We have recently co-financed an FAO expert meeting to develop operational guidelines to implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.
In our reform proposals we have excluded the mandatory scrapping of vessels and given more emphasis to multiannual plans using flexible instruments such as TACs, effort regulation and technical measures as main regulatory elements.
We have proposed to maintain aid to modernisation of vessels for reasons of security, working conditions and hygiene, provided that there is no increased fishing efficiency in order to prevent increases in fishing pressure.
We are promoting the elaboration by the main stakeholders of a European code of responsible fishing practice.
The first drafts are already under discussion in the context of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture.
We have requested that the ICES study the ecological consequences of industrial fisheries and the effects on non-fishery activities, as well as the threats, including global warming, to commercial stocks.
The Commission has initiated debate to promote a coordinated protection of the marine environment.
The recent communication on a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment gives the main elements of the policy advocated for a holistic treatment of the problem.
We have addressed the Erika oil spill by completing most elements of the package, namely the rules on port state control, certification and checking of security measures and bringing forward the phasing out of single hull tankers.
The creation of an EU compensation fund for oil spills is expected to be finalised by 2003.
We are constantly putting as much pressure as we can on Member States for a better implementation of the habitats directive in the marine environment as completely and as soon as possible.
Finally, as you have already had the opportunity to study our communication on sustainable aquaculture, you may have noticed how much our intended policy in the area takes into account environmental protection requirements.
As far as fisheries agreements are concerned, you will soon have an opportunity to confirm that the Commission shares your environmental concerns. The announced communication on partnership agreements will be presented shortly.
Generally speaking, the Commission is on your side regarding the main resolutions of the report.
However, I wish to comment on several statements in the explanatory memorandum.
Firstly, while I recognise the shortcomings of scientific advice, I strongly disagree that this is the main problem of fisheries management.
We all know that the main problem is too many fishermen chasing too few fish.
Secondly, the rapporteur states that it is the Commission is pursuing a policy of capacity reduction.
As I have said before on many occasions, this is simply not correct.
It is not correct, either, that the Commission has proposed the abolition of public aid for modernisation of the fleet.
Finally, I would not agree that industrial fishing has a much greater environmental impact per euro added value than fisheries for human consumption, mainly because I find it odd to measure environmental impact against monetary units, but also because the environmental impact of this kind of fishing has yet to be determined.
To sum up, I do not agree totally with the form but will support the substance of the report and in particular the motion for a resolution.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done and to thank him for this.
Next, I should like clearly to emphasise that reform of the common fisheries policy must be based upon the sustainable development of fisheries.
The sustainability in question must be defensible from an environmental point of view and be conceived in both economic and social terms.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the Commission's proposals for reform, which contain a number of features aimed at sustainability and, therefore, the balance needed if the stock of fish is to be adjusted to the existing number of fishing vessels.
We would remind you that it is very important to secure the fishermen's understanding for, without that and without cooperation with the fishermen, we shall not be able to achieve the necessary results.
In that connection, we must respect the fact that fishermen all around the EU attend to their tasks in different ways.
It is absolutely crucial to the common fisheries policy that decisions be made on the basis of very clear scientific data.
The Commission must gather this data from the Member States and, at the same time, have the necessary technical and, especially, human administrative and supervisory resources available to it.
We should also very much like to emphasise that the EU must participate more in the development of the international fisheries policy.
It is important for our third-country agreements to be given a central place in this connection.
Madam President, I could almost echo the words of the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Busk, when he states that fisheries policy is, above all, a matter of international treaties and everything that takes place outside these.
If we consider the maritime environment - and I am also speaking here in the capacity of shadow rapporteur for Mr Souchet's report, whom I should at any rate like to warmly congratulate on his report and the balanced way in which he has presented it - it appears that, where the implementation of environmental requirements in the fisheries policy is concerned, only a very small proportion is determined by fisheries policy.
It struck me that the Commissioner said that if we consider the problem from different angles, then what it comes down to is that there are too few fish and too many fishermen.
I wonder if, with regard to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, this situation is so cut and dried, particularly in the light of the recent disaster with an oil tanker off the coast of Galicia.
If we consider the maritime area covered by European fishermen, then this is only a very small fraction of the total area in the world that is used for fishing.
As Mr Busk has already stated, this also means that it is of key importance for us to conclude sound treaties, particularly outside of the European Union, in order to find the right solution.
At the same time, the Committee on Fisheries and also my own group, of course, recognise the importance of the fishing environment, especially since the environment, including the maritime environment, is decisive for the fishing industry in terms of what can be caught.
This means that if the maritime environment is in a bad state, the fishing industry, in particular, will bear the brunt of this.
At the same time, this sector feels under pressure and the difficult bit is to strike the right balance between economic and ecological aspects.
It would be nice if the Commission's public statements gave more evidence of this very balance.
A properly motivated fisheries sector can contribute quite easily to a better maritime environment, and this also applies to the legislation needed for this.
On this score, I am pleased that Mr Souchet - and indeed the Stevenson report, which was formerly the Noriega report - devotes particular attention to aquaculture.
There are probably also good opportunities for Europe here, provided that we get the chance on this score to let legislation in this area run parallel with the economy on the one hand and ecology on the other from the word go.
I have to say that the Souchet report has been particularly well received in our group. We will therefore warmly advise Parliament to vote in favour of the report, assuming that, as the rapporteur has observed, it is essential to take sufficient account of the economic and social aspects of fishing in order to encourage the fisheries industry and environmental legislation.
I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on this.
Mr President, within the framework of the reform of the CFP which the Commission has decided to present to us in small doses, today we are debating the reports on the 'guideline' document and the protection of the environment.
I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on his excellent work because the environment is a fundamental aspect of the CFP, and fishing is the sector most affected by the attacks on the marine environment, as highlighted by the oil slick that is currently threatening the coasts of my region, Galicia.
We know little about the sea and the fragile situation of the resources cannot be explained entirely by over-fishing, as Mr Souchet has rightly said and as the oil slick caused off the coasts of Galicia by the oil tanker Prestige dramatically demonstrates.
I would like to believe that the fishermen and shellfishermen of my region are not going to face this terrible situation alone, but that Europe is going to show solidarity with them and that the European Commission will fully support them.
And I would like to say to the Commission that, since it presented these proposals in May, it has received sufficient messages from this Parliament, from the Council and from the sector to redirect this reform in a different way, bearing in mind that it will always have to be gradual, be provided with sufficient resources and be agreed with the sector, with the Member States and with this House.
I believe that the Commission is hearing this message.
It is a shame that in May, on presenting its proposals for the reform of the CFP, the Commission should have ignored the resolution approved by this Parliament in January on the Green Paper, in which this House urged it to present a proposal for reform to create a sustainable and more Community-focused CFP, in opposition to attempts at renationalisation; a CFP that is fairer, eliminating the discrimination against certain fleets, showing more solidarity and supporting regions dependent on fishing, basically by means of Community co-funding of the restructuring of the fleet.
Madam President, towards sustainability, that is the future of the fishing industry.
It is important not only to draft these reports, but also to consider aquaculture and safe conditions within the fishing industry.
It is unfortunate that the report was late, although this was followed by very fast work.
Truly impressive.
Further to the votes in the committee meetings, there are now sound reports before us.
Despite this, we should, in addition to the precautionary measures that need to be observed, also consider the situations we are facing.
ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, is keen to reduce the catch quota of flatfish even further, while the safe margin is in sight.
This cannot be completely justified.
We should, however, ensure that we do justice to historical catch rights in the new common fisheries policy; these should not be jeopardised.
Moreover, we should think very carefully about access to the seas.
I am, of course, thinking of the North Sea, but the point I am trying to make is that fishing unquoted species is dangerous, because quoted species are caught along with these.
It is at present extremely difficult to check whether the quoted species are left alone.
Should they be thrown overboard or taken somewhere?
It has in any event a huge impact on those keeping track of the quotas and is important for the valuable species.
In my view, this additional burden on the stocks is unacceptable, certainly if quotas were to dwindle even further.
People have already taken the pressure off on their own initiatives.
It will therefore be very difficult to sell this.
Policy and management are dependent on the support base within the sector.
In my view, we should prevent the sector from straying too far, and we will also need to involve it in creating and thinking of new solutions.
This is why it is also extremely important for control and sanctions to be harmonised at international level.
As for international fishing, I condemn unilateral measures, for they do not have a positive bearing on sustainable fish stocks.
My final comment is: thank you, rapporteurs who have written the reports.
I think that we have a sound basis to vote on this report in Parliament.
Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Souchet for his excellent report, which also represents a good basis for the report I have subsequently been responsible for.
Topical events, such as the accident involving the Prestige, make what I want to say about the report by Mr Souchet much more relevant.
With regard to the report taken on by Mr Stevenson, I believe it has been the victim of various procedural problems.
This report should have represented the reference framework for Parliament's position on the reform of the fisheries policy, and it is surprising, and only attributable to procedural problems, that this report differs in many respects from what we have subsequently done on approving the legislative proposals in the Committee on Fisheries.
There is no doubt that the problems stem from a Commission proposal which arrived late, which has turned out to be perhaps a little immature, and which furthermore was incomplete at the outset.
For example, the main package has been presented while lacking certain important sections, such as fishing in the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, there are very clear indications that the Commission's proposals, in structural terms, lack a reasonable basis and at times verge on the absurd.
With regard to the policy on the conservation of resources, I will resist anticipating a later debate, which we are going to hold.
However, I would like to express a certain distaste at the way we have dealt with this issue.
For some time, the fishing policy has established a division between States, and the Commission's proposal has been accompanied by a scenario which has accentuated that separation between States.
Perhaps certain Ministers have taken part in this game, but that is not the important thing.
What is really important is that the situation of the populations of cod, hake and other species has blurred the distinction between what have been known as the 'friends of fishing' and the 'friends of the fish'.
I believe that, however many debates we have held and however many issues may legitimately divide us, it is clear that we must resolve the problem of how to guarantee sustainable fishing.
To this end, I believe it is necessary to deal with fundamental issues, transcending what I would call very specific and overly national interests.
We could perhaps have left behind the rigid positions which have divided us - the distribution of quotas for example - and we could have reformed the Community policy, protecting sections of the fleet which most of the economy of the regions dependent on fishing rely on.
Madam President, it is not by chance that the reform of the CFP is being undertaken in 2002.
We must adopt it now precisely because, in accordance with their Accession Agreements of 1986, the transitional period established for the Spanish State and for Portugal are about to expire.
From now on, therefore, these States must have the same rights in Community waters as the nine Member States that established the common fisheries policy at the start of the 1980s.
Despite these obvious statements, Madam President, a majority in the Committee on Fisheries refused, in a totally unacceptable decision, to grant the Spanish and the Portuguese equal rights.
The new CFP ought to acknowledge that the fleets of the fifteen Member States all have the same rights, thereby putting an end to the privileges and discriminations between the citizens, fleets and countries of the European Union.
This pro-European - and I must say also Galician - position that my country has adopted inspired the report that I had the honour of drafting on the policies to be implemented for the reform of the CFP.
Nor did we reject temporary restrictions based solely on the need to conserve fish stocks being established or maintained in this equal treatment of access to Community waters.
We argued for the need to review or, where necessary, replace the principle of relative stability with a principle that is fairer and more consistent with the Treaties in this field.
We argued for international fisheries policy and also joint ventures to be strengthened, and for public aid from the European Union for investment intended to improve conditions on board ships, which are currently very poor, to be maintained.
For these and other reasons rejected by a majority in the committee, I cannot accept the report that now bears the name of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
The report nevertheless upholds some principles with which I agree, which survived the destructive offensive against the amendments tabled and adopted by the majority.
This means that dialogue and a new compromise on the part of everyone where the reform of the CFP is concerned are still possible.
In any event, they are still necessary.
Madam President, I fundamentally disagree with many of the aspects of the European Commission's proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy.
However, it is true that a more balanced approach is needed.
The current COM on fisheries policy has not been a success.
It has not done any favours - and in some cases has been discriminatory - to Irish fishermen.
The opportunity must not be missed to redress the current imbalance during this reform process.
That is what Irish fishermen are asking for at the moment, and that is what I am asking for.
One of the issues which is currently being discussed relates to the issue of access to the Irish Box.
The Spanish Government, for example, is claiming that it is entitled from next January to even greater access to the Irish fishing waters.
This simply cannot be allowed to happen.
It would have absolutely disastrous consequences for Irish fishermen, their families and Irish fishing communities.
Fish stocks in the Irish Sea at the present time are at a precariously low level.
Opening up our waters to more Spanish vessels than is presently allowed will only result in a decimation of our stocks.
The Irish Sea is a biologically very sensitive area.
It is the spawning ground for many of our fish species.
Only last week Parliament's Committee on Fisheries passed an amendment stating clearly that fish balances shall not be disturbed in western waters and therefore it is in this context that relative stability must be understood.
We must protect fishing regions where our fish stocks are under threat and the Irish Box and the Irish Sea is one such region.
The last thing we want is to have our waters opened up to more effort by Spanish fishermen, or indeed any other fishermen.
We need to protect our fish stocks and not decimate them.
Any new conservation measures which are introduced at European Union level must be brought about in consultation with all interested parties involved in all Member States in order to protect what is a very valuable natural resource for all of us.
Madam President, it is on record that the outline regulations on the common fisheries policy were not agreed until eight hours after the Community had opened the accession negotiations with the United Kingdom in 1971.
The head of the British delegation, Sir Con O'Neil, remarked that these two events were not unconnected.
Prior to that there had hardly been any interest in a Community fisheries policy because the founding six had virtually no fishing resources.
Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway all had rich coastal fisheries and they had been kept in good condition by effective conservation measures.
O'Neil attests to this; experts from the British Ministry of Agriculture produced a report showing that British waters were literally teeming with fish, whilst there were very few within the fishing limits of the present Community countries.
The main evidence for this is that Community waters did not attract foreign fishermen, while British waters most certainly did.
After 30 years of the CFP, Britain's waters no longer teem with fish.
To paraphrase Sir Con: 'These two events are not unconnected'.
Yet still members of the Committee on Fisheries seem unable to make the connection.
They call for more technical and human resources.
They want more money for research.
They want management plants, sustainable development, integrated policies, multiannual plans, the application of the precautionary principle and, wait for it, target reference points for biomass and fishing mortality.
If jargon were the solution, Member State waters would still be teeming with fish, the CFP would be a world-beater.
But all that jargon does is to hide an uncomfortable truth: the common fisheries policy has not worked, does not work and cannot work no matter how much reform is dressed up in flowery words.
As long as fish are considered to be a common European resource, there will be no sense of ownership or responsibility.
Predatory fishing becomes the norm. It is an inevitable consequence of the policy and leads to the depletion of stocks.
Reform is not the solution.
The CFP cannot be reformed.
It has proved to be incapable of reform.
It should be scrapped and fisheries should be managed once again by national governments.
Madam President, I am beginning my speech in this debate on fisheries very moved, as you know, by the events that have taken place in Galicia.
I remember that, while I was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the tragic accident involving the Erika took place, and our committee put an oral question and adopted a resolution.
At that point we were all united, and I hope we are in this case as well.
I would like to stress - and you know this - that Galicia is the region most dependent on fishing in the whole of Europe and is extraordinarily rich in seafood and fish, which, following the Prestige accident, is going to take many years to recover, above all in the areas most directly affected by the oil slick.
I am going to prepare a motion for a resolution and I believe that the political groups must be united, so that this House can issue a political opinion, so that events of this type never happen again.
I believe that we have a very important political responsibility.
It is terrible to see fishing resources covered in petrol, dead sea birds and the fishermen who live exclusively from the sea.
Sometimes over-fishing is discussed but these issues are not.
I believe it is very important to bear it in mind and I hope, as I have said, that all our colleagues will show solidarity.
With regard to the reports before the plenary, there has been no mention of the Busk report, and I would like to congratulate him, because there is no need for either a debate or for amendments since we have all agreed on the issue of illegal fishing and also the fight against it; it is therefore important to point it out.
I believe that the report by Mr Souchet has worked out well.
It is a reasonable and positive report, and there are no amendments to it in this House either.
With regard to the report by Mr Stevenson, everybody knows what happened and I am not going to go into details; today we are dealing with the report which carries the name of the chairman of our committee.
I would simply say to you that my political group has presented certain minimal amendments; we have tried to clear up certain issues.
I would like to say, and I say this in general, that we are dealing with a communication. In other words, we are not dealing with a legislative document, but the report by Mr JovÃ© will be, and we will examine that report during the next part-session.
I hope that we can focus all our efforts and use the balanced approach indicated here, in order to adopt the commitments in this report, which will have to be debated, as I have said, at the next part-session in Brussels.
With regard to the amendments we have presented, we have tried to remove the word 'permanent' from the twelve miles, because the Legal Services of the Council and the European Parliament, as well as the Commission, accept that, since it is a derogation from the Treaty, it cannot be permanent, because that would amount to a modification of the Treaty itself.
Therefore, it is simply a measure that requires a time limit.
Since we are not in agreement on whether it is five, ten, fifteen or twenty years, we have simply asked that we may adopt an agreement on this during the debate on the JovÃ© report.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the common fisheries policy has made some at times majestic waves of argument.
Some of the arguments are reasonable and justified, whereas others are hasty and disproportionate.
The reform of the common fisheries policy is necessary, and no sensible person would deny this.
The depletion of fish stocks is not a fantasy or an exaggeration by ecologists, by those seeking to protect marine life or by pessimistic scientists.
It is a tragic reality for many species.
In the past, we also saw the collapse of some population units, but it was then possible to rebuild them by shifting the fishing effort to other species and to other latitudes.
Today, this is all but impossible.
The example of the collapse of the Newfoundland cod banks, the source of so much history and so much legend in Portugal, my own country, should serve as a warning to us.
Of the more than 35 000 species that populate the seas, only one hundred are of commercial and consumer interest.
This is a fact!
Today, however, we are seeing an impoverishment of biological diversity in the marine environment and the gradual destruction of habitats and ecosystems.
The situation has reached this disturbing point not only as a result of the pressure exerted by fishing; but other well known reasons have also contributed to this phenomenon.
Fishing is now subject to a dual requirement: the ecological requirement to preserve fish stocks and the political and social requirement to maintain the economic activities of the maritime fishing sector.
These activities must, therefore, pay close attention to the state of stocks and not be undertaken in a predatory way or in the form of simple hunting and gathering, as if we were still living in the Stone Age.
Linking the Souchet report on the Community Action Plan to integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy with the Stevenson report on the reform of the CFP and the Busk report on monitoring and eradicating illegal fishing was, consequently, an inspired move.
The reform of the common fisheries policy must necessarily be a compromise that balances all strands: the social, the economic, the cultural and the ecological.
Those Members who are most in favour - as they claim - of fishing, should therefore be mindful of the de la Palissian truism: without fish, there can be no fishing.
Madam President, I also support the report by Mr Souchet and am extremely sorry to see the pollution caused by the oil tanker in Galicia.
With regard to the Stevenson report, although it is somewhat contradictory, it does take account of many of the proposals and positions that we called for and which are important to Portugal, specifically the installation of 12-mile coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP, the participation of fishermen's organisations in the decision-making process, socio-economic measures to compensate for the effects of the reform, which must take account of past efforts, greater investment in research and ensuring that there is no legal vacuum.
Two of our proposals that we felt were of the utmost importance were also accepted: the extension of the derogation concerning free access to 50 miles in the case of the most remote regions, as laid down in the Treaty, and strengthening the support mechanisms for the processing industry, specifically the canning industry.
Nevertheless, we disagree with the proposals that are intended to change the report, with some that were rejected in the Committee on Fisheries and which run counter to the positions and proposals that we tabled once again being adopted.
We shall, however, be voting in favour of the proposal which is comparable to an amendment of ours, which is of enormous importance to Portugal, and which has already been adopted in the other report, stating that the six-twelve mile zones should be maintained and defined as a feature of the common fisheries policy, for an unlimited period of time, in order to promote conservation and to encourage the local development of small-scale fishing.
Madam President, I want to begin by saying that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Commission's proposals for reforming the common fisheries policy.
The measures and proposals presented should have come about a very long time ago.
That is why they are now absolutely necessary.
The only thing we are doubtful about and see problems with is the Commission's proposal concerning the possibility of reducing the fishing fleets by means of the simple 'one boat in, one boat out' proposal.
I do not really understand how that could work and how it could possibly lead to our obtaining a smaller fishing fleet.
I can also understand the Commission's frustration in view of the difficulties in getting the Council and the Member States to accept their responsibility.
For so many years, ministers and the Council have failed to see the connection between fisheries policy and a reduced access to fish.
They have taken no responsibility at all for sustainable development and for ensuring that fish stocks are preserved, this being the only possible way of rescuing the fishing industry.
Where, for example, the Irish Sea is concerned, a quota 28% higher than what researchers have considered to be acceptable has been permitted over the last ten years.
In this context, it does not matter whether the fishing fleets come from Ireland or Spain or some other country.
I should therefore like to say that we now face our hour of destiny when it comes to fish stocks.
The Council has not wished to decide about restrictions on catch quotas, which have not been at all realistic.
There have been no adequate supervisory programmes, and there has been no desire to place limits upon fishing fleets.
We already know that this is the cause of the whole problem.
What shall we do, therefore?
I think we must be able to adopt the Commission's proposals.
Sweden plans to introduce a unilateral moratorium on cod fishing in the Baltic.
That is in actual fact a demand made by the Greens/ALE Group in connection with the formation of a government.
Cod is threatened, not only in the Baltic but also in the Kattegat and throughout the North Sea.
The International Marine Research Council believes that the EU's reconstruction plan is entirely inadequate and that the situation is urgent.
We must therefore adopt measures as drastic as introducing a moratorium.
I now hope that the Commission will support this proposal.
I also assume that the Commission will, as soon as possible, respond positively to the possibility of using the structural funds for compensation, for that is completely in line with the Commission's own proposal about the possibility of acting responsibly to safeguard and preserve fish stocks in the future too.
Madam President, I wanted to comment briefly on the report by Mr Stevenson.
I welcome the fact that it calls for the system of access to waters and resources to be maintained as well as the fundamental principle of relative stability.
I regret, however, that the original proposal by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, who wanted to re-focus attention on the economic and social dimension of the common fisheries policy and, therefore, study it at the same time as the issue of fishing effort, has not been retained.
What struck me is that the proposal by the European Commission on the roadmap on reform of the common agricultural policy reflects the lack of priority that the latter gives to the social impact of its plan since this impact only features in seventh place in the list of proposed measures.
As for the Commission communication of 6 November on the measures intended to soften the impact of the reform, it confirms the plan to do away with 28 000 jobs over three years, between 2003 and 2006, due to the mass scrapping of vessels as predicted by the Commission.
We are naturally waiting for an appropriate time to question the Commission on these dramatic figures, Madam President, which will be when we study this communication.
Madam President, it is unfortunate that we have had to make substantial alterations to the Souchet and Nogueira reports.
The whole scenario is depressing enough already: here we are, sitting in a warm room and endlessly talking, not only with each other but often, alas, at odds with each other.
Out there, though, our environmental accidents and overfishing are making conditions catastrophic for more and more fish stocks.
In here, or so it seems, we prefer to stonewall rather than work on a genuine reform, and the image of the European Union suffers.
We should start by sorting out our own environment, and do it at once.
The Commission proposals may have been late in landing on the table, but they got there well before the summer.
Now that the first snows are falling, we are talking; but it is only today that we are discussing the timetable for the reform, which is due to enter into force on 1 January of next year, which is only a few weeks away.
Quite apart from the Gallic bias of its content, this timetable started out as a tall order in linguistic terms.
By dint of great efforts and 258 amendments, the Committee on Fisheries was then able to make the timetable readable with a view to genuine reform.
It is curious, though, to take one example, that the committee voted to safeguard the twelve nautical mile zone - and now I am supposed to vote against it on Wednesday!
That I will not do.
Am I a puppet; are we marionettes?
Granted, we all want to be re-elected.
Is that why the spirits invoked by the Committee on Fisheries have proved so remarkably changeable?
We all know that without fish, the fishing industry will die out.
What this is about is protecting the fleet and protection of resources, which are fundamental principles; there can be no deviation from them and no softening-up of them.
I want the fisheries industry to be economically successful, socially balanced, and to make sense in environmental terms.
We have to face reality and cannot set sail in an ever-increasing fleet in search of the mirage of stocks that last for ever.
I appeal to my fellow-MEPs to break free of their national interests and support me in maintaining our fish stocks!
Madam President, I would like to begin by echoing the comments made by my fellow Members from Galicia and to say that I shall support all their initiatives.
My region was affected by the Amoco Cadiz and Erika disasters; their region has been struck by the sinking of the Prestige, but the ship's name does nothing to ease the problems of those living in the region and of the Galician fishermen.
Commissioner, the conception of the new fisheries policy is problematic but the fledgling policy is due to come into force on the evening of 31 December.
I think that the Committee on Fisheries has worked hard to restore a balance between the exploitation of fishery resources and the protection of these resources for future generations, without forgetting the economy of coastal regions.
In any case, we are seeking a better balance between these two areas than that put forward in your proposals, one that corresponds to sustainable development in the correct sense of the word.
This applies, of course, to fish stocks, where this balance is needed, but it also concerns coastal economies.
And we tried to draw your attention, in these three reports and in others, to the implications of the political decisions regarding employment in regions that are dependent on fishing, to the consequences of scrapping boats, since of course, if we scrap them and fish levels increase in the future, there may not be any fishermen left to fish them.
We must keep our heads.
We must also ensure that our fishermen do not use boats that are too old, which they make last longer and that they overload with equipment, thus running all kinds of risks.
Our committee, in all its debates and through its rapporteurs, is seeking to influence the final decisions of the Commission and the Council.
Of course, there are good decisions and we should highlight them, such as controls and sanctions, involving the relevant parties in the decision-making processes, improving knowledge of fishing techniques and resources.
In short, if all this is done, if the balance is maintained, our fishermen will be able to continue to have faith in their work, in their business and we in our regions.
Madam President, the management of EU fisheries is at an important juncture with key stocks in the North Sea and elsewhere in decline and the future of fishing and fish processing industries therefore under threat.
So it is essential that the Commission gets it right, proposing a management system which ensures sustainable fisheries backed up by up-to-date independent and verifiable scientific evidence involving stakeholders and installing confidence in the system.
However, as the first set of CFP reform proposals nears a conclusion, I find myself more cynical about the process and less optimistic about the future for Scotland's fishing-dependent communities than ever before.
Why should this be so?
Is a workable EU fisheries policy achievable?
I have always believed that the only way to succeed in achieving the necessary balance between resource, harvesting and conservation and to better encourage compliance with any management regime is to have a regime with which the stakeholders can have some faith.
That is why I have welcomed the Commission's support for regional advisory councils as a step in the right direction, towards a much-needed new and better way of doing things.
Actions, however, have to accompany words and I have been shocked by the attitude displayed by the Commission recently in relation to cod and other white fish quotas for next year.
To announce the possible closure of the Scots fishing industry with the 'we know best' and 'it's all your own fault' statements attributed to Commissioner Fischler seems to fly in the face of the stated intention to involve stakeholders more.
This 'tough guy' approach, presumably designed to make the actual outcome for next year seem relatively palatable, should have no place in a new CFP.
The sad truth is that irreparable damage has been done by the Commission in the last six months to the Scottish confidence in Europe being capable of managing fisheries at all.
With Mr Fischler's about-turn on deep-water management, followed by the insensitive presentation of the ICES's advice on cod and its repercussions for Scotland, it is little wonder that conspiracy theories abound.
Does Commissioner Fischler want to be remembered as the architect of a new and successful EU fisheries policy? Or the one who brought desolation to communities and destruction to a way of life?
Sadly at this moment, he seems to me more likely to achieve the latter.
I and the leadership of the Scottish fishing industry have played a constructive role, working with environmental organisations in the consultative process towards CFP reform.
I would like to see the Commission and the Council taking due account of that and giving some return and not penalising the Scots for their efforts.
This Parliament report on the reform of the CFP remedies some of the shortcomings in the Commission proposal, but is remiss with regard to others.
With regard to its positive points, I would highlight three main aspects:
the first is that sustainable fisheries management must be based on a balanced range of measures, not only on the simplistic solution of fleet reduction, but also on a greater selection of fishing methods, on the proper use of the MAGPs and of the TACs and quotas.
Most of all, the recommendation that in any reduction of the fishing effort, lower targets are set for Member States that have already undertaken fleet reduction;
the second aspect is the clear recommendation that fisheries agreements with third countries, which, if properly implemented are of mutual convenience for both parties, must continue to be an integral part of the CFP.
For this reason, it is right that ships removed from the Community fleet can continue to be included in fleets belonging to joint ventures;
the third aspect is the desire to find a specific solution to the problem of access to the waters of the outermost regions, which have very delicate balances and ecosystems, such as the Azores, the Island of Madeira and other regions in the European Union.
The aspect that I feel is most negative is the report's total omission of the structural component.
There are two main reasons for not changing the rules laid down at the Berlin European Council on the funding of fisheries structures.
The first is that fleet modernisation is in itself a priority matter, because otherwise the Community fleet will become uncompetitive: where Portugal is concerned, 40% of our fleet is over 25 years old and therefore, unless it receives support, it will be unviable.
The second reason is that since appropriations were set in Berlin for fleet modernisation by 2007 and since various ship owners have placed orders on this basis, it is politically unacceptable to now change the rules in mid-stream.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are no doubt all agreed that the common fisheries policy needs to be reformed, but great differences become apparent as soon as discussion turns to the detailed modalities of reform.
These have to do not only with how we assess the situation, which is at present, indeed, not exactly rosy, but also with what measures are to be taken.
We even take different views of the scientific investigations into our resources, as shown by the report on our timetable, which we are discussing this evening, and I imagine that discussions in the Council of Ministers are just as animated as our own in Parliament.
As Europe's Parliament, though, we should be concentrating on the points of fact and attempting to play an active part in fashioning a reform whose prime objective will be to maintain fishery resources.
We are talking about the precautionary principle, and cuts, painful though they may be, are probably necessary to secure sustainable management of fish stocks and hence the long-term survival of fishery as a whole.
The social component of the measures we are to decide on, however, plays a key role in this.
I therefore call on all Members of this House, as well as the Fisheries Ministers, to fulfil their responsibility for fishery as a whole in the European Union and to distance themselves from myopic national interests when deciding what shape the reform is to take.
We should not now let the great opportunity pass to decide on a fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy.
We have to make use of this opportunity, or else the prospects for our fisheries in Europe will, in the foreseeable future, be bleak indeed.
That this is so is already demonstrated very clearly by the current state of cod stocks in the North Sea, and I hope that will be a lesson to us.
Madam President, we make this subject sound very complicated but for me it boils down to two questions: how much fish can we take, and who can take them?
If we could agree on those two questions, we would have an amicable solution to all the other questions that arise.
I do not agree with those who say that the common fisheries policy is responsible for the present state of stocks.
The reason the stocks are in their present state is because the scientists were not heeded.
When the Commission took the scientists' message to the Council of Ministers it was not heeded and its advice was not put into effect.
I do not agree with the present policy, but within its framework stocks could have been conserved if the advice of the Commission had been taken through the years.
The other problem with the common fisheries policy is that on the one hand the Commission has the responsibility but can merely give advice.
The Council of Ministers and the individual states are the people with the ultimate responsibility.
There is a lot of evidence that in the past they did not discharge their responsibility, without fear or favour, in a manner which ensured that every fisherman took what he was entitled to take and every ship got its quota and no more.
The common fisheries policy goes too far.
There was never any need to take fish into common ownership.
It does not make sense.
We have a common agricultural policy.
It does not give me the right or an Irish farmer the right to pick grapes or olives in the south of Spain.
It does not give us the right to harvest forests in Finland or Sweden.
Neither should the common fisheries policy include the common ownership of stocks.
It makes no sense.
As far as I know, nevertheless, there is only one country which loses out and gets less than its natural share.
You will not find a more convinced European integrationist than I am, so I can say that there is one region in the Union, the west of Ireland, that does not get its natural share.
I have no special quarrel with the Spanish, French or British fishermen who come into what are natural waters.
However, in other areas - oil and minerals - and in every form of jurisdiction Member States have over their oceans, natural resources fall within the remit of the national governments.
That should also apply to fish.
It would make a lot more sense.
Madam President, the CFP has totally failed.
It has not maintained the fishing stocks or fishermen's jobs.
Discarding nearly two million tonnes of healthy fish each year is absolutely ridiculous.
Fish do not swim separately in the sea.
They swim together and the sooner we work that out the better.
The 6- and 12-mile limits must be confirmed permanently.
I am not convinced by the argument that we cannot do it and I shall be voting firmly for the fact that these limits should be etched in stone.
Not only must those 6- and 12-mile limits be there, but they must be managed at a local level and properly devolved from Brussels, not just some token gesture.
If local fishermen have proper ownership of these waters, the conservation measures will work.
In the North Sea cod is disappearing.
Is it a coincidence that the cod are disappearing in the areas where the industrial fishing takes place?
We take out millions of tonnes of sand eels and scour the sea beds, and the cod eat sand eels.
It is not a coincidence.
We must do something about it.
Norway and Iceland have good fishing stocks and they are not part of the common fisheries policy.
Again, is this a coincidence?
I would agree here with Mr McCartin.
Do we need to make fishing resources part of the common fisheries policy?
I will say this quite bluntly: if the Commission cannot run the common fisheries policy properly, then send it back to the Member States and let them do it.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the recent tragedy involving the Prestige, I believe that these are worrying times for both the Galician fishermen, who are awaiting the Commission's response, and who do not want these terrible events to happen again anywhere, and for all good people who defend the environment and sustainable development.
I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Souchet and Mr Busk on the quality of their reports; and with regard to the report which in the end the chairman of the committee has taken charge of, I will comment on recital K and Amendment No 23.
The area reserved for traditional fishing within a band of 6 miles - which was subsequently increased to 12 and extended to all Member States - was extended, for the last time, within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy of 1992, for a period of ten years.
We have therefore been in a provisional situation for thirty years.
It appears that the aim was to allow for a progressive adaptation of the small-scale coastal fleet.
And if they have not carried it out, I do not know when they are going to do so.
The European Commission's proposal on the timetable for the reform of the common fisheries policy advocates permanently maintaining the prohibition of fishing within 12 miles - a proposal, by the way, whose legal validity has been called into question.
I believe that, at a time when we are facing enlargement and we have a Convention under way, paradoxically, this proposal would mark the beginning of a period of renationalisation of Community waters contrary to the principle of equal access for fishing vessels to all European Union stocks, which would also involve the additional risk of a possible future increase of this restricted area if it is adopted as a permanent exception.
Madam President, the Europeans in general and the people who live from the sea, in particular, will not understand why the waters are not communitarised, why we have this restriction - an exception to the principle of free access - why this sector is not being communitarised while the others are.
Therefore, from a strictly legal point of view, the establishment of a permanent exception should be ruled out forever.
I would like to encourage Members to vote against Recital K and Amendment No 23, which, in my humble opinion, are contrary to Community law and European common sense.
Madam President, thank you for extending the debate to give me a chance to get here and participate.
It took me 16 hours to travel here to Strasbourg today.
Two weeks ago I went to Hobart in Tasmania in less time than it takes to get to Strasbourg.
When I find out that part of the reason for the delay is reindeer running on the runway of the international airport in Strasbourg, I find that utterly incredible.
Firstly, I understand that during the debate a great deal of concern has been expressed about the wreck of the Prestige off the coast of Galicia.
I hope that from what has been said in this debate my colleagues will agree with me that we should be calling for the Commission and the EU institutions to take all possible steps to aid Galicia in dealing with this horrendous problem.
The newspapers in Scotland today were calling it the 'Costa del muerte' and saying that 3 000 tonnes of oil had already been spilled.
I understand that the tanker contained 70 000 tonnes of oil and the idea of a spillage on that scale is absolutely horrifying.
We are dealing here with a debate in which you have heard Mr Parish expressing a great deal of anger.
You have heard Mr Hudghton also expressing anger from a Scottish perspective.
Part of this debate deals with the Commission's roadmap.
I should say at the outset that the recent scientific advice from ICES, which recommends the complete closure of the whitefish sector in the UK and Ireland, points to the fact that to have a roadmap is superfluous.
As far as the common fisheries policy is concerned we are on the road to nowhere.
What is the use of debating future fisheries policy in this Chamber tonight if for British and Irish fishermen there is no future?
What is the point of discussing multi-annual management plans if tax and quotas in the North Sea, the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea and the Kattegat are to be set at zero for at least the next five years?
What an indictment of the common fisheries policy!
What a sorry state of affairs that after 20 years of failed policies we are now looking at the destruction of an industry that is as old as mankind itself.
In the name of conservation our fishermen have been forced to dump millions of tonnes of prime fish back into the sea dead to comply with the lunatic quota scheme.
In the name of conservation our fishermen have suffered tie-ups, lay-offs, emergency closures, decommissioning, job losses and plunging incomes and now the message from the scientists appears to be that everything they have advised in the past has failed - all the technical conservation measures, all the increased mesh sizes, the square mesh panels to allow young cod to escape, all the emergency closures of cod spawning grounds, the 40 000 square miles of the North Sea closed for 12 weeks last year without one penny of compensation paid to the fishermen, the three years in a row that the Irish Sea has been closed for cod fishing, the massive decommissioning round that took over 100 demersal vessels out of the Scottish fleet alone.
All of these measures recommended by the scientists and ordered by the Commission have apparently failed.
It beggars belief.
There is no place in the common fisheries policy for our roadmap if 20 000 fishermen, fish processors and harbour workers are facing the closure of their industry and the loss of their jobs.
There is no justification for closing the whole whitefish sector.
Seven hundred thousand tonnes of cod were caught in the Northeast Atlantic last year.
That does not sound like a species on the verge of collapse.
Tens of thousands of big mature cod are being caught around the Faroes and Iceland where they have no CFP.
If the cod have migrated northwards due to global warming, pollution or the North Atlantic drift, then no amount of draconian measures will make them return.
It is true the cod have gone from the central part of the North Sea.
Nobody is disputing that.
But their place has been taken by prawns, now one of the biggest fisheries around the British Isles.
We know that cod is a key predator of prawns so it is not surprising that when the cod decline the prawns thrive.
But it is also a fact that prawns feed on cod larvae, so once the cod have gone they may never return.
That has certainly been the case in Canada.
I do not accept that the possible recovery of cod stocks is in any way an adequate justification for the sacrifice of the prawn, haddock, whiting, plaice, and flatfish fisheries.
Nor do I accept that there are anything like sufficient funds in the budget to even meet a fraction of the likely socio-economic impact costs which this catastrophic proposal implies.
So there is no point in discussing a roadmap tonight.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for not having been able to be here earlier.
I was given three explanations over a period of time: one was that there were goats on the runway; another, that there were deer on it; and we were told on one occasion that it was occupied by reindeer.
We were also told that there was fog, so it was obviously difficult to identify the animals involved.
I do not wish to repeat what my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne has already told you about the report that has been under discussion.
He has enlarged upon what had to be done in consequence of the great and pestilential amount of oil to which, unfortunately, Galicia has fallen victim.
It is no doubt evident to all that this is a challenge to Europe.
You will be aware that a plan exists, one that the Commission submitted some considerable time ago in connection with the 'Erika' disaster, and which also includes an approach to implementation to which my fellow-Commissioner Mrs de Palacio is giving her very close attention.
There is also, associated with this approach, a certain plan for compensation, which is to be put into action in the year ahead.
Let me first, though, state my position on the report by Mr Stevenson, to whom I would like to start by expressing my thanks for its drafting.
I would also like to thank the Committee on Fisheries, which has made really great efforts to keep to the tight timetable and enable us to decide on the reform of the common fisheries policy by the end of the year.
I believe that Parliament and the Commission are largely agreed on the fundamental objectives that we have in mind in the fisheries reform, and I am glad that they support the fundamental objectives of the reform.
Whilst it is about sustainability, it is also about the sector's competitiveness.
It has to do with decent living conditions for all who work in the fishery industry, and in just the same way it involves linking in environmental concerns and, as a primary concern, new ways of managing fishery resources.
I am glad that you support this fundamental approach, even though we no doubt have different views concerning the means we choose to achieve these objectives.
Let me return to a number of specific points.
You quite rightly call for better information concerning the state of stocks, and more investment in scientific research into stock development.
The Commission has at present a total of EUR 35 million at its disposal for the purposes of research into the fisheries sector.
It is with regret that I have to tell you that these resources will be reduced somewhat over the coming years, but, in the context of fisheries research as a whole, we are prepared to inject more funds for the specific purpose of researching the state of stocks and the way they are developing.
In addition to that, we also want to do more research with alternative technical measures, such as the development of new fishing gear, in mind.
But let us be honest: research can be based only on accurate data that has been carefully collected.
Not the least significant factor underlying our present dilemma with regard to cod is what we have been told by scientists - scientists appointed not by the Commission, but by the Member States.
In these matters, the Commission has only the status of an observer.
The scientists tell us, though, that in the past, reports of landings and on the composition of catches were sometimes quite simply not accurate, and that misreporting had therefore led to the wrong conclusions being drawn.
I do not want to level accusations at anyone right now, but we must at least acknowledge that this is a problem we also have to solve if we want to come to better conclusions.
Your resolutions on the subject of stock maintenance and fishery management coincide with our approach.
Fishery management needs frameworks that are tailor-made for it and that will last for years.
These frameworks have to be adapted to the fisheries, operations and stocks in each case and we have to adhere to the precautionary principle.
These frameworks also have to ensure that the minimum of fish are discarded.
However, Mr Stevenson, things are not so straightforward that we can only blame the imposition of quotas for the number of fish that are discarded.
There are other countries in the world, which have other approaches, impose no quotas and have a problem with discarded fish all the same.
That fish are continuing to be discarded in such a way has to do with all the essential components of fishery.
It certainly has a technical dimension in that fishing gear is not selective enough.
It is certainly a problem that, in mixed fishing, the quota for some stocks is reached faster than that for others, even leading to stocks being discarded when we do not want that at all.
There is, of course, exactly the same problem with limitation of the fishing effort.
If we do not achieve a certain balance of these essential, key elements of managing fishery at all, then we will never get anywhere.
You devote part of your report to the Mediterranean, and demonstrate thoroughness in doing so.
Here I am in full agreement with you that the Mediterranean has to be handled differently; that is what tailor-made approaches are all about.
The methods that work in the North Sea cannot be applied here: the fishery carried on in the Mediterranean, most of which is artisan in nature, makes the Mediterranean different.
It is different because of the narrowness of the continental shelf that is found there. It is different because of the far greater involvement of third states in fishing it.
It therefore demands a specific approach.
That is what we have put forward.
We also want to cooperate more with the third states that are active in the Mediterranean.
This means that we want to be very careful in preparing for enhanced cooperation, and plan to organise, in the second half of next year, a conference under the Italian Presidency, to which we will invite all the states bordering on the Mediterranean, and at which we will be putting forward ideas for joint management and, above all, for improving research.
On the subject of fleet management, let me just reiterate that it is simply not the case that fishermen are obliged to break up their boats.
Nobody has been able to produce evidence of it, and nowhere in our drafts is there the requirement that they should do so; all scrapping will be on a voluntary basis.
What we do want is that fishermen who actually want to do that should get better support from us than they have had in the past.
The decision, though, as to whether or not to scrap a vessel, is one that every fisherman will have to take for himself.
Access to waters and resources involves two issues.
I regard access to resources and waters in the outermost regions as a special case, which must therefore be dealt with accordingly.
We will investigate the situation in these regions, and will be making appropriate proposals before the end of the coming year.
The special restrictions on access to these regions are to remain in force until then.
The issue of access to the North Sea is primarily a legal question, as is that of whether the twelve-nautical-mile zone should be set up on a permanent basis or only for a limited period of time.
I would warn against simply saying that there will be a vote on it.
An arrangement without limit of time is what is needed.
The European Court of Justice will then rule on what is lawful.
I believe that we should rely primarily on the Treaty and that it, as in the past, should be the basis for any decision.
The fact is that the relevant provisions of Spain's and Portugal's accession treaties are due to expire, which will initially mean only that these states will also have access to northern waters.
I am very well aware that it is the discarding issue that rears its head here.
Specifically, the problem has to do with the fact that other species subject to a quota are also caught along with species subject neither to a TAC nor to a quota, so that there is the risk of fish being caught and being thrown back into the sea, despite being in themselves very valuable.
We will have to do some in-depth work on this issue, and are ready to do so.
I would also like to say something about the question of monitoring and the implementation of fisheries legislation.
I believe that it remains a matter of importance that I re-emphasise that we absolutely need the sector to be involved, which means that the new advisory councils are actually the basis of our future improved cooperation with the sector.
It stands to reason that there is no doubt that we will see to it that the agreed sanctions, controls and inspections are actually implemented throughout the EU and in the same manner.

There are many other issues that I might discuss, but I want to address only one of them - fisheries in the waters of third countries, in regard to which we are working on a communication on fisheries partnerships with third countries, which we will be adopting at the beginning of December.
In this communication, you will find much of what you have called for, examples including adherence to the precautionary principle, the justified demands of developing countries for the development of their own fisheries sector, more efficient supervision, and so on. This, I believe, is where we have to go down a new road.
There must be no doubt about the fact that we will have to keep on fighting for this mischief with flags of convenience to stop, and, above all, for illegal fishing to be curbed.
I fully endorse what you have to say on aquaculture, and I therefore want to express my gratitude for it.
One point - the social issue - remains to be cleared up.
If you look at how much public money has been spent to date on social measures, and how much we intend to spend on social measures in future, it will become clear that this reform very definitely has a social dimension.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Madam President, Commissioner, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the committee, I would imagine, the two related reports before us this evening have been prepared with undue haste. Their quality is certainly not in keeping with the legal traditions of Europe and its Member States.
The two reports focus in particular on the approximation of laws on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property.
They specifically concern the possibility of extensive powers of confiscation, in other words the confiscation not so much and not only of the proceeds of the crime itself but also of all the other property in the possession of a person sentenced to a very long prison sentence who cannot prove that the property is of lawful origin.
This part of the report, Commissioner Vitorino, was deleted by the committee, and what remains is therefore the possibility of confiscating crime-related proceeds.
However, a framework decision is not necessary to achieve this result in the European Community, for the legislation of almost all the European countries provides for the compulsory confiscation of crime-related proceeds or, at least, makes this possible.
Precisely in order to overcome the committee's difficulties in accepting the inversion of the onus of proof - Amendment No 11, amending Article 3(1) - I suggested, by means of an amendment which is very reminiscent of the Italian legislation on the subject, the possibility of confiscating additional property - the property subject precisely to extended powers of confiscation - only where the prosecution has proved that the property possessed is disproportionate to the activity pursued or, in any case, exceeds the person's income as declared for tax purposes.
The person convicted would then have the chance to prove the lawful origin of the property.
The provisions were therefore toned down but the onus of proof not actually inverted.
The committee was disconcerted, surprised, confused by this, and therefore rejected my amendment.
I therefore call upon the House to adopt this amendment, for this is the only way to include in the legislation extensive powers of confiscation, which is one of the goals of the proposal and, in my opinion, also a useful tool for combating organised crime. It is based on a dual principle.
The prosecution has to prove that the person's property is disproportionate: in other words, it has to prove that the value of the property exceeds the person's real activities and their income as declared for tax purposes, while the person convicted has the option to prove that this property is of lawful origin.
If, however, the report remains in the form adopted by the committee, it will be absolutely useless, for - I stress - the European countries already have similar legislation in place and do not need a European Parliament framework decision.
Madam President, Commissioner, unlike our esteemed rapporteur - the basic approach of whose text I do, however, appreciate - I am convinced that our work is neither superfluous nor useless.
It is an appeal, a valuable reminder precisely for all the Member States, which are called to harmonise their legislation or, in any case, cooperate in the field of justice, in this very sensitive area - the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property - too.
It is without a doubt an important instrument because, as we know from daily experience, it is that instrument which will strike at the financial sources supporting organised crime, particularly crime organised on an international scale.
At the centre of this fight is the fight against what is known as money laundering between the international organisations, which now know no bounds either in Europe or worldwide.
I want to tell you something which the unforgettable Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, said, which is relevant to this aspect of the matter. As you will remember, he was subsequently assassinated by the Mafia.
At a hearing, ten years ago now, he said: the Mafia have not waited for the completion of the internal market to internationalise their activity.
That is why it is important to provide an international response to this internationalisation of crime from those in charge of the legal systems in the Member States.
It must be said that, in this, we have been preceded by both the United Nations and the Council of Europe, which have produced conventions which are a valuable point of reference for the subject we are debating too.
It must also be said, however, that the proper legislative basis is the action plan endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 and drawn on by the Vienna European Council of December 1998.
These action plans specify the procedures for implementing international confiscation measures, which are, clearly, intended to supplement the various national measures.
The Council stresses the importance of each Member State- and I quote from the Council text - 'having well-developed and wide ranging legislation in the field of confiscation of the proceeds from crime' and of 'introducing special procedures for tracing, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime'.
As regards the debate on Mr Di Lello's report in committee, we tabled a number of amendments which were all adopted by the committee.
Our rapporteur is of the opinion that these amendments impair the original text but we, of course, feel that they enhance it. I will mention just one in particular - the amendment seeking to invert the onus of proof and transfer it from the defendant to the prosecution.
Madam President, everyone is aware of my group's reservations about the Member State initiatives concerning the judicial European area.
The most effective and consistent method, in most of the matters that this involves, is the Community initiative, which we hope will be, following the work of the Convention, the prime working method, precisely because only the Commission is in a position to defend and promote the balance of values and principles that are not depleted by the construction of Europe's security, which is drifting away from the Europeans' deep-rooted component of rights and freedoms.
The history of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice is still made up much more of isolated initiatives by the Members States, which make specific contributions concerning security as they see fit, given the concerns of their citizens.
Instead, we are seeing the dissipation of Commission initiatives to approximate legislation, in which efforts to prosecute crime are tempered by the protection of individual values. This is not the Commission's fault, but a result of differences between the various Member States.
Furthermore, although there is no proof that the national area is the best suited to combating international organised crime, nor will it ever be proven that freedoms are best protected within the strict framework of national borders.
Take for example the motives for requests for accession and the examples of Spain and Portugal, which quickly became part of the European framework, and consequently, stable and deep-seated democracies.
This initiative and this report by Mr Di Lello, which adopt similar mechanisms for the freezing of property and evidence that I myself covered in this Parliament and to which the Council has still not given its agreement, deserve a better fate than the one befalling my report.
Therefore, regardless of the method and some points of relative disagreement, we are voting in favour of this initiative and this report as a sign that Parliament is pursuing its efforts to support the Tampere Council and the Commission's sensible and genuinely European interpretation of the promises made at the European Council.
Because, Madam President, the electors do not want crime to go unpunished, specifically international crime, for the sake of the judicial sovereignty of each Member State.
Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work.
The seizure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime is indeed, as has been pointed out by the rapporteur too, a genuinely effective tool for combating organised crime.
I would add that the confiscation of goods is also a valuable way of building up compensation funds for the victims of organised crime, victims of heinous crimes which can be linked to terrorism, child abuse, the trafficking of human beings or the trafficking of arms or drugs, victims who - it is worth pointing out - are often victims twice over, firstly because, through no fault of their own, they are the victims of a crime, and secondly because they do not subsequently receive sufficient, timely compensation for the damages suffered.
Approximation of the rules and procedures governing the matter is therefore urgent and essential, especially where cross-border criminal activities are concerned.
With regard to the Kingdom of Denmark's proposal, I agree with the rapporteur that its scope should be restricted to organised crime offences, and I also support his proposal to place the onus to prove the unlawful origin of property upon the prosecution rather than the defendant.
Last but not least, although I feel it is essential for it to be possible to confiscate crime-related proceeds, where these have been fictitiously transferred to the spouse or cohabitee or to another legal person, the prosecution must prove that the property of the spouse, cohabitee or other legal person does genuinely belong to the convicted person and that the other persons therefore only have fictitious title or access to it.
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, for his very comprehensive and helpful report on the two Danish initiatives on confiscation.
First, I shall address the framework decision on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property.
As the rapporteur said, it is essential that all Member States adopt rules providing for confiscation in general.
The added value of this initiative, however, is that it addresses extended powers to confiscate the property of a person convicted of a serious crime, especially when the convicted person was involved in organised crime.
The problems that this initiative raises, as the rapporteur has said, are mainly concerned with the idea of extended powers of confiscation which consist essentially of extending confiscation measures to property which is not linked to the crime for which the person has been convicted, permitting confiscation of property belonging to a convicted person if the person cannot prove that he obtained the property through legitimate means, and permitting confiscation of property belonging to the spouse of the convicted person.
In my view, it should be possible to break the link between the offence for which the person has been convicted and the property to be confiscated, especially if that property is itself of illegal origin.
However, the scope of application should be limited to serious offences linked to organised crime.
In addition, it is not the relationship between the convicted person and the third party which is important, but the fact that illegally obtained property was transferred to a third person.
So, like the rapporteur, I agree with the general approach adopted by the Danish Presidency.
I also support most of the amendments by the rapporteur, in particular the amendment which introduced the notion of proportionality, so that confiscation does not result in a loss of property disproportionate to the offence committed; and the amendment which limits the scope of application of extended powers of confiscation to organised crime.
I have some doubts about the amendment the rapporteur has just mentioned, which demands that Member States avoid a reversal of the burden of proof in their legislation.
I sincerely do not see the need to include such a provision in this specific instrument on confiscation as this could be interpreted as conflicting with the principle of subsidiarity.
The Danish initiative envisages a certain flexibility concerning the burden of proof.
In this area, as Mr Di Lello Finuoli mentioned, we have to find the correct balance between combating organised crime on the one hand and on the other respecting the fundamental rights of the accused.
It is not necessary, therefore, to reverse the burden of proof.
However, we should consider the fact that the person convicted in connection with organised crime who cannot justify his lifestyle should face the prospect of confiscation of property unless this person demonstrates that he obtained the property by legitimate means.
As for the second Danish initiative for a framework decision on the execution in the European Union of confiscation orders, this second initiative deals, as Mr Marinho has just said, with the mutual recognition and execution of confiscation orders in the European Union.
It is closely connected with the initiative that has been presented on the freezing and confiscation of property, for which Mr Marinho was the rapporteur, and the Commission intends to maintain the overall coherence between the two initiatives.
Some of the issues raised by the second initiative are now under negotiation in the Council, with regard also to the framework decision concerning the mutual recognition of financial penalties.
We are therefore pleased that the rapporteur shares the positive view of the Commission on this framework decision.
Most of your amendments seek to ensure that decisions are recognised only when issued by judges.
We agree that it is important to be clear about the status of the issuing authority.
The initial text as you have mentioned confused judicial authorities, courts and judges.
This needs to be ratified.
We support your view that it is not appropriate for orders issued by investigating magistrates and prosecutors to fall within the scope of these instruments.
The rapporteur also suggests that the issuing state should be prohibited from imposing a custodial sentence as an alternative to confiscation.
Although we agree with the objective of this amendment, it seems to us that this issue might be better addressed in the first framework decision on the approximation of national rules on confiscation.
I would conclude by thanking the rapporteur and also the House for its patience during this late-night debate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 10.09 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President, I was scheduled yesterday to speak in the debate on the media but, unfortunately, because of problems getting to Strasbourg, I was unable to make my timeslot.
I simply want to say that coming from the United Kingdom - renowned for its fogs, not to say for its smogs - I can in no way criticise the climate of Strasbourg.
Indeed, I want to congratulate and thank the airport staff for putting safety first.
I simply want to apologise to the presidency and to the House for missing my timeslot.
I had left my home at 6 a.m. in a brave attempt to be here.
In addition to your comments, which will go on the record, I would point out that you have the opportunity under Rule 120(7) to make a written statement that will be appended to verbatim report of the debate in question.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)
The next item is the report (A5-0371/2002) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on enlargement: progress report (COM(2002) 700 - C5-0474/2002 - 2002/2160(INI)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we have had the historical dimension vividly presented to us this morning, I would like to start by referring to the immense efforts that the candidates for accession have put into completing the process of transformation.
I believe that there was in many of these countries a politically courageous attitude, with a willingness to have recourse to unpopular courses of action that were bound to bring about change in their political, economic and social systems.
Such measures would in any case have had to be implemented over wide areas, but they were also connected with membership of the European Union.
I believe that our own political work has something to gain from such courage and capacity for making an impact.
I would also like, at the same time, to take this opportunity to thank the parties to the negotiations - the Council, the Commission in particular and the candidate countries, which have, over the past few years, taken upon themselves an incalculable amount of work in order to slowly steer this endeavour to a positive outcome.
It must be clear to us, however, that there is still a range of things in this process that need to be put in order.
For example, there are still a number of weighty issues remaining to be resolved before Copenhagen, or which will still require adjustments to be made in the ensuing process.
By this I mean not only adherence to the transitional arrangements, which must of course be limited in time, but also the issues that we take up in our reports and which have to do with capacity deficits in the administration and justice systems, as well as with minority rights, corruption and trafficking in human beings.
These are examples of problems that should be decisively tackled before enlargement becomes effective.
I therefore believe that the Commission is taking the right line in concentrating pre-accession aid on these areas in order thereby to create the conditions required by May 2004.
I agree with you that we still have much to do even after these things have been achieved by all parties.
We in this Parliament are prepared to make our contribution by keeping to the timetable.
It was this House that decided that enlargement should go ahead so that these countries might be able to take part in the 2004 European elections, and in doing so it set a date that the others have adopted.
When the accession treaty, amounting to some 6000 pages, is in place, we want to ensure that we can come to our decision by the beginning of April at the latest, so that the planned deadline for signature can be met and so that we can keep to the timetable, according to which ratification is to take place in mid-2004.
There are a number of very tangible issues that will need to be addressed in the course of negotiations.
I refer to structural grants and agriculture.
I would like again to emphasise that I trust in the wisdom of all the parties to the negotiations, and that these will be conducted in such a format as to make it possible to credibly present the outcome as a success, preventing us from ending up being foiled, in some referendum or other, by things that are trivialities in comparison with the historical dimension.
I believe that we must not lose sight of that or be less than fully aware of our responsibilities, and take the view that we will be called on to give further support over the coming weeks.
That also means that we have to seriously consider whether, for example, we want to inject a disproportionate amount of money - something that is not going to increase in quantity before 2006 - in the form of direct grants, or whether it might not be better to take a macroeconomic approach and put it into rural development as a whole.
That is simply a question that I am throwing out into the room for the benefit of these countries.
I am convinced that we will also succeed in bringing the Kaliningrad issue to a conclusion.
I hope that all the disputes surrounding the negotiations will be brought to an end and that the Commission and the Council will soon be able to explain in definite terms what is meant by the 'travel document light'.
The one thing that is clear is the position of the European Parliament: we have to build bridges with Russia, but it must be made clear that Lithuania will become a Member State of the European Union without reservation, that we consider the interests of a small sovereign state, and that we will not accept any solution that impedes, hampers or delays Lithuania's entry into the Schengen system.
I see this as an important pointer to the coming weeks.
I hope that the results of previous negotiations will serve as a basis on which everything will run smoothly.
I also wish to make clear that both the countries with which no conclusion is as yet in sight must be able to rely - if they complete the negotiations and fulfil the conditions - on us not discovering a new veto and a new alibi and shutting the door on them.
This should also serve to reassure such countries as Bulgaria and Romania.
I hope that the Cyprus issue can be resolved on the basis of Kofi Annan's proposal, which I believe to be an important step forward in terms of the European Union's internal and external relations and also of the establishment of peace in the Mediterranean, quite independent of accession and EU enlargement, but connected with it.
I do think, however, that the achievement of something as self-evident as this must not go hand in hand with watering down the Copenhagen political criteria in order to gain a political trade-off.
It will be after Copenhagen that the public will realise that we are taking the first step with ten countries seriously, and that a wide-ranging discussion will ensue in the present Member States of the European Union as to how much further we should go.
We will then be able to put a credible case for that only if we say that any further enlargement of the European Union would be acceptable only on the basis of full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, both political and economic.
I believe that the credibility of the entire process depends on this.
It is for the avoidance of any misunderstanding that I tell you that, if Turkey fulfils these conditions, which at present include compliance with the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, and if this forms an integral part of a political development in Turkey, with the armed forces no longer having a political role there, and the rule of law being established in full, then Turkey will have undergone a dramatic change, and we will then have to give sympathetic reconsideration to the possibility of Turkey acceding.
Whether it will get there I do not know, but we should give it the chance.
That is why it is the political criteria that are crucial here.
(Applause)
Mr President, we are now approaching the crucial date.
In 23 days' time in Copenhagen, we shall hopefully conclude the accession negotiations with 10 candidate countries, give impetus to the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and take a decision about the next phase of Turkey's candidacy.
In that way, we shall approach the objective towards which we have been striving, namely a single, reunified Europe.
That is something which, today, we have anticipated.
We have carried out a trial run, and it emerged that having such a large Parliament with MEPs from 27 countries present here in Parliament is perfectly possible, as is the task of interpreting into 23 languages, as has been done.
Many doubters must now recognise that these things are perfectly possible.
It was an historic event we experienced this morning, and I think Parliament deserves to be applauded for having in this way demonstrated what we shall all be embarking upon in a year and a half's time, as well as for having demonstrated that the process is feasible and for having in this way helped make the whole process irrevocable, so that there is no way back.
Yesterday was also historic in a way, however.
Yesterday, a ministerial meeting was, for the first time, held in Brussels with the participation of all 25 Member States.
It was, of course, an informal meeting.
It took place directly before the ordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council, and what we decided was of course what we had discussed with the new Member States.
We agreed, for example, that the new countries should accede on 1 May 2004.
That will provide time for the ratification of the accession treaty and, at the same time, enable the new Member States to participate on an equal footing in the elections to the European Parliament.
It was also agreed that they will be able to have their own Commissioners in the present Commission as from the date of accession, that is to say from 1 May 2004.
This naturally presupposes an understanding with this Parliament to the effect that 10 Commissioners will be able to accede without portfolios and, presumably, without being approved by Parliament, its being specified however that, when the new Commission is appointed, presumably as per 1 November, all the Commissioners will naturally have, as always, to be approved by Parliament, which by that time will have been newly elected.
We must particularly express our thanks, and demonstrate our respect, for the candidate countries' contributions.
They have done an impressive piece of work in adjusting to all the criteria we have set.
That, as I understand it, is also the message of the report we are today debating.
The Copenhagen criteria have been the yardstick for measuring the countries' political and economic reforms.
Radical reforms have been carried out.
Democratic structures have been developed.
Legislation has been introduced to protect human rights, and major progress has been made where minorities are concerned.
In the economic sphere, there has been an impressive transition from the planned economies of the past to market economies.
Price formation has been liberalised, privatisations have been carried out and there has been comprehensive restructuring within industry, agriculture and the financial sector.
Public administration has been reformed so that the EU's acquis communautaire can be implemented.
When one considers how much effort has been expended in every single one of these areas, one cannot help but admire the candidate countries.
That is why we must not disappoint their justified expectations of now shortly being able to become fully-fledged members.
This impressive progress can be read about in the Commission's progress report and strategy paper for enlargement, submitted on 9 October.
These described all 10 countries, and the Commission judged that the latter are ready to pursue membership.
Before they become Member States, however, further efforts are of course required.
The Commission has not said that the work has been done and that they are ready.
It has said that they can be ready in time.
As a reaction to the Commission's progress reports, the candidate countries have clearly intimated that they will step up their efforts in those areas pointed out by the Commission, and these efforts will be supported with EU funds.
Some work remains to be done in the accession negotiations.
The Brussels European Council took a number of important decisions concerning the outstanding financial issues.
Intense negotiations are currently being conducted with the candidate countries on these matters.
Clearly, moreover, a successful outcome demands both effort and a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone involved - the present, as well as the future, Member States.
We are all aware that a certain economic framework has been set, but there is naturally room for negotiation within this framework.
The concluding of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 23 days' time will be an incredible breakthrough.
There will then follow the work of preparation, signature and ratification.
Parliament will have to give its consent before the treaty can be signed, and Parliament's statement to the effect that it wishes to approve the treaty as quickly as possible merely illustrates once again Parliament's role as a driving force for rapid enlargement.
The Copenhagen European Council will not just concern itself with the 10 countries concerned.
Important decisions concerning Bulgaria and Romania, which still have some way to go, will also have to be taken.
In Brussels, clear support was expressed for these countries' efforts to achieve membership by 2007.
In response to the conclusions from Brussels, the Copenhagen European Council will have to make decisions concerning detailed timetables, including schedules and increased pre-accession aid, so that the accession process involving these countries can be taken forward.
The decisions taken in Copenhagen will, then, be designed to strengthen Bulgaria's and Romania's membership prospects.
With regard to Turkey, the Commission concludes that, since the last progress report, great progress has been made towards fulfilling the political Copenhagen criterion.
That is a gratifying development that must be maintained.
Developments in Turkey over the last year show that the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999, when Turkey was accorded the status of a candidate country, was a correct one.
At the same time, it is noted that there is still work to be done on the road towards fulfilling the political Copenhagen criterion.
In order further to increase its membership prospects, Turkey was encouraged by the Commission to adopt further reforms and to implement those already adopted.
In view of the Seville conclusions, the Copenhagen European Council will be the key moment in the development of relations between the EU and Turkey.
That is why it is important to keep all the doors open in the run-up to the decision to be taken in 23 days' time in Copenhagen.
I should like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its clear and unqualified support for enlargement, expressed this morning and reflected in the report submitted. It will also be reflected in the forthcoming debate.
Parliament has been involved in establishing the background against which the whole of the enlargement debate will take place.
It is of course MEPs' and the people's support that is so fundamental to the enlargement process.
We must ensure that this is maintained by creating the framework for a thorough and sober debate on enlargement, both in our own countries and in the new Member States.
The European Parliament's debates on enlargement have an important role to play.
It is in the course of these that the signals are sent to the people of Europe concerning the significance of the decisions we are to take.
That is why I should like again to thank Parliament and the President personally, and also Commissioner Verheugen, for the huge amount of work done by the institutions of the European Union on various fronts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to express very warm thanks to Mr Brok and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the report that has been presented, which demonstrates that the matter in hand has been gone into in considerable depth.
I would also like to express my gratitude for the very good cooperation that we have built up over the years.
It is a bit like the mood before Christmas, in which season we find ourselves, when you know you are doing something for the last time, and this is probably the last time that I will be able to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its cooperation, at any rate as regards the big enlargement package.
I want to include in this expression of gratitude Parliament as a whole and in particular its President, Pat Cox.
I regard the initiative that Parliament has devised today as truly worthy of a European Parliament and a demonstration of the fact that those who represent Europe's citizens here do not take enlargement to be a technical process, but rather a crucial part of giving our continent political unity.
It has also been made clear today that this process of enlargement has, if I may say so, a soul as well.
It has to be said that 2002 was a race over hurdles. If I may be permitted a brief reminiscence, the problems that we were faced with at the beginning of this year, and the things that have passed before our eyes, included the acquisition of land in Poland, the decommissioning of the Ignalina power plant, the Bene? decrees in the Czech Republic, elections in Slovakia, the Irish referendum, the Kaliningrad issue, and, finally, the financial package.
We really have gone from one obstacle to another, but we have been able to surmount them all.
Only one single hurdle still lies before us, and that is agreement on the final negotiation package.
Yesterday, the General Affairs Council gave the Presidency and the Commission a clear mandate, along with the required flexibility and the necessary powers, to conduct substantive and immediate talks with the candidate countries, which will involve submitting to them final packages tailor-made for each individual country.
There will be no package of proposals applying to all of them, but we will be meeting each country halfway and attempting to give sufficient attention to those of each country's problems that are still on the table.
We are able to do that because we had two rounds of intensive discussions with the candidate countries immediately following the Brussels meeting of the European Council, and these were concerned with putting on the table everything that is as yet undecided.
I have already reported on this to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
A large number of bilateral issues remain to be sorted out directly with the countries concerned.
These range from extraordinarily difficult issues such as, for example, the whole Polish and Hungarian problem with competition, to this or that rather bizarre special case, which has to be taken into account under the circumstances, as it can have an influence - a very great influence, moreover - on public opinion.
On the other hand, this round has taught us that the horizontal issues are in fact seen in the same light everywhere.
Here we are dealing with familiar topics, of which there are, in essence, four, all of them closely interconnected. In the Budget chapter, there is the cash flow problem, especially in the first year.
There is the issue of the pressure that the financial package as a whole will put on the candidate countries' budgets in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Let me say this in order to clarify what I mean: the rules under which European funds are made available very definitely amount to an imposition on these countries' budgets.
In one instance or another, this imposition results in the need to make substantial cuts in areas where I am sure nobody in this House would be happy to have cuts made.
Nevertheless, the country has no other option available to it if it wants to make full use of the funds available.
We are trying to find a way forward here which will enable us to avoid problems of this sort with budgets.
The Brussels Council, like yesterday's General Affairs Council, on the one hand again confirmed the boundaries within which we have to operate, but also established a certain degree of flexibility, and I want to elucidate what this flexibility involves.
Admittedly, for example, the Council did say that we would reduce the funds set aside for the Structural and Cohesion Funds by EUR 2.5 billion - I might add, by the way, that it did so with the Commission's agreement, because we too had come to the conclusion that it could be expected to be extremely difficult, over the three years, to actually fully incorporate these funds into the programming.
But it did not change the upper limit for expenditure decided on in Berlin.
When we point out that the Berlin framework has to be strictly adhered to and that the decisions taken in Brussels cannot be altered either, it follows that there is a certain amount of room for manoeuvre.
Looking carefully at what the Franco-German compromise, which brought about agreement in the Council, said about direct payments, one sees that it is only in the third year in which direct payments are to be made - 2006, when they will reach 35% - that what was decided in Brussels will be affected.
Agricultural expenditure is to be fixed at the 2006 level.
There is no mention of either 2005 or 2004.
I want to use these two examples to demonstrate that we are right to say that what is on the table is not an offer that can only be either accepted in its entirety or rejected.
Rather, it leaves a certain amount of room in which negotiations can be conducted in a sensible way.
Once Copenhagen is over, the candidate countries will have do what the Committee on Foreign Affairs' reports demand of them, that is, concentrate, with our help, on acknowledged deficiencies and weaknesses.
We will again report in detail on the results of these efforts.
Now that 1 May 2004 has been fixed as the date for the accessions, this final report will be put before the Council and Parliament on 1 November, and quite conceivably on 31 October 2003, thus creating another opportunity for insisting that the commitments they have made should actually be met.
As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Council yesterday adopted the Commission's proposal for a more fully developed pre-accession strategy for both these countries, which applies to each country separately, so that there is no concerted strategy, but one for Bulgaria and one for Romania.
There is a difference from previous timetables for negotiations in that we used to always specify dates by which specific decisions had to be taken concerning the negotiations.
That is no longer necessary in this case, as nearly all the chapters have already been opened.
We are now setting benchmarks both in the short and medium terms, as well as those with reference to the date of accession, which each country should have reached by a specific point in time in order that accession, planned for 2007, can go ahead.
After that, that is to say, post-Copenhagen - as was said in this House this morning - the parliaments will have their moment, when the political decision-making process is set in motion.
I do not need to say very much about this at this juncture, other than that the Commission will obviously be available to help Parliament in every way possible during the first months of 2003, which will be crucial.
No matter which committee or forum asks for expert advice or expresses a need for discussion, we will be there for them.
That is for us the Number One priority at the beginning of next year, and President Prodi will have more to say about that when, tomorrow, he stands here and presents our work programme.
I believe that Parliament and the Commission will, together, be able to get on top of this extremely difficult task.
I would now like to say something more about Turkey, an issue that will also have a part to play next year.
I agree with the whole of what Mr Brok said - it could have been me speaking - about how the Turkey that will be able to join the European Union will be a quite different Turkey.
It is precisely that that we want to make easier by means of the pre-accession process.
I have to say that I do not see why we are to dispense with a strategy that has been so successful.
It was what we did in Helsinki, more than anything that had preceded it, that got the process of change in Turkey really moving.
As regards the date, the Commission has made its preference perfectly clear.
The Commission continues to insist on all the candidates being treated equally, which means that we can only talk in terms of a date for opening negotiations when the political criteria have indeed been fulfilled, which they very definitely have not been so far.
I also want to tell you that this issue has been brought up quite unilaterally, and without consultation, by the Turks.
Never and nowhere has there been any discussion of the possibility of naming a date for the commencement of negotiations before the political criteria have been fulfilled.
That is a unilateral demand on the part of Turkey, and neither I nor the Commission are willing simply to give in to a situation in which the other side steps up the pressure and says: 'If you do not give in to this pressure, you are causing a crisis in relations between us.'
That is not the way we should be treating each other.
That is something I want to make absolutely clear.
Related to that is the Cyprus question, on which I would like to say something briefly; here, too, I think that the Helsinki strategy is proving to be the right one.
We would not have got where we are today without the Helsinki conclusions.
I have always taken the view that, when things move in Cyprus, they do so very, very late in the day, which means that two things have to be made abundantly clear in political terms.
Firstly, and whatever happens in the twenty-three days that remain to us, the decision on the accessions - including Cyprus' - must be taken at Copenhagen.
It cannot be delayed; it is the fulcrum and pivot of the whole strategy.
The solution we want is of course accession on the basis of fundamental agreement on the package proposed by Kofi Annan, but it goes without saying that it would also be possible to come to the necessary decisions in Copenhagen and then continue with the political process that is meant to bring about a peaceful solution in Cyprus.
It is very definitely not being said that the decision in Copenhagen will represent an end to the peace-making effort if matters have not already been brought to a conclusion before Copenhagen.
A whole range of issues have been raised in connection with the United Nations' proposals, and these touch on the peace plan's compatibility with European Community law.
I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that there are certain things that are not negotiable.
They are requirements that must be met.
A Member State must, for example, be capable of contributing to our institutions' decision-making and must speak with one voice.
It must possess structures of central government strong enough to realise and enforce Community law, and it must adhere to and defend our core values and principles, these being democracy, human rights, the protection of minorities and so on.
The United Nations knew this to be an absolute conditio sine qua non from our point of view, and, having carried out an initial and careful scrutiny, I believe that I can say that the proposals comply with these conditions.
That leaves us with a second difficulty: what is asked of us is a consequence of the principle of two zones and two communities on which the proposal is founded.
What is being asked of us involves the adaptation of the acquis communautaire.
I do not think it necessary for us to engage with these questions at the present moment, but we should do so when they are put to us by those who want to live together in this state in the future.
For as long as they do not express their desire for this state, we do not, I believe, need to answer the question of which rules for co-existing in it are compatible with the acquis communautaire.
The important thing is that we should not be giving anyone the opportunity to use reference to Community law as a way of evading responsibility for the political decision that now has to be taken.
At the end of the day, this is about getting the final result accepted in the Member States and the candidate countries, and so I will say quite clearly that the final package for every single candidate country must also come complete with a decent measure of generosity on our part.
There is no room here for small-mindedness.
We are also getting to the point where we simply have to say that these concerns and aspirations are justified, and that, politically speaking, there will be no other way of explaining to people why joining the EU is the right thing for them to do.
In that event, we will have to meet the candidate countries halfway and make it clear that there will under no circumstances be such a thing as second-class membership.
I am very grateful to the Council Presidency for having already made this clear with reference to the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Commission takes the same view.
Once negotiations are completed, the countries that have done so will be participants with equal rights in the Intergovernmental Conference, and, moreover, right from the word go.
The same applies to the Commission.
