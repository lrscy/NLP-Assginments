You will hear barracking from those who live on this European Union and who earn far more here than they would ever be worth in the commercial world.
You are here as observers, so just have a look around.
What are we doing here today?
What a nonsense that we are spending EUR 200 million a year of taxpayers' money on the monthly jaunt to Strasbourg.
Have a look tomorrow and on Wednesday and Thursday at the absolutely farcical voting system here and realise that whatever MrÂ Barroso said last week about deregulation, less regulation and the sixty legislative acts they intend to withdraw, there have been some 2Â 000 legislative instruments passed in the short period since 1Â July, when the British took over the Presidency of the Council.
Please look and go back and tell your people the truth.
The ten Member States that joined last year all had referendums in their countries.
I understand there is no intention to hold referendums in Romania and Bulgaria.
Do not those people deserve the chance at least to vote in a referendum and have a debate?
Would it not be a huge, historic mistake to railroad those people into this failing European Union without first telling them the truth?
The British people were lied to 30 years ago about this European club.
Your people deserve better than that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Prescott and Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for their presence here today.
I would also like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for devoting so much attention to me, as always.
What we have seen here today is the ability of an institution such as ours to raise our voices in grave concern and yet come up with no solution.
Because, ultimately, if we really want to respond to what is occurring in the European Union of today, we must first recognise that, whatever crisis we may perceive, the people out there do not see it as a crisis.
For 90% of the people, the European Union does not represent a positive image of relevance to them.
It is seen as being interfering, over-burdensome, over-arching and, indeed, uncaring when it comes people's everyday concerns.
It is important to be realistic when we consider the number of issues that our organisation can address within its rules.
I heard talk here today of how wrong it was of President Barroso to mention that the Commission was going to drop 'x' number of directives, or that it was going to reduce the number of directives in force.
The President of our own Parliament said here today that there are 56 different directives dealing with the sale and production of goods for supply and for services.
There are 16 individual directives dealing with the purchase, marketing and presentation of fertiliser for sale.
Surely, they can all be brought into a single directive.
Maybe there is a difference in language and interpretation and that what the President of the Commission meant to say was consolidation, or codification, which happens in every single government.
There is no reason why every single institution should not take a hard look at itself to determine what the most important issues to be tackled are and how legislation can be improved and made more relevant to the people.
The challenges facing us today are not about the distant future, or even the failed ideologies of the past.
The challenges for us today are to ensure that we can create a proper structure for Europe in the 21st century.
Funding is a core issue and there must be agreement on the financial perspective.
Member States must make a payment towards the central budget to ensure that we can assist those countries most in need, and to ensure that we can continue to drive forward Europe as a dynamic, innovative and creative centre.
We must also try to ensure that, in so doing, we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
There have been those who in the recent past have sought to link the common agricultural policy to the financial perspective.
That was a mistake and it is to be hoped that there will now be a retreat from that position.
Likewise it is important that we in this Parliament view our role responsibly and that, when we do not like or agree with legislation, we do not flunk the decision â as we did with the computer-implemented inventions directive, as we are trying to do with the services directive, and as we have done with many other proposed directives in the past.
Our role as legislators is to legislate.
That requires tough decisions.
That means that there will be differences between us in this House.
Those differences are not of a personal nature, but in what we see as the best vision for the future.
Finally, when we speak about an area of freedom, security and justice, it is justice which must be first and foremost among those aims and ideals, because, unless we can guarantee people that their individual rights and freedoms are protected, then we will have failed in our first duty as legislators, namely, to ensure that the laws that we pass not only protect the common good, but do not adversely affect the minority.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, last but not least I would like to take my turn in welcoming our new colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria.
They will, I hope, restore to the French language and culture a little of the lustre it has lost here as successive enlargements have taken place, in particular with the accession of countries from Northern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe.
I am not forgetting notable exceptions such as our late fellow Member from Poland, FilipÂ Adwent.
I welcome, in particular, our five colleagues and friends from the Romania Mare party in the great country of Romania and our Bulgarian colleague from the Attack party.
They have come as observers to the European Parliament at a time when Turkey, on 3 October 2005, will be starting its accession talks, even though its accession was one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and without it having acknowledged the Republic of Cyprus and, furthermore, without it wanting to do so.
I believe that, with 10% of its population of Turkish origin, Bulgaria is particularly sensitive to this major event.
May our colleagues know that they can count on our support in the European Parliament to defend the Europe of our native lands in the face of destructive globalisation and the flood of migrants.
I note with interest the death knell that MrÂ Barroso, President of the European Commission, has just sounded to the defunct European Constitution.
As a rational democrat, he has learned lessons from the French and Dutch referenda and scrapped this freedom-annihilating text.
For once, law comes close to morality.
The peopleâs opinion is superior to that of the technocrats, in spite of the various kinds of pressure being exerted by the great professional consciences.
As regards the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the Franco-British battle over the rebate and the CAP budget is in danger of continuing unless the Community budget is increased beyond 1% of GDP to meet the needs of the CEECs.
On that issue, we will denounce any withdrawal or climb-down from MrÂ Chirac and the French Government regarding the CAP.
As loyal allies of the Americans, the British have but two objectives during their six-month Presidency: to get Turkeyâs accession under way and to ensure that the much-vaunted âBolkesteinâ Directive on services is adopted.
We will oppose them both.
MrÂ Chirac addressed the European Commission, quite shamelessly, to request its intervention in the Hewlett Packard affair, with its 1Â 240 compulsory redundancies.
He publicly humiliated himself and France along with him.
It is not up to the Commission, in fact, to intervene in the internal management of businesses.
It is only natural that methods of protecting French economic and social interests should be decided in Paris and not in Brussels and Geneva.
Only the 2007 French presidential election, coming in the wake of the bombshell events of 29 May 2005, will mark the genuine break with Euro-internationalism and the spirit of renunciation.
It is a break that all genuine Europeans are waiting for.
This will be the return to national ideas and to economic patriotism in the service of the people.
Having the formidable privilege of precedence, I believe I can be the most convincing spokesperson on this matter in France and in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by joining President Borrell and others who have welcomed our friends from Bulgaria and Romania as observers.
This will be a very important step towards helping the final preparations for membership.
The Commission will continue to actively assist your efforts and we look forward to working with you.
Let me also add that I have followed the reports about the floods and their effects in your countries during the summer.
I hope you are aware of the solidarity we feel and know that we will respond to any requests for assistance you may have.
I wish to make two comments, firstly on the Constitution, because it is important for everybody to see the role of the Commission in this matter.
From the very beginning, the Commission not only supported the Constitution, but was also actively involved in the work of the Convention.
This was discussed every week at the Commission.
We continue to support the Constitution.
We all agree that it might not be a perfect document, but we support it and we have worked actively on it.
After the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands, we all know it is unlikely that the Constitution will be ratified by all Member States in the foreseeable future.
That does not mean that we will not continue to work actively on the political agenda in order to deliver concrete results for the citizens of Europe.
The Commission will continue to ensure that we work on our political priorities and deliver on them.
We must also use this period of reflection to engage in a dialogue with citizens.
This is the only way to ensure that we can gain their full support for a new Constitution.
We want to find a common understanding with Member States on the way forward, with the help of the European Parliament.
That is why even before the summer we started to draw up what we call 'Plan D' for debate, dialogue and democracy.
At our seminar last week, we discussed a number of very concrete ideas on how we could engage in that kind of dialogue with Member States.
It has to be a very broad agenda aimed at continuing the dialogue beyond the lifetime of the current Commission or Parliament.
This is not only a rescue operation for the Constitution, but must also be a new way of engaging with citizens.
President Barroso and I will present our preliminary ideas on this Plan D to the Conference of Presidents on Wednesday.
A communication to the Council and Parliament is also being prepared and I hope that a formal version of this will be ready later this week to give you an opportunity to react to it.
Last week President Barroso sent a letter to President Borrell proposing that we identify initiatives where the Commission and Parliament could cooperate and also that our respective services meet as soon as possible to discuss such initiatives.
The best way to overcome the current crisis is to convince Europeans of the relevance of Europe.
Therefore, our primary concern is to deliver on our policy priorities.
Our objectives of prosperity, solidarity and security are still valid and indeed are more relevant than ever.
They are in tune with what people in Europe want when we ask them through the Euro-barometer polls â more and better jobs; preserving social and territorial cohesion; managing the earth's resources in a sustainable way; and reinforcing security in Europe and the world as a whole.
Secondly, on the subject of better regulation, I first of all want to thank Parliament for its cooperation on the signing of a new framework agreement.
Since this is my responsibility, I will be taking great care to make sure that we abide by the framework agreement.
That is why I have studied the events which prompted criticism and unease on the part of Members of Parliament over the question of better regulation.
Better regulation has been on the agenda of our institutions for a long time.
Since 2003, we have been working together on better law-making.
An interinstitutional agreement was signed that year, aimed at simplifying and improving Community regulation.
This Commission made a renewed and strong commitment to better regulation at the beginning of its mandate, and better regulation at all levels has also become a central plank of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
My colleague, Mr Verheugen, has kept this House regularly informed about the Commission's approach and, having looked at the calendar, I see that there have been at least ten occasions, including the preliminary hearings, on which this House has been informed about the agenda on better regulation, in addition to the general information provided in interviews and on other occasions.
It is a three-pillar approach which includes: screening of pending legislation with a view to withdrawing proposals which do not meet the criteria; the simplification exercise; and the upgrading of methods for preparing new legislative proposals, including impact assessments.
Tomorrow, the Commission will discuss and endorse the results of the screening exercise and put forward the list of legislative proposals it considers should be withdrawn.
It is the first time that the whole college has had the opportunity to decide on that.
It has been a thorough and extensive exercise and we propose to withdraw about one-third of the 183 pending proposals.
This will be done in full respect of the relevant provisions of the revised framework agreement.
Pursuant to Article 12 of the framework agreement, Commissioner Verheugen will submit our proposal to Parliament before it is made public â it will be presented here in full tomorrow, immediately after the Commission has discussed it.
With reference to Article 32 of the framework agreement, our proposal, which is a political decision at this stage, is intended as prior notification to the other institutions and, in line with established practice, the legal act of withdrawal will be taken in three months' time.
This exercise has been long announced and the Commission has been open both on the methods and the objectives.
We do not believe that any of the statements released to the press by individual Commissioners or by the President can be seen as undermining the prerogative of the Commission to act as a college or the commitments made to the other institutions.
If you wish, I can provide the full list, detailing the series of occasion when these proposals were presented to this House in different forums â whether in the committees or in the form of decisions.
I accept that there is always scope for improving communication and trust between our two institutions.
I would like to reaffirm my personal commitment to keeping this objective high on the Commission agenda.
I shall not miss any opportunity to remind colleagues that it is here that proposals should first be presented.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
Mrs BerÃšs has requested the floor.
Please tell me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure you are invoking.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to speak about the organisation of the agenda simply in order to draw your attention to our method of working.
I regret that a legislative text of absolutely crucial importance to the funding of our economy â which is, I repeat, a legislative text â should be included in todayâs agenda only as from 7.30Â p.m.
I believe that it should have been scheduled for another day and another time.
I understand the importance of these moments to pause for breath and to conduct political debates, but I believe that it is also important for our Parliament to treat its legislative work in a reasonable fashion.
Â Â  Thank you for your comment on the way we carry out our work, but we can only follow the order of business that we have adopted.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, today is European Day of Languages.
We are celebrating the language diversity that is part of our cultural heritage and makes for a richer society.
Even as a young girl, I knew the following proverb: âThe number of languages you speak is the number of times you are humanâ.
This proverb also appears to be known on the Commission website where Commissioner Figel' makes a statement.
That should encourage this House to give maximum support to sound programmes that promote the teaching of languages to as many people as possible.
We in this House should, however, also realise that compliance with internal rules in the area of language diversity is an expression of respect for each human being and contributes to our institutionâs democratic functioning.
That is why I think it important, even though I do not have much time available to me, to draw your special attention to two issues.
First of all, we must continue to make every effort in order to give all those who work in our House, Members and officials, the opportunity of attending language courses and secondly, you must encourage our officials to continue to respect our internal language rules to the letter and spirit.
Whatever we do, we must not slip into the example the Council has given us, in the light of ...
Â Â  Mr President, public transport is important to all our local communities.
In Scotland, ferries provide an essential service to some of the European Union's most peripheral and vulnerable communities.
This week I will be welcoming a delegation representing the CalMac trade unions to the European Parliament, who will be meeting the transport Commissioner on Wednesday.
Presently these ferry services are being put out to tender in communities where they are the sole mode of transport connecting island communities to the mainland.
Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations, public administrations will be given flexibility over tendering processes and will be able to award certain services to in-house operators directly.
Why, then, are lifeline ferries being treated differently to trains, trams and metros?
There are no trains, trams and metros in Scotland's peripheral island communities.
The position of the Commission would appear to be contradictory and I urge the Commission to clarify its position.
Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to share with you my concern about yet another example of a shocking homophobic speech in one of the national parliaments of an EU Member State.
In this case we are talking about the Parliament of Latvia, which is discussing the implementation of Article 13 â on European anti-discrimination legislation â as well as a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriages.
I note that not even George Bush dares go that far.
I would like to appeal to our colleagues in the Latvian Parliament to conduct their debate with dignity, to condemn hate speeches and to remember that Latvia, like the other Member States, has signed up to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It has also ratified the EU Constitution, which forbids discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
Â Â  Mr President, colleagues, as you may already be aware, the Irish Republican Army has taken another initiative to assist peace in Ireland.
Today's courageous decision to verifiably and definitively dispose of its weaponry represents a major advance for the peace process in Ireland.
The enormity of what the IRA has done should neither be underestimated nor undervalued. I should like to take this opportunity to praise the IRA for taking risks when others shirked their responsibilities.
An enormous responsibility has now been placed on both the British and Irish Governments to finally implement the Good Friday agreement in all its aspects, on issues such as equality, human rights, policing, demilitarisation and indeed northern representation in the Oireachtas.
The Democratic Unionist Party, one of whose members is elected to this Parliament, must re-engage with the peace process.
No possible excuse now exists for them not to sit down ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, the signature of the agreement to build an undersea gas pipeline across the Baltic was accompanied by shots of PresidentÂ Putin of Russia locked in a warm embrace with ChancellorÂ SchrÃ¶der of Germany.
This display of affection took place against the background of two major threats to peace and the security of the worldâs economy.
I refer to international terrorism and the price increases and instability affecting the market in raw materials for energy production.
Everyone is aware that this situation calls for cooperation at global level.
Unfortunately, just when the European Union should be setting an example of collective wisdom and solidarity between countries, ChancellorÂ SchrÃ¶der and PresidentÂ Putin trumpet abroad an unambiguous statement to the effect that all they care about is promoting the selfish interests of Germany and Russia.
The fact that the countries across whose marine economic area the gas pipeline is to run were not informed or consulted illustrates the respect in which both countries hold the international law of the sea.
We are firmly convinced that the agreement on building the gas pipeline was devised to be detrimental to several Member States of the European Union.
Poland, the Baltic States and other countries will be forced to submit to Russian control of their energy supplies.
The agreement also suggests a clear association âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are only 15Â months left before the start of the Union's first new sevenâyear budgetary period.
Despite the Union's agreed rules and conventions, however, we still do not have a draft budget.
The Union is drifting rudderless across a budgetary ocean, so to speak.
Each successive month of delay results in needless tension and unease, and gives rise to distrust between the old and new Member States.
By failing to produce a budget, the Union is sending out the wrong kind of message to its future members and its external partners.
It is presenting itself as weak, lacking vision for the future and the political will to work together in solidarity in order to build that future.
This situation does not suggest stalemate, to borrow an expression from the game of chess. Rather, it suggests checkmate for the idea of a truly united Europe that is not split into a first and second class Europe according to wealth or historical legacy.
I call on the Council and the UK Presidency to ensure that work on the budget is concluded at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Poland is into its second year of membership of the European Union, but the outlook for Polish farmers is getting steadily worse, not better.
Polish soft fruit growers account for 50% of production in Europe, yet they are on the verge of bankruptcy.
The same is true of Polish potato growers, who are the main producers of this crop in the Union, and of producers of cereals and textile plants.
It will not be long before producers of pork, milk and sugar beet find themselves in the same situation, and I would remind you that Poland is the third most important producer of sugar beet in Europe.
Members of this House do understand the situation, but the same is not true of the European Commission, which tends to ignore Parliament and disregard the decisions it takes.
This was what happened in the case of the report on starch production, for example.
The planned reform of the market in sugar will mean a reduction of more than 42% in the price of sugar beet, which will make it uneconomic to produce.
It would appear that the European Commission is more concerned about Chinese and Moroccan soft fruit growers and about Brazilian sugar producers than about farmers and producers in the new Member States.
The question arises as to why the European Commission and the Commissioner himself are pursuing a policy that is detrimental to farmers in the Member States, and why decisions taken by the European Parliament are being disregarded.
Â Â  Mr President, I am taking the floor on behalf of Mr Pittella, from Italy, and Mrs Madeira, from Portugal, to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, in the proposals on the financial perspective that it is to present, to reincorporate the criteria proposed by the Commission on the regions affected by the statistical effect, with regard to the need to support them without any shameful discrimination amongst them, since, as I said in this very House on 9 March, this is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it egalitarian, balanced and democratic, faithful to its roots and to its ambitions.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this truly historic day for Ireland.
In July of this year, the IRA called on its units to dump their arms and today we have verification that those words have been translated into action.
Yes, there are still many bridges to cross, but today, in my opinion, we have crossed the Rubicon.
There will be difficulties ahead; there are peace breakers on both sides who will try to derail this process.
Massive support must therefore be given to peace builders, to ordinary people who on a day-to-day basis begin to build trust and seek out a shared future.
We salute all of those, on both sides and none, who helped to bring us to this day.
In the European Parliament, I wish to applaud the positive and supportive role of the European Union in this process.
Finally, on this day we remember the victims and their families whose lives have been shattered.
For them today comes too late, but for the rest of us it is hopefully a beginning.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have recently become aware of the signature of an agreement between Germany and Russia concerning the building of a gas pipeline in the north of Europe, routed across the Baltic.
Clearly, this is more than a significant economic agreement.
It has an equally important political dimension.
Poland and the Baltic States have been bypassed, much to the detriment of the national interests of countries that are part of the same structure, namely the European Union.
Once again, the Unionâs common economic and foreign policies have proved to be so much hot air, and many commentators and politicians are already likening the agreement signed recently to the 1939Â RibbentropâMolotov pact.
I call on Germany to comply with the procedures binding on all Member States and clarify the situation.
I also call for the information provided to be made available to the European Parliament.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Europe is capable of showing solidarity, as it demonstrated in connection with the tragic events in Portugal.
Europeâs leaders can, however, behave selfishly at times, as was the case when MrÂ Chirac, MrÂ SchrÃ¶der and MrÂ Putin met in Kaliningrad, a curious part of Russian territory.
Subsequently, MrÂ SchrÃ¶der and MrÂ Putin acted selfishly when they signed the agreement to build the gas pipeline.
It is alleged that the purpose of the pipeline is to guarantee Germanyâs energy supply, but that is only half the story.
What MrÂ SchrÃ¶der is about is supporting MrÂ Putinâs âdivide and ruleâ policy, which amounts to weakening the Union.
The European Parliament should stand up for Europe and denounce this act for what it really is.
Europe needs decisions that transcend local interests.
It will never become integrated if we do not adopt cohesive policies.
It would be like trying to build a brick house without using any mortar.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have received particularly worrying information over recent days from Turkish non-governmental human rights organisations about the prosecution and sentencing of Turkish journalists.
I refer not only to the case of the author Orhan Pamuk, but also to the case of the journalist Emin Karaca, who has been sentenced to five months in prison for violating Article 301, paragraph 2, of the recently revised penal code.
I also refer to other cases of journalists prosecuted under the same Article.
In light of this situation, I call on the European Parliament and, more importantly, its President to take an immediate initiative addressed to the Turkish prime minister, Mr Erdogan, and to the speaker of the Turkish National Assembly, Mr Arinc, calling for prosecutions to cease and for freedom of speech to be respected, and to the UK Presidency and the European Commission ...
Â Â  Mr President, although I am a firm believer in the use of a common working language of communication, I accept and respect the right of every MEP to listen and speak in his or her own national language.
What I cannot accept, however, is the fact that more than a year after the accession of ten new Member States, there is still at least one parliamentary committee in which no interpretation for certain new Member State languages is provided, and that colleagues from these states are unable to take part in the deliberations of these committees using their official mother tongue.
This obviously puts these colleagues at an unfair disadvantage.
It is not an acceptable state of affairs and I call on you to reassure the House, on this day of linguistic freedom, that this regrettable situation will be remedied as soon as possible and that it will not arise again when the next two new Member States join the EU in the near future.
Â Â  Mr President, one quarter of the Irish GDP is tied up in construction.
We could say that Ireland is a country under construction.
However, in many of the villages around the cities of my constituency, houses are being thrown up with no thought for utilities, for enough water or sewage, or for the important elements of social infrastructure.
Children spend their whole education in Portakabins.
Often there are no sports fields or crÃšches and few shops.
Rural villages quickly become dormitory towns with no sense of community.
Is that alright with Europe?
Does it tally with rural development?
I need answers for the people of Watergrass Hill, Glenville and other towns: the people who are struggling with life in shiny new clusters of houses with no soul.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to take advantage of today's celebration of the European Day of Languages to express my concern about the lack of teaching of their mother tongue to the children of nationals of the Member States who move and establish in other Member States of the Union, with the result that these children forget their language of origin and, at the same time, their cultural identity.
The linguistic assimilation which children and young Europeans undergo when they re-establish, especially those whose mother tongue is less widely spoken than the European languages spoken by millions of European citizens, does not help to maintain the linguistic diversity which the European Union alleges that it wishes to maintain.
I call on the Commission, within the framework of the new strategy on multilingualism, to monitor the effective application of Directive 77/486/ÎEC of 25 July 1977 on the education of the children of migrant workers ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is celebrating an important date: the European Day of Languages.
This event, first held in 2001, involves the European Union and, above all, the Council of Europe, which has planned events throughout Europe.
Today we welcome here our new Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues; with them, Bulgarian and Romanian will join our Community family of languages on 1Â January 2007, raising the number of official languages from 20 toÂ 22.
For us Europeans, language is synonymous with culture and history and hence with a vast historical and cultural heritage.
I wonder, then, whether it would not be appropriate for us, as the European Parliament, at last to promote a constructive reform of the language regime within the Community institutions.
I am certainly delighted at the arrival of the new languages and especially of those that will soon become part of our daily work, but on the other hand I am extremely concerned at the chaos and lack of written rules, as has been confirmed to me by the European Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, a man died.
He had been known as a merciless avenger by many, even though he had been seeking justice, not revenge.
He was motivated by the conviction that if people who had committed crimes can leave the past behind without any consequences, this past would return, poisoning both the present and the future.
Simon Wiesenthal died.
He was human and sometimes made mistakes.
But he could not come to terms with the fact that Europe, the new world building a collective future based on its common values, had already been united once in the past.
United in the assumption of racial superiority, in condemnation, ostracism and hatred.
A 96-year-old man passed away.
His legacy to us is the knowledge that contempt for another human being and taking human lives should never be allowed to unite Europe again.
Let us think of him when we work to ensure that the unity of the new Europe is based on equal treatment and equal opportunities.
In remembrance of him we ask the Committee that in paragraph 13 ...
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to apprise plenary of a very serious matter.
As we speak, the Turkish authorities are in the final stage of constructing a dam.
This dam, which is scheduled for completion on 15 November, in other words in fewer than 50 days from today, will result in the flooding and definitive loss of one of the most important archaeological sites in Asia Minor today.
I refer to Allianoi, a Roman spa centre which lies 18Â kilometres from the town of Bergama.
The archaeological site of Allianoi consists of an entire complex of spas which, it would appear, complemented the famous Bergama Asklepion.
I believe that the European Parliament should take a stand on the question of this loss and, given that the Commission's reply was unsatisfactory, I propose that the President of Parliament write to the Turkish president calling for a halt to work to complete the dam, which will result in the definitive loss of a piece of European cultural heritage.
Â Â  Mr President, in the presence of Commissioner McCreevy and his colleagues, I would like to put down a marker about the Commission's proposed reform of the sugar regime.
Contrary to received wisdom, global sugar consumption already outstrips demand.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecast world sugar consumption at 145 million tonnes for 2004 and 2005, with production at 143 million tonnes.
World sugar consumption next year is said to reach 149 million tonnes, with per capita consumption in China alone expected to increase from its current 10Â kilograms to the EU level of 35Â kilograms in the medium term.
In Brazil the consumption per capita is already 50Â kilograms.
In addition the availability of irrigation water in developing countries and elsewhere is decreasing, and this will dictate a swing away from the cultivation of sugar cane, a water-intensive crop.
Factor in the inevitable impact on sugar cane consumption patterns by the projected increases in gasohol as oil prices rise and alternative biofuel technologies become mainstream.
Sugar may increasingly become a strategic commodity.
The world is facing a long-term surge in demand.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor with regard to the situation in Western Sahara.
In August, the Polisario Front freed the last Moroccan prisoners of war.
That is a positive step, which has met with the approval of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, President Bush and the whole international community.
The same is not happening, however, with those detained in Moroccan jails: the physical condition of the tens of Sahrawi detainees on hunger strike is now critical, according to Amnesty International reports.
Among them are women and men who are standing up for human rights.
Europe must not remain silent, but must take decisive steps to secure the freedom of those upholding human rights; to ensure that Morocco, the Sahrawi who have stayed in Western Sahara and the refugees reach an agreement to live in peace, working together to create the new democratic Arab-Sahrawi Republic; and to ensure that they no longer live in exile or in prison.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to welcome our Romanian colleagues, in particular to my own group, from the Romanian Democratic Party, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and the Romanian Conservative Party.
The observers will clearly be learning the way that we work, which may be rather complicated, but I also believe that we should learn from Romania's history.
Romania has suffered from Fascism under the Iron Guard and from Communism under Ceausescu.
However, because it is politically convenient, many people have forgotten that Bessarabia was illegally invaded by Stalin with the complicity of Hitler.
Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives or were exiled, and that part of Romania was subjected.
Certain chapters in the history of Central and Eastern Europe have been forgotten and we have to look at them.
We should not make this an obsession, but we must draw conclusions and look to the future.
Romania before Communism and Fascism was one of great prosperity, with the Anglo-Romanian oil company and significant investment from France.
Â Â  Mr President, members from across national borders and political boundaries are in support of John Packwood, who faces extradition from Spain to Morocco, which is something that could not happen to a Spanish citizen.
This is, of course, a violation of the equal treatment of EU citizens, enshrined in the Treaty.
It is discrimination which I call most strongly on the Commission and the President to oppose by making representations to the Spanish Government before the extradition deadline.
A case must be allowed to be developed that can go to the Court of Human Rights, but this is also being denied as matters are being pushed through quickly.
He is a desperate man facing a desperate plight and he needs all our support.
I urge you to help in this case.
Â Â  Mr President, on 15Â September a Russian fighter plane carrying four missiles entered Lithuanian airspace and crashed near the city of Kaunas.
It was part of a group of six fighters accompanying a Russian spy plane from St Petersburg to Kaliningrad.
It was a most serious incident in a long series of violations of Finnish and Baltic airspace by Russian planes.
On the eve of the EU-Russia summit I should like to ask the Commission how systematic violation by Russian planes of the borders of EU Member States can be tallied with the common values upon which the EU-Russia partnership is officially based.
Is not the integrity of the EU's eastern border part of our common foreign and security policy?
As for Kaliningrad, is it not in the interests of all parties to start to find ways to demilitarise this last vestige of the Cold War in Europe?
Â Â  In 1940, as the threat of war loomed, Italy removed from the territory of Slovenian Istria, Koper, Izola and Piran works of art that had been created in those locations under commission from the Church and private individuals.
The works were produced by Italian masters.
Just as Yugoslavia did previously, the Slovenian state has made intensive efforts on behalf of the owners to secure the return of these priceless works.
Italy has avoided taking this matter seriously and rejects all efforts from the Slovenian side for a diplomatic resolution to the problem.
Therefore on 22 September this year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again sent a Note Verbale communicating its renewed request for a diplomatic resolution to this issue.
Italy is bound by international treaty to return everything that it removed from occupied territory, and for this reason we justifiably expect these works of art to be returned to Slovenia.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the Commission statement: âTwenty-fifth anniversary of Solidarity and its message for Europeâ.
In introducing this debate, I must emphasise how Solidarityâs contribution to the events leading to a united Europe may be seen as a chance and an opportunity for a generation to learn about freedom: the West certainly did much for the countries of Eastern Europe under the Soviet yoke, but Solidarity has perhaps done much more for the West and for a generation of Westerners.
Â Â  . Mr President, the historic events of August 1980 started the process which ended the cold war and led to the reunification of Europe.
The action led at that time by SolidarnoÅÄ is a symbol of the value that all Europeans attach to the shared values of freedom and solidarity.
Because of the courage and determination of the leaders of SolidarnoÅÄ and the inspiration it provided to so many, the influence of the strike of shipyard workers in Gdansk did not stop at the Polish borders.
It brought fresh sap to the many buds of dissent and democracy which were then burgeoning throughout central and eastern Europe and which allowed the unification of our continent.
As was mentioned by the President of the Commission in Gdansk on 31Â August, 'Solidarity' was an inspired choice of name for the union which was born from the strike in Gdansk.
It conveyed strength, determination and focus.
Solidarity is today one of the six titles of the European Charter for Fundamental Rights.
The remembrance of the events of August 1980 enriches this word with meaning and emotion.
Freedom was what SolidarnoÅÄ fought for and it is today also closely associated with solidarity as a fundamental value shared by Europeans.
There is no Europe without solidarity.
SolidarnoÅÄ is a meaningful symbol to remind future generations of Europeans of this alliance.
The Commission has been happy to contribute to the commemorative events which took place in Gdansk three weeks ago, to celebrate the 25thÂ anniversary of these historic events, upon the invitation of the Polish Government and of the honourable Members of this Parliament.
The Commission will listen to the views of this House; and, be assured, will look favourably on initiatives aiming to mark 31Â August with the seal of remembrance.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the Solidarity movement had three meanings.
Firstly, for Poland, it meant breaking free from the foreign Soviet model.
Secondly, for Central and Eastern Europe it meant doing away with the division of Europe effected at Yalta at the end of the Second World War.
As a result, the part of Europe cut off from the rest of Europe by Communism was able to regain its rightful place in the mainstream of our continentâs political history.
In this sense, therefore, the events at the Gdansk shipyard, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolution in Kiev are all stages in Europeâs journey to freedom.
Thirdly, for Western Europe Solidarity meant rediscovering the true meaning of values that had disappeared from public life as a result of .
I refer to values such as freedom, solidarity, democracy and the dignity of the individual.
Thanks to Solidarity, many people in Western Europe came to understand that the fundamental values revived by Solidarity had to become part of the fabric of the reorganised and reunited Europe.
The message and significance of these events transcends the experience of a single nation.
They have a far more universal meaning and a pan-European nature.
Their message is one of European unity.
If the Schuman plan is recognised as the basic premise underpinning European integration, then the Gdansk shipyard demands must be seen as heralding another important stage in the process.
In their SeptemberÂ 1981Â message to workers in Central and Eastern Europe, Solidarity activists wrote about the sense of a common fate uniting all Europeans in the eastern part of our continent.
Twenty-five years later that same expression appeared in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, referring on this occasion to the enlarged European Union.
The Solidarity movement highlights the importance of solidarity as the basis of any system of trust and unity.
Solidarity, understood to mean shouldering each otherâs burdens, has a very practical expression indeed as far as the European Union is concerned.
It means financial solidarity regarding security and solidarity in foreign policy.
Only by displaying such solidarity can we attain European unity.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, in July and AugustÂ 1980, Polish workers in Lublin, along the Baltic coast and in many other towns took strike action.
At the end of August this action became a general strike affecting the whole country.
The action was led and organised by an Inter-enterprise Strike Committee and by Lech WaÅÄsa at the Gdansk shipyard.
Workers and the intelligentsia rebelled in the cause of freedom, social justice and dignity.
The slogans of freedom, equality and brotherhood shouted out again from European banners just as they had 200Â years earlier in Paris.
On 31Â August an agreement was signed at the Gdansk shipyard.
In it, the State authorities agreed to the 21Â demands made by the strikers.
This led to the emergence of the Independent and Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity.
The general strike and Solidarityâs activities became a source of hope for workers the world over in the struggle for workersâ rights, a just society and a better world.
Solidarity set off a chain reaction across Eastern Europe, which led eventually to a peaceful democratic revolution and a victory for democracy and human rights.
It also meant the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system and the division of Europe, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Twenty-five years later, here at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, at the political heart of a united Europe, it is fitting to honour the Polish workers and all those who rebelled against oppression and injustice, and played a part in the creation of the Solidarity Trade Union. Particular recognition is due to those who continued to pursue independent activity after the introduction of martial law in Poland.
I would like to pay tribute to all the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, who are to be admired for their struggle in the cause of democracy, human rights and national sovereignty.
MrÂ President, we were not alone in this struggle.
We recall the help Solidarity received from the international trade union movement, from Western European civil society and from democratic governments.
Thank you, Europe!
Thanks are also due to all those Europeans who sided with Solidarity and supported our fight for freedom and democracy when we were in prison or driven underground.
The European Union should be proud of this heritage, proud of having given such proof of brotherhood.
Brotherhood underpins European unity.
In its programme, namely the 21Â Gdansk demands, and also the Self-Governing Republic programme, Solidarity presented a vision of a society and a country bound together by freedom, where human rights were respected and social justice prevailed.
This vision remains relevant today.
Solidarityâs programme can still serve as an inspiration at global level and also at European level, as Europe tackles the challenge of creating an effective economy and a just society.
In todayâs world, Solidarity stands for a refusal to condone poverty and oppression anywhere on the globe.
It demands that the European Union act to wipe poverty off the face of the earth.
In the 21st century, Solidarityâs message demands a European Union foreign policy that actively promotes democracy and human rights, and support for those who are currently persecuted because they belong to a minority.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, on behalf of the Group for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would first like to pay tribute to the Polish workers who set in motion the process of the liberation and unification of Europe.
I am moved and grateful to note that both the European Parliament and the European Commission appreciate the significance of the events that took place on Polish soil 25Â years ago.
Polish workers took to their hearts the message of the Polish Pope, who urged them not to have fear.
It was Polish workers who took action on behalf of their country, which longed for freedom.
In so doing they proved those who believed that the proletariat has no fatherland to be mistaken.
The workers took action in the name of freedom, standing up to a regime and a system that claimed to represent them.
They made political demands, and called for freedom and the establishment of a free trade union to represent them.
The workers also demanded freedom of the press, freedom of information and a state that was not controlled by Communist Party officials.
All these demands expressed something crucial to the very essence of Europe, as they were demands for freedom.
It is also the case that when the Gdansk shipyard workers took action to improve their lot and that of their families, they were aware that their situation was the result of an alien regime that had been imposed on them. It was a regime to which the Polish nation had never consented.
The amazing achievement of this mass movement of 10Â million workers, farm labourers, and members of the intelligentsia was a peaceful revolution.
It was a movement that encompassed the whole of Polish society and amounted to a rebellion against totalitarianism.
âWithout the use of forceâ is a principle worth adhering to in todayâs world too.
It was a movement inspired by values.
We are proud that the word solidarity has become part of the language of politics.
It is a very significant word for us, a truly Polish word, and represents Polandâs contribution to the idea of Europe.
MrÂ President, it is my belief that the unification of Europe began at Gdansk, that East and West came together as a result of the movement started by the Gdansk shipyard workers, and that many other nations followed where Poland and Solidarity led.
Solidarity inspired nations to be reborn and peoples to rise up for freedom.
We feel proud of this, but above all we feel solidarity with those who brought freedom to Georgia through the Rose Revolution and to Ukraine through the Orange Revolution.
We hope that this non-violent example of regime change by way of negotiation, allowing European ideals to become reality, will remain relevant to todayâs world.
I feel sure it is important for Europe that as the European Union seeks its own identity, it should wish today to chart the course taken by the people who worked for the freedom of Europe.
They were the men and women who ended the Cold War and made the unification of Europe possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen from Poland, it is more than merely symbolic that we should, today, not only be welcoming the observers from Bulgaria and Romania, but also remembering the great triumph of Solidarity 25 years ago.
I am glad that the Commission has had something to say about the Solidarity movement today.
One might think there were occasions of greater contemporary relevance and that the celebrations over the past weeks had paid sufficient tribute to history, but our debate today shows that the opposite is the case.
When I joined in the celebrations in Warsaw and Gdansk three weeks ago, it was again brought home to me just how relevant to our own time this groundbreaking historic event actually is.
The legendary strike by Solidarity that we are commemorating is part of our living heritage, and has lost none of its significance in 25 years.
It was the politically and socially oppressed and disadvantaged who, by their courage, succeeded in bringing to an end the totalitarian Communist regimes in Poland and, following on from that, in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe; their boundless desire for reform is on all our lips.
Above all, though, we revere the memory of the victims of these totalitarian regimes, remembering those who were oppressed, arrested, shot dead during protest strikes, condemned and executed after show trials.
One man â the priest, Father Jerzy PopieÅuszko, can be taken as representative of all of them.
The years 1953, 1956, and 1968 are significant in the histories of East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but Solidarity gave impetus and reinforcement to the civil rights movements in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Charta 77, which campaigned for traditional, political human rights, the âSwords into Ploughsharesâ peace campaign in the former East Germany, and the âDunakÃ¶râ environmentalist movement in Hungary.
What all this adds up to is that, without Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would not have fallen.
I speak for this House when I say that debate mattered to those who supported the Solidarity movement in Poland â debate that involved our friends Adam Michnik and Jacek KuroÅ, as well as BronisÅaw Geremek and Janusz Onyskiewicz, who are now Members of this House, and so we are very grateful to them for the way in which they, 25 years ago, laid the foundation stones of a Europe united in peace, freedom and democracy, a Europe guided by social and environmental principles.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the autumn of 1980 when I was 15 years old, I travelled to Poland for the first time in my life.
We were a group of young Swedes cooperating with Polandâs independent movement of students and pupils.
It was a youth movement that, in practice, was a part of Solidarity and of the huge and positive mobilisation that Solidarity stood for in the Polish society of the time.
For me, the visit was a real eye-opener.
The freedoms and rights that I, as a Swedish teenager, took for granted were things for which my Polish contemporaries had to fight hard.
Poland was a society with a shortage of goods and manifest political oppression and, for most Poles, life was hard.
With its demands for freedom, democracy and the right to national self-determination, Solidarity then stood for the hope of a better future.
It was a progressive movement, and not only because it called for the democratisation of Polish society.
As a union, it campaigned for higher wages, better pension conditions, influence in the work place for employees and better health care and child care.
It was a genuinely progressive movement that was put down when, with the support of the Soviet Union, the military assumed power.
In spite of military rule, there was no crushing the demands and hopes symbolised by Solidarity, however.
The fact is that, on a number of occasions, spontaneous organisation on the part of workers, together with demands for independent trade unions, have been decisive in opposing the dictatorships in those countries dominated by the Soviet Union following the war.
Solidarity and the Polish opposition constituted one â and perhaps the most important â of the succession of revolts against oppression.
East Berlin in 1953, Budapest in 1956, Pozna in the same year and Prague in 1968 were cases in which the democratic opposition was put down using violence.
More often than not, it was workers â organised as they were and with their demands for justice and democracy â who were in the front rank of the protesters.
Today, Poland is a political democracy among other political democracies.
Huge progress has been made in crucial areas since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
An important factor behind this â indeed, perhaps the absolutely crucial factor â was Solidarityâs efforts in opposing the old regime.
This development has led to a better future, not only for Poland but for the whole of Europe.
At the same time, a lot remains to be done, considering the social demands made by Solidarity in terms of worker influence and a better standard of living.
Poland is at present a society in which many people are badly off and in which there is very high unemployment.
At the same time, very few people are organised in trade unions, and employees often struggle to make their voices heard.
If something is to be done about this, a strong, well-organised trade union movement is needed.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the 25th anniversary of the emergence of Polandâs Solidarity is not simply an occasion on which to commemorate that event, which marked the beginning of the unification of Europe.
It is also an opportunity to recall a fundamental truth about the activities of people and nations, and about the moral and political foundations of the European Union.
The slogan that inspired millions of members of this trade union in 1980 and 1981 and also during the period of martial law was âThere can be no freedom without Solidarityâ.
We were fully aware that it was upon solidarity between human beings that Solidarity with a capital S was based. That was what ensured its success and indeed its survival.
It is also true that Western politicians and societies took this slogan to heart as they supported the people of Poland in their struggle for national sovereignty and democracy.
This slogan therefore recalls the actions âLet Poland be Polandâ and âSolidarity with Solidarityâ, and also the material aid that the union, its activists and many millions of ordinary Poles received from citizens of countries in the West.
You must believe me, ladies and gentlemen, when I say that the political, moral and material solidarity shown to us by people in the West helped to keep our hopes alive and made us feel that our efforts were not hopeless and that we were not alone.
I experienced this myself.
I should like today to take the opportunity of having the floor in the European Parliament to offer sincere thanks to all those people of good will who expressed solidarity with us.
In their wider meaning, the lessons of solidarity, with and without a capital S, remain valid today.
âThere can be no freedom without Solidarityâ also means that freedom is not an end in itself.
In its economic sense, freedom is essential, but if it is bereft of solidarity it results in the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer and affects individual economies across the whole European Union.
Freedom can easily turn into anarchy or a new kind of oppression if it lacks a moral dimension.
Freedom without solidarity amounts to self-will.
Sooner or later it harms the individual or the community.
It breaks up families and societies.
Those who attempt to install freedom without solidarity and without fundamental rights such as the right to life, justice and honesty are disregarding the rights of others and undermining the community.
Ultimately, they are endangering freedom itself.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Polandâs Solidarity movement came into being a quarter of a century ago.
This peaceful non-violent movement proved as effective as the movement led by the great Mahatma Ghandi a few decades earlier had been.
Ghandiâs movement eventually led to Indian independence, whilst Solidarity was instrumental in Poland regaining its sovereignty and Poles their freedom.
Solidarity was instrumental in much more besides.
It led to the peaceful revolution in Central and Eastern Europe.
Nine years after the so-called outbreak of Solidarity, Czechoslovakia underwent the Velvet Revolution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall followed.
The origins of these events can, however, be traced back to 1980 and to Gdansk, in Poland.
Solidarity was not just a trade union with 10Â million members, representing almost 40% of the adult population of my country.
It was also a movement working for democratic freedoms, free elections, free media and freedom of religion.
I cannot be impartial, as I am a Pole, but even so, I firmly believe that Solidarity was a crucial turning point in our common European 20thÂ century history.
Today, 25Â years later, I should like to pay tribute to Solidarity as a Pole and as a European.
It was largely due to this movement that my country and neighbouring nations gained their freedom.
Our freedom is not all it could be.
We still have many economic and social problems to deal with, but the most important thing is that we do now enjoy real freedom and are in a position to put our own house in order.
I should like to thank the many millions of ordinary working people in my homeland whose efforts enabled us to be in this fortunate position.
Poland and the whole of Europe owe you a debt of gratitude.
We are all indebted to Solidarity.
Â Â  I wholeheartedly welcome the attention devoted by the European Commission and European Parliament to Solidarity, without which we would not be celebrating the collapse of communist totalitarianism or the historic enlargement of the European Union.
On this occasion I cannot ignore the memory of how deeply the phenomenon of Solidarity strengthened the hopes of democrats in Slovenia, and the significance for us at that time of the words of John Paul II, when he said âDo not be afraid.â
As we express our recognition of Solidarity and remember with special reverence those who paid for the desire for freedom and democracy with their lives, we are aware that Solidarity is no museum piece, but an inspiration, a concept, and a much needed way forward, without which European and global development is unimaginable.
We are erecting a monument to Solidarity, but not archiving it, for we wish to develop it further.
There is an obvious need for solidarity between generations, between social partners, between more developed countries and less developed countries in the areas of security, disaster relief and so on. I firmly believe that the quality of our lives in the future will depend on the fulfilment of this essential principle.
I think that following the historic breakthrough we need another period of Solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, a certain measure of modesty is in order for someone who, like me, was born in the Netherlands in peacetime after the Second World War.
I think that today is the right time for people who have not lived under the yoke of Communism to pay their respects to those who, particularly in Poland, rose against a regime that we all considered reprehensible.
It was a very special chapter in Polandâs history and I am delighted that we are commemorating it today in this Parliament, in Strasbourg.
Although it forms an important part of Polish history, it is not for the Poles alone, for the example of â Solidarity â has led to much discussion and movement and has had an enormous impact outside Poland.
I would say that, even after 25 years, Solidarity is a household word in my country, the Netherlands, too.
What was so special was that the workers at a Gdansk shipyard staged a protest, went on strike, but also enjoyed the support of a group of prominent intellectuals who were prepared to stick their necks out and oppose the regime in Poland.
I think that it was, in fact, an example of the best the labour movement as we have known it in Europe had to offer, the democratic labour movement that, in terms of freedom, political awareness and emancipation, has also had great significance in our countries.
It has also, I think, been a source of inspiration to many, not only in Eastern European countries, but also in Western Europe, and people, not least in the Netherlands, have also often been surprised at the moral fibre of the strikers in Gdansk who stood up to the Communist regime in this fashion.
We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the work of Solidarity also meant the beginning of the end of a fantastic revolution in Polandâs history; we can now say that Poland has at long last found its rightful place, free in Europe.
That is also the Poland that, to my mind, should be the centre of attention.
The Polish struggle for freedom, and its history, enrich our continent; the story of the Polish plumber become even more poignant in the light of this historic role.
Although Solidarity lives on in Poland and in the hearts of the Polish people, as is evident once again today, it also deserves to be remembered as a shining, European example.
Â Â  Mr President, the Socialists of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw it as the ideal that human society should be based on the equality of all people and on their mutual solidarity; that people should not be made subordinate to the state or their employer, and that we should be free to make our own choices and organise society from the bottom up.
They were aware that, in a society in which one group oppresses the other, nobody â not even the oppressors â can be really free.
This belief would certainly have led those old Socialists, including their great thinker Karl Marx, to applaud the Polish workersâ protest in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century.
Any authoritarian regime that skimps on wages and benefits while favouring a small group of people deserves to go under as a result of mass protest.
Normally speaking, workersâ protests are directed at big businessâ desire for profit or at a government that considers itself to be right-wing.
That was certainly not the case in Poland, where the state was founded upon Socialism, the intellectual legacy of Marx, common ownership of the means of production and the equality of all people.
That state was not the product of the working class struggle, but of the way in which, after the Second World War, the victors shared out the military spheres of influence .
The people experienced the reality of that moment as the complete opposite of what Socialists claim to pursue.
That is one of the reasons that in the mid-80s, I was a speaker at a meeting in the Netherlands for solidarity with the suppressed independent trade union in Poland.
I have never shared the opinion that workers should be content with their leaders when these call themselves Socialists or Communists.
Meanwhile, people holding strongly differing opinions talk about Solidarityâs legacy, both inside and outside Poland.
To one group, it represented the return to the Conservative Poland of the Pilsudski period between the wars; to the other, it was a necessary step towards the replacement of the caricature of Socialism conceived after 1945 by a real, Socialist democracy.
The former opinion appears, for the time being, to have the upper hand; while not deploring this outcome, I do consider the resistance to unacceptable rule an inherent right of all people, and Solidarity an inspiring example.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Solidarity made it possible for me to be in this Chamber today, and I am eternally grateful to it for that, and for not having been condemned to life behind the Iron Curtain.
Had it not been for Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would have fallen later, or might even still be standing.
Attempts had been made previously by the Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians to overthrow that diabolical system, but it was the Poles and the Polish Pope who eventually succeeded in dismantling the agreements reached at Yalta.
I should today like to thank the countries of Western Europe and the United States for their support.
It should be remembered, however, that Stalin was not the only guilty party.
Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed half of Europe to the Soviets at Yalta, hoping for peace and quiet and to make things easier for themselves.
The example of Solidarity shows us how many long years it can take to put mistakes right.
With Parliamentâs consent, the Union is now opening negotiations with Turkey.
I fear this may be the beginning of the end for the Union, and I regret it very much, as I am in favour of a common Europe.
We should show solidarity with the whole world, but not betray Europe in the name of internationalism.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the left has just been voted out of office in Poland lends added poignancy to this debate.
I congratulate MrÂ Saryusz-Wolski and the Civic Platform, as well as the Law and Justice Party, on their victory in yesterday's general election, and I am sure Poland has a great future under new leadership.
Lech WaÅÄsa is the most prominent personification of Solidarity and its success.
He was in Brussels recently to receive the acclaim of this House on its important anniversary.
He has won many honours from countries and organisations around the world in recognition of his courage and vision, perhaps the greatest honour being his election as Poland's President after Communism crumbled.
Britain has always felt a special affinity with Poland, and this was evidenced in the early 1980s when Poland was going through very difficult times.
It was a British Conservative Minister for Foreign Affairs, Malcolm Rifkind, who went to Warsaw and became the first western politician to meet with representatives of Solidarity, an act that infuriated the Communist regime.
This meeting was symbolic of the deep bond between Britain and Poland.
All through those grim years we in Britain never forgot Poland, nor did we ever lose our conviction that democracy and freedom would ultimately prevail and that Poland would once again take its honoured place in the European family.
It is easy to forget the speed with which Europe has moved on from those dark days and what life was like for those under the yoke of Communist tyranny.
That is why it is so important that we never forget, and with Poland rightly taking its place in the European Union last year we can be sure that those who suffered and those who inflicted the suffering will not be forgotten.
Solidarity symbolised then, as it does now, hope in the future, the determination of people to build better lives for themselves and their families and an unshakeable belief in the power of the human spirit.
Political systems can subjugate wills and extinguish individuality but they can never quench the desire to be free.
We would all do well to learn the lessons that Solidarity's history teaches us.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Gdansk shipyards, for the benefit of the previous speakers, where the 25th anniversary of the start of the Solidarity strikes in 1980 was celebrated, employed 6Â 000 workers.
Today, now that the shipyards have been privatised, two thirds of the workforce was dismissed in the 1990s.
Mr Walesa and Solidarity, of course, did not go on any strikes because it was they who dismissed them.
In the town of Gdansk, which you have as a symbol, poverty reigns.
Unemployment exceeds 15%.
In âfreeâ Poland, working farmers, the grass roots, live in drastic conditions.
The standard of living is plummeting.
Fourteen years after the overthrow of socialism, the Poles are consuming less, including less basic foods, than in 1980.
All social achievements have been eroded.
Foreign capital is plundering the country.
Farmers are being wiped out and new latifundia are being created.
The course of events demonstrates, therefore, that Solidarity was the Trojan Horse for the restoration of capitalism in Poland.
The leaders deceived the workers.
They projected pro-labour demands, trapped them and brought them to this pass.
They had economic and political support from the United States and governments in other capitalistic countries, which are today reaping huge profits for capital and creating poverty among the Polish people.
For the benefit of the previous speakers, Walesa's slogans of alleged freedom and solidarity for the workers, led them â impoverished, subjugated and disenfranchised â into the hands of the capitalists.
As far as democracy in Poland is concerned, let me quote you just one statistic: 20% voted in the last European elections.
That is what they think about the European Union.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I should like to say to the previous speaker that those workers and others would not, at any price, wish to turn the clock back to the time before Solidarity.
There are few events one wishes to refer to with pride and pleasure, particularly in this House.
In my view, solidarity is a concept that deserves a special entry in all encyclopaedias.
It is not easy to show solidarity.
It is often necessary to sacrifice oneâs own interests, national interests and possibly higher ones too.
The European Union is not a cohesive unit like a nation, an ethnic group, or maybe a political one.
That is why an effort of solidarity is needed.
It was only thanks to the determination and solidarity of workers, students, farmers, academics and sometimes of police and army officers that refused to be intimidated, along with the solidarity shown by people from abroad, that it was possible to force the dinosaurs clinging on to power to surrender it.
That enabled ordinary decent people to reinstate respectable values.
If we find it within us to recognise the meaning of the Solidarity movement, and to learn this historic lesson, we shall be in a position to hope that the measures voted through in this House will be implemented.
We shall also be in a position to hope that the coordinated body known as the Union will gradually come into being.
Europe is too complex and diverse for this aim to be achieved without solidarity.
Solidarity must be promoted in this House, in the Commission, and through educational and cultural programmes.
It needs to be grafted onto all Europeans.
At the same time, we should be developing a broader solidarity that could be termed supra-continental, in order to help deal with the problems facing mankind.
Allow me to emphasise that without solidarity there can be no future for Europe or for mankind as a whole.
In its 1980 version, solidarity began in Åwidnik and Lublin, and it made it possible for us to be able to discuss fundamental values in this House today.
It is for contemporary European solidarity to ensure that at the end of the next 25Â years, Members will be able to speak in similar terms about todayâs Parliament and Commission, and credit them with playing a leading role in the historical process we are all involved in.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today we are commemorating the 25th anniversary of Polish Solidarity and debating its message for Europe.
We remember the days and months when the Polish people could take no more and when Polish workers went on strike in Gdansk.
We remember the fight that set in motion so much more than simply the struggle for Polish freedom. What it set in motion was the fight for the freedom of the whole of Eastern Europe.
The first stone to fall from the Berlin Wall fell not in Berlin but in Gdansk.
We often forget, however, that the strike and the solidarity in Gdansk were preceded by years of Polish revolt against Communism.
Many fought for freedom, doing so each independently and in different ways, but there was no combined force uniting all Poles around the same idea.
Only when a Polish pope was installed in the Vatican did the Poles realise that they were united by their spiritual inheritance and that there were forces that would take them forward to independence and autonomy.
And so it came to pass.
I myself was living at that time in Communist Yugoslavia and clearly remember the pictures from Gdansk.
I could not understand how anyone could actually believe it was possible to topple Communism.
When, almost two decades after Gdansk, the people of Serbia protested against Milosevicâs regime, they had learned something from Solidarity.
They had learned that totalitarian regimes do not go on forever, but can in actual fact come tumbling down.
They had also learned that democracy must always come about from within and that victory necessarily falls to a unified people fighting for its freedom.
The most important message for Europe had already been sent by Solidarity.
My fellow Member, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt from Sweden, who belongs to a party whose leader still calls himself a Communist, has just made a speech in which he paid tribute to Solidarity, a movement that fought specifically against Communism.
This too is a message sent by Solidarity to Europe: that Europe does not tolerate either Communist, or any other, dictatorships or, indeed, any systems of totalitarianism or enslavement.
The future of Europe lies in freedom, and that is something we all defend, and today most especially by expressing our respect for, and gratitude towards, the people of Poland and Eastern Europe who fought for a free Europe during the 1980s and 90s.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Solidarity was an extraordinary experiment involving a community that developed on the basis of common values and confidence in freedom.
In AugustÂ 1980 Polish workers demanded freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief and above all freedom to set up free trade unions and an end to persecution for reasons of conviction.
Millions of Poles said ânoâ to Communism, and this was the beginning of the end of the Communist dictatorship.
We called on the nations of Eastern Europe to engage in the struggle for civil liberties, which involved building a civil society.
We did so with determination and strong in the belief that freedom can be won in spite of all overtly political restrictions.
Millions of individuals committed themselves in solidarity to the life of their own country, a country that was free for 16Â months until 13Â December, when GeneralÂ Jaruzelskiâs Communist dictatorship struck against this movement with a .
It was impossible to stifle or break our spirit, however, and we continued to live as free people.
Communism was mortally wounded at the Gdansk shipyard in AugustÂ 1980, and received its nine years later in 1989.
We were helped in our struggle by other European nations.
France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom all supported us.
This gave us courage and a belief in our own strength, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who stood by us at that time.
It was thanks to you that we survived, strong in the knowledge that Europe was thinking of us and that we had not been forgotten.
To what extent can the ideals of solidarity move hearts and consciences today?
Nowadays, reflecting about Solidarity means reflecting about the nature of Europe.
Europe is more than an economy and a market.
It also stands for the values that make the European Community great.
Europe is a family of nations built on a Christian heritage.
Solidarity was founded on Christian principles and it strove to reawaken the best of human values in people.
I refer to taking responsibility for each other, and being prepared to help those in need.
The Solidarity ethic could contribute to the creation of a contemporary vision of Europe that would awaken the interest of the world.
Reflecting about Solidarity nowadays also means reflecting about how to counter national egoism amongst the 25Â Member States of the Union.
I am confident that this can be achieved.
I believe in a European Union imbued with solidarity, a Union that is capable of being competitive, but which is simultaneously capable of demonstrating solidarity with the small and the weak.
I believe in a Union that will hold high the banner of Solidarity and freedom, and be an inspiration to those who lack them.
Â Â  Mr President, 25 years ago Polish workers and intellectuals succeeded in creating a democratic civic alternative to the rigid communist structures.
SolidarnoÅÄ started the process of East European nations becoming genuinely free from totalitarian enslavement.
The other lung of the same European homeland, to quote Pope John PaulÂ II, started to breathe and to bring oxygen and self-respect to tens of millions of Eastern Europeans.
Poland is a symbol for Europe.
It was the first victim of the alliance of Hitler and Stalin, who together launched the Second World War.
The Polish nation experienced the worst of both of these dictatorships.
It is not by chance perhaps that the victory of the Gdansk workers opened the way for the reunification of Europe.
I think the most significant achievement of SolidarnoÅÄ was its ability to unite all sectors of society.
It was not possible without a moral revival, without the spiritual dimension of which a Polish pope became the embodiment, reminder and inspiration.
The important message of SolidarnoÅÄ's victory remains how to find both strength and balance in the passionate quest for justice and the eternal spiritual values of Europe.
Listening to this message would probably help us to overcome the crisis of European identity, of which there was talk today, because SolidarnoÅÄ has become part of our European identity.
We have an opportunity to decide on celebrating 31Â August as a day of freedom and solidarity, but another date of European significance needs to be remembered.
On 23Â August, the date on which the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed in 1939, we should commemorate the victims of both communism and Nazism.
Only then will the famous slogan, 'Never again', also apply to the victims of communism.
Â Â  I have received four motions for resolutions(1), tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Solidarity is not exclusively part of Polandâs heritage.
Solidarity, together with its values and ethos, should become part of the heritage of the whole of Europe and indeed of the whole of the world.
That is precisely why it is important for Solidarity to become a permanent feature of our European consciousness.
As stated in our resolutions, 25Â years ago the workers of GdaÅsk opened a new chapter in the European struggle for bread and freedom.
It was the workers of PoznaÅ, where I come from, who actually launched the struggle 49Â years ago.
On 28Â JuneÂ 1956 several dozen of them died at the hands of Communists. They died because they demanded bread and freedom.
Fortunately neither their deaths, nor the deaths of the workers who died in DecemberÂ 1970, were in vain.
Solidarity has global significance because it was a peaceful movement but also a victorious one.
Solidarity's story inspires optimism and confidence, as it proved that even a Communist totalitarian regime could be brought down without the use of force.
It would be wonderful if Solidarity's methods and values became an effective way in which all people living under oppressive regimes could fight for freedom, dignity and human rights.
Solidarity demonstrated that it makes sense to hope for a better life, and that perseverance and belief in one's principles will bear fruit.
I am convinced that the European Union of 25Â Member States would not exist today if Lech WaÅÄsa and his companions had not acted as they did 25Â years ago.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0257/2005) by MrÂ Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (COM(2004)0486 C6-0141/2004 2004/0155(COD)), and also on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (COM(2004)0486 C6-0144/2004 2004/0159(COD)).
Â Â  , . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Alexander Radwan and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the excellent work done on this dossier.
Let me stress that the work on the Capital Requirements Directive has been a very good example of efficient cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Considering the complexity of the issues involved, I think this has been a real achievement.
A state-of-the-art accepted supervisory framework for both credit institutions and investment firms is important for the financial stability of the European market and in creating a level playing field, not just within the European Union, but across the global financial community compared to those countries also following the Basel II process.
Our proposal has been prepared in close cooperation with Member States and the finance industry and was subject to extensive consultation.
It is in line with the Basel II Accord, but takes account of European specificities where necessary.
Even the latest proposals for the treatment of trading-related activities will be included.
This proposal provides a regulatory framework for financial activities in the EU.
It improves the supervisory regime currently in place, which is primarily based on regulatory capital requirements.
The new regime will have a solid basis of three pillars.
Firstly, more risk-sensitive regulatory capital requirements, which are closer in line with banksâ own practices; secondly, an enhanced supervisory review process to ensure a closer fit of these new requirements; and, thirdly, disclosure requirements which improve transparency and market discipline.
This proposal represents a move to an altogether more sophisticated and refined approach to supervision and risk management.
By adopting this proposal, the EU will be the first international organization to implement the new Basel II framework.
This will be a major step towards better banking supervision and will foster greater effectiveness of the European financial markets.
Let me now turn to the comitology issue.
As we all know, this debate is linked to the wider question of the powers of the Council and the European Parliament in the comitology procedures.
We need to make sure that the legislative process does not come to a halt.
I do not believe that our citizens and the industry would understand that important legislative proposals, such as those on the table today, are taken hostage on account of an issue such as comitology â important as it may be.
We need to find a pragmatic way to ensure a smooth legislative conclusion to the comitology provisions in the Capital Requirements Directive.
I welcome the efforts made by the European Parliament and the Council to find agreement on this issue.
I think we all agree that adoption in first reading of this directive is in the interest of all three institutions and it is also what the marketplace wants.
Comitology being a general issue, we must look at it in its general context.
The Commission submitted a proposal for a modification of the 1999Â Comitology Decision in 2002, followed by an amended proposal in 2004.
This proposal already took into account important elements requested by the European Parliament, in particular that the European Parliament and the Council should be put on an equal footing as regards their powers in the comitology procedures.
It is in large part thanks to the persistence of Parliament, and of your rapporteur in particular, that the Council will now take up work on revising the Comitology Decision, using the Commissionâs revised proposal as a basis.
I welcome the initiative taken by the Presidency to set up a âFriends of the Presidencyâ group to launch the discussion on the Commission proposal in the Council.
This is an important step forward.
The European Parliament must confirm urgently whether its support of the Commission proposal still holds and if not, identify clearly what it wants to achieve.
The Commission stands ready to cooperate both with Parliament and the Council to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on this delicate matter as soon as possible.
Let me make only a few more specific points.
I understand the European Parliamentâs interest in creating a much stronger sense of urgency with regard to the question of its powers to supervise the Commissionâs exercise of its implementing powers.
But introducing a sunset clause, coming into force on 1 January 2007, would be too short.
There is a serious danger that such a drastic reduction in the duration of the sunset clause would send a wrong and dangerous signal to the marketplace that the adoption of the necessary implementing measures could become highly uncertain.
The Council has indicated that a period of at least two years is acceptable.
In the light of the discussions that have taken place, the Commission considers that this is a viable period.
The introduction of such a reduced period for implementing powers â much shorter than the normal period of four years â clearly emphasizes the need urgently to find a solid, lasting and balanced solution for the supervision of the Commissionâs implementing powers by both branches of the legislative authority.
All institutions must work together to reach this solution as quickly as possible.
In this regard, the Commission notes that in the first half of 2007, the first sunset clauses under the so-called Lamfalussy process will start suspending the Commissionâs implementing powers for two directives - the Conglomerates Directive on 11 February 2007 and the Market Abuse Directive on 12 April 2007.
While the Commission lives by the commitments made by the then President, Romano Prodi, and my predecessor Frits Bolkestein, when the European Parliament approved the Lamfalussy process, the Commission understands that a renewal of its implementing powers for those directives would be problematic in the absence of an overall solution on comitology.
This very fact should motivate all institutions to make progress.
Failure to agree would not only spoil the spirit of cooperation between the institutions, it would also be detrimental to the further development of an integrated financial services market, which relies heavily on the availability of executive powers within the context of framework legislation agreed by codecision.
I would also add that other policy areas would be affected from a lack of agreement on comitology.
Before concluding, I would like to reiterate my call on both Parliament and the Council to work constructively towards a solution.
The Commission from its side will assist wherever it can to ensure that the sense of urgency that is now being given to this matter does not evaporate.
The Commission has long recognized the need for a solution to be found and I believe that the conditions are now ripe for this.
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is for once no mere formality that I start by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and all members of the Committee for having made it possible for us all to work together on this directive in a constructive manner.
I would also like to thank the Commission for working with us over recent years â for this draft did not come into being overnight â and enabling us to make progress.
I see this as being, perhaps, a good example of how we can work together on making laws in the future.
This evening, I would like, at the outset, to point out a fly in the ointment.
I agree with the Chairman of our Committee that we are engaged in making laws that will have far-reaching effects on Europeâs financial sector and small and medium-sized businesses, and, speaking on behalf of our President, I would remind you, Mr President, and the Bureau too, that this House possesses full legislative powers in this area.
Perhaps you could look through the agendas for this week and find another subject, another position where we adopt acts under the codecision procedure, unless you really do think that everything we discuss this week is of high priority.
I refer here also to the Doorn report, which also has to do with Parliamentâs full legislative powers.
In dealing with this directive, Parliament has always emphasised that it is important to us that certain areas be made Basel-compatible.
Basel is an international agreement.
We have always seen the small business sector as important.
It was always important to us that there should, in this regulatory framework, be special arrangements made for small banks, in order that they should not be squeezed out of the competition; take for example the partial application, or the demand in the report that banks opting in future for the Standardised Approach, should not be discriminated against by the national supervisory bodies.
Another example I would give is that of the granularity agreed on in Basel and present in the Commission proposal, but which is absent from Parliamentâs resolution and must not be re-inserted through the back door.
I would point out that this needs also to be transposed by the national parliaments and incorporated into supervisory practice.
There are a number of new things in this directive that will change financial supervision in Europe, for example the Lead Supervisor System, under which one supervisor can overrule another when approving internal ratings, and which puts us on the way to a European market.
Another example, and one on which there was a great deal of consensus in this House, was the disclosure of ratings, which is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses, and I am grateful to the Council for eventually accepting Parliamentâs proposed compromise on this.
There was lengthy discussion of intergroup exposuresI maintained from the very outset that banksâ internal loans should receive equal treatment based on the risks involved, for this document is about risk rather than competition.
It is because different structures already exist in Europe that we should not prescribe structures for this, for we cannot say that one is better than another.
We must, though, weigh up their merits.
Here, too, we have come up with a compromise, and so we have achieved a good result as regards the substance.
Comitology is a weak point and will remain one.
I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has always given the Lamfalussy procedureâs comitology its backing, believing this to be right and important in terms of quick legislation that meets the needs of the market, but we had always considered the former Lamfalussy agreement in the light of a future constitution, by providing for a callback mechanism.
Today, we need no new debate on the Constitution, but if, in future, we come to draft more directives using Lamfalussy comitology, we will need to conclude a new agreement on the subject to secure Parliamentâs rights by providing that, where we delegate them, we can also âcall them backâ, by which I mean better scrutiny, more options for definitions and also the general withdrawal of the delegated power if things start to go wrong.
As I will not be able to take the floor when we discuss the Doorn report, let me briefly say that there is one area that is excluded from its resolution.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will, though, in future, be responsible for the International Accounting Standards.
As I see it, though, even if this is not what we decide tomorrow, this agreement should also include the international convention on accounting standards.
It is not acceptable that, in the future, international bodies should define standards and that these should be implemented without scrutiny by this House.
Let me just remind the House that we had a visit some time ago from some people from the Board of the IAS, who informed us that they were working on standards for SMEs.
We will not â and I say this not least for the Commissionâs benefit â accept these standards without the necessary scrutiny.
I hope we are on the right track here, and, to the Presidency, I would say that I hope that it will take on board the compromises we have put forward today.
I am optimistic, not only as regards the date for the sunset clause, but also as regards the recitals, about our chances of achieving a good compromise this week and that we will succeed in our aim of getting this adopted at first reading.
What I hear from many Member States is that they are doing these things already, and I believe we are on the right track towards achieving this.
It is down to the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes the compromise that the rapporteur has hammered out.
The author of the position expresses her support for most of the objectives and the need for the updating of the provisions to take account of the considerable progress that has been made in the techniques of risk assessment and financial services management, while also proposing amendments that might help to simplify the system of equity capital requirements.
A number of amendments have to do with national discretion, which is to be removed for the sake of greater regulatory harmonisation in the internal market.
I might add that many of these deletions have been recommended to the national supervisory bodies.
The draftsman of the opinion also takes the view that it was very definitely the right thing to do to take Article 47(2) of the EC Treaty as the basis for this proposal.
As a directive is the instrument best suited to achieving the desired objectives, the principle of subsidiarity is complied with, as is the principle of proportionality, since the directive goes no further than doing that which is absolutely necessary.
I would like to add a number of comments on comitology from the point of view not only of the Legal Affairs Committee, but also of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and will be commenting on them later on.
As financial markets and banks are liable to undergo rapid change, with new products and combinations of products constantly having to be developed, the law on banking and banking supervision must also be capable of being further developed.
Basel II must not be allowed to degenerate into a framework from which one chooses the financial instruments one fancies, but must instead never lose sight of the need to protect creditors, investors and consumers.
The dialogue between legislators, supervisors and banks, both at national and European level, referred to in the Lamfalussy procedure can also help to keep supervision appropriate to the function concerned.
I will enlarge on this point later on.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to our Chamber.
My role in this debate consists exclusively of explaining what has happened in this Parliament during comitology and expressing my full support for the position of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Radwan.
The problems in relation to comitology began some years ago now, when the Commission presented Parliament with the financial services action plan, which proposed the rapid implementation of forty-something measures in the field of financial services.
We were told at that point that the ordinary legislative procedure was too slow to keep up to date with the speed of the financial markets.
I spoke here to say that, in the vast majority of cases, Parliament was not responsible for this delay, but rather the Council.
The next step was what we know as the Lamfalussy report, after the person in charge of drawing it up, who, with a view to providing a solution, to adapting the speed of the procedure to the speed of the markets, proposed splitting the legislation into two levels.
First level: general principles, basic guidelines. Second level: concrete legal rules.
Level one, codecision.
Level two, complete exclusion of Parliament.
We were asked to surrender the prerogatives that should be the privileges, the basic rules, of any European Parliament.
It is quite understandable that the European Parliament should express its suspicion.
We simply wanted to be in the same position as the Council.
In the event that boundaries were overstepped, in the event that the attorney did not keep to the limits of their mandate, we wanted a call-back.
It was not possible at that time, because the Treaties did not allow it, and we were waiting for the Constitution.
We have reached a transitional situation â and I would stress transitional â and I would therefore call for the sunset clause that MrÂ Radwan has mentioned.
Until then it will be necessary to reach an agreement that harmonises the two objectives: speed in the legislative procedure and respect for Parliamentâs powers, powers which, as is the case for any Parliament, have been hard won over time.
I would like finally to explain our suspicion by recalling a Spanish politician renowned for his skill and ability in fiddling the rules, who said, âyou make the law, but leave it to me to make the regulationâ.
That is the danger we are worried about.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me start by saying âthank youâ to the rapporteur for the willingness to cooperate that he has demonstrated, which enabled Social Democratsâ main concerns to be accommodated.
We believe that banking supervision must be internationally agreed and of the same kind throughout the EU, and that, in particular the banksâ equity capital required by law must be more rigorously adjusted to take account of commercial risks.
It is only in this way that the savers can be put in a more secure position and their savings safeguarded against the event of their bank failing.
Modern banks both manage private householdsâ assets and keep their accounts, while also being their advisers and agents on the financial markets.
The economic efficiency of the finance they provide and of the capital they invest is dependent on their remaining competitive.
The finance they provide plays an important part in the further development of the EU through its infrastructure, housebuilding, municipalities, energy industry and, not least, its small and medium-sized business.
Basel II includes objective points of reference for assessing the risks involved in providing this finance, along with the banksâ associated equity capital costs and the interest charged to debtors.
This picture is completed by the adoption of my amendments on easier retail credit for SMEs and the liability of regional and local authorities in the computation of the risk element.
Basel II should not, then, result in finance becoming harder to come by or more expensive.
The banks also bear an economic responsibility, and Basel II must not be misused as an excuse to the detriment of debtors or at their expense.
Basel II is also intended to create a level playing field for competition between the big banking groups and the savings banks and credit unions that operate on a regional basis, and it was for that reason that I pressed for the greatest possible objectivity in the treatment of what are termed inter-bank loans.
I would like, not least, to highlight what is now the dual responsibility of the national supervisory agencies as regards both the monitoring of the banksâ more precise risk assessment methods and supporting banks that operate in more than one country when the supervisory authorities in both countries cooperate with one another.
Last but not least, I would like to revisit the subject of comitology.
The rules on information and transparency that Parliament is demanding for Basel II are actually taken for granted in modern legislation, and that should also be reflected in the right of recall.
What we want from the Council is a guarantee that, in two yearsâ time at the latest, there will be a solid agreement enabling Parliament to continue to exercise its democratic rights and responsibilities.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the object of this draft directive is the implementation of Basel II in the European Union, thereby establishing a basis on which the financial markets may be made more stable.
Banking supervision can be made more efficient and greater weight attached to the risk element involved.
The directive will also impose minimum standards for high-risk businesses.
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have discussed Basel II in depth and worked our way through some 900 amendments, along with a whole array of compromise amendments that the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, drafted together with Mr Ettl and myself.
I would like at this point to express my gratitude for the high degree of trust in all this and for the constructive cooperation that we enjoyed.
In the ensuing troika discussions, the Council accepted many of Parliamentâs amendments, and we managed to extract several concessions and compromises from it, with the effect that the technical substance of Basel II can be regarded as balanced.
Speaking as a Liberal, I am particularly glad that we have managed to come up with rules that are capable of ensuring fair competitive conditions between the various groups in the banking sector.
This is a package that the Liberals and Democrats can strongly endorse.
It does, however include two amendments on Islamic loans and mortgages, and one on energy companies, to which we cannot give our backing, for Basel II was not intended to be used as a means of putting in place special safeguards for certain sectors of industry or creating special conditions for them.
Despite that, we will, as a group, be voting in favour of the whole package.
It was our group that introduced the amendments relating to the trading book We see it as a very good thing that the good and fast work done by the Commission has now made it possible for these to be adopted in the course of the voting on Basel II, thus ensuring consistent implementation in this area.
Discussion of Basel II has of course touched on the subject of comitology, something about which all speakers have already had something to say.
The importance and usefulness of the comitology procedure is not a matter of dispute for any of us; it is a means whereby the rules implementing basic acts may be speedily enacted, but it is a procedure that must not be allowed to undermine Parliamentâs prerogatives, for the enhancement of which the Constitutional Treaty makes provision.
Uncertain though the future of that Treaty may be, Parliamentâs concerns still matter and are still relevant.
As was only to be expected, the troika negotiations on comitology proved to be particularly problematic.
Weeks of pressure on our part prompted the Council to create a working party called âFriends of the Presidencyâ, which Commissioner McCreevy mentioned, thereby acknowledging for the first time the need for a new inter-institutional agreement and for action to be taken.
We cannot, though, be satisfied with mere promises.
What we want is a definite date by which there will be a new inter-institutional agreement to reinforce our rights
To the Council, we propose 1 January 2008 as the date for the sunset clause, and now await its response, which we hope will turn out to be favourable.
Â Â  . Mr President, capital requirements are regarded as useful in preventing bank failure because they make shareholders bear more of the cost of failure.
The international Basel II proposals, which this directive implements, are designed to achieve a better match between capital and risk than the simple 8% capital asset ratio of Basel I. However, no amount of bank capital, short of 100% of risk assets, can safeguard against failure.
The minimum amounts of capital specified in any regulatory scheme are arbitrary.
As Mr Radwan stressed, other problems are the extent to which risk-spreading amongst individual banks of a banking group should imply a reduction in regulatory capital, and the difficulty of defining the division of responsibility across national supervisors.
There are no objective answers to those vexed questions.
For that reason I question the competence of this Parliament in this field.
It is ridiculous that we should be involved in the minutiae of this directive given how complex and yet how important it is.
But this is how Parliament works, with all of us Members, however experienced or inexperienced in the arcane arts of banking regulation, expected to make hundreds of reasoned judgments on questions, many of which cannot be answered in any objective way.
The rapporteur recommends that, owing to doubt, this directive should be reviewed in the future.
The banking industry does not need that.
Banks spend their time dealing with risk and uncertainty.
Adding further uncertainty over future regulation will not help them to plan or look after our interests as customers and shareholders.
The bottom line is that there is no right amount of regulatory capital.
If we kept that in mind when legislating, we would come up with rules that are a great deal simpler, and the Members of this Parliament would be spared from the farcical exercise of voting on hundreds of amendments.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, for his timely report.
The financial services sector has become very sophisticated at risk management and so the regulatory framework has to respond to the times.
I am very satisfied with the report on the table today.
It acknowledges the fact that covered bonds are a global capital markets product and are no longer either a European or domestic product.
I believe that any alternative to that would handicap the development of the sector, which has significant commercial potential.
According to a study conducted by JPÂ Morgan, Basel II could increase the number of high-yield bonds â and especially covered bonds â being issued. That would be advantageous from an Irish perspective because Irish covered bond issues have the highest credit rating.
Therefore it is important that Basel II upholds current market practice in the covered bond area.
Banks have a long history of lending money and we sometimes take it for granted that they are fully prepared for the traditional risks such as credit and market risks.
However, nowadays banks are facing increasingly unpredictable operational risks, which are difficult to manage.
Under Basel II it would become essential that risks analytics are timely assigned to financial services operations.
It would be interesting to know what the expenditure of financial services institutions will be on analytics in the EU after the introduction of Basel II.
Therefore I welcome the proposed review of this regulation after four years.
At the same time, however, it would be unwise to underestimate the importance of risk management in the traditional areas of credit and market risks.
In today's economic climate there is a growing need for detailed analysis of the effects of recession and other financial shocks on national economies and the EU.
Under the standards set by Basel II the banking sector will have to invest in the development of IT systems capable of modelling in-depth credit risk analysis.
The way in which financial services are conducted has changed and will continue to change.
However successful risk management cannot be solely based on a compulsory reply to regulations.
It requires a sound understanding of what is good for business and the standard of best practice.
Â Â  Mr President, for many small and medium-sized businesses, Basel II is a matter of life and death.
They worry a great deal about it; there has been a great deal of discussion about it.
I believe that they should have complete confidence in the rapporteur.
Even though his report has accomplished many things, there is one aspect I would like to mention in the short speaking time available to me, and that is that whether there really will be fair competition among sources of credit, and then perhaps also among those who apply for it, will be dependent on what is agreed in this House.
It is fortunate that we are only at first reading stage.
I do think, though, that Amendment 140, which is an attempt to introduce more transparency by calling on the credit institutions to provide the SMEs and other firms that have applied for loans with written clarification of how they arrived at their rating decisions, will be essential if the market is not to be even more distorted.
We will then have to wait and see what comes out at the other end â the right degree of transparency or excessive regulation.
It would be nice if we could lay down a timeframe for this, at least at second reading.
I would certainly be in favour of a sunset clause, about which everything has in any case already been said, and I hope that Mr Radwanâs report gets through in such a shape as to maintain the balance he is seeking.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to compliment Mr Radwan on the extremely able way in which he has steered this complex directive to this advanced stage.
We all hope that the Council of Ministers will now be able to take the steps needed to make a first reading agreement possible.
Surely the Presidency can make a supreme effort and undertake to reach a conclusion on the comitology issue to a mutually agreeable timescale.
So much has been agreed on the complex, technical issues that it would surely be a shame â in fact, an absurd embarrassment â not to close the remaining gap.
It is surely reasonable for Parliament to aspire to a role in the legislative process which is equivalent to that of the other branch of the legislature â the Council.
Our constituents expect that.
Indeed most of them assume that is already the case.
All that we ask is for the Council to assess that aspiration with dispatch.
The industry needs timely legal certainty and will not readily forgive either of us â Parliament or the Council â if in the face of all common sense we allow this important directive to fail for what might appear to the outside world to be interinstitutional niceties.
I now turn to international considerations.
Almost every European banking, insurance and asset management business will be affected by this new regime and will have to shoulder the costs of adjusting their systems.
In America, on the other hand, only the largest international banks will have to comply.
The competitive benefits will probably induce at least some of their medium-sized competitors to adopt Basel II too.
However, even the smaller European financial institutions will have to comply and bear quite substantial financial costs in so doing, while their American competitors, such as asset management firms, will not have to.
How will the Commission ensure a level playing field for our financial institutions of all shapes and sizes in the global marketplace?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an agreement at first reading on a text that could scarcely be more complex, in the context of which 304 amendments will be easily adopted.
That is, if Parliament can work intelligently when it has to.
That being said, what is at stake in the text, as everyone can see, is absolutely huge.
The text strikes a balance between an approach sensitive to risk and one that is sensitive to real challenges in terms of competition, whether within or outside the Europe Union.
I will make three remarks.
The first is that, as regards the content of this text, any aspects enabling us to assess and take better account of the risks taken by the banking sector â and, more generally, by the financial institutions sector â are steps in the right direction, insofar as they are backed up by reasonable consolidation and, above all, with the implementation of effective supervision mechanisms.
That is the entire debate we have had on the size of the banks, the internal group consolidations and risk evaluation.
I believe that, behind the way in which this matter is handled, the issue of knowing how to implement a lead supervisor at European level remains altogether crucial, and we will have to return to it over the next few years.
I have one word to say on the subject of SMEs: I dare to hope that the solution proposed is a step in the right direction and that it will not, on the contrary, lead to a shortage of credit for SMEs.
The debate is open, but I personally have my doubts on this matter.
The second point I wish to make, which my fellow Member, MrÂ Purvis, spoke of just now, concerns international relations.
I know, Commissioner, that you attach great importance to them and, quite frankly, since we have been following this matter, I have been struck by the imbalance that exists in the way the integration and appropriation of the Basel II Agreements are perceived.
We know what role the Americans have played in defining, and conducting negotiations on, Basel II, and today we are witnessing a large question mark hanging over the schedule for, and the scope of, this agreement on the other side of the Atlantic.
Behind all of that, a challenge in terms of competition for our economies exists that we cannot overlook, and we are counting on your vigilance in order to prevent this from leading to a situation that results in the European Union being discriminated against.
My final point concerns the issue of comitology, which all my fellow Members have spoken about.
Firstly, the Commissioner told us: âLet us not take these agreements hostage because the markets would not understandâ.
Yet as you know, the markets do as they please.
They will say to us today: âIt is imperative that you adopt this text.
If you do not, it will be a disasterâ, and then tomorrow, when they disagree with the way in which you have implemented Level I of the agreement, they will come to see us and they will then be quite happy that a Parliament exists where people can re-examine the way in which the comitology measures have been adequately or inadequately implemented.
Let us not listen too hard, therefore, to what the markets have to say and let us do our job as legislator.
My final point will be to express my delight that the UK Presidency has implemented a Friends of the Presidency Group.
I believe that that is a good way of finding an agreement.
I simply regret the fact that the Council is not here to participate in this important discussion in the debate between the institutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Capital Requirements Directive updates a recurrent conflict of aims in EU cooperation, a conflict of aims that we all have reason, as a matter of principle, to analyse and debate before we adopt a position.
On the one hand, there are often good reasons for introducing common rules at EU level if the internal market is to operate efficiently.
Differing rules between one Member State and another in crucial areas entail high costs and, thus, less prosperity.
That also applies to the financial market.
On the other hand, there are strong reasons for not forcing the Member States to adopt common rules that then become part of our and thus prevent individual countries from taking the lead and developing systems of rules.
A large part of our economiesâ dynamic is based upon the institutional competition we have between countries when it comes to developing efficient and growth-promoting institutions.
Often, expressions such as best practice and benchmarking are used, reflecting knowledge of this important process.
Unfortunately, this Chamber devotes little or no attention to institutional competition.
Where Basel II is concerned, we are, however, talking about an extremely global market involving an extremely well-informed group of actors who can take action at a momentâs notice.
In this market, there is little scope for special positions at EU level.
When it comes to BaselÂ II, individual countries should operate independently within the framework of this cooperation between central banks.
There is really no reason for mixing the EU and this Parliament up in that process.
We are not designed for that purpose.
Allow me finally to agree with other speakers about how unfortunate it is that Parliament is trying to use this report as part of the constant institutional power struggle between the EUâs institutions.
The June List does not wish to help strengthen this Parliamentâs power.
Â Â  Mr President, I understand that I can also use Mr Goebbelsâ speaking time.
As a number of Members have already had something to say about the content of this dossier, I do not propose to say too much about it; I would, though, like to say something about the procedure, but not before getting something off my chest.
To outsiders, this is an impenetrable technical dossier with no fewer than 800 amendments or thereabouts; a document at least 10 cm thick.
You would be forgiven for wondering what Brussels is up to.
Where is the indignation, where are the critical articles in the press?
Then again, this is not about the protection of workers against skin cancer through exposure to too much sunlight â a subject about which everyone has an opinion and which, in the previous part-session, came in for denunciation from every quarter .
No, this time round, it is about the protection of invested capital.
Is this, then, in some way, an entirely different and nobler goal?
Is this, then, something in which Europe is allowed to be closely involved?
No selective indignation this time round, then.
Fortunately, that is also true for me: I have nothing against this dossier, but let us, in future, not apply different standards when it comes to protecting workers.
I would now like to turn to the report.
I am pleased and also proud that we have managed to prepare this complex dossier, including the added rules for the trading book, so quickly and efficiently in our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, something on which all those involved deserve many congratulations.
This determination is something which the United States, in particular, is following with a measure of astonishment and jealousy.
That is what we need in order to make Europe competitive and attract investments for growth and employment; that is what matters in the Lisbon Strategy.
The way in which we are going about this, though, with this plethora of amendments and technical appendices, is not an approach that appeals to me, nor do I believe that we will thereby achieve better regulation.
We have in the financial markets regulations just developed a more intelligent working method referred to as the Lamfalussy procedure.
According to this procedure, framework legislation is adopted by the EU institutions whilst technical details are delegated to the different committees in the comitology and to the European groups of supervisors who, in turn, delegate in very close dialogue and consultation with market operators and other stakeholders.
Not only is this necessary in order to lessen the burden on employers, but also enable a much more flexible and adequate response to the developments in these dynamic markets.
I am a forthright advocate of this approach and believe that we can use it to find effective solutions for better regulations in other areas too.
Paradoxically, we have not yet applied the Lamfalussy method to this capital adequacy directive, but are now laying down everything, including the appendices and mathematical formulas, at the level of legislators as a group.
Instead, we would prefer, after the directive has entered into effect, to tie the possibility of injecting this dynamism and flexibility into the directive to conditions and to a deadline.
I would like to make it clear that that is not, I repeat not, because we are opposed to the method, but because a fundamental condition is still missing from the Lamfalussy procedure, and by that I mean Parliamentâs call-back right.
I think that that should be spelled out once more, which is what we intended to do in this directive in order to crank up the pressure so as to obtain this formal call-back right.
We do not care how this is done.
The problem was around back in 1999, before the conventions were introduced to prepare treaty changes, and there now has to be a structural solution to the problem.
The ball is in the Councilâs court, and we hope that the ECOFIN ministers will make it clear to their General Affairs and Foreign Affairs counterparts that a solution must be found, come what may.
I think that that should be the key message coming out of this discussion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I willingly join others in thanking the rapporteur, who has finally been able to demonstrate a sufficient ability to listen in order to reach an agreement which, while not to everyoneâs satisfaction, is to the satisfaction of a large number of us.
The highly technical nature of this directive could not disguise its fundamental character; the implementation of the Basel II Agreements at Community level is absolutely crucial for the banking industry in Europe.
Alongside other fellow Members, I have fought to oppose a logic of extreme harmonisation in the field of mortgage lending, and I am delighted to have won my case.
The mortgage lending market, which is a German concept, is booming, particularly since the euro was introduced. With a sum of around EURÂ 1Â 600 billion, it is the largest sector of private lending.
The fact is that maintaining the provisions that were initially envisaged would have meant bringing this activity - which involves the main financial centres of the European Union:Â London, Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg - to an abrupt end.
Covered bonds are one of the rare European products that Americans envy us; let us not turn them into an instrument doomed to obsolescence by applying overly restrictive criteria preventing the banks from using them for the purpose for which they are intended.
As mortgage bonds feature among the most secure financial instruments and benefit from the highest bond ratings, no one would have understood if we had headed towards a state of inflexibility and not allowed any leeway with regard to national regulation.
The definition of mortgage bonds and the collateralisation threshold have, therefore, finally been put together in such a way as to be compatible with the existing items of legislation.
That decision was necessary, even though I regret the fact that, in terms of lost given defaults, the directive goes far beyond what is required, with rates well above the losses that are, in fact, absorbed by the credit institutions.
I will conclude by making two remarks.
Firstly, I note once again that the consolidation and harmonisation approach leads to a dead end.
Let us not confuse the need for a common framework with egalitarianism.
Secondly, the dialogue with the financial stakeholders can be conducted in complete transparency and to everyoneâs satisfaction.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish firstly to thank MrÂ Radwan and also congratulate him on the major, complicated and important piece of work he has done.
If there is any area in which we see the importance of European cooperation, it is in this area in which we are creating a large financial market.
To my Swedish fellow Member who spoke previously, I should like to say that, if we did not have European cooperation, we should not have the opportunity to exercise democratic and parliamentary control over the regulations designed here.
We now have stability, efficiency and predictability in the common financial markets.
The directive will also entail more flexible risk assessment which â and this is important to remember â is basically good for European consumers and businesses.
What is important, as has been mentioned previously in this Chamber, is that it also entails identical ground rules in the global market and in relation to the American market.
It is also important, however, that it means identical ground rules in another sense, whereby we shall see new, developing financial institutions in the dynamic financial markets.
In the same way as we have seen a convergence between banks and insurance companies in recent decades, we shall see new products and new structures.
It is important, then, that this directive should not in practice hamper dynamic development in the market but enable new forms of business to develop and compete on equal conditions.
It will be an important task for the Commission, as for the debate here in Parliament, to follow up developments in precisely this sense.
I am grateful that we have been able to obtain transitional rules that give the national authorities the opportunity to affirm this development but, once the directive is properly in place and its rules applicable, it will be one of Parliamentâs and the Commissionâs tasks to ensure that there is an openness to change that positively accepts the variability of the financial markets.
Otherwise, we shall become less competitive in Europe. That is why this is an important task.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, Basel II has become a byword for the way in which it becomes more difficult to get credit the more problematic the situation one is in.
Had Basel II been accepted in its original form, that would of course be an extraordinarily bad sign for Europeâs present economic state, and so I want to express warm thanks to the rapporteur for our group, MrÂ Radwan, for the extraordinarily difficult job he has done in this regard.
I see this directive, in the form in which it is presented in his report for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, as providing us with an excellent means of dispelling the fears of small and medium-sized businesses.
The second point I want to pick up is the same as that addressed by Mrs BerÃšs.
It does not often happen that I agree with her, but on this occasion and in this matter I do.
It is astonishing that the American banking sector, from which this directive was originally derived, is now delaying its application to the smaller American banks.
Great believer in the trans-Atlantic relationship though I am, I do think we need to take care that economic harmonisation in Europe does not take us down different roads from those taken on the other side of the Atlantic.
We will be the strongest economic area in the world only if we make changes at the same pace as they do.
Let me conclude by expressing my agreement with what Mr Radwan had to say about comitology.
The right message to send to the many members of the European public who complain that it is not clear who decides what in Europe, is that it is here in the European Parliament that decisions of a political nature are taken, and that is why the sunset clause, which is to be in force for two years, enjoys my support.
In 2007, there will be three more directives that have gone through the Lamfalussy procedure: the directive on responsibilities in relation to prospectuses, the Market Abuse Directive and the one on financial conglomerates.
All three will be there, and all three, or so I believe, need to bring clarity and stability to the financial markets.
This is where the European Parliament can play its part, and so I welcome this directive in the form in which Mr Radwan has presented it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate MrÂ Radwan on the quality of his report in a field that is very technical, but crucial for banking.
The draft directive implements or updates the general security principles of the banking system and, in particular, as regards the solvency of credit institutions.
Two specific aspects will warrant more in-depth consideration in the future: the division of risks, in order sensibly to control the proportion of regulatory own funds validated by a single signature, and the harmonisation of rules relating to the internal control systems in order to take account of the circumstances of cross-border banking groups.
In this respect, I would have liked â and I had tabled amendments to this end â more consideration to have been given to the European dimension where cross-border internal group lending and supervision on a consolidated basis were concerned.
I acknowledge, however, that the draft directive, as amended by Parliament, strikes the greatest balance we could realistically envisage at present between the responsibilities of the regulatory authorities in the home country and of those in the host country with regard to banking groups carrying out cross-border activities.
In the unfortunate absence of the Constitution, the proposals made by the Council Presidency seem to me pragmatically to preserve the legitimate rights of Parliament.
For their part, the banks have, over several years, harnessed human, financial and technical resources in order to keep to the deadline.
The statutory deadline must therefore be retained, whatever questions may be asked by the United States.
It is important that the directive enter into force on the date scheduled.
That is why I hope that Parliament adopts the draft submitted to it and that an agreement is reached at first reading.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by telling the Commission that this is where the work begins.
Mr Radwan may well have produced a splendid dossier, but what matters is that Commissioner Verheugen should give his attention to the question of how best to introduce this directive in Europe, how to prevent insolvencies and encourage company formations.
Commissioner KovÃ¡csâ homework is, in my view, to give some thought to how, in future, businesses may write off more minor items â the rates in America, for example, are substantially higher â and to how they are to handle the carrying forward and back of losses.
This is where the Commission should, with competition in mind, intervene creatively, for this Basel II project is, after all, meant to be about rationalisation and reform; it is meant to save costs rather than to bring a whole new wodge of them into play, and for that reason, here too, I recommend benchmarking and best practice.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Members for their very constructive comments regarding this very important piece of legislation and, as I said at the outset, I congratulate Mr Radwan and the shadow rapporteurs for their work and the deep, intensive and very technical work done by the committee on this complex subject.
I agree with those speakers who stressed the importance of this particular directive.
What will be good for the financial institutions will be good for economic growth, employment, the economy and for increased financial stability.
Sometimes members of the public look at matters relating to banks and financial institutions with rather a jaundiced eye and see them as charging excessive interest and making huge profits at their expense.
However, if it were not for banks and credit institutions, there would be no great economic success.
Therefore it is in everybody's interests â including the various actors and stakeholders â that we have a properly regulated financial sector and that risk is properly assessed.
It is also important for depositors.
This is the flipside of lending, since, if no one placed money in banks, there would be no money to lend.
For the very same reasons, it is also important for shareholders and investors. It is also important for the employees of the financial institutions.
Therefore, what will be good for the banking sector will be good for us all.
A recent study estimated that banks would have reduced capital requirements of about EUR 80 to 120 billion as a result of the proposed directive.
It is also said that this directive will reduce the capital requirements for loans to SMEs by more than 50%.
This Parliament has tabled amendments to our proposals that improve the rules for retail and SME lending still further.
Some speakers referred to the question of Islamic mortgages.
We need rules to ensure that such loans do not fall between the cracks and escape regulation altogether.
Mr Ryan and Mrs Lulling raised questions about mortgage bonds or asset-covered bonds.
I note that the further flexibility introduced by Parliament's amendments will reduce regulatory constraints for so-called covered bonds still further and this is a good result for the markets.
Some other Members â in particular Mrs BerÃšs and MrÂ Purvis â raised the question of a level playing field for Europe and the United States.
Firstly, I would like to point out that the small and medium-sized American banks have asked for the benefits of Basle II also to be extended to them and I understand that the United States is on the verge of making such proposals within the next month.
Secondly, as regards this level playing field, all the big American banks which are in direct competition with European globally-operating banks will be covered by the Basle framework.
I take on board, however, what Mr Purvis and Mrs BerÃšs said, not only in this particular regard, but also in other areas relating to the United States.
I know that Mrs BerÃšs has taken a particularly keen interest in this matter and it is something that I bear in mind.
Just about every speaker referred to the general question of comitology.
Mr Radwan can take particular pleasure and pride in having brought this issue to the forefront of the debate and in having extended it into other areas as well.
As regards comitology, I note with satisfaction that the rapporteur is putting forward a helpful and constructive proposal here and I hope that, not only with this directive but in other areas as well, we can bring the matter to a successful conclusion, with the cooperation of the various actors.
I am also pleased to inform you that the Commission can fully support the compromise which has been reached on these amendments.
The package which is now before the plenary is a fair compromise, taking into account the discussions between the Council and Parliament, and it will also enjoy the strong support of the banking industry.
Furthermore, the solutions proposed are well-balanced and respect the Commission's initial intentions for this legislation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Doorn, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on statutory audit of annual accounts and consolidated accounts and amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC [COM(2004)0177 C6-0005/2004 2004/0065(COD)] (A6-0224/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Bert Doorn, and the Legal Affairs Committee, for the excellent work done on this dossier.
Efficient cooperation between the institutions should make it possible to adopt this proposal in a single reading.
Statutory audit is a very important subject for Europe.
Recent scandals highlighted the need to reply to new challenges.
In order to modernise statutory audit, the revised directive will clarify the duties of statutory auditors, their independence and their ethics.
It will also require the application of international standards on auditing and will set the criteria for robust public oversight of the audit profession.
We must have proper auditors in the EU. This benefits everyone: the companies themselves, investors and savers, both large and small.
Economic confidence will grow.
Let me just say a few words on the question of limiting auditor liability.
This question has arisen during debates on this directive, although it was not in the Commissionâs original proposal.
Auditors are wary of taking on new audits because they are afraid of unlimited liability.
I can see the arguments in favour of acting at EU level, as there could potentially be an impact on the internal market.
I intend to work actively to see what can be done in this regard.
As a first step, I intend to launch a study in the near future.
The proposed amendments take account of the discussions in the Council, and also enjoy strong support from the audit industry.
The solutions proposed by your rapporteur are, furthermore, well balanced and respect the Commissionâs initial intentions with this legislation.
So we strongly support the outcome.
As was the case with the previous report that we discussed, comitology is once again the only outstanding issue.
The situation is very similar to what was said in the context of Mr Radwanâs report on the capital requirements directive just a few moments ago.
I refer to the statements I made in that context so I do not need to repeat myself.
Implementing powers are very important for the eighth company law directive.
Many technical issues and adaptations require the availability of comitology powers.
This was also confirmed by the Council when it expressed its support for the overall compromise package of amendments.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives considered that a sunset clause under which the implementing powers would be suspended could harm the effective implementation of this directive.
It therefore asked Parliament to consider the implications of such a sunset clause carefully.
The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Council.
Yet it also recognises Parliamentâs view that its role in supervising the exercise of delegated authority must be brought in line with its standing in the codecision procedure.
Pending an overall solution for comitology, the Commission understands that Parliament would wish to limit the delegated authority in time.
For the Commission it is essential that this period be long enough to ensure proper implementation of the directive.
I understand that your rapporteur would propose a sunset clause of two years after the entry into force of the directive, but 1Â April 2008 at the latest.
This would not, however, apply to ArticleÂ 26, on international auditing standards.
The Commission can agree with this.
This solution would correspond with the solution found in Mr Radwan's report on the proposed capital requirements directive.
The Commission also calls on the Council to show flexibility, but above all to consider the revision of the 1999 comitology decision as a priority.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the 8th directive, I can inform you that we have put together an interesting package in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
For example, we managed to create more room for national solutions in audit committees, which are supervisory committees within enterprises.
We spelled out once more that corporate governance is a matter to be negotiated at Member State level and that it is unacceptable for sweeping solutions in this area to be imposed from the European level.
We managed to make accountancy rotation the rule and the rotation of accountancy offices an exception.
We also managed to restrict the administrative burden on the small and medium-sized enterprise in some areas and the Commission has undertaken to present a report on liability before the end of 2006.
Commissioner McCreevy said a moment ago that he âintends to launch a study in the near futureâ, but we agreed that a report will be on the table before the end of 2006, and I also hope to have his word that that will be done; we would like to exchange views on this matter in this House too.
Liability is a problem on account of the huge differences between the Member States, but we will need to look for solutions here.
All in all, it is a vital piece of legislation which, in my view, has become somewhat more pragmatic in the past six months and also more practical in its application, which is, after all, what this is all about.
There is another big obstacle to negotiate, namely comitology, as you, Commissioner, already pointed out.
In that respect, we decided in favour of consistency with the Radwan report, as I believe it is the same interests that are at stake.
Further to a remark made by one Member a moment ago â âI do not want to take part in the power games between the institutionsâ â I would like to repeat that I do not think this is about power games, but simply a modern way of legislating.
We must draft framework legislation and delegate the details to the Commission and the experts, but that can only be done provided that Parliament has the call-back right.
That is what matters most of all.
I remember that just before the Dutch referendum on the Constitution, which was, as you know, unsuccessful, there was a large article in one of the Dutch newspapers with the headline âOfficials in Brussels have the powerâ.
In actual fact, it referred to the executive committees where legislation of all kinds drafted in this House is implemented behind closed doors.
That is a typical example that adds to the citizensâ growing dislike for Brussels, where all kinds of things are done behind closed doors.
I think, therefore, that if we discuss this comitology â and I am pleased that the Council has announced that it intends to develop initiatives â that much will need to be done in order to improve matters on this score.
In that respect, I endorse the clause setting 1 April 2008 as the âsunsetâ, as also stipulated in the Radwan report.
I would like to add, though, that with regard to Article 26, which concerns the adoption of the international accountancy standards, we should make an exception, because these involve, in terms of this sunset clause, international agreements.
Needless to say, if and when a new regulation on comitology is introduced, the call-back right will also need to apply to accountancy standards of this kind.
On a final note, I would like to thank my fellow members of the committee for the very constructive collaboration.
I think that our negotiations over the past six months have been very useful.
I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the constructive attitude, and we can be very satisfied with the results achieved.
