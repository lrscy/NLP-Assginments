Â Â  Mr President, I voted for the motion of censure because it was fully in accordance with the manifesto on which I was elected to this House.
The European Commission has taken no effective action on fraud and maladministration beyond persecuting the journalist who exposed the whole affair and the whistleblowers.
Unfortunately, many Members have succumbed to the bullying of the Commission and therefore did not back the motion, which is to their shame.
Nevertheless, I hope the Commission will take note of the sentiment and clean up its act.
My constituents in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham and Cleveland demand that the Commission put an end to the culture of casual misappropriation of taxpayers' money that exists in so many of our European institutions.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Members belonging to the and the may have voted for this motion of censure, but they are not fooled.
The Eurostat scandal has been known about ever since mid-2003, and it is astonishing that it is only now, with the European elections a month away, that Members of this House are waking up to it.
We have been barred from signing the motion of censure, even though certain signatories had no problem with it being signed by sympathisers with Communism and Trotskyism; we therefore suspect that this is an electoral subterfuge on their part.
If the motion of censure had been adopted, improbable though that is, the Commissionâs term of office would in any case have ended in October, while it would still have been dealing with day-to-day business.
Why did it not attack Commissioner Monti for his handling of competition policy in the Schneider and Alstom cases? Why did it not draw attention to the other cases of fraud committed against the Community Budget, the diversion of funds and peddling of influence in the Blue Dragon case?
By intervening now, those Members who signed the motion have attempted to carry out a minor internal political operation, which is, alas, far from being commensurate with the gravity of the situation.
Â Â  .â The Commission has stalled for time and Parliament has let it get away with it.
If the Commission refuses, both individually and collectively, to accept responsibility of its own free will and accord, then it is for our House to oblige it to do so.
No response to the plenary debate on the motion of censure, held on Wednesday 21 April, has been forthcoming, any more than to yet another resolution on 22 April 2004.
The fact of the situation is that the Commission is neither listening to Parliamentâs demands nor responding to them.
The reason why there is opposition to this motion is that its opponents are happy that the Commission should be irresponsible.
It follows that the failure of this motion sends a very poor message to the citizens of the twenty-five Member States.
Although the European Parliament is authorised to exercise the power of democratic control, a majority of its Members has explicitly declined to do so.
Â Â  .â On this great day, on which Europe is reunited, we are better than ever enabled to judge the gulf between the noble objectives of the European Union and the way it is actually managed from one day to another.
In fact, at the same time as welcoming ten new Members States, eight of which the Soviet Union had kept shut off from the rest of the world, we have been obliged to vote on a motion of censure aimed at penalising the Commission for one of the many troubled episodes that have occurred throughout its history.
This is a day for harmony, which ought not to have been disturbed by such a punishment, but it is the Commission itself that is responsible for this, having allowed the affair to drag on for years.
This affair has not, however, turned up at completely the wrong time.
We have just heard the new Members from the countries of the East calling for a Europe with more regard for national sovereignty.
Affairs like Eurostat, with its labyrinthine byways, and also the issue of GMOs, which has also been raised today in the context of the approval of the new Commission, are what happens when European institutions believe themselves to be superior to nations and end up being out of control.
There is one conclusion to be drawn from all these affairs, and that is that we must work to achieve a Europe that is better controlled by its nation-states.
Â Â  . The is in favour of the motion of censure against the Commission, on the understanding that it is demonstrated that the Commission has failed to take responsibility in the Eurostat case.
The responses to Parliamentâs questions were not all conclusive, nor were individual responsibilities assigned.
According to the President of the Commission, MrÂ Prodi, past affairs, such as the Cresson case, as a result of which the Commission stood down, are well and truly behind us, or, if they occur, will at least be dealt with more correctly.
However, the Eurostat case has demonstrated that there is still no culture of accountability.
The Commission ought to consider this rather than levelling criticism at MEPs who wish to clarify what happened in the Eurostat scandal.
When voters in various Member States opt out and no longer wish to take part in the European Parliament elections, then that is mainly attributable to the attitude taken by the Commission in matters such as the Eurostat case.
What the electorate demands of the European institutions, and rightly so, is more transparency, more accountability and more democratic legitimacy.
Â Â  .â It is too late or too early to pass judgment on the Eurostat affair, to which, let it be added, there is much more than has been mentioned in the motion.
It is comical to suggest that a Parliament that is about to stand down should censure a Commission that is going to do likewise.
As the President deemed the motion admissible, however, and put it to the vote, I did vote, and did so in favour of censure.
The fact is that no man of the Left can express confidence in a Commission capable of proposing the Bolkestein directive on public services, a directive that threatens to sound their death knell.
Â Â  . British Conservative MEPs have been actively engaged in raising concerns relating to Eurostat, and have played a major role in highlighting the issue to the wider public.
We do not believe that the Commission has accepted political responsibility for the failures that have become clear from this affair.
We believe the Commission has been given a clear message by the motion for a resolution on Eurostat adopted on 22 April 2004 which:
- stated that the Commission had failed to draw the appropriate conclusions from the Eurostat affair, and that it had failed to accept its political responsibility either collectively or individually;
- made clear Parliament's intention to continue to monitor and scrutinise future developments in the ongoing Eurostat investigations and potential legal actions, with a view to proposing further reforms.
Since the motion of censure was originally devised, the responsible Commissioner Pedro Solbes has resigned and returned to Spanish politics.
In these circumstances, we do not believe that it would be appropriate for the whole Commission to be dismissed at this time, but we urge the Commission to take note of the serious concerns expressed and urgently address the issues as laid out in the resolution adopted by Parliament.
Â Â  . In July 2003, the Commission laid off Eurostatâs management in response to the persistence of the fraud cases that had been known about for a long time.
I immediately demanded that the facts be published.
It is pointless to ask institutions dependent on the Commission to institute an inquiry if they subsequently have to keep their findings secret.
Only when public opinion is well informed and can help pass judgment can fraud, self-enrichment and nepotism be prevented in future.
Investigation by Parliament makes that possible.
Even though a secret report was submitted to the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control at the end of September 2003, the Commission can still act as if it does not carry any responsibility.
The person primarily responsible, Commissioner Solbes, has meanwhile become minister in the new Spanish Government.
There is no evidence to show that the problems that forced the previous Commission to step down before the elections five years ago have well and truly ended.
To illustrate the seriousness of the situation and to ensure that the next Commission will be required to address the problems, I am voting in favour of the motion of censure today.
The fact that the Greens, previously in opposition, turned against this in the previous meeting, with the aim to prove their administrative reliability, makes it no less necessary to continue the fight against fraud.
Â Â  . My vote against the motion of censure does not mean that I support the Commission, or that I am unaware of the seriousness of the situation.
My group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, has on many occasions sought to clarify the Eurostat affair and we continue to do so.
It is also true that I have voiced my criticism of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, particularly since November 2003, for openly interfering in internal Italian politics and in European party politics, thereby relinquishing the independence he should always maintain.
For this reason alone, the President and his Commission deserves Parliamentâs political censure.
It is, nevertheless, entirely wrong to vote on a motion of censure at this time, at the very end of a legislative term and with the Commissionâs mandate also coming to an end, and many commissioners arriving and leaving.
The process of the motion has also been adversely affected by these circumstances.
I therefore feel that the vote on the motion would not have any genuine political impact.
It would appear totally out of step and inconsistent, and would be virtually meaningless to the public.
Â Â  . I would like to make it clear that in supporting the motion of censure on the Commission I fully recognise that there are very worthy Commissioners who have worked to the best of their ability with honesty and accountability throughout their terms of office.
However, it is also clear that there have been unaccountable and unacceptable actions within the Commission that have jeopardised the reputation and the good name of the institution.
As there is no means other than censuring the entire Commission, in order to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding use of public funds, I had no other option but to vote in favour.
Â Â  .â Contrary to what has been claimed by Mrs GrossetÃªte and those who have spoken after her, Parliament is fully entitled to exercise its right to censure the Commission, which has proved itself incapable either of keeping tabs on fraud within its bodies or of finding those responsible for the Eurostat scandal â itself no small matter in view of the three accounts used in respect of contracts awarded to Eurocost, a body incorporated under Luxembourg law, concealment of funds; false invitations to tender to the benefit of one company, Eurogramme, which was also incorporated in Luxembourg; the falsification of turnover, and fictitious staff.
That is how the Commission compiles its statistics!
Refusing to censure it amounts to covering up such errors and gives the impression that the rules of financial transparency must not apply to European institutions.
This latest scandal reveals the Commissionâs fundamental inability to combat the corruption that affects its services.
After the Commission under Jacques Santer was censured, a zero tolerance approach was announced, along with the establishment of OLAF â (the European Anti-Fraud Office).
After the Commission under Romano Prodi was censured, we were told that there would be radical reforms to OLAF, as if fraud were caused by the means used to measure it.
In reality, it is the way the Commission works that must be reformed.
Â Â  . Our group has, with conviction, supported the motion that was rejected a moment ago.
It is now immediately obvious to the electorate which Members wish to expose the mismanagement and deception on the part of the present Commission and which Members wish to cover it up or are not interested in it.
The mealy-mouthed and abortive reform, the accounting systemâs obsolescence and vulnerability to fraud and the Eurostat affair are just three examples that speak volumes.
They illustrate that what the Committee of Wise Men concluded back in 1999 also applies to this Commission, namely that there is hardly anyone within the Commission who is willing to accept any responsibility.
It makes a mockery of democracy in Europe and is a denial of Parliament's rights when members of the Commission do not act, but do not step down either.
If the Commission rebuffs Parliament when it performs its primary task of budgetary control, we have no choice but to send it packing.
If we failed to do so, we would not be taking ourselves seriously, or the citizens who have voted for us.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the so-called European Constitution is merely window-dressing, to conceal to the citizens what is going on in the EU and how their interests are being trifled with.
The motion of no-confidence was a means of bringing the curtain down on the Prodi Commissionâs faltering performance and marks the beginning of an open culture in which everyone takes their responsibility seriously.
Â Â  . Along with my British Conservative colleagues I have actively engaged in raising concerns relating to fraud, waste and mismanagement in the European Union institutions and we have played a major role in highlighting the issues to the wider public.
Since the motion of censure was originally devised, Commissioner Solbes has resigned and returned to Spanish politics.
In these circumstances it was no longer credible to support a motion against the whole Commission and our delegation policy was therefore to abstain.
Nevertheless, it is essential that the Commission take serious note of the concerns expressed in the resolution on Eurostat adopted by the European Parliament on 22 April 2004;
- that the Commission had failed to draw the appropriate conclusions from the Eurostat affair, and that it had failed to accept its political responsibility either collectively or individually
- making clear Parliamentâs intention to continue to monitor and scrutinise future developments in the ongoing Eurostat investigations and potential legal actions, with a view to further possible action
The pursuit of greater accountability and control of the EU budget and dramatically improved management by the Commission; the need for the European Parliament to have the power to dismiss individual Commissioners;
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote in writing.
(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, while we are now rejoicing and welcoming new Member States to the European Union, we cannot, unfortunately, put the international situation out of our minds.
A few days ago, we were profoundly disturbed by revelations in the Press of appalling tortures inflicted on Iraqi prisoners by the American and British occupying forces.
Practices such as these can do nothing other than widen the gulf between North and South, between the West and the Muslim world.
Nevertheless, they represent a tendency that must be resisted.
If this is to be done, the international community must unequivocally condemn such practices; it must demonstrate the firm determination to bring to light, in so far as is possible, the extent to which they take place and to ensure that those responsible will be brought to justice.
In particular, we can have no confidence in any enquiry carried out by the governments of the States concerned.
I therefore hope that a United Nations commission of enquiry may be set up as quickly as possible and I ask the President of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that a request to this effect is forwarded to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Â Â  I did not give you the floor for a point of order, MrsÂ Duthu, but simply because yesterday when we opened the proceedings, given the solemnity of the meeting, the MEPs who intended to speak, as usual, for one minute on matters of interest to them, did not have the chance to do so.
Â Â  I am taking the floor in order to ask you, Mr President, to use your position to send, on behalf of us all, I think, a message of solidarity to MrÂ Anastasiades, a victim of an attack yesterday in Cyprus during which bombs were thrown at his house.
As we know, Mr Anastasiades is the leader of the âyesâ movement for the referendum.
I feel that it is important for this to be referred to today, during this sitting, simply in terms of expressing this institutionâs solidarity in this respect.
Â Â  I can tell you, MrsÂ Frassoni, that the President has already contacted the person who â unfortunately â was directly concerned, expressing all our solidarity on his and on Parliamentâs behalf.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to clarify that the bomb attack against Mr Anastasiadis was not carried out for political motives but because of comments he made after a football game.
Â Â  The minutes of this House on Monday 3rd May 2004 exposed Mr Martin for the deceitful person that he is.
He also falsely accused hundreds of MEPs, including 11 Irish MEPs, of âmilking no show loopholesâ in our daily expenses.
This relates to the facility that MEPs have to sign on a register on a Friday so that they are enabled to claim their allowances for accommodation on a Thursday night when they participate in votes on a Thursday afternoon and are unable to fly home.
On the Irish radio programme âLive Lineâ he disingenuously claimed, that as these votes closed at 5.14 pm, I could have easily caught the Frankfurt to Dublin flight.
This flight closes at 7.05 pm, so therefore Mr Martin was claiming that in 1 Hour and fifty minutes I would have plenty of time to collect my belongings and drive approximately 250 kilometres to Frankfurt airport.
Such a statement is blatantly dishonest and he knows that well.
He also claimed that I leave Strasbourg early.
MEPs are prisoners of flight schedules. Up until November 2003 when my flight schedule changed my regular routine was leaving Strasbourg in the afternoon to catch flights which departed for the airport in my constituency at times varying from 16:00 to 18:00.
Furthermore this routine also required me coming regularly to Strasbourg on a Sunday for which I received no daily allowance.
Mr Martin also accused me of some 32 problem cases of claiming the daily allowance.
Despite the viciousness of his accusations he has never once provided with this list â strange justice indeed.
However in relation to the 6 dates he mentioned on RTEs liveline programmes, he was inaccurate in at least half of them.
On a date when he alleged I signed in late I actually was present early that morning voting in my committee.
With regard to 2 other dates I did not receive any daily allowance for the Parliament and these facts have been confirmed in writing to me by the EP services.
I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Matsakis, for being so meticulous.
Â Â  The general debate will continue with the Council and Commission declarations on enlarged Europe and its neighbours.
Â Â  . Mr President, one of the tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the continuation of the enlargement process.
Our common target is to carry through the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. This of course depends on whether both countries complete negotiations and all necessary internal reforms.
2004 will also be decisive for Turkey and the report and recommendation to be brought forward by the Commission in the autumn will be one of the last big decisions of our mandate.
Turkey's chances depends on its fulfilment of the political criteria, as was the case for all the other candidate countries.
The sequence is clear. First the political criteria and then the negotiations.
As regards the Western Balkan states, as you are aware, the Thessaloniki European Council last year fully supported the European perspective of the Western Balkan states becoming an integral part of the European Union once they meet the conditions for accession and the so-called political and economic criteria and they can demonstrate that they are ready to assume the obligations of membership.
Two weeks ago my colleagues, Commissioners Patten and Verheugen, presented to you the Commission's opinion on Croatia's accession and the Commission concluded that Croatia fulfils the political criteria for membership and has recommended the opening of negotiations.
This is now likely to be taken up by the European Council in June.
This House has always shown its full support for and engagement in the enlargement process.
My colleague Commissioner Verheugen would have liked to have been here today.
In March he debated with this House the last steps in the accession of the ten new Member States which joined us last week and on the accession prospects for Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the current state of play for Turkey.
Less than two weeks ago, he reported to this plenary on the final preparations for the accession of Cyprus, recalling once again the clear preference of the EU for a united Cyprus to join the Union.
As we have all seen in the meantime, this desire on the part of the Union was not fulfilled and, as a result of democratic referenda held on the island on 24 April, the Annan plan for the reunification of the island was rejected.
The Commission deeply regretted that the Greek Cypriot community did not approve the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, but we have to respect the democratic decision of the people.
The Commission warmly congratulated the Turkish Cypriots for their 'yes' vote. This signals a clear desire by the community to resolve the island's problem.
Last week Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy engaged in a lively debate in the wake of the referenda result and on that occasion Commissioner Verheugen stressed the commitment of the EU to come forward with comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.
The Commission was invited to do so by the Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 26 April, and financial support totalling EUR 259 million will be earmarked for this purpose.
The Commission has already initiated the necessary planning to that end and intends to bring forward comprehensive proposals on trade and aid measures within the coming weeks.
A new spirit of cooperation between the two communities will be necessary for the implementation of the announced measures.
At this stage, I can only recall the position of the Commission that the Turkish Cypriots must not be punished by this situation and that we will help them to overcome their economic isolation, as well as continue to bring them closer to the Union.
Let me turn now to our neighbours outside the enlarged EU.
Last autumn this House had an opportunity to debate the European neighbourhood policy.
This policy has been developed as a response to the new opportunities and challenges created by enlargement.
Together the Union offers an ambitious policy to our neighbours in the east and the south, based on shared values and common interests, and aiming at preventing the creation of new dividing lines in and around our continent, and at expanding the area of peace, stability and prosperity.
The European neighbourhood policy is distinct from the issue of possible accession to the EU.
Though we are not closing doors, the European neighbourhood policy is not about future enlargements since it is addressed to neighbours who do not currently have the prospect of accession.
At this stage, we will build on the existing institutional framework of our relations, the association or partnership and cooperation agreements.
Differentiation is a key notion to the European neighbourhood policy.
It results from the different situations of each partner, as well as of its relationship with the Union.
The European neighbourhood policy is based on the principle of joint ownership in line with the European Union's approach that political and economic reform cannot be imposed and that successful cooperation can only build on mutual interests and the principle of equality of partners.
In the course of the last months, we have been working out the various aspects of this new policy and we are preparing, in close consultation with partners, a first package of action plans to be jointly adopted with them.
These actions plans will set out the agreed priorities of our relationships in key areas, as well as mechanisms to ensure their timely implementation.
Next week the Commission will present a strategy document on the European neighbourhood policy, together with country reports on this first group of countries.
The action plans will provide new political momentum to the Union's relations with partner countries. The action plans will focus on political dialogue and reform, trade, market and regulatory reform, cooperation in the fields of energy, transport, the information society, the environment and people-to-people contacts.
The content and priorities agreed with each partner country will differ and depend on its particular circumstances.
The plans will identify key actions in a limited number of priority fields and include a clear time horizon.
The action plans are expected to be adopted later this summer.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Cyprus on behalf of the Council.
Three days ago, on 1 May, a new chapter was written in the history of Europe.
It is no exaggeration to say that the accession of ten Member States marks a truly historic moment.
In effect, it brings an end to the tragic post-war divisions in Europe.
It does not, however, bring a complete end to divisions within our continent.
The Republic of Cyprus has taken its place as a full Member State of the European Union.
It is no secret that the clear preference of the European Union was for the accession of a united Cyprus on 1 May.
We greatly regret that following the outcome of the referenda in Cyprus on 24 April, it was not possible to achieve this objective.
I would like today to echo the strong words from the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 26 April.
The Council indicated its determination to ensure that the people of Cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union.
We accept, however, that the people of Cyprus have made a democratic choice.
On 24 April, the people of both parts of Cyprus voted in separate referenda on the settlement plan presented by the United Nations Secretary-General.
The referenda were the culmination of a long and detailed negotiating process led by the United Nations.
It is important today, therefore, that I again emphasise in the European Parliament the deep gratitude that the European Union has for the determined and sustained efforts in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem by Secretary-General Annan, by his Special Adviser, MrÂ Alvaro de Soto, and by their colleagues.
They worked closely, and tirelessly, with the parties for a long period.
We also recognise the very positive contributions made by the governments of Greece and Turkey.
All in this House know and have reflected on the results of the referenda and there is little point in going further into the analysis at this point.
The Turkish Cypriot community has now expressed its clear desire for a future within the European Union.
The Council is determined to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and to facilitate the reunification of the island by encouraging economic development.
Last week, the Council took an important step with the adoption on 29 April of the regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 of the Act of Accession.
The regulation was necessary for a smooth accession process. It provided the terms under which the relevant provisions of European Union law are applied to the line between the northern part of Cyprus, in which the application of the is suspended, and the areas in which the government of Cyprus is in control.
The terms of the regulation will facilitate trade and other links across the line while ensuring that the appropriate standards of protection are maintained.
I believe that the agreement reached on this regulation reflects clearly the desire of the Council to send a signal of encouragement to the members of the Turkish Cypriot community that its future lies within a united Cyprus and within the European Union.
The next step will be the presentation by the Commission of the comprehensive proposal requested by the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
That will have a particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities within the European Union.
The Council has recommended that the EUR 259Â million that had been earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement should now be used for this purpose.
I welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward its comprehensive proposals within the coming weeks.
There is a strong sympathy and a sense of respect in this Parliament for the people of Cyprus, of both communities, as they seek to overcome the legacy of a divided history.
I have said here on more than one occasion that coming as I do from a divided island we understand very fully how difficult it is to heal the rifts.
I regret that the accession celebrations in Ireland on 1 May could not have included a celebration of a united Cyprus in the European Union, in fact I do so on a particularly personal note, because the celebrations for Cyprus were held in my own home town and it would have been marvellous if we could have welcomed all of the people of Cyprus there on that occasion.
However, those who did come were very welcome.
The statements and actions by the Council since the referenda clearly confirm that the European Union remains strongly committed to providing tangible assurance to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future will be in a united Cyprus within the European Union.
On a personal note, I shall unfortunately have to leave before this debate ends.
This is likely to be the last occasion on which I address this Parliament.
I want to thank very sincerely all the Members of this Parliament for the extraordinary courtesy and for the forbearance they have shown me during many debates in this Chamber.
I have seldom enjoyed an experience more than I have enjoyed addressing this Parliament.
I am not sure whether that enjoyment was reciprocated, but nonetheless, from my point of view my duties here were very pleasant and they were made all the more pleasant by the fact that I was able to make new friends and renew old acquaintances.
In recent days this Parliament has come in for some of the most uncalled for and scurrilous criticism, criticism which it does not deserve.
This Parliament serves the people of Europe well.
It is a model of parliamentary performance.
It gets through its work in an efficient and effective way.
Undoubtedly it is not entirely made up of saints, but then very few human institutions are absolutely perfect.
However, insofar as a parliamentary assembly is concerned, this comes as close to perfection as any assembly that I have ever addressed.
It has been my pleasure to work with the Members of this Parliament.
I wish those who are going into retirement all the very best for their retirement.
I hope that they enjoy the years ahead of them.
For those who are going into the election campaigns, I wish them well too, for safe campaigning and a very happy result.
Â Â  MrÂ Roche, usually the President should not applaud, but this time I joined my fellow Members in their applause for your words, which were very kind and thoughtful in respect of this House which has admired the work carried out by the Irish Presidency at a very difficult time.
We of course hope that following these days of celebration, there will be another joyful conclusion for at least a good number of the MEPs in this Chamber, when the European Council is held in June.
Allow me to say to you, however, that your thanks and courtesy have been reciprocated.
The parliamentary groups and the House as a whole have truly appreciated, both during individual meetings and thanks to your presence here, the great ability of a small country to help ensure that these wonderful days of celebration would proceed in the best possible way and that we could realise this âfirstâ in the history of the union of peoples, States, nations and citizens.
Thank you very much, MrÂ Roche, and through you I would like to thank all the Irish Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join with you in thanking the Irish presidency for everything it has done so far, in particular in ensuring the success of this enormously historic occasion of the welcoming of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which, as other speakers have said, will go down in the annals of history.
I would like to contribute a few thoughts at this stage.
This morning speakers have been talking about the past, of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli.
I would like to give a few ideas of how one might see the future.
I am not sure that I share the Commission's idea that we should be looking at enlargement as the sole focus of our energies.
It is true that within the European Parliament we now have a fantastic variety of representation of traditions and cultures, but this is not what Europe is going to be about over the next five to ten years.
In the last 20 years we have seen this question of enlargement go together with the deepening of the Union.
We are now at a point where we see the limits to competence and to the geographical expansion of the Union being reached.
Therefore, I have three remarks to make.
Firstly, when a new Commission is appointed, we need some vision and strategy of how to handle the internal problems of the Union.
The question arises in our own Parliament of how we are to handle the vast array of different political parties, 25 nationalities and 20 different languages.
But, perhaps more importantly for our electorate, we must determine how to remain competitive in the global economy and how to ensure the internal security of our citizens.
These are debates that will come later this afternoon.
However, for ourselves today, we face the question of how to ensure that the European Union will be a player on the world stage, how to handle the questions of AIDS in Africa, how to contribute towards peacekeeping, and how to ensure that the Union has a presence in the world.
A few weeks ago, we adopted Mr Brok's resolution on how we would like to work with our transatlantic friends, the United States, as we move from a Community of values to a Community of action, so that together we can see how a global system will work.
In the next few years we will need to think of how the European Union can really make an impact on the global stage, as a partner rather than a rival of the United States.
Therefore, on the question of how we are to handle enlargement, the majority of my Group would be in favour of consolidation of the Union rather than continuing enlargement simply because countries feel that they meet the criteria.
The essential clause in the Copenhagen criteria is that we should take account of the absorptive capacity of the European Union in order to welcome countries as they would like to be welcomed and as we have welcomed the ten Central and Eastern European countries today.
I would urge in the coming months that we look at the provisions on privileged partnerships under the Constitutional Treaty.
Not everybody has to join the Union in order to meet the requirements of their foreign policies satisfactorily.
We in the Union have to be sure to coordinate everything that is available to us in a financial, political and economic way â as the President-in-Office of the Council has said for the Turkish side of Cyprus, which is not yet able to join the European Union.
We must find the legal basis, the means by which we control the funds, and deal with a whole array of different things to enable us to create a stable, prosperous and secure environment for citizens of the European Union to live in.
In conclusion, when we look to the future, at enlargement and our neighbours, we in the European Union must be more prepared to look strategically at our own interests.
What do we want, where do we want to go and what do we want to say to our citizens so that we can live in peace within our frontiers and contribute to global peace outside them?
For the majority of my Group, this means that we need to think in terms of consolidation over the coming period, rather than enlargement.
In time we can enlarge, yet under no account should we enlarge so quickly that we undermine the European Union, which we have built so strongly in the last 40 years.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has conducted business.
It has been a delight to work with Minister Roche in particular.
The Irish presidency has set a model of transparency and cooperation within the Parliament.
Today â which has been very much a day of celebration â it is important to remember just how far we have come in the European Union in a very short period of time.
I remember visiting Lithuania a few weeks after independence.
It was then a country with huge energy shortages, tremendous dislocation, Soviet troops still on its soil and tremendous insecurity.
It is hard to imagine that, in the short period of 15 years, Lithuania has managed to join the EU.
This is a sign of what the EU can achieve when we are determined to set off down a particular road and not let obstacles hinder us.
It is often said that this is a historic enlargement â it is indeed.
If I can return again to Lithuania, one of the most spectacular events in my life was a visit to the KGB Museum in Vilnius where my blood ran cold.
This enlargement shows that the Cold War is finally at an end and we should remember that in those revolutions of 1989 and 1990, a number of people died to have the freedom to join organisations like the EU.
We should remember their sacrifice.
When we finish celebrating, we ought to realise that all we have done is reach the end of the beginning of the EU.
We now finally have a European Union which is Europe-wide.
It is not complete â and I disagree with MrÂ Elles, we be moving forward in relation to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey â but it is a Europe-wide EU.
We must now make this EU work for the benefit of its citizens.
The hard part really begins today.
In order to do that, we must start by getting away from endless discussions about processes and start talking about outcomes and policies.
That is why it is important to agree on a Constitution and then move on and look at how we benefit EU citizens.
Our priorities in this enlarged Europe must be to have more and better jobs: not to talk, but to .
It is worth noting that the ten new countries have all had to go through a process of being investigated on a yearly basis by the Commission on their progress towards fulfilling the requirements for membership.
Perhaps we should apply that same process to the existing 15 Member States, so that instead of promising to do things, people actually do them.
That must be our priority.
We also have to look at how we develop legislation which can be properly implemented.
We need to move our focus away from simply developing legislation to looking at how it is implemented and where it is achieving the objectives that we set out.
We must also have more and better security.
Enlargement has to deliver a safer Europe for our citizens, a Europe safe from criminals, drug runners, terrorists and people traffickers.
That is what the citizens are going to look for in our enlarged Europe.
Part of that security agenda must be that we do not become Eurocentric.
This enlarged Europe must be for the benefit of the world as a whole.
That is why I hope â and I am glad Commissioner Nielson is here â that we see no slackening of our commitments to development policy, no slackening of our commitments to meet the millennium development goals and that we redouble our efforts to develop better relationships with our neighbours.
We should bear in mind that in Kaliningrad in particular, we have a perfect example of how we need to proceed.
How we succeed in working with Kaliningrad will dictate how we succeed in working with the rest of the world.
We should celebrate today, but we should also remember that we must start working hard from now on to make this enlarged Europe work for the benefit of our citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Nielson, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this House has perhaps done most to promote enlargement.
We have put the pressure on and committed ourselves to a date.
We have worked closely with the candidate countries, our sister parties and others.
We have invited them to Parliament during the part-sessions.
We have been active in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and we were the only political group to vote unanimously in favour of every country in the vote on membership here in the House.
We have, of course, been incredibly happy over the last few days, when what we have fought for has at last become a reality.
At last, we have unified the European continent which, for so long, has been divided by war, misery, enmity and walls.
Now, it is no longer a case of âusâ and âthemâ.
Now, we are all âusâ: 25 countries and 450 million citizens who have come together to solve common problems, defend common values and build a common future.
That is not, however, the end.
The EU will continue to grow.
We look forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania in a few yearsâ time.
We look forward to the start of the negotiations with Croatia, and the ELDR Group also supports the Turkish candidacy.
Major reforms and changes have taken place in Turkey during Recep Tayyip Erdoganâs leadership.
The country has been modernised and democratised.
Certainly, there remains a great deal to be done.
The role of the military in politics is unacceptable; there are political prisoners; the Kurds are still treated in an abusive and discriminatory way; and the court case against Leyla Zana leaves a very great deal to be desired.
We grant no exemptions, for criteria exist, but Turkey will in time have an obvious place.
A democratic Turkey would make an important contribution and be a link between Europe and the Muslim world.
The ELDR Group can never accept the argument that the EU is exclusively a Christian union.
The EU will be undergoing enlargement for many years.
The day that Serbs and Albanians sit in Parliament together with ourselves, or with yourselves in the Council, and, side by side, debate, for example, emission rights, then the European project will clearly have become a peace project again.
The ELDR Group believes that we should not now be setting any limit on how large the EU is to become.
We proceed on the principle that all countries situated wholly or partly in Europe are welcome as long as they fulfil the criteria.
The world is, however, larger than the EU, even an enlarged EU.
The great task in the next term of office will therefore be to implement, and give practical shape to, the neighbourhood strategy and formulate how, in practical terms, we are to increase cooperation with our eastern and southern neighbours, using the Mediterranean process, and with those countries that may one day be able to become Members and with those that do not perhaps want to become Members.
We must find both common and bilateral solutions.
The people of Moldavia, Albania, Georgia and Ukraine, together with the oppressed people of Belarus all have high hopes of the EU.
They want us to be able to give them an answer concerning a better future.
We must therefore formulate strategies as to how we are to cooperate with these countries.
This will be a priority task.
MrÂ President, you can be sure that the ELDR Group will put its weight behind this work.
Finally, I wish, on my own behalf but also on behalf of the ELDR Group, to say a big thank you to MrÂ Brok for the work he has done in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
He is not in the House, but I wish my thanks to be minuted.
The work that has been done in the committee and the fact that we are standing where we are today owe a very great deal to him.
Â Â  â Mr President, these days' debates have perhaps a celebratory character.
I should like, however, to point out that, for us, the enlargement of united Europe, over and above its historic, political and economic importance, is also a huge challenge for a Europe without partitions and without exclusions.
Unfortunately, the current economic and social choices of the European Union widen the social gap, instead of bridging it.
If, therefore, we look realistically at the omissions and problems, I would say that the European Union as a whole needs to look specifically at how the new Member States are being supported, so that cohesion, at both economic and social level, and the safeguarding of citizens' rights can progress.
Enlargement, however, is continuing.
The prospect of the integration, in coming years, of Bulgaria and Romania into the Union is positive, insofar as it is based not simply on satisfying certain indicators, but on real improvements to the life of the citizens in these countries.
As far as Turkey is concerned, enlargement and the consolidation of relations between the European Union and this country are, I believe, positive both for the country and its democratisation and for peace and stability in the area.
It is within these frameworks that we see the contribution of Cyprus to the European Union.
We believe that Cyprus can and must be used as a bridge between the European Union and the Eastern Mediterranean, especially the Middle East.
We could, of course, play this part much more efficiently if the Cyprus question had been resolved when we joined the European Union on 1 May.
Unfortunately, the referenda, the expression of the will of the people, did not bring about the result which we all hoped for.
We need to interpret the result of the referenda correctly.
In our perception at least, the no vote by the Greek Cypriot community in the referendum neither rejects the solution for the reunification of Cyprus nor, if you like, the plan of the Secretary General of the United Nations itself.
It is an expression of insecurity, it is an expression of anxieties about the workability of the solution and we would like the European Parliament to turn its attention in this direction and make a positive contribution towards putting those preconditions in place that will result in the support of the overwhelming majority, of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, for the reunification of the island, within the framework of a federation.
Â Â  Mr President, I also want to thank the presidency, and Mr Roche in particular, for the way in which he has handled our dealings together.
I also enjoyed it very much.
I must say that sometimes I find it difficult to attack him because he is so nice and so it is difficult to say how much I disagree with the Irish presidency.
I thank him very much and it was a pleasure for my Group too to work with the Irish presidency.
I have very little time so I just want to concentrate on the question of Cyprus.
We all share the sadness at the disappointing result of the referendum.
I understand and I respect the response of the Greek Cypriots.
I want to believe that they want a solution and that they are not happy with the status quo.
But now it is time for them and for us to act.
We have to act quickly and positively to ensure that agreement can still be reached this year.
The Greek Cypriots should tell us their ideas to ensure that enlargement is completed and the rest of the European Union must assist and remind them that this business cannot remain unfinished.
I have two small suggestions.
The first is for the Commission and the Council.
To say that EUR 289Â million have been earmarked is quite good, but how much time elapses between earmarking and spending?
I became very worried when I heard Commissioner Nielson talking about legal problems and complications.
Could the Commission and the Council give us a timetable for committing this money and solving the European Union's formal problems with northern Cyprus?
The Government of the Republic of Cyprus has a problem with the implementation of the law governing the European elections in Cyprus.
In order to be able to vote, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Latin Maronites and Armenians have to be registered on the electoral roll for the European elections.
Unfortunately, the Cypriot Parliament took a decision requiring all Cypriots to register themselves on the electoral roll.
As a result of this procedure, only 503 out of an estimated 80 000 Turkish Cypriots are eligible to vote.
This is too few.
If the Cypriot Parliament decided to include on the electoral roll all persons who have either an ID card or a passport issued by the Republic of Cyprus, 40 000 Turkish Cypriots could vote.
I have two requests to the Government of Cyprus.
Firstly, people from both communities who are in possession of an ID card or a passport from the Republic of Cyprus should automatically be entitled to vote.
Secondly, the Government of Cyprus should re-open the electoral roll over the next three weeks and make a public announcement in both communities and in both languages to ensure that those able to vote in the European elections do so.
Â Â  Mr President, joining the European Union still fires the public and political imagination of eastern Europe, even after, or perhaps, in fact, because of, the large enlargement round that has just been completed.
I would like to bring you the following story by way of illustration.
The president and economic affairs minister of one of the so-called new neighbouring countries in the east are paying a joint visit to the Delphic Oracle.
To one of the ministerâs pressing questions about the trends in macro-economic figures, he receives surprisingly positive responses.
Disappointingly enough for him, the oracle adds, 'but not during your term in office'.
Encouraged by these promises, the president wants to know whether his country might also join the European Union.
'It will', says the famous Oracle in reply, 'but not during my term in office'.
Commissioner Verheugen recently made a statement that was not dissimilar to this wise saying.
He stated in no uncertain terms that the former Soviet Union's border to the west, with the exception of the Baltic States, would coincide with the European Union's eastern border for some time to come.
His plain speaking, moreover, prompted the offended Ukrainians to comment that it is apparently easier for a Turkish-Moroccan camel to negotiate the eye of the European Commission's needle than an Orthodox civilisation such as their own, which is regarded as alien.
We have been told.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Verheugen's chosen position bears witness to a sense of realism, at least in the near future.
Speculation about, for example, Ukraine's long-term chances of accession to the EU depends on various factors.
Suffice to think of the possible fulfilment of Turkey's European aspirations.
In that light, is it at all possible to keep the door firmly shut to Kiev while preserving any sense of propriety?
However, very recent statements by the Ukrainian Head of State, Mr Leonid Kuchma, that Kiev is currently giving priority to membership of the WTO and NATO rather than to accession to the European Union, should serve to put MrÂ Elles' mind at rest.
Whichever way you look at it, and quite apart from the issue of EU membership, the European Union will need a new neighbourliness policy after this enlargement round.
This is causing a great deal of worry at the new eastern border, because the domestic situation in Belarus, the Ukraine and Moldova is worrying, to say the least.
How can we promote the forming of democratic constitutional states in that region?
Practical neighbourly help is the most obvious way of doing this.
An asymmetric liberalisation of internal trade springs to mind, a helping hand to which the EU should, however, attach political conditions.
In addition, the new Member States will also have a contribution of major importance to make to the forming of the Union's relations with its neighbours to the east.
They, after all, are most closely involved.
We are relying on them today, just as the reform-minded forces in Belarussian, Ukrainian and Moldovan, society should be able to continue to rely on the European Union in the near future.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate on an enlarged Europe and its neighbourliness policy is inextricably linked to the existential issue of European Union borders.
The enlargement that we have spent the past few days celebrating is a good thing, but it will require effort, certainly in the first years, and not least in the financial field.
It is therefore important that we should take a break now before we contemplate future enlargements.
Romania and Bulgaria have 2007 as their target date for accession.
This should remain as such, and we should not decide in favour of enlargement if it turns out that those countries are not ready for accession at that time.
The same applies to Croatia.
As far as Turkey is concerned, it should be made clear that it is not a European country and that, even it were, it does not meet the Copenhagen criteria.
Turkey does, however, have a major role to play in the EUâs neighbourliness policy.
That is the only realistic option, and probably means that more will need to be invested in neighbourliness policy than originally planned.
Following the referendum in Cyprus, I can only regret that the Commission and Council have decided in favour of a recognition of the Turkish military occupation of the north of the island.
Moreover, it would be interesting to know on what legal basis this recognition is founded.
The funds which were intended for North Cyprus in the event of the referendum resulting in the island's reunification will be paid out all the same, despite the fact that the voters have decided differently.
This is a new illustration of the democratic deficit in the European Union, despite all pledges to bring Europe closer to the citizen.
Â Â  âMr President, ladies and gentlementoday it is my great privilege to share with you my thoughts in the context of the European Unionâs enlargement.
Despite the festive atmosphere of recent days, those thoughts are concerned more with problems than ovations.
First of all, coming from a country that has only just acceded, I do not feel morally entitled to say where the future borders of the European Union should lie, or when further enlargement should stop.
At the same time, it would be equally morally unjustified to make insubstantial promises to our neighbours concerning their possible accession, in a situation where neither party is ready for it.
The experience of relations with Turkey over the past 40 years would be a poor model to use for the development of relations with Ukraine today.
Secondly, my background in academic circles has given me a clear understanding of what is accomplishable and what is not.
A prerequisite for the enlargement of the European Union is an in-depth approach to integration.
The Constitutional Treaty enables the involvement of ten new Member States in collective processes without compromising the fundamental principles and decision making of that union.
If the Member States fail to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, we may have to accept that future enlargement may also come to a halt.
Thirdly, I believe that all rounds of enlargement must be based on certain objective criteria.
Once a round of enlargement has taken place, however, Member States should be treated equally.
The restrictions on the free movement of workers imposed by some Member States is just as unwarranted as the imposition of stricter internal market regulations on new Member States.
If the European Union accepts the splitting up of Cyprus, why then should it agree to the raising of Russian minority issues in Estonia and Latvia?
That is just not logical.
Fourthly, I welcome the European Unionâs neighbourhood policy, which is a guarantee for stability and democratisation beyond its borders.
I believe that the setting up of the ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the setting up of peace-keeping operations elsewhere in the world are signs of the European Unionâs growing foreign policy agenda and of the attempts of Member States to speak with a single voice in the international arena.
At the same time, I do not comprehend how countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Haiti have achieved a higher placing in the list of priorities than our close neighbours Moldova and Georgia.Yet this was the neighbourhood policy that was supposed to prepare the European Union for further enlargements.
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, there are a great number of problems to be solved.
I sincerely hope that the enlarged European Union will not prove to be a disappointment for anyone.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeans, the long-awaited hour is here.
Poland has become a Member State of the European Union, along with another nine countries and peoples .
Integration into Europe has been the hope and ambition of many nations, including Poland.
The Polish people played a significant role in this endeavour.
After all, Poland initiated the process of structural transformation in our part of Europe, and it was the Polish Government that was the first to propose enlarging the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
We therefore have good reasons for pride and satisfaction.
The date of 1 May 2004 will become a symbol of the end of the Yalta order in Europe.
This order artificially divided our continent, placing some in a privileged position, while sentencing others to a sluggish pace of economic development.
Let us hope it is gone forever.
Today, with the sense of a job well done, we should look forward in hope to the future of Europe.
Thanks are due to all those who strove towards integration, both in the countries of The Fifteen and in the candidate countries.
They are to be commended on their unshakeable determination and on helping to bring about integration through concrete facts and actions.
The next step on this road will be the adoption of the Constitutional Treaty.
It is our expectation and hope that this will occur during the current Irish Presidency.
In this period of globalisation and terrorism, it is necessary to reinforce our European solidarity, cooperation, unity, and security.
In order for work on this important document to be completed successfully, it is vital for all the Member States to be willing to compromise.
I agree with Commissioner Verheugen.
He is a great friend of Poland and of its people.
The Commissioner stated that European integration called for courage, courage of thought and the courage to compromise.
Courage is also required when considering the future of the European Union, because the process of enlargement will not stop at this stage.
It will continue until the time our common neighbours in the east and south of Europe join our great strong family in their turn.
We should maintain the best possible relations with them, endeavouring to ensure they are properly prepared for the process of integration at the appropriate time.
I cannot predict whether the Polish electorate will decide if I should continue to sit in this House.
Allow me, therefore, to finish by thanking President Pat Cox and the European Parliament for enabling me to represent Poland in the European arena over the last year.
I am sure I speak for the other observers too.
It has been a great privilege to witness events that will go down in history and an honour to have been actively involved in shaping them.
I am conscious of the significance of this moment for the history of Europe.
Confident of our shared courage and determination to build a better world I face the future with confidence and hope.
Â Â  Naturally I hope, MrÂ Gawlowski, that you will come and take the floor on many other occasions in this Chamber, but the next time the President â who will be someone else â will certainly be a bit stricter than me and will cut you off earlier.
Â Â  Mr President, as a representative from Cyprus, I will attempt to dispel a few myths.
Firstly, the Greek Cypriots vote against peace and the reunification of the island in the recent referendum.
They voted against a particular plan which would not have brought peace or reunification to the island.
The plan legalises the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
The plan also stipulates that Turkish troops of occupation will remain in Cyprus forever and that Turkey â an invader of Cyprus â will be a guarantor of the independence of Cyprus.
This means that a Member State of the European Union will be under the guardianship of Turkey.
This is the main reason why Greek Cypriots did not vote for this plan.
There is only one way that Cyprus can be reunified and peace restored: the Turkish troops of occupation must be withdrawn from Cyprus.
Â Â  â Mr President, beyond any doubt, the enlargement of the EU by the accession of ten states is an event of historic magnitude.
It is difficult to predict how history will eventually rate the first day of May in 2004.
If one is to believe the politicians, the accession of the former Socialist Republics of Eastern Europe has not enlarged Europe, but completed it.
Whatever our understandable and justifiable rejoicing at the fall of borders, we should not overlook the fact that many citizens of both the old and new Member States take a sceptical view of the future.
Those who live in Prague or Budapest, where unemployment stands at only between 3% and 4% will take a different view of things from someone from Ostrawa in Northern Moravia, where some 30% are out of work.
I have experienced celebrations that soon gave way to sober reality and disappointment, the after-effects of which are being felt in Germany to this day.
In the course of negotiations, much was said about the implementation of the Copenhagen criteria, but there was no debate about the changes that bring with them grave social disparities, with poverty for the many and immense wealth for the few.
Far be it from me to pour cold water on this solemn moment, but I know that there is in the long term nothing worse than self-deception, and that nothing does more political damage than the unwillingness to accept history with all its contradictions, bitterness and difficulties.
This being my last speech to this House, I have a request to make.
There must be no room in the European democracy for xenophobia, anti-Semitism or hatred of Communists, of whatever kind.
Europe is more than the EU, and the European Union will have new neighbours.
What the present time demands of us is that we be good neighbours.
A week ago, I was in Riga and saw for myself just how much is required if trust in our neighbours is to grow.
If we want to have a good future to look forward to in peace, then what is required of us will be peaceful communities, the bringing together of people, and coexistence in a spirit of solidarity.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen. I am from Latvia and it is a great honour for me to appear here today before the European Parliament, as a fully fledged representative of my country.
We are very pleased that Europe is becoming ever more united, that borders and regulations that hinder our cooperation and the full participation of Eastern Europe in the European Union are disappearing.
I represent the Russian-speaking minority of Latvia, which makes up about 40% of the country's population.
It is a great pleasure for me to announce to you today that Russians too are now part of a united Europe and I want to emphasise that this is a direct result of enlargement.
On 1 May, tens of thousands of the Russian-speaking residents of Latvia â participants in a rally â entrusted me to greet you and expressed a real hope that the European Union will develop not only as a union of States and economies, but will also become a real union of the peoples who live in the European Union and that the European Union will devote more attention not only to the economic aspects but also to such spheres as human rights.
In conclusion I would like to wish for effective cooperation for us all, for the good of our common Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday, 3 May, when the European Union was celebrating its enlargement, the people of Poland were honouring the Most Blessed Virgin Mary as Queen of Poland.
She is also Queen of Europe and of the whole world.
We are bound to respond appropriately to this special protection granted to us.
Please accept this gift from the people of Poland.
It is our most precious treasure, the Cross of Christ.
May this Cross be a source of strength for us.
Only by seeking inspiration in the Cross can Europe rise above chaos and moral degradation.
Mr President, I shall now speak to you as Pat Cox, the father of a Catholic family.
Like the Holy Father, you have been awarded the Charlemagne Prize.
I am sure you are familiar with the teachings of John Paul II and aware of his concern for the spiritual unity of a Christian Europe.
We are today seeking a way to find peace and a way to combat terrorism.
We long for justice and progress.
The Holy Father himself, Europeâs first citizen, the champion of the true union of Europe, is constantly reminding us that Europe needs God.
It needs Godâs laws and Godâs constitution.
Only then shall we overcome all manner of afflictions, injustices, and terrorism.
We cannot hope to overcome terrorism as long as we condone those dreadful acts of terrorism committed secretly every day.
I refer to the killing of the most innocent of victims, namely children conceived in their mothersâ wombs.
If Europe rejects Godâs laws, it will also reject the rights of nations and the rights of families.
It will reject human rights, including the most important of them all, the right to life.
Mr President, I am confident you will make arrangements for this cross to be hung in a place of honour in this Parliament.
The cross stands for love triumphant.
A cross must be hung in Strasbourg, and another in Brussels.
Do not allow yourself to be deterred, Mr President!
You must have the courage of your convictions!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate shows the diversity of this Europe of ours, which is one of its strengths.
It will certainly take us several years to take the diversity in our enlarged European and develop from it the common political approach we once had.
I want to make it clear that we must take the time to do so.
If we are to be able to ensure Europeâs long-term effectiveness, it is certain that all our institutions will have to undergo a period of consolidation.
There is a whole range of issues to be discussed.
Where Europe was already effective, it must of course remain so, in order that we may be successful in facing the challenge of globalisation and actively work on economic cooperation and in establishing a common framework.
We must, though, ensure that Europe becomes effective where it has not been before.
This is true also of foreign and security policy, where Europe still has much to do over the coming years.
I hope that we will, together, succeed in this.
We will then have to give very serious attention to the question of what, in this European Union of ours, holds us together.
Is it no more than a free trade area?
Is it only the common currency and common market?
For me, that would be too little.
Europe is founded upon a shared history and culture, upon values that bind us, and the Member States â now numbering 25 â together.
It follows that, rather than just talking about cooperation with our neighbours, we must come up with new approaches in order to actually do so where such close cooperation is desirable.
Where the European Union is concerned, there are only two options: being a full member or not being a member at all.
That is true when it comes to our new neighbours in the East, it also â of course â applies to Turkey, and it is the case with regard to other areas in our neighbourhood, like â if I may make this clear for once â the whole of the Mediterranean.
That is the challenge we have to set ourselves.
Where there are new challenges, let us find new responses to them, and let us consolidate what we have achieved in such a way that we may start the twenty-first century well.
Â Â  â Madam President, I wonder how one of our Members managed to get up on the Presidential rostrum, an act that strikes me as utterly out of place in the course of our work, and done with the purpose of attaching a religious emblem that is incompatible with the EUâs motto of âunity in diversityâ.
Such a Christian cross has, obviously, no place as a symbol of our European Parliament, and I hope, Madam President, that no such incident will occur again.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ BerÃ©s, your view, together with MrÂ Tomczakâs, will be forwarded to Parliamentâs President.
Â Â  Madam President, allow me also to pay my regards and express my thanks to the Irish Presidency.
The new Europe of 25 has an important future ahead of it: dealing with what is happening around it.
The scenario is very demanding: in fact, the outer borders will adjoin highly problematic countries, such as Ukraine and Belarus, the latter controlled by a government so authoritarian that it warranted the suspension of all official relations with it; and then there is Russia, a major military power which is having trouble adopting a more democratic institutional shape and above all pacifying Chechnya, agreeing without delay to work on the peace plan proposed by MrÂ Maskhadov, to which Parliament gave its full backing; and then in the south we have Turkey, now on the eve of negotiations which could see it accede; and there is the Middle East, the Gulf and Maghreb and Mashreq countries.

In order to address this aspect, Europe must assume credible political characteristics and a coherent strategy: at institutional level, only the Constitution can guarantee progress in this direction; at political level, in the report on the future of enlarged Europe adopted last November, Parliament stressed the need for political dialogue with all its neighbours, warning us against fragmentary, economic actions based exclusively on liberalising markets.
Political dialogue, establishing common rules, sharing the same values and rights, vision and respect for the point of view of other countries when tackling complex issues, such as immigration: this is the right way forward to avoid the risk of a rift between the Union and its neighbours.
We must prevent the walls which we have demolished within the Union now being constructed at our new borders.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to express my strong support for the policy of the Commission and the Council on Cyprus.
It is clear now that the Union must move swiftly to replace the United Nations as the principal force for peace and reconciliation upon that sad, divided island.
To assist that process, the European Parliament should, as soon as we reassemble, set up a special relationship with the North Cypriot Parliamentary Assembly.
I should like to request that the Commission and the Council consider supporting appropriate court cases brought by Turkish Cypriots aggrieved that they have been deprived of the franchise for the European Parliamentary elections.
Â Â  â Madam President, that the ten new Member States belong to Europe is so manifest that their accession to the European Union ought to have been a formality, as should the accession of all those countries, constituting much of Europe, which are not at present Member States.
I regard opposition to Turkish accession on religious grounds as unjust, whilst there are others in this House acting as spokesmen for traditionalist Catholicism by opposing womenâs rights.
My rejoicing at the relaxation of the EUâs internal borders would know no bounds were it not for the countervailing reinforcement of the external borders, by which peoples are cut in half.
The European Union must enforce respect for the rights of all minorities.
I would rejoice in the enlargement of the European Union were it not for the fact that it bears the marks of a project guided, not by the interests of the peoples, but by the desire to ensure the movement of capital and goods.
The new Member States have been incorporated as subject countries rather than as equals.
Their economies are already under the thumb of major industrial and financial conglomerates from Western Europe.
Having been incorporated into the EU, they are regarded as second-class members, and the debate on a future European Constitution largely revolves around the idea of putting this arrangement on a constitutional footing.
What is particularly shocking today is that restrictions are imposed upon the rights of people from the ten new Member States â their right to travel, settle and work anywhere within the European Union.
The aspect of the European project that gives me most hope is that it unites in one body some 200Â million European workers, both those in jobs and those currently unemployed.
I hope that, in the course of time, and above all as a result of social struggles, these workers may come to be aware that their fundamental interests are the same on whatever side of whatever border.
They will then be able to bring about the social Europe that we are merely talking about today, whereas the Europe of big business is all too real.
Â Â  Madam President, I should briefly like to return to a point made, so powerfully and yet with such charm, by my group Chairman, Mrs Frassoni, which was that Turkish Cypriots need to be given the opportunity to take part in the European elections.
On the assumption that it is listening, I should like the Councilâs comments as I take this one step further and ask whether, if the Turkish-Cypriots are unable to vote, you do not think that consideration should be given to leaving unoccupied two of the six Cypriot seats that are specifically intended for defending the interests of the Turkish-Cypriots.
Secondly, in the discussion about the present enlargement, the question is often asked: 'where do we stop?'
Where does Europe end?
That is a point for Commissioner Nielson.
So far, the European Commission has taken a very pragmatic line on this.
In addition to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, the Balkans have, in principle, been given a 'yes', without a timeframe.
The Ukraine and Belarus have not received any answer, whether âyesâ or ânoâ.
According to the newspapers, though, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, stated in Dublin last weekend that the book is closed for the Ukraine and Belarus.
They can never become members of the European Union.
Is this a change in the Commission's position?
Did the Commission establish the European Union's ultimate borders in its spare time this weekend, or is this a misunderstanding?
The third point relates to an old discussion, namely whether it is possible both to enlarge and to deepen.
In other words, how does enlargement affect the chances of establishing a common foreign policy?
Some, including some of us, are of the opinion that this is less likely after enlargement, because there are now 25 countries, which reduces the chance of unanimity.
Others, on the other hand, are pleased, because they want anything but foreign policy.
As I see it â and I am prepared to uphold this view here â the lesson we learnt in Iraq is that we never want Europe to be so divided again.
I think that the chances of adopting a European foreign policy have increased, and, contrary to popular belief, I do not expect the new Member States to be Trojan horses.
In my opinion, it is possible to enlarge and deepen, which means common foreign policy is a possibility, even after enlargement.
Â Â  Madam President, on the first of May a new stage in the unification of Old Europe was completed.
Euro-enthusiasts cried âEurope, here we are!â
Surely this cannot mean Poland was not previously part of Europe?
After all, even when through no will of its own, Poland was part of the system of totalitarian coercion, it was able to generate certain forces within itself.
These forces triggered the unification of a divided Germany, and went on to build bridges across the entire continent.
Thus was political unification achieved.
The only pity is that the economic burden of this process is again being borne by the countries that were once behind the Iron Curtain.
For Europe to be cohesive, strong, and acceptable to all its citizens, it must accept new values along with new Member States.
I refer to those values Europe is tending to move away from.
The equality of citizens, the equality of nations, and a balanced economic development cannot remain mere slogans in the context of a world market that is very rapidly becoming globalised.
United, we are stronger and wiser.
Let us rather build ourselves a single one-speed Europe and ensure balanced and stable development.
Internally, Europe must be modern, but above all it must be competitive in external markets.
Let us build a Europe that will generate economic growth and reduce the areas affected by poverty.
Contemporary Europe amounts to a collection of rules, restrictions and regulations. These are often harmful to weaker countries that have just made it into the organisation.
There have also been numerous damaging corruption scandals.
What is even more regrettable is that Europe seems to lack the determination to resolve them.
This is a kind of disease. If it is not treated in time, it will result in far more serious diseases.
Now everything depends on us.
It is up to us to determine whether the enlarged Europe will remain paralysed.
Alternatively, we could work together to take advantage of our inherent attributes for rapid, joint development.
It would then be possible to offer even more hope of greatness to the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  Madam President, the remark was made on quite a few occasions yesterday that it is only now that the Second World War has properly come to an end.
As one person put it: it is only now that Hitler and Stalin have finally been conquered by Walesa and Havel.
Freedom, respect and tolerance have conquered the forces of totalitarianism.
That is what makes the step taken today so significant, not mainly for ourselves who are active now, but for those who will follow us.
In contrast, rather, to Commissioner Verheugen, whose efforts we all have every reason to be grateful for today, I should like to state that it was precisely this state of affairs that the fathers of the EU wanted to achieve: the Europe without borders, in which we no longer talk about East and West as a political dividing line.
On a day such as today, it is important that we should not construct new borders, but be open not only to the possibility of others too joining, but also to the old Member Statesâ taking on board some of the new things that enlargement can provide.
Politicians of a new breed have, as from now, taken their place in this Parliament.
They are people who, irrespective of their position, have helped to give their peoples freedom and have now led them into a still larger community.
On the morning after 1 May, I found myself attending mass at a little Catholic church in Tallinn in Estonia where the priest was talking about the hot topic of the day.
âWe have always asked how we shall benefit if we become Members of the EU and what we should get out of it,â he said.
âA Christianâs first question, however, is not, of course, how do I stand to benefit, but what can I give?â
We have a very great deal to learn from what these people have to give who have now taken their places among us and whose values and ideas not even the very worst weapons of Soviet power could overcome.
I can only hope that the rest of us will listen, learn and be receptive.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo what other speakers have already said, that Europe is indeed experiencing a historic moment.
For the first time in the history of our continent, twenty-five countries and nationalities are sitting together round the table and are beginning to work together.
I would like to thank all those, in the Commission, in the Council and here in Parliament, who have contributed to this success.
This enlargement does not, however, signify the end of the enlargement process in Europe.
I understand how important it is for the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to have a clear vision, how important it is to have foresight and how important it is to have a plan that these countries and nations can follow.
It is for this reason that I welcome the year 2007 regarding Romania and Bulgaria, which is a realistic date for these countries.
I also welcome what we have heard about Croatia, which in the course of recent months and years has made substantial progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, especially the criteria that we have discussed here, such as human and civil rights, political democracy and a functioning market economy.
It is very important these nations and countries have programmes for the future that they are able to follow and that will contribute to the further success of the unified European continent.
We should not, however, forget other Balkan countries during this process, namely Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Whilst it may take these nations and countries longer than the Romanians, Bulgarians and Croats, I think the doors to the European Union should be open for them.
In conclusion, I should like to give an answer, if I may, to my fellow Member regarding the conduct of new Members in the process of establishing the Common Security and Defence Policy.
I am convinced that these countries will conduct themselves responsibly and that they will contribute to implementing policies that will enable Europe to play its role in the world.
Â Â  âMadam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about the enlargement of the European Union and about the relations with our new neighbours.
This, the fifth enlargement of the European Union is, historically speaking, certainly one of the greatest challenges faced by the whole of Europe.
Since 1 May we can say that there is no longer any reason to speak of a divided Europe, but of one united large European family, which must act according to common perceptions and rules.
For this we also need the European Unionâs Constitutional Treaty.
Hopefully the drafting of the treaty will already be completed in June, since only then can we continue as the worldâs most dynamic economic and political union.
Enlargement has also given the European Union many new neighbours.
Estonia, having spent many long years in the Soviet Union against its will, as a member of the European Union now has Russia as its direct neighbour, followed by Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova further to the south.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to spend a year as an observer in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, one of whose priorities is relations with the European Unionâs neighbouring countries, and I would like to continue working in this committee.
As a liberal, I wish to continue to support the European Unionâs commitment to promote the development of democracy and press freedom in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and particularly in Russia.
Estonia is a good example to them of the transition to a European country.
Our experiences are necessary for the creation of a new and democratic Europe.
Our investment in the development of our new neighbours is essential, since the existence of democratic neighbours is a complimentary security guarantee for the European Union itself, and fruitful mutual cooperation is a foundation for the future.
I therefore await with interest the new development strategy for the European Unionâs neighbourhood policy due to be drafted shortly.
Â Â  â Madam President, I believe that enlargement should mainly be a procedure of resetting and renewing the objective of a Europe of democracy, solidarity and peace.
The question of Cyprus, a new Member State of the Union but with the political problem unresolved, is a typical example of the achievement of this objective.
The European Union, while respecting the results of the referendum and implementing the Act of Accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, needs to step up its efforts in order for there to be a solution in the form of reunification of the island and reconciliation of the two communities, a solution in the form of a twin-community, twin-zone federation, without foreign troops and permanent referees.
First, such a solution will prove that the dynamism of the European Union is not restricted solely to personifying the expectations of the European nations for a better future, but that it also constitutes a framework for the resolution of differences, which can guarantee the application of international law and, at the same time, respect for the human and democratic rights of its people.
Secondly, let us not forget that the resolution of the Cyprus question will contribute to the security and stability of and peace in the wider area of the Middle East, which is suffering acutely following the military invasion by the United States of Iraq and the continuing policy of Sharon, who refuses to respect the rights of the Palestinian people.
Â Â  Madam President, the Polish Parliament stipulated that the Republic of Polandâs entry into the European Union should be subject to the fulfilment of four conditions.
It is important to recall this today, because in politics there is nothing worse than delusion and ignorance.
The conditions were as follows.
First, that the Christian values that fashioned Poland and Europe, be recognised by the Union and included in the preamble to the treaty being drafted.
Second, that voting in the Council of the Union be according to the Nice system, and not on the basis of a double majority.
Third, that Poland shall not recognise any decisions of the tribunals and courts of the Union with respect to possible German claims.
Those who are advancing such claims should remember that war reparations owing to Poland have not yet been paid off, and that Poland may not be prepared to overlook the fact.
An executioner should not be seen as a victim or vice-versa.
Fourth, that Polish companies, like German companies from the former eastern zone, should be able to benefit from State aid.
A further basic condition must be added.
Poland will never give precedence to Union law over our constitution.
We shall not surrender the sovereignty of our national law.
Poland overcame occupation by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
Through its fight for independence, Poland paved the way to freedom for the peoples of Europe.
Thanks to its faith in God and thanks âŠ
âŠ values of the alliance we shall never surrender, in the meantime, the Union to âŠ
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, in this House, time flies by irretrievably.
We must prepare our European home for the accession of so many new countries.
After all, not everything is ready, not even in our own backyards.
Having focused too much on what they have to do, we must now deepen Europe, while, at the same time, we must formulate a clear answer for the other countries.
We know that by 2007, another two countries will join us, but Turkey is a candidate as well.
Today, however, we cannot claim that Turkey is ready to open negotiations.
It is clear that the Copenhagen criteria are not being met, whether in the practice of the law courts or that of care for minorities.
The Kurds, in particular, are complaining that, despite changes in legislation, they cannot discern any real improvements to the day-to-day situation, and, following a trial that was a mockery of justice, Leyla Zana is once again locked up together with her elected parliamentarian colleagues.
This is a clear illustration that Turkey is not ready.
We would therefore like to urge Turkey to conform to the Copenhagen criteria and inform us of its own accord when it is ready.
In anticipation of this, we want to put our own House in order with, as I hope, the new countries by our side.
Â Â  I should like to express my thanks and gratitude to you that Hungary has been able to become an integral part of the European Union.
I express my thanks and gratitude to my own region too, to Ajka, in the County of VeszprÃ©m, that here today, in Parliament, I can talk to you in the language of my native country.
This morning, during the Constitutional discussions, one Member of this House said that constitutional cooperation meant force.
We know another type of expression for libertinism, which, for us, represented 45 years of isolation and the Iron Curtain.
That is why we believe in cooperation.
We must not just limit ourselves to cooperation relating to the environmental and health effects of cross-border sustainable development, but I can assure you that even in such cases we will be quite decisive.
As a result of the Trianon Treaty, Hungary lost two-thirds of its land and one-third of its population and its minorities now live beyond its borders.
That is why it is very important for Hungary that Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia should join and that the capabilities of the Ukraine and Serbia should be increased.
It is very important for Hungary that the demographic deficit itself is eliminated in every region as soon as possible.
The examples are too fresh of situations where minorities are in the majority at regional level, yet are still unable to exercise their autonomous rights.
The examples of cases where minorities are deprived of their rights to vote and to be elected on the basis of various legally fabricated reasons are too fresh.
The soon to be introduced Constitution will provide a further guarantee that the ruling powers will never have the chance, even in theory, to repeat this dreadful period of the twentieth century.
Â Â  Madam President, cooperation between the Europe of 25 with the neighbouring countries to the east, such as the Ukraine, and to the south, such as North Africa, should not in the first place be about EU membership, but about stability and security pacts, whereby the control of borders and border regions should be central.
At the same time, it is necessary for the enlarged Europe to put its own house in order.
In this Europe, there is too much neo-liberalism and too little in the way of social dialogue, social security and employment.
In this Europe, there is too much backroom politics and too little public-political debate.
In this Europe, there is too much red tape and too little discretion shown in working practices.
A more social, more democratic and more selective Europe means a strong Europe with a Constitution.
Consequently, that Europe, with the self-assurance of the citizens behind it, could give its backing to stability and security pacts with the new neighbours.
If we focus only on further cooperation with our new neighbours without completing the work we have to do on ourselves, we will disrupt society and democracy within the Europe of 25 and make of it a project lacking electoral support.
Only if the citizens of the 25 feel stronger and more secure in themselves, will we, the Europe of 25, be able to be good neighbours.
Stability and security pacts entail not only fair trade zones, human rights programmes and knowledge exchange programmes, but also cooperation agreements in order to closely monitor our external borders and regions with regard to terrorism, the trafficking in women and crime.
Such stability and security pacts should not, however, be at the expense of Europe's worldwide contribution to the fight against poverty and to ending conflicts.
Quite the reverse: we, including the new Members, should contribute more.
That is also in keeping with Europe's social model â both internal and external.
Incidentally, I take the view that Europe should withdraw from Iraq until such time as the UN has actually taken over the mandate.
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to begin by welcoming our 162 new MEPs to the European Parliament.
I am convinced that there will be many exciting debates in this new Parliament, even though I myself shall not be participating because I am now, after two terms of office, leaving the European Parliament.
Many have said that this is an historic enlargement, as of course it is.
It must, however, be followed by further historic enlargements.
We must not stop here.
We must be open to a cooperation that does not set any geographical limits.
It must also be possible for every country that wishes to do so and that fulfils the stated requirements to become a Member of the EU.
I also welcome the negotiations with Turkey, even though I am aware that Turkey still has a huge amount of work to do in the matter of, for example, democracy.
The new, enlarged EU must take upon itself the arduous task of genuinely becoming a functioning Union for all citizens.
The objectives must be a secure future, human dignity, work, health and a sound environment to hand on to the next generation.
We must be tolerant, and we must be good neighbours.
I am therefore very proud that the Swedish Parliament voted against a proposal for transitional rules governing the labour force from the new EU countries.
I am proud that, from the beginning, my party â the party of the environment â absolutely rejected transitional rules in any form.
Such rules only cause offence and put a damper on the joy of having good neighbours.
That is something that also emerged extremely clearly from Lech Walesaâs speech yesterday.
To obtain respect, there must also be a readiness to respect others.
Â Â  Madam President, it was a privilege for me over the past three legislative periods, from the liberation of eastern Europe to the accession of the new Member States, to take part in the accession process as policy coordinator for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and, initially, also as strategy rapporteur.
It involved letting the Union be what the peoples who were once so oppressed hoped it was: a federation of democratic constitutional states contributing to international peace.
The acceding states expected to come home to a community of values, one that also fulfils their deepest desires.
We are not primarily a market: âIt's not the economy, stupid!â
The Council is possibly less bothered by it, but we, as representatives of the European citizens, insist that not the bureaucratic or power-political arguments carry the weight, but the political-moral arguments.
I would echo the Commissioner's words about Turkey and the need to give political criteria priority over the more technical policy problems.
I noticed recently that this Turkish Government increasingly understands and appreciates this.
In the same way, political values should also be given priority where Romania is concerned.
I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will not disregard Parliament's warning and carry on business as usual.
The accession of the ten is a very festive event, marred only by the off-key note of the Cypriot referendum, on the basis of which, quite remarkably, the no-voters are being rewarded with two seats taken from the yes-voters.
In fact, I wonder whether that is indeed the intention and whether something will yet be done about this.
This shows how much we need to continue to insist on the sustainability of the political changes before a candidate becomes a member.
A crucial factor in this context is the way in which the Members of this Parliament view their term in office.
We are European representatives of the people, elected in different countries.
That means that we stand up for general European well-being, in accordance with the old biblical duty that we should not only look after our own interests, but also that of others.
In that light, I hope that Europe is becoming increasingly Christian.
The mood of solidarity creates the confidence that is essential to us, and on which the EU's future will depend.
Â Â  â Madam President, first I should like to thank everyone who contributed towards the integration of the Republic of Cyprus into the European Union and to say that Cyprus, which has battled and fought hard for freedom, justice and, above all, solidarity between peoples, is becoming a member of the European Union, which has these as its principles and objective.
Cyprus has a great deal to gain from the European Union but, at the same time, vice versa, it can also give quite a lot to the European Union, with its contribution and the role which it has to play with its civilisation, culture and geopolitical position, which can be the bridge between the European Union and the Middle East.
Our integration into the European Union is the achievement of one of the major objectives which we set, but this does not mean for us that we shall rest.
Our next objective is to resolve the Cyprus question, an objective which, unfortunately, we were unable to achieve prior to integration.
We shall make every effort, as quickly as possible, to achieve it.
Our desire is to reunite our country.
The democratic decision by the Greek Cypriots does not express a wish not to resolve our problem.
The result of the referendum was a reaction to a specific plan.
As regards the so-called embargo mentioned earlier for the Turkish Cypriots, and which never existed on the Greek Cypriot side, we believe that our Turkish Cypriot fellow countrymen, who for us are equally European Citizens, with all the rights which derive from the integration of Cyprus into the European Union, certainly need to be strengthened economically.
This has also been proven by the Turkish Government, with support measures which it itself announced a year ago and again recently at the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Luxembourg.
Naturally, this will need to be done without there being the slightest risk of recognition of another state within the European Union itself.
Our objective is to resolve the Cyprus question as quickly as possible, so that the entire Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, can again celebrate together the integration of a united Cyprus into the European Union and the reunification of our homeland.
Â Â  â Madam President, I had the wonderful opportunity to share in celebrating the historic event of enlargement and our neighboursâ joy on Frankfurtâs .
It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, above all because the event had been preceded by a long process involving a great deal of work on both sides.
The winners can celebrate, but there are losers too, and they have already been mentioned.
One important group who have lost out are the Turkish Cypriots, who voted in favour of Europe.
Another is made up of the people on both sides of the new external border, regions with which I am familiar in my capacity as Vice-Chairman for relations with Ukraine, Moldavia and Belarus.
I am disappointed that the Commission is again rolling back its neighbourhood concept, and that it is not addressing the problems of people on the borders where they are.
To the practical problems of border regions, it has geopolitical solutions, and that is the wrong way to deal with them.
What bothers people, what they are afraid of, is the new Schengen border, the new frontier and the prospect of again being out in the cold.
If you were to travel to these regions, that would be your experience too.
For real change to happen in our neighbourhood concept, I am relying very much on the cooperation of our fellow-Members from Poland and Slovakia and our counterparts in Ukraine and the other neighbouring countries.
In working with our neighbours, we need to open borders and bring regions together, facilitating retail trade and economic development, or else the interior will also die.
For years, that has been our experience in Germanyâs border regions, and so I urge the Commission to rethink its concept and ensure that the idea of Europe as a project for peace is communicated to the new border regions too, and the door is not shut on them, but rather that we take further what Parliament has proposed, which is an open-door policy, involving practical action to deal with peopleâs problems where they actually are.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to convey the grateful thanks of the entire political world, as a representative of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, and of its entire people for your positive contribution, so that my country could become part of enlarged Europe.
We assure you today that we shall repay it with the positive role of our contribution and our consistency towards what we call a Europe of all the peoples, a strong, powerful Europe, a Europe of prosperity, security and stability.
Cyprus today forms the south-easternmost edge of the European Union and the crossroads of the three continents.
Cyprus has and can play a role for the European Union and can act as the gateway to these three continents and, at the same time, the point of peace, stability and prosperity in the entire area.
Our people believed in European values and the European vision, they believed in everything that today governs the European Union, and one important reason why they took this particular decision, which was not a decision not to resolve the Cyprus question, was because principles and values which have to do with the guarantee and the security of the island could not create this feeling in the people themselves.
They could not create this feeling, if you think â and you must understand us â that our people, in their course through history, were only without an occupying army, without foreign troops, without suffering invasion and abuse of their human rights, from 1960 to 1974.
I believe today that Cyprus can constitute a major positive challenge for Europe, a positive challenge in which it will be able to prove and gainsay all those who think that it is only a commercial and financial union, proving that it is also a political union.
Today I convey to you the historic will of our people to achieve a solution to our problem, in a place where equal rights for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are already being applied, and I assure you of this.
Â Â  â Madam President, yesterday, when we welcomed Members from the ten new Member States, many speakers spoke in terms of the dream of the unification of the continent of Europe coming true.
For one of the Member States, Cyprus, it has not done so.
Even today, Cyprus is divided by a wall, by barbed wire, and by minefields.
I have had the pleasure of joining our Cypriot friends in celebrating their accession, and I have come back from Cyprus with more optimism than I had before I went.
Even though part of the island has rejected the Annan plan, I am still convinced that the Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, can live together and want to do so.
They are a single, sovereign and indivisible people, and where there is a will there is a way.
That way goes via renewed dialogue between the communities under the auspices of the European Union.
One possible reason why the referendum in the Republic of Cyprus failed may be that the voters felt themselves rushed and that too little time was allowed for explanations; that being so, it was monopolised by nationalist slogans.
What matters now is that the Cypriots should move on to an in-depth debate on their future together.
This, Madam President, Commissioner, is my last speech in the European Parliament, and so I issue an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Council, that they should put behind them the legitimate disappointment aroused by the rejection of the Annan plan, but, Commissioner, we must not sit around idly.
As from today, the reunification of Cyprus is a European problem, and so we must again seize the initiative.
Â Â  â Madam President, today, having celebrated the completion of enlargement, it is right that this House should also sketch, for the benefit of those who are to be elected here, some of the outlines that will have to determine the EUâs foreign policy commitments and underpin our own commitment during the campaign for the coming European elections.
You will be aware how perturbed some of our neighbours and friends on the other side of the Mediterranean are today at the prospect of our Union devoting excessive energy and resources to the realisation of its new internal unity, to the detriment of the interest it should have in their own future.
I am sure that Jean Monnet, whose memory we honoured this morning, and whose humanism was leavened by pragmatism, would not have failed to notice that a continued contribution to the development of our Southern neighbours was not only Europeâs duty, but also in its interest and in the interests of generations yet to come, on both sides of the Mediterranean.
Along with Mr Cohn-Bendit, I had the privilege of presenting, two years ago, an own-initiative report on the privileged partnership that the European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union had agreed to establish.
A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join with a large number of Members of this House in the inaugural session of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Athens.
It is my hope that, when Parliament reassembles, many of those of us in whom their electors put their trust will continue to work with determination to extend to North Africa, to the Middle East and to the whole of the continent of Africa, the area of peace and stability that our forebears were able to establish on both banks of the Rhine 60 years ago.
To do so is not only Europeâs vocation, but also in its interests.
Â Â  On 1 May, when celebrations marking EU expansion were taking place throughout the whole of Europe, Lithuania also celebrated the Day of Workersâ Solidarity.
To the people of the new member countries EU membership means more social justice, more civilized working conditions, and better salaries.
We must not create a new Iron Curtain, fencing ourselves off from our new neighbours, the Ukraine, Moldova and, of course, Russia, countries which are actually old neighbours as far as the new Member States are concerned.
Let us not take away those countriesâ hopes that one day they will themselves become members of the European Union.
Belarus must not be left beyond the neighbourhoodâs boundaries.
Lithuania, which has a five hundred and fifty kilometre external border with this State, is very concerned that economic reforms and democratic change should take place in this country.
If nothing is done in this State, however, then everything will carry on as before for many years to come.
Some of the new member countries have already lived with their neighbours in one union.
We understand the mentality and customs of our neighbours and are ready to help export the values of the European Union to our new neighbours.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your congratulations, but the celebrations are over and we in Latvia are used to working in a businesslike way, without illusions.
There is much talk here of how the Second World War has come to an end.
I would like only to remind you here that it is not over for everyone and especially not for our neighbours.
Between the Baltic and the Black Sea we have, first of all, the Belarussians, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Georgians as our neighbours.
We congratulate the Romanians, who will be in the European Union in a couple of years, but why not the Moldovans?
Only because the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Soviet forces to occupy part of Romania and because these forces remained in Moldova and refused to withdraw.
We are forced to watch, we are doing something and we in the Baltic States will not be content to watch television in comfort as mothers in Moldova are forced to trade in their own kidneys to feed their starving children.
Will the Black Sea be a black hole where the drug and arms traders' crossroads meet, or will we be able to change this situation?
Belarus is completely terrorised by the communists.
In Georgia Russian forces are refusing to withdraw and are supporting separatists.
What is the situation in our neighbouring country, Russia?
It has been best described by the former member of the Duma and noted businessman, Konstantin Borovoy.
He says that KGB men are currently in charge in Russia, which is almost the same as if Gestapo men were in power in Germany and were saying that everything is much improved and changed.
Friendship with the West is a sham and the provocations in the Baltic countries will continue, to be used as a bargaining chip in a deal with the West on the issue of Chechnya.
Madam President, that is a precise description of what our neighbours in a neighbouring State have been given by a member of the State Duma.
As long as we are aware that some countries are continuing to profit from the results of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, we will, of course, be able to do something.
In conclusion, before we dream about the European Union's borders with Iraq, let us put our closer neighbours in order.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many people tend to refer to certain events, in which they participate as they are happening, as historic or unique, because that is how they appraise the period in question.
As time goes by, however, developments themselves, history itself, finalises things, and events are placed in their real proportion when developments themselves confirm them or cancel them.
I believe, however, that history will not gainsay us and will confirm the political and historic values of this promising step of recent enlargement by Europe.
Often we debate the future in terms of ideologies which have either collapsed or are outdated, resulting in our engaging in useless nostalgia.
United Europe, however, must be constructed on the basis of a forward-looking perception, with positive prospects, supported on principles of humanitarianism, freedom, diversity, pluralism and peace.
A few years ago, our current partners were our neighbours, with all the peculiarities and the historic and political burden of a different era.
Today we are acquiring new neighbours, with a positive perception, with an expectation of hope towards the European Union on the part of citizens and politicians alike.
The integration of the ten countries into the Union does not mean that all the individual problems have automatically been resolved.
There are mild problems, cross-border problems, minority problems and so on, but they have all launched their solutions within the favourable environment.
These ten countries bring great potential.
The Baltic States and the former central and eastern European countries to the other Europe, Malta to Africa and the Mediterranean and Cyprus to the eastern Mediterranean and beyond.
In a few years' time we expect Bulgaria, Romania and, later, Croatia.
The same applies to Turkey which, I hope, will quickly adapt to what are European values.
As for our beloved, long-suffering Cyprus, the green and golden leaf tossed into the sea, the island of Aphrodite, we all welcome it, as I do, as a Greek.
I hope, as does everyone else who supported the Annan plan, as does the European Parliament, that it will help to bring about positive developments for the reunification of the island.
Ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Lithuania, welcome!
The same to Malta, for which I acted as shadow rapporteur.
Welcome to you all, all ten of you.
Once again, as a Greek, welcome dear Cyprus.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my joy at the current enlargement.
I wish our Community peace, stability, prosperity and a good quality of life.
God bless our joint work.
I would now like to return to the subject of our debate.
The EU changed its neighbours and its external borders overnight.
This transformation also represents a challenge to produce a new, well thought out integration project, which will be an extension of the current project, at the end of which Europe will be reunited within its geographical and cultural borders.
For our new neighbours the prospect of integration represents the same dream as we had ourselves.
Our joint task is to help these countries to fulfil their dream.
I know from the experience of my own country how the prospect of the European Union membership can be a driving force for carrying out necessary reforms that would otherwise require fierce political determination.
The European Union is already showing an interest in extending the enlargement process, and new emphasis in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy should reflect this.
Not only are there new neighbours, but the character of the neighbourhood is also changing.
Information technology, rapid transport systems and trade have given the neighbourhood a new dimension.
In this respect, our common interest also concerns the countries of the developing world.
We can use the extra energy that was released following the latest enlargement for a new spirit of cooperation with those countries.
In order for this cooperation to be successful, we must overcome the divergence of policy tools in the area of external relations and ensure that they are simplified and harmonised.
This will make the new neighbourhood complete.
Â Â  â Madam President, the European Union is beginning a new stage in its history.
The greatest enlargement in 47 years has been completed.
The EUâs population is rising to half a billion people, and one of the biggest single markets in the world is coming into being.
This is a source of hope, above all to young people, who have no first-hand experience or knowledge of the Second World War or of the Cold War that followed it.
They are so used to peace that they do not see the peace policy dimension of this enlargement as the most important thing about it.
Nevertheless, this is probably the most important thing associated with what happened on 1 May â the enlargement, or, as one might say, the reunification of Europe.
What we now have to do is to work towards partnership with our immediate and more distant neighbours and make the best possible use of it in the interests of all parties.
It is important that a Europe that is still grappling with its own constitution should work together to further the common interest and think in regional terms.
Only together will we be able to cope with the challenges that the enlarged Union will face.
Only together will we be able to resolve the problem of illegal immigration and win the war on organised crime.
In this, investment in securing the EUâs new external borders is every bit as important as the use of resources for scrapping dangerous nuclear power stations.
The European Union now needs time to let enlargement become a success.
It is logical that the next stage should involve Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia â the last of which would be very desirable as a new Member State.
As far as Turkey is concerned, it is time that we appealed to the Council to ask the Commission to add to its report on the political criteria â which has not yet been produced â a study of the potential impact on the Structural and Agricultural Policies and on the EUâs institutions.
Â Â  Madam President, in an interview in in 1992, the then President of the European Commission, Mr Delors, said that we should not forget that in the year 2000 we shall be more than 12, maybe a little more than 20.
There is a country that one forgets but it is very important as a symbol: Malta.
We must not displace Europe too much towards the north whilst forgetting the south.
That would risk losing our sensitivity to the Mediterranean world, which is our world.
And we should contemplate the dangers in the future for all of us.
Mr Delors' statement made 12 years ago is still pertinent today insofar as the Mediterranean confronts dangers that face us all.
It is about this Mediterranean world, in particular its southern and eastern perimeter, that I would like to share my thoughts with this assembly today.
I believe it is an accepted fact that a major cause of strife in the Middle East is that so far no solution has been found to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
For the Arab world Palestine is not just another issue affecting some Arabs.
It is an issue affecting an Arab people.
Through the centuries we have witnessed, and sometimes caused, the sufferings of the people of Israel.
It would be a major political mistake on our part were we to ignore this reality, but it would be equally tragic if we were not also to bear in mind the plight of the Palestinian people living as refugees in their own country, walled up in their own territory.
The European Union has a shared responsibility to bringing about in the region the change from an economy of strife to an economy of peace.
It is here that strong political and diplomatic presence in the Middle East on the part of the European Union can give positive results to our neighbourhood policy.
By promoting peace, prosperity and stability in the region, the European Union will not only be contributing to the welfare and security of the region but also to its own security.
Insofar as North Africa is concerned, things are moving ahead.
The Libya which is now emerging can be a very positive element for the central Mediterranean.
Relations between the EU and the Maghreb are also slowly but surely moving ahead positively.
The Agadir Agreement can be a fundamental link, bringing us closer to our joint objective of a Euro-Med free-trade area by the year 2010.
However, in the Mediterranean we are facing an important choice and the necessity of taking certain decisions.
There are some who look at the future and see the region as an area where a clash of civilisations is bound to take place.
Indeed, some may be moving towards self-fulfilling prophecies.
The choice, if it can be called choice, is between a policy leading to a clash of civilisations and one promoting a dialogue of civilisations.
We cannot afford to have in the Mediterranean a great divide between the north and south.
It would be geographically unnatural; it would economically harmful; it would be politically disastrous.
If we are to realise peace in the Mediterranean we need to start thinking Mediterranean.
For if this Mediterranean of ours is to overcome its present divisive element, we have to build on our commonalities: common interests, common concerns, a common heritage.
It is the new Mediterranean where the EU can contribute towards removing those dangers for the future of us all.
Â Â  . Madam President, my first remark is to Mrs Frassoni, who asked about the decision taken by the Council on 26 April to earmark money for Northern Cyprus.
This was a political decision made by the Council.
The Commission will work out how to clarify it.
In terms of the kind of decision-making involved here, this is how outstanding commitments come about.
We have had enormous problems with outstanding commitments that have accumulated in our general external aid.
A lot of that has historically reflected these kinds of manifestation-driven decisions that have not been based on more specific and better prepared work.
Please bear in mind that the fastest possible tender for anything â and we have to put everything out to tender â takes at least six months.
And that is when we have reached a point where we actually have something concrete to put out to tender! There is a lot of work to be done before we reach that stage.
Parliament must understand that there is some way to go, and that the decision was more of a political signal than something that immediately translates into specific actions.
It is not fair that this Commission, or our successors in the next Commission, should continue to be under the same kind of pressure that we have felt thus far.
The Council decision will be respected.
Many Members addressed the broader global perspective of an enlarged Europe.
It is not Europe that has been enlarged, but the European Union: that is an important distinction.
I am confident that what we do in the global perspective will not in any way be weakened by enlargement.
It will in fact be strengthened.
Mr Lagendijk asked whether, in the light of the lessons we learned last year regarding Iraq, we should have a common foreign and security policy.
He said that we must hope that the new Member States will not act as a Trojan horse.
I have strong views on this.
With regard to deepening or expanding the Union, please keep in mind that the Luxembourg Agreement reinstating the veto in the Community was decided in 1966, many years before the first wave of enlargement took place.
It would be nice if the 'old' Member States could show some humility now and then.
It is also interesting to note that CFSP will not really mean 'common foreign and security policy' as long as it is totally off-limits to discuss, within the framework of our foreign policy cooperation, what two of the Member States of this Union are doing in the UN Security Council.
In many ways, the 'C' in CFSP still only means 'convenient'.
This is where we are.
I do not approve of using this moment of celebration as an opportunity to forget these fundamental realities.
The challenge is still there.
Some Members referred to the Treaty being negotiated and discussed as a way forward on these issues.
I would warn against unrealistic expectations. There is in what is now being discussed that creates a new situation in relation to what we are addressing here.
Europe cannot have a High Representative based on the lowest common denominator, and the whole architecture of our foreign policy is still defined by the lowest common denominator.
In relation to ensuring that the European public understands what cooperation is all about, one of my biggest worries is that we often create confusion by characterising what we have in an unrealistic manner.
That said, the debate today has been positive.
Mr Lagendijk also mentioned Mr Prodi's recent remarks on Russia and Ukraine.
There are no new messages for me to give you on this.
The notion of the European neighbourhood policy is exactly what we need.
If I disagreed with a Member while listening to the debate, it was for the most part because those concerned were jumping to conclusions.
This is not what we should do.
This new neighbourhood policy is simply borne out of a need to create a strategic, positively-defined neighbourhood, keeping our options open and organising everything over the long term.
Continual enlargement will never be a sustainable answer to the question of how to live with Europe's neighbours.
It is thus wise to have created and launched this concept; it serves Europe and our new neighbours well.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . Madam President, to paraphrase words first uttered 500 years ago now spirits have awakened, and life has again become a pleasure.
I recall these words today, first, to infuse optimism into those who are reluctant to rejoice in enlargement, and second, in order to draw attention to the need to create a new social order.
Like a table, this order must have at least three legs.
It needs an economic leg and a political leg.
It also needs a cultural leg which must be equally strong.
Without it, no table will stand, not even a round table like the one we sat round in Poland in the past.
This is the conclusion I bring to integration based on Polandâs latest experiences.
When I refer to culture, I have in mind all areas of human self-realisation.
I am thinking of the theatre, school, office; stadiums, an honest market, along with Parliament, and the Polish parliament in particular.
The Renaissance, Baroque, Enlightenment, Romanticism, and now Postmodernism are all bidding to be involved in the creation of the order I mentioned.
Many artists, writers, and intellectuals also wish to be involved.
They want to bring their creativity to bear on the political creation of a European identity.
This will take years to accomplish.
It is an exceedingly difficult task, particularly as regards ensuring the security of the culture of a multilingual Europe.
Today we are debating difficulties related to partnership with our neighbours.
I can identify a range of aspects of the relationship with our eastern neighbours.
There is warm friendship and cold acquisitive greed.
There is also mutual fascination and ethnic animosity, which poisons the intelligentsia.
I have personal experience of all these, and so do many millions of the citizens of Central Europe.
We know all about destruction and establishing new borders that are an affront to logic, morality, and dignity.
Â Â  . â The next item is the Commission statement on the European economic and social model.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to express my joy that enlargement is now a reality.
I am happy that, at this unique historic moment for the European Union, I am being given an opportunity to debate with you, the representatives of 450 million people and of a union of markets, economies, peoples and societies, the two basic foundations on which the European Union is based: the economic and the social model.
The European economic model concerns the unification of markets and economies and the coordination of economic policies.
The European social model is designed to secure a high level of social protection, education and social dialogue, based on good economic performance.
These two models are two sides of the same coin.
They represent the two characteristics which distinguish the European Union from other areas in the world.
In addition, they have helped not only to secure entire decades of increased prosperity for all citizens, but also to consolidate peace and friendship between the peoples of Europe.
As far as the European economic model is concerned, the Treaty makes provision for the application of an economic policy based on close coordination of the economic policies of the Member States.
Economies with a great degree of unification and interdependence which share a common market and have a common currency need efficient coordination of economic policy if they are to benefit from them.
That is why the European Union has drawn up a detailed framework for economic policy.
Within this framework, the expression 'coordination of economic policy' is used as a general term, which covers an entire spectrum of interactions between policy-making factors, at both national level and European Union level.
The methods used include exchanging information, discussing best practices, engaging in policy-making dialogue, drafting jointly agreed rules and policy objectives and taking jointly decided action.
The uniqueness of the coordinating framework in Economic and Monetary Union lies in the fact that an independent, supranational European Central Bank has undertaken to exercise a single monetary policy, while responsibility for economic, financial and structural policies remains decentralised in the hands of the national authorities, but subject to joint rules.
The European Central Bank decides monetary policy on the basis of developments noted in the eurozone as a whole and therefore has the facility to deal in the best possible way with any important crises which may affect the common currency zone.
By contrast, the national governments each have the facility to apply their own economic policy based on the specific problems and crises which each individual country faces within, of course, the limits of joint rules.
Many of the constituent components of the economic coordinating framework are closely linked to the general Lisbon strategy, a strategy of structural reforms with economic, social and environmental dimensions.
The framework of economic policy gives the national policy of each country a noteworthy degree of autonomy in important sectors and reflects the application of the principle of subsidiarity, which is based on strong economic and political logic.
In certain specific sectors, such as the single market, competition policy and financial deficits, the application of joint rules and provision for reliable measures to ensure they are adhered to are required.
In other sectors, such as the size and composition of government spending, structural policies and social welfare benefits, there are no strong arguments for requiring that competence for exercising policy be transferred to supranational level.
The decentralisation of policy-making procedures gives the national authorities the necessary room for manoeuvre, allowing them both to apply policies in keeping with national economic structures and preferences and to adapt to the economic developments noted in each individual country.
It also provides the facility to safeguard the beneficial results of competition policy.
Macroeconomic coordination in the eurozone is generally based on dialogue and agreement.
It aims to maintain a healthy and stable macroeconomic framework and to optimise the policy mix at short-term level to address cyclical developments.
Its main objective is to ensure that economic growth comes up to its real potential.
The results of structural policies in the partner countries and the joint benefits provided by Economic and Monetary Union may not be perceived quite as easily as the consequences of macroeconomic policies.
Nonetheless, it is clear that the existence of efficient and flexible markets is of decisive importance to increasing the potential for growth and to safeguarding the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
In order to avoid distortions and safeguard the smooth functioning of the internal market, structural policies which have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and competition are subject to stronger forms of coordination.
Now, what constitutes the European social model?
The conclusions of the European Council in Barcelona describe it as a model based on good economic performance, a high level of social protection and education and social dialogue.
Thus, the European social model supports the parallel development of economic and social prosperity and is based on the interdependence between economic efficiency and social progress.
Despite the differences which exist between our individual national systems, this particular European social model, which European social policies strengthen in a bid to consolidate the economic power of Europe, really does exist.
The European social model, in the various forms in which it appears in the Union, has played a vital role, contributing to the constant increase in productivity and uninterrupted improvement in the social level in the whole of the Union, while at the same time ensuring that the benefits are as widespread as possible.
Nonetheless, in order to improve its efficiency, this model needs to be updated.
The social partners play a very important role from this point of view.
The reform is also facilitated by cooperation at European level, which is happening today with issues such as employment, social integration and the reform of pension systems.
The Social Policy Agenda plays a most important role in the updating of the European social model.
It has as its reference point the strategic objective of Lisbon, according to which Europe needs to seek to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
This clearly reflects the perception that the Lisbon objective was a single strategic objective and not three juxtaposed aims.
Thus, it is clear that securing more and better jobs or promoting social cohesion are elements which can support competitiveness and improve economic performance.
The inclusion of competitiveness at the World Economic Forum, at which European countries such as Finland, Sweden and Denmark clearly have leading positions, clearly emphasises the vital importance of this interaction.
The success of the Social Policy Agenda depends on numerous factors and this constitutes an important advantage, because it broadens the range of agencies involved in implementing the Agenda and, in this way, strengthens the commitment to update the European social model.
The social partners play a crucial role from this point of view.
Social policies are not therefore simply the only result of good economic performance; they are, at the same time, a factor which makes an essential contribution to economic growth.
Updating the social model means developing and adapting it, so that account is taken of the fast changes taking place in the social economy.
Finally, I should like to point out that economic prosperity depends on efficient competition between businesses and social progress depends on solidarity between citizens.
Both these factors have contributed to the success of Europe.
Competition without solidarity would result in the law of the jungle.
Solidarity without competition would lead to stagnation.
That is why the European model is based on the market economy, which recognises the rights of workers and social dialogue.
In conjunction, therefore, with highly developed social systems, it provides the possibility to carry out the necessary structural changes in the economies of our societies in such a way as to avoid conflict and safeguard social stability.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has been a turning-point in Europeâs history, and we have experienced it at first hand.
Enlargement took place against a backdrop of uncertainties about the international situation, security problems, and problems with the preservation of social and environmental models common to us all. All of these are urgent issues that we must address.
Although enlargement has a political vocation, it must also be a source of impetus and growth.
We all want the EU to prosper for the sake of its 450 million consumers; we all want a dynamic EU, one founded upon solidarity.
If we are to have one, we must do everything possible to encourage sustainable growth through performance and competitiveness, which presupposes action on several different fronts.
It presupposes that we sustain and promote our successful businesses, our centres of excellence and develop our high-tech industries.
It presupposes that we step up our investment effort, for when the European Union has a euro in hand, that euro must not merely be spent; it must be invested in order to encourage innovation, develop research, maintain our SMEs, and encourage businesses to be handed on.
It presupposes that the euro should be accompanied by better coordination of economic and social policies, for there is a real need in Europe for economic governance in permanent dialogue with the Central Bank, and also that we review the Stability and Growth Pact, which must be tougher than 3% in periods of growth, but also slightly more flexible when the economy slows down.
The Europe that we want must not be guided by economic interests alone, but also by values of social progress and full employment.
If we are to restore Europeâs credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens, we have to make it a social Europe with more of a dimension of solidarity.
The European model that we want to build is founded upon values of humanism, liberty and solidarity, which solidarity is the result of economic growth, ensuring a satisfactory level of pensions, the protection of the weakest, promotion of the rights of workers and of the family.
If asked to sum up in one word my view of the social Europe, I would say it was the Europe of employment.
Â Â  â Madam President, there is no single European social model.
The social security systems of our twenty-five states were forged at different stages of history, and resulted from very different social struggles involving trade unionists and politicians.
There is, however, a sort of European social exception:Â the general awareness among our peoples that the economy must serve the well-being of society and of the environment.
The market, although indispensable, deals only with supply and demand at one given time.
It cannot predict the future or prepare strategic choices for balanced development.
That is still the noblest task of politics.
It was on our continent that social policy and the Welfare State were invented.
Having shaped our respective lifestyles, social policy will determine our future.
This Europe of ours must be social or it will perish.
The citizens of our twenty-five countries will identify themselves with Europe only when, and in so far as, the EU manages to demonstrate in practical ways its ability to improve living conditions for every citizen.
Future enlargements will be possible only if Europe makes every individual more prosperous.
At present, the public have doubts about the future; let me quote what Jacques Delors had to say on the subject: âWhen times are hard (...) there is a tangible decline in confidence in the European projectâ.
Europeâs ambitions cannot be bounded by the great market or by free trade alone.
The siren song of the liberals promises us more freedom and more material comfort by way of deregulation or liberalisation in which no holds are barred.
Yes, it is sometimes necessary to break companiesâ shackles, to break up monopolies and secure incomes, but the end-product of deregulation â if it does not give way to better rules â is the law of the jungle.
New freedoms must go hand in hand with equal opportunities, and be rounded off by unfailing solidarity with the weakest members of our societies.
European and economic policy cannot be limited to prudent monetary policy and the monitoring of Budget deficits.
Let me forcibly reiterate that we Socialists regard stability as a public good, one that must be defended in the interests of the poorest in society.
Without growth, however, stability leads to a social desert.
Europe must back up its ambitions with Budget resources, giving priority to future expenditure.
Investment in human capital, in research, and in infrastructure, will create the conditions for the publicâs aspirations to be met, with the right to work, to health, to housing, to be comfortably off and to enjoy a decent retirement.
Let me remind you of JacquesÂ Delorsâ celebrated three-pronged approach: âCompetition to stimulate, cooperation to strengthen, and solidarity to uniteâ!
ââ was the keyword that at last demolished the Iron Curtain and made the political unification of Europe possible.
Solidarity should still be the guiding principle for this our Europe; solidarity at home in order to promote a social Europe, but also solidarity with those beyond our borders.
Europe must be in the front line fighting for true globalisation, which is socially, environmentally and economically inclusive, in that it does not leave by the wayside billions of people living across two-thirds of the planet.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, how do we turn enlargement into an economic and social success?
We shall do so by equipping the new Europe for international competition in the way you talked about, MrÂ Dimas.
We shall do so by releasing initiative and energy, by continuing the work on creating an internal market involving free competition, by guaranteeing an internal market for financial services so that businesses have adequate and cheap capital to work with and by guaranteeing that, through free competition, consumers and taxpayers are supplied with a diverse range of products and services of high quality at reasonable prices.
The lesson to be learned from the bitter experience of Communismâs command economy was, of course, that economic and political freedom belong together.
Those of us in the new Europe must not, therefore, be afraid of economic freedom.
