The first point is our view of the recent events that have taken place in that region; the second is to analyse the political situation both in Palestine and in Israel; and thirdly, how the European Union sees the current situation and how, amongst all of us, we might find a way to speed up the peace process and thereby put an end to this spiral of violence we are caught up in.
With regard to the first point, that of recent events, I would like to go back, Mr President, to the last meeting of the Quartet in New York on 22 September.
I would like to emphasise four points from the document that emerged from that meeting, because some of them are important to the subsequent debate.
Some of these points seemed perhaps to have been forgotten or to have been put to sleep, but fortunately, thanks to that meeting of the Quartet on 22 September, they seem to have recovered their place in peopleâs hearts.
Of those four points, I will comment on the following: the need for reforms within the Palestinian Authority â we all agree on this â and also our complete and utter condemnation of terrorism.
But that resolution also talks of the need to stop the settlements, of the fact that the members of the Quartet should take note of the Decision of the International Criminal Court on the wall and that we members of the Quartet want the process of withdrawal from Gaza, which has been put into motion in Israel, to be part of broader political process and that it should genuinely lead to a resolution of the problem in its entirety.
Since then, 22 September, the situation on the ground in Gaza has unfortunately deteriorated.
What we have seen in recent days and weeks around Gaza has made us all suffer and, above all, has made us all reflect on what point there is to certain actions on the ground.
It is true that at one point the violence began when Palestinian terrorists launched Qassam rockets in the north of the Gaza Strip, but it is also the case that Israelâs response has not been what we European democrats would have expected.
It has been a response which we believe goes beyond what could be described as proportional: 119 deaths, a third of them of under-18s, amongst Palestinians; five deaths amongst Israelis, including two children.
It is not possible to go on living in this spiral of violence, in which people die senselessly, and continue to die senselessly, and this whole process of violence does nothing to take the peace process forward a single millimetre.
How can we stop it?
How can we stop this violence from continuing?
We in the European Union have done everything possible over these weeks â in constant contact with the authorities of Israel, Palestine, Egypt and Jordan â to see whether it is possible to bring about a comprehensive peace, a comprehensive ceasefire.
It has been impossible.
We have not achieved it, and we have not even managed to bring about any kind of pause in order to deal with humanitarian issues.
We therefore feel frustration, emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days.
The situation was complicated even further by the terrorist attack on Thursday night in Taba, which was also dreadful.
It was dreadful because of its senselessness, because of the people who died, Israelis taking their holidays, Egyptians looking after hotels, some European citizens who were there on holiday.
I would, therefore, like to express my total condemnation of this attack which made sense to the terrorists: to try to destabilise a country, Egypt, which is cooperating in the peace process in an admirable way.
I would, therefore, once again appeal to everybody who can hear us via this European Parliament for common sense, peace, an end to the violence, so that Israelâs process of withdrawal from Gaza can go ahead in peace and tranquillity, with no more victims on any side.
The second point I wanted to comment on is the situation in Palestine: you know it very well; you are well aware of the European Unionâs position.
Palestine now needs a government, a Palestinian Authority with the capacity to act as such, as a government.
We have asked, and we will do everything to ensure, that the rules which have been more or less agreed by President Arafat be signed by him, that he turn them into reality through a Prime Minister with real powers to operate in relation to what are fundamentally the elements defining a State: security, on the one hand, and the economy on the other.
With regard to the economic element, Mr President, I believe that our good friend the Minister for Finance is doing an admirable job.
Everybody knows this.
In the realm of security, however, there remains much to be done, and it is the responsibility of President Arafat to delegate real powers to his Prime Minister in relation to security; so that he can act and actually does act by means of his Interior Minister.
Until this happens, it will be more difficult to combat terrorism, to control the situation in terms of terrorism, peace and order in the occupied territories.
I would also like to say that it is very important that there be a clear interlocutor on the Palestinian side.
Israel keeps saying day after day that it cannot find an interlocutor with whom it can discuss the peace process.
This may become an excuse for those people who do not want to make progress, and the Palestinians should be capable of organising their own political life in such a way that that excuse cannot be used by those who do not want the peace process to move forward.
I would, therefore, like once again to appeal on behalf of the European Union â just as my personal delegate, Mr Marc Otte, is currently doing in Palestine â for a Palestinian Authority capable of carrying out its responsibilities in terms of internal reforms.
It is not just in Palestine, however, that a situation of this nature is arising.
I would like to point out that Israel is also currently experiencing a degree of political instability; this may also have repercussions for some of the measures being taken at the moment.
The negative vote two days ago in the Knesset raises a political problem for Prime Minister Sharon with regard to the decisions to be taken on the plan to withdraw from Gaza: the essential vote on funding, on the process of disengagement from Gaza, I believe, is also creating difficulties within Israeli political society.
Over the coming weeks, therefore, it is very likely that we will see new political realignments in Israel, which may even lead to the formation of a new coalition government.
In any event, however, it is also very probable that the elections scheduled for 2006 may have to be brought forward to 2005 for the reasons I have just explained.
Anyway, as far as we are concerned the important thing is that the peace process does not move any slower than it is at the moment.
Ladies and gentlemen, the road map talked of a peace process that should lead to two States by the end of 2005.
The most we will have in 2005 is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, nothing more.
And that is a great failure on all our parts and very specifically on the part of Israel and Palestine and on the part of the Quartet and the international community.
I would also like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the recent statements made by certain Israeli politicians are not acceptable to the European Union.
The nerve of these statements is completely unacceptable, to us at least.
To say these things about the meaning of disengagement from Gaza, the meaning of a complete and utter rejection of the road map, which the Israeli Government has endorsed, seems to me to be something we must condemn in the clearest possible terms.
We cannot accept that way of working in politics.
That kind of statement leads to a lack of trust, not only amongst us, but throughout the Arab world, in the neighbouring countries, amongst the Palestinians themselves and amongst a large section of Israeli society, and we cannot go on like that.
To say one thing and then say the opposite in the newspapers is not an honest way to behave in politics.
And it is not just any person who is saying it, but a person of weight, a significant and important person, one of the closest people to the Prime Minister of Israel.
Having said that, the question we are all asking is: what should we do?
What can we do from a European point of view?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the European Union has a clear direction, set out in the road map, which is also the result of the efforts of the Europeans, the Americans, the United Nations and the Russian Federation.
We shall defend it from the beginning to the end and we will not be in agreement with anybody who does not defend it from the beginning to the end. We do, and, therefore, anything we are able or wish to contribute at this point, we will contribute within the framework of that road map.
What could we do to speed up this process in the short and medium term?
I believe that in the short term we should work on four areas, with a view to ratifying them and implementing them at the next Council of Ministers in March, and certainly at the March European Council.
The first is security.
The European Union has the will and has a plan and an approach to help the Palestinian Authority to improve its situation in terms of policing; so that it can carry out its duties in a serious and rigorous manner, in accordance with law and order, and combating terrorism.
We are prepared to do so.
We have a plan for doing so, we have the people to do it and we have the will to do it.
Secondly, reforms.
The European Union is going to help the Palestinian Authority in every way it can to ensure that the process of reform which has begun is carried through to its conclusion.
The leaders of the Palestinian Authority have our absolute assurance that, if they want to progress towards reform, we will always stand by them.
Thirdly, actions of an economic nature.
Commissioner Patten will talk about this in more detail, but, in any event, you must be aware that we are prepared to continue helping to ensure that, from an economic point of view, this peace process does not have to suffer from a lack of resources from the European Union.
We must also say clearly, however, that the European citizens, who pay taxes in Europe, cannot be paying out money permanently if the operations being funded do not lead to the desired objective, which is peace.
And I would like to point out that, if the process of disengagement from Gaza is aimed solely and exclusively at Gaza, the citizens and leaders of Israel must be in no doubt that they cannot count on the European Union's money.
The Gaza process must be part of a longer process, a process that truly leads to two States, which is the fundamental objective of the road map.
Fourthly, and finally, I believe we must work seriously on the electoral process.
We must help to establish an electoral process in the Territories which the Palestinians can lead; to establish an electoral commission which is reliable and which has the trust of the people, so that the electoral process can create a leadership â the leadership the Palestinian citizens want â which can lead that country towards its ultimate dream, a dream many of us share, the dream of two States.
I have said this in relation to the short term, Mr President.
Can we continue with just a gradual, step-by-step method, or has the time come to do more?
Or has the time come to take a greater leap, to play a much more courageous role, if that is possible, but one which leads much more quickly to a definitive solution?
We believe it has, that the step-by-step approach, the small step by small step approach, is surely about to come to an end, and that, within the context of the road map, progress can be made, or made more quickly, if the political will is there.
We have that will and, once the elections have taken place in the United States of America, we will try to continue working with them, with our Russian friends and with our friends in the United Nations, to see whether it is possible to speed up the road map, so that this slowness which leads to suffering and frustration â and nothing positive for the Palestinians, nor for the Israelis, nor for the region, nor for us or our societies â comes to an end and much quicker progress genuinely begins and leads us to what we all dream of, which is â as I have said before â the two States.
We have talked a lot about the two States, but we have never defined the form the Palestinian State should take, what borders it should have.
All of these issues remain open and have not been closed.
I would like to say once again that, from the European Unionâs point of view, some of the elements of the final debate on these parameters are clear to us.
We believe the borders of this Palestinian State must be the 1967 borders.
We state this very clearly, we said it on Monday at the meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers, we have said it through the European Council and we are repeating it today formally in this House.
And, on the basis of those 1967 borders, the two parties must negotiate any exchanges of territory they consider necessary.
But that must be the basis for the negotiation and progress must be made on that basis â and I hope we can do so before the end of the year â and we must find a way to make more direct and rapid progress towards defining the final parameters, which can make this dream shared by so many people a reality and lead to a political process that contradicts some of the statements made over recent days by responsible and respectable people on behalf of Israel.
Having spoken, as we have in recent days, to the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, I would like to point out that they all have the same feeling that, without knowing exactly where we are going, nor what the borders of the new Palestinian State are, nor when that leap forward is going to happen, the stability of their own countries is to a certain degree in jeopardy.
Jordan is essentially a country whose borders are yet to be defined, which does yet know who its neighbour is going to be and which wants to know, and has the right to know, what the borders of its new neighbour, the Palestinian State, are going to be.
Mr President, the situation â as I have said â is sad and frustrating for those who have dedicated so many hours of their lives to trying to find a path to peace.
It is important that a solution is found, because the whole of the Middle East â not just the peace process, but the whole of the Middle East â has been plunged into a profound crisis and we all want to get out of it.
But we will probably have to do this by means of a faster and more effective peace process, with more involvement by the international community and by the fundamental players, which are Israel and Palestine.
Mr President, I have little more to say to you this afternoon, but I would like to say from the bottom of my heart that we will continue working between now and the next Council of Ministers to see whether we can implement a small plan which, within the context of the road map, can speed up the process in the way I have described to this House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the sadness, frustration, and at the same time emotion, that all these issues bring to anybody who discusses them â including all of you â I would say to you once again that we shall continue to work day and night to achieve that objective.
Â Â  Mr President, divine intervention notwithstanding, I imagine that this will be the last speech â certainly on the Middle East â that I make in this House.
I have lost count of the number of debates on this subject there have been since I took office.
On a sensitive issue like this, it is only natural that our exchanges have sometimes been a little difficult.
I hope that they have been of some use. I certainly hope they have not done any damage.
As I approach the end of my term as a Commissioner â I underline âas a Commissionerâ â I have started going to the theatre again.
I recently saw a new interpretation by that admirable Irish playwright, Frank McGuinness, of Hecuba by Euripides.
The classicists and theatregoers among you may recall that this is a bleak and bloody drama of death, hate and revenge.
Perhaps all too suitably for this production, the backdrop to the stage was a tall black wall inscribed with the names of the Israelis and Palestinians who have died in the last few years â hatred, revenge and blood.
It is certainly true, looking back, that despite the heroic efforts of my friend and colleague the High Representative and others we unfortunately have scant progress to report.
Just the other day, as the High Representative pointed out, we saw the dreadful massacre of Israeli tourists in Egypt.
Time and again one hope after another has been dashed.
We had Camp David, Taba and the understandings reached there, and excellent reports from Mitchell, Tennet and Zinni, all of which were to no avail.
Indeed, since Taba the sombre balance is that a total of 4Â 360 people have died: 1Â 026 Israelis and 3Â 334 Palestinians.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth â after which, as Gandhi said, everybody ends up blind.
Innocent children for innocent children.
The latest initiative is Prime Minister Sharonâs proposals for unilateral disengagement in Gaza.
Any steps towards withdrawal from occupied territory â albeit limited â are to be welcomed.
However, there are, as the High Representative pointed out, many questions that need to be clarified, not least in the broader context of the roadmap.
Although we have our reservations, this initiative does foresee the beginning of the removal of settlements â an important aspect and one in line with what we have been saying for a very long time.
Therefore, we are prepared to give it a try, although we have to be clear, as the High Representative said, that the parties will factor in the five elements which the European Council has identified as being essential for the plan to work.
We must insist that those points are respected.
The scepticism that has undoubtedly surrounded this initiative has increased, as the High Representative very diplomatically said, as a result of the extraordinary remarks made recently by the Israeli Prime Ministerâs Chief of Staff and senior adviser, which have been deeply damaging.
I hope that despite such remarks the two-state solution continues to be recognised as the only hope for an end to the conflict.
To be realistic, we should not expect too much â except, alas, perhaps more death and destruction â until after the US presidential elections.
Even then it would be unwise to expect miracles.
However, at the very least the international community should engage boldly with the Israeli Government to establish its commitment to the two-state solution, and with the Palestinians to establish their commitment to security and reform.
That is the only way to end the conflict.
The roadmap shows how to do it, so the challenge for the European Union is to steer the parties and others in the international community towards the roadmap.
Otherwise people may come to believe that Mr Weisglass was right and that his only mistake was to let the cat out of the bag.
During the course of my mandate, I have tried with the support of the majority of Parliament to build a reformed Palestinian Authority capable of governing Palestine in due course and of negotiating and reaching a settlement with Israel.
During that period the Israeli Government has been seeking to marginalise President Arafat himself.
However, at the end of the day President Arafat is still there while, unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority itself has been battered to pieces.
I accept that President Arafat might be part of the problem, but he is not the only problem.
What I have always been clear about is that a reformed Palestinian Authority is part of the solution.
It is not clear whether, under the current internal and external circumstances, the Palestinian Authority is in much of a position to deliver on a two-state solution.
The deadly combination of too little action on the Palestinian side and what has perhaps been too much action on the Israeli side, has quite successfully destroyed most of the authority that the Palestinian Authority might otherwise have had.
We need to find a way to give the Palestinian Authority more political room for manoeuvre and to do this in return for cast-iron guarantees on security and reform.
The High Representative noted the general work that we have done to support economic development as well as institutional development and humanitarian relief in Palestine.
This Union has done far more than anyone else.
This Parliament has voted for and supported far more assistance than anybody else has provided.
I expect that this Parliament will now start asking itself some searching questions about the continuation of assistance on the present scale.
Let me make one obvious point.
We are the biggest supporters of the World Bank's Palestinian Development Fund.
To say we are the biggest supporters is in fact an understatement.
Hardly anyone else is contributing any money to it at all.
We want to see that money used to lay the foundations for an economy in the Palestinian territories that can provide jobs, revenues and at least a modicum of economic growth so that people can live a better life with greater dignity, have a better chance of a job, and so on.
We are all entitled to question whether that money will be nugatory expenditure, and whether any expenditure will be worthwhile unless we can obtain certain guarantees from Israel on its withdrawal from Gaza, on the way that is going to be handled, and on Gaza's medium- and long-term prospects.
I am sure Parliament would not want to feel that we were simply footing the bill for the consequences of whatever the Israeli Defence Forces did.
We have to make it clear that our role â the role we want to play in helping to support reconstruction â must be dependent on a real political dialogue with the Israeli authorities.
Otherwise the money will simply be wasted, in the same way that too much of what we have done already has been wasted.
I repeat that, working on the basis of the report by the Council on Foreign Relations, working on the basis of the work initiated by MrÂ Rocard and his colleagues on that Council, we have done more than anyone else to put in place reformed institutions in Palestine.
I salute the work of people like MrÂ Salam Fayyad, who has bravely tried to ensure that Palestine has a decent and transparent government.
It must be said, however, that without political progress, without an improvement in the security situation and without a more effective dialogue with Israel, it is going to be incredibly difficult to continue to justify that sort of help and that sort of expenditure.
There is no more important problem facing the international community than this one, not only because of the bloodshed that it continues to produce, unresolved, but also because of the damage it does to the relationship between the West and the Islamic world.
Nobody should be in any doubt at all about the impact of the struggle between Israel and Palestine and about the impact that it has on attitudes in the Islamic world.
We must work even harder to try to shape the parameters of a solution to this bloody conflict.
If we do not succeed in that then to return to what is â I think â the last line of Euripedesâ Hecuba: âfate compels and none can resistâ.
Bloodshed after bloodshed after bloodshed, revenge after revenge after revenge, unless people in Washington, in Europe and, above all, in Israel and Palestine, have the political courage to try to deliver what their people deserve and what the whole world requires.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, you have said that this was your last speech in this House, and I think that many of us feel â as I myself do despite our many differences of opinion â that you were one of the most important and outstanding personalities in this Commission, who gave foreign policy a quite special edge, for which I would like to thank you most warmly on behalf of our group.
The occasion for todayâs debate is, as is invariable in the case of matters of topical and urgent importance, an escalation of violence.
Rarely do we have good news to announce about the Middle East; on the contrary, the situation is often a very grave one.
Hamas rockets landing on Israeli towns, excessive military actions and then the attack in Taba, in Taba of all places, a place associated with so many peace agreements, peace negotiations and concepts of peace.
In Israelâs neighbour, Egypt, a new dimension of terror waged against innocent civilians, Europeans, Egyptians and Israelis, brings home to us the whole tragedy of the situation, and so I agree with what Mr Solana has had to say here today, that the road map is still the only way ahead.
Mr Sharon, the Prime Minister, spoke about this on Monday in the Knesset, and I believe that we Europeans should also insist on that; it is this position that unites the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
And the road map means a two-state solution, ultimately a Palestinian state and an Israeli state.
What must now happen in the coming weeks?
I am very grateful to Mr Solana for having, today, reminded us in very clear terms of Arafatâs responsibility; for reminding us that the Prime Minister must now be able to function independently; that the security forces, too, must be taken out of Mr Arafatâs control and made subject to an independent police authority, with all the powers needed to combat terrorism.
You then had something to say about money and economic cooperation.
In recent years, we have gained the impression that the more the situation escalated, the more money Europe gave, in order to try and bring about social stability.
It would be a good thing, though, for the police forces to be reformed and for Europe to then provide more funds for reconstruction, so that it becomes clear to the people on the ground that where peace is, there is also aid from Europe, but that it is not unconditional and not at any cost.
For that reason, our group endorses the courses of action you have outlined, and we wish you much success in carrying them out.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Europe ask, when foreign policy is being debated, why they should be interested in it.
What, they ask, do we as Europeans actually have to do with the topic?
The sense of not being involved is something I frequently experience when I meet visitors who have come to listen to debates in this House.
âWhat business is that of ours, actually?â
Let me pick up on something that Commissioner Patten said, that, if peace in the Middle East is unattainable or hard to achieve, it is, in the long term, our own security that is also increasingly destabilised as a result of the increasing radicalisation of people which is associated with the failure to achieve peace.
There is a causal connection between this regional conflict and worldwide radicalisation.
For that reason, we Europeans are directly affected, and that is why we are part of the road map, to which â as everyone has said â there can be no alternative.
It is good that the Prime Minister of Israel, in his statement on Monday, gave his backing to it.
Commissioner Patten, you referred to Hecuba.
Rather than delve so deeply into the world of drama, I just want to quote a sentence that I cannot get out of my head about terrorism and torture.
It is this: âAt the end of any series of cruel acts, their source no longer matters; we just want them to stop.â
That is how many of the people affected feel, and it is understandable, but it is not enough.
That statement is inadequate, for those who commit the acts of cruelty need to be shown where the limits are.
Those who understand only the language of violence â and they are present on both sides â need to be isolated.
It is true to say that the reform of the security forces is tied together with this phenomenon.
Reforming the security forces and the police means playing a part in ensuring that the scope available to the men of violence for their activities is limited.
The radicals can, above all, be kept in check by working hand in hand with the moderates.
That Egypt and other moderate Arab states have offered to cooperate with Israel in bringing about a ceasefire is a good sign, but it is an offer that the Israeli side must accept.
There must then be a dialogue between equals, rather than exclusive negotiations in which mutual dialogue is abandoned when demands are made and not met.
We, then, as Europeans, need the courage to encourage and openly back those in the region who are prepared to commence dialogue with one another, without preconditions if at all possible.
That is the substantial contribution that we Europeans can and must make.
It also involves committing ourselves to the two-state model.
Let me add at this point that the two-state model cannot be a matter of withdrawal from the West Bank and nothing more.
The viability of the second state must also be guaranteed, and Mr Laschet is right to say that that requires that funds be mobilised for reconstruction, and we must commit ourselves to that, for it is in the interests of our own security to do so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in the Middle East appears to be one of complete deadlock.
Arafat is there in his headquarters â old, isolated, in poor health and unable to lead his people.
Sharon fails again and again in his plan to withdraw from Gaza.
He appears to have lost touch with both his party and the electorate.
The question is that of whether he is the man who can lead Israel to peace.
I do not believe he is.
The future of the Gaza plan is now extremely uncertain, and violence in the area appears to be increasing.
It is worse than it has been for a very long time.
I do not believe that these gentlemen can bring about lasting peace in the Middle East.
They cannot put an end to the killing.
They cannot put an end to the violence and the acts of terrorism, and they cannot bring about what all of us in this House want to see: two states living peacefully side by side and with respect for one another.
This conflict has gone on for so many decades and has involved so much suffering, for the Palestinian people, of course, but also for the Israeli people, who live in constant fear of acts of terrorism and of suicide bombs.
We have made so many plans, had so many conferences and meetings and held so many debates in this House, but nothing happens.
We must consider having a practical international presence in the region that can supervise the withdrawal from Gaza and perhaps also remain there in the longer term.
Following the American presidential election, and no matter who wins, the EU and the United States must sit down and formulate a common strategy, based perhaps upon the road map, in which they talk the same language and give out the same signals to these two leaders.
The whole world stands to gain from peace in the Middle East, and it is also an important part of the fight against international terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, it is the case that, as pointed out by the School of Culture and Peace of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the situation in Israel and Palestine has far from improved over recent months, in fact quite the opposite.
The judgment of the International Court of Justice on the separation wall built by Israel, the refusal of that country to comply with it, the feeling in diplomatic circles that the Quartetâs road map is on the brink of failure and the protests from Palestinian groups at the corruption in Gaza are just some examples of these steps backwards.
Furthermore, it is clear that we cannot separate the delicate situation in Palestine and Israel from the international context and the dreadful consequences of the absurd way the United States and some of its European allies are dealing with terrorism at international level, an approach which I believe is providing more fuel for the fanaticism of Al Qaeda every day.
For all these reasons, the European Union must adopt a much more determined attitude with regard to what is happening in the Middle East.
I have two proposals: to pursue and support the proposal to provide all the resources necessary to create a normal and transparent election process in Palestine so that Sharon can no longer use the argument that there is no legitimate and valid interlocutor on the Palestinian side, but also, in view of the insulting disregard Sharon has shown not only for human rights but also for international law, rather than continuing to export arms to Israel â as no small number of European countries have been doing over recent years, of which I would mention Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, amongst others â I believe the time has come for the European Union to take much more determined measures in order to put pressure on the current Israeli Government, and I would not rule out the possibility of cancelling the association agreement.
Charlie Chaplin put it very clearly in the film Monsieur Verdoux: if you kill five people you are a murderer, if you kill 5 000 you are a hero.
Please let us not treat Mr Sharon as a hero.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to express my sorrow and concern about recent operations by the Israeli army.
The results, once again, have been tragic, with dozens of Palestinians, mainly civilians and children, killed or injured.
I am truly saddened by the fact that, despite the global outcry, the Israeli Government persists in this undeclared war and bloodshed.
What we see unfolding before the eyes of the whole world are crimes against humanity.
The European Parliament too should call on the Israeli Government to stop at once the attacks on and the murder of civilians in the Gaza Strip, to stop building the wall, the sole objective of which is to isolate the Palestinians, to stop tearing down homes and to comply with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention.
At the same time, we should also denounce in the strongest possible terms the rocket attacks and bombings in Egypt last week, which resulted in the death of numerous Israeli and Egyptian civilians, because the last thing that did was to help the peace process.
We should also call on both sides to apply the road map.
Finally, I should like, on behalf of my group, to express our undivided support for the Palestinian people, who continue to resist and fight for their independence, and for the forces for peace in Israel acting to put an end to the bloodshed.
Â Â  Mr President, terror and trauma go hand in hand in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians; they are the dual results of one single craving for destruction shared by the terrorist organisations Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian politician, Mustafa Barghouti, wrote that â and I quote â âthe silent majority of the Palestinian people do not identify with the terrorists or with the Palestinian authorityâ.
Looking towards the crucial local elections in December, Barghouti urges Europe, once and for all, to give firm support to the democratic forces and processes in the Palestinian regions instead of to Arafatâs gigantic apparatus of oppression.
I would like to hear what the Councilâs High Representative has to say in response to this insistent appeal.
The Palestinian appeal is at the same time a test of the European Unionâs willingness to fight terrorism effectively.
Do the Council and Commission think that the conclusion of an association agreement with Syria compatible with this?
Secondly, it is well enough known that the Assad regime facilitates terrorist operations against the State of Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.
Yesterday, there was an article in the German press â in âDie Weltâ to be precise â about the way in which terror has made the Israeli people a traumatised nation.
A trauma expert confirms that Israel is still a country made up of survivors.
It is not only for reasons of history that this should be of concern to us in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the Israeli defence forces are currently continuing with the largest incursion into Gaza since the beginning of the Intifada and death tolls are continuing to rise.
Some estimates have suggested that at least half of the hundreds of the Palestinians killed have been civilians.
The actions of the Israeli army are simply disproportionate and this is a view that is shared by Kofi Annan, the EU foreign ministers and many more.
I cautiously welcome Prime Minister Sharon's announced intention of complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, but there are a number of conditions that must be met in the context of future Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
This withdrawal must take place in the context of the Quartet's roadmap agreement.
It must be a step in a twoâstate solution.
It must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank.
There must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority.
Israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.
The bottom line is simply this: the roadmap remains the mostly likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the IsraelâPalestine conflict.
The members of the international Quartet, namely the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, are all committed to this roadmap plan.
However, the current cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and this is taking the parties even further away from a negotiated settlement.
The most important step is for both sides to desist from further acts of violence.
Leadership is needed on both sides, and that is not easy.
I am an Irish Member of the European Parliament and we in Ireland know how difficult that can be.
We know only too well the cycle of violence, the titâforâtat, the eye for an eye.
But we also know only too well the enormous benefits that accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place.
That takes courage on both sides.
I believe we should be asking both sides in this conflict to have this courage and show their leadership.
It is not easy to be in a situation of leadership, it takes a lot of courage.
I often feel that in this conflict, courage is not being shown.
As I said, we who come from Ireland know the benefits that can accrue for the people of the Middle East if courage and leadership are shown by the people there.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate you on your presidency of the European Parliament.
You are certainly the right person in the right place.
The subject under discussion is the situation in the Middle East, as it was a few months ago, and as it was a year ago and even 15 years ago, as CommissionerÂ Patten pointed out earlier.
Incidentally, MrÂ Patten has been awarded an honorary doctorate by a Polish university.
Maybe the time has finally come to stop using polite diplomatic language and start using the language of hard facts.
It is simply not the case that both parties to the conflict in the Middle East are equally guilty and that the truth lies somewhere in between.
We are currently facing a new situation.
Since early this year, Israeli towns have been struck by nearly 150 rockets manufactured locally by Hamas.
Rockets of this kind have been causing material damage and spreading panic for several years, but now they are also killing people and even children.
This proves that the conflict has escalated.
It also proves that responsibility for the escalation must now be borne by the Palestinian side.
How are we to react to this?
Are we to remain passive, or can we and do we maybe even want to play at being an arbitrator and move the Israeli Government and Arafat around like figures on a chessboard?
Neither of these approaches would be right.
We are constantly discussing great plans and road maps.
It might be more appropriate first to have a long hard look at where EU money is going.
It is important to establish whether sometimes, contrary to our intentions, this money actually goes directly to those who bring death to the Middle East.
This matter was already discussed by the previous European Parliament.
In conclusion, let us be generous, but let us examine what our money is being spent on.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in his speech MrÂ Solana acknowledged Europeâs helplessness in the face of the Israel-Palestine conflict, yet it is not only Europe that is helpless.
The same applies to the United Nations and the United States.
MrÂ Solana, however, posed the question as to what is to be done in such a situation.
He went on to give us the correct answer.
The road map must be adhered to, as the road map also acts as a signpost for the European Union.
That is all well and good, but there can be no doubt that our position should be more open and flexible, and that more should be done to adapt our policies to the changing political situation.
Our policy in the Middle East should also be more nuanced.
If a serious project is put forward, such as Israelâs unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, it should be heartily welcomed, and not merely ârecognised as a significant stepâ, to quote the Councilâs communication.
Thought must also be given to the steps and measures that should be taken in order to support this project.
If there is a desire to continue supporting Palestinian Authority, as you stated in your four-point programme, consideration must be given to a point mentioned a moment ago.
I refer to the fact that having seen some of our money wasted, it is important to ensure that the money we are spending to support the stabilisation of Palestinian Authority is not wasted again.
In other words appropriate control mechanisms are needed to manage this aid effectively.
In my opinion, MrÂ Solana, a regional approach was lacking in your speech.
After all a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict will involve the entire region, the region known as the wider or greater Middle East.
We have discussed this approach during previous debates on strengthening the peace and stabilisation process in Iraq, and this is also the right policy to pursue with regard to Iran and Libya.
We are experiencing success both in the fight against terrorism and in measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as in the case of Libya.
Unfortunately we are also experiencing setbacks, such as in the recent case of Iran.
This policy must be rationalised.
The Presidency has produced good work so far.
It is to be hoped that it will respond to this request from the House, and that the Commission and the Secretariat will also.
Â Â  Madam President, some people have stated that the war in Iraq will have favoured a rapid solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
A cynical forecast, instrumental in justifying a wrong and illegal war.
A forecast belied by the terrible picture before our eyes: despair in the Palestinian camp, growing terrorism and fundamentalism, crisis in the Palestinian Authority and fear in Israeli society, which gives Prime Minister Sharon the opportunity to unleash indiscriminate repression and to proceed undaunted with the construction of the wall.
The withdrawal from Gaza that has been announced has by no means been said to be paving the way for the restitution of the occupied territories of the West Bank.
On the contrary, it could be the prelude, via the settlement activity which is being stepped up, to the definitive acquisition by Israel of the majority of those territories, confining the Palestinians within enclaves which have nothing to do with the sovereign state to which they are entitled.
The road map has not provided the tools with which to prevent the negotiation process from once more being overwhelmed by violence.
The international community, and above all the Middle East Quartet, ought to draw some conclusions from all this and reflect on this fact.
As for the possibility of a solution to the conflict, the Geneva negotiators, in contrast to Camp David, have demonstrated that it is possible to find dignified solutions to which both sides can agree on all the points of conflict, even on the most sensitive and thorny issues, such as the status of Jerusalem and the right to return up until the final status.
The Middle East question ought, moreover, to have absolute priority in the relations between the European Union and the United States â in the hope that there will be a change in the administration there.
Today we can also rely on the positive role played by some Arab countries â Egypt and Jordan â and on the improvement of our relations with Syria and the normalisation of relations with Libya.
Tomorrow, this state of affairs could be very different.
If yesterday Europeâs security was linked to developments to the east, today it depends on the southern and south-eastern dimension.
It is also for these reasons that the Middle East conflict is not something which has nothing to do with us, but is the central issue in the future of European security.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Solana said that we could not continue to give money.
Something had to happen.
What the EU will, in actual fact, do is of course a matter for speculation.
The fact is, the EU has not done much other than make payments and adopt statements.
I would very much recommend that, firstly, attention be given to the proposal from MrÂ RomevaÂ iÂ Rueda about cancelling the cooperation agreement so that there are at least some minimum consequences of continually breaching the agreements.
Secondly, I wish to support what was said just now about giving the Geneva Agreement a much clearer status on this road map.
It might then be seen where the road is heading and an appeal finally made for more cogent discussion of the subject.
It seems, in fact, that a terrorist is being defined as someone who kills himself.
Anyone who has military helicopters and missiles is not however a terrorist, but a soldier, and it is immaterial whether very many more civilians are killed by these means than by suicide bombs.
It cannot help that we continue to engage in double-speak in this connection.
We must talk to Israel in the same way that we talk to other grown-up states and demand that a democratic nation be alert to these matters.
The way things are now heading, we are not going to have two viable states.
We shall have no viable states because Israel will die in the process, and it is therefore vital for both Israel and Palestine that we begin also to speak to the Israelis as if they could tolerate being talked to as grown-up people.
Â Â  Madam President, 3Â 500 Palestinians dead, and over 1Â 000 Israelis: my dear Mr Solana, you speak of an âappealâ and talk of hoping that the Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza.
Frankly, I have been listening for six years now in this Parliament to wise words, which ascribe responsibility to one side or the other for the situation, but today Palestinians continue to die, killed by an occupying army.
Occupying.
In fact, the truth is simple: there is no asymmetry, there is symmetry.
What we see before us is an occupied country and international law being totally rejected.
You should believe Sharon when he tells Winston Churchillâs descendant that he will squeeze the Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank like a pastrami sandwich.
Dove Weisglass is not lying when he clearly asserts that withdrawing from Gaza simply means mothballing the peace process.
These are not lies; this is the truth, and this is the political line that Sharon is taking.
Certainly, there can be no justification for the criminal acts that the Palestinian terrorists may carry out against Israeli citizens.
But can we really only make appeals?
Does Europe really not have the authority to say to Israel âIt is time to end the Israeli military occupationâ?
This is not simplistic or ingenuous: this is the truth.
I am tired of our hypocrisies, tired of this way of going on, where every day houses are being destroyed and children are being killed.
Ayman, 13 years old, who was going to school with his schoolbag on and was shot dead, is the symbol of the barbarity to which an army of military occupation can stoop, just as, obviously, it is barbarous that Hamas should send Palestinian children to throw bombs at Israeli citizens.
I believe, though, that we have the authority and the power not just to make appeals, but to say that the Israeli military occupation must stop.
Let us rather give a voice to the Palestinians and Israelis who together are fighting for peace: there are many of them!
It is these voices to which we should listen.
Â Â  Madam President, unlike the previous speaker I refuse to condemn so forcefully the government of Israel or the Israeli defence force in its operation on 29 September in Gaza to prevent Hamas â an organisation banned by both the US and the EU â from launching Qassam rockets which recently killed two Israeli children and wounded ten civilians in Sderot.
No government anywhere can tolerate civilian fatalities killed by a deadly and implacable enemy without reserving the right to retaliate with all the means at its disposal, and the Palestinian Authority has clearly not reined in its terrorists.
For years Hamas rockets were fortunately more like fire-crackers than bombs, but since the start of 2004, 149 high-explosive rockets have been launched from Gaza.
The BBC, not renowned as a friend of Israel, has reported that 15 out of 16 of the Palestinian men killed by the IDF were known terrorist militants.
All of us have a common enemy in fighting international Islamist terrorism.
Last week in Taba innocent Israeli holidaymakers were killed by a bomb attack which has all the hallmarks of al-Qaâida.
It must also be emphasised that Israel took great care during the operation in Gaza to provide medical and humanitarian support for all the casualties, as well as innocent Palestinian civilians.
Prime Minister Sharon, in spite of fierce Likud opposition, is pressing ahead with withdrawal of settlements from Gaza as a way of kick-starting the roadmap for peace in the Middle East again and bringing about a two-state solution.
But I call on the Palestinian Authority to crack down on Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, otherwise Israel will be very reluctant to withdraw from the West Bank, which poses a much bigger challenge and is ultimately a much bigger prize.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, MrÂ Solana, concerning the situation in the Middle East, what conclusions might we, as Members of the European Parliament, draw one year after the Geneva agreements, which we greeted with hope since the road map was getting bogged down, one year after plenary debates on the application of the association agreement between Israel and the European Union, and a few months after the condemnation of the wall, both by the United Nations Commission on Human Rightsin Geneva and by the International Court of Justice in The Hague?
As has been said, the overall outcome amounts to a blood bath; and, as MrÂ Patten said, he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.
Since the second intifada, there have been 4Â 350 deaths, including the deaths of 3Â 500 Palestinians; 33Â 600 houses have been destroyed; and, since the âDay of Penitenceâ operation orchestrated by the Sharon government, 120 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed.
Three Israelis are, indeed, three too many, MrÂ Tannock, but so too are the 120 Palestinians, and I should not have dared to mention, as you did, that two Israeli children were killed when it is known that, two days ago, a little Palestinian girl carrying a schoolbag was murdered by Israeli soldiers and finished off by an officer, who shot her in the head.
I should not have dared to bring up such matters, but I do so today.
So what are we, the European Parliament, able to do?
We would question you as to the role that the European Union can play at Quartet level.
What, however, can we, as MEPs, do other than return continually in this House to the association agreements and again condemn what is indefensible in international law?
What can we do?
Our powerlessness is combined with anger.
There are many of us who travel to Palestine.
I spent half of my holidays there with Palestinian teachers dealing with the Palestinian children traumatised by the war.
Here in this Parliament, we are neither an NGO nor people who sign blank cheques, for we monitor the issuing of our cheques. We cannot, however, resign ourselves to this powerlessness and to the idea that Europe would forget international law.
Â Â  Madam President, I agree with Mr Solana that the step-by-step policy is no longer valid.
What alternative does he have in mind in order to aim higher?
For the reality is very tough.
Firstly, the Palestinian Authority has hardly any control and is not effective in the occupied territories.
Furthermore, as a result of the of the United States, the road map is practically dead and it will be very difficult to bring it back to life.
The policy in relation to the settlements, the wall, the horrendous violence of the Israelis and Palestinians, have left the Quartetâs objectives in tatters.
We have practically reached rock bottom.
There is absolutely no sign that Israel is complying with the Councilâs conditions for supporting the withdrawal from Gaza.
What is more, Sharon has already said that he rules out further Israeli concessions and in reality he is showing no intention of seeking peace beyond the withdrawal from Gaza.
We should be aware that time is running out and the room for manoeuvre required for a fair and viable solution for the Palestinian people and the security of Israel is disappearing.
If the European Union cannot get Middle East peace back on track quickly, this issue will continue to poison peace and security in the Middle East and throughout the Mediterranean.
Â Â  Madam President, there is widespread frustration and bafflement in Europe at the failure of the Middle East peace process to make any headway, even though we all think we know what the result of that process should be: two states and the territorial disputes sorted out amicably.
To that end we demand of Israel that no more settlements be established, that the existing ones should not be extended, and that the West Bank wall should not be taken as a political fact when shaping the borders of the future.
When I see, though, that this hideous edifice has saved human lives by substantially reducing the number of suicide bombings, I cannot really criticise Israel for building it, but I can criticise it for the fact that the wall does not follow the recognised border.
No doubt, alas, the wall must remain in place until such time as the Palestinian Autonomous Authority itself becomes willing to use its own police and security forces to arrest those who carry out these attacks.
It is Mr Arafat who is standing in the way of this sort of effective reorganisation.
Gaza is another point at issue.
I find it inexplicable that more Kassam rockets should be fired at Israel even after it had announced, without conditions, its military and civil withdrawal.
It is evident that certain Palestinian elements are almost afraid of the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal, for, in that event, Palestinians in Gaza would at last have to get themselves organised and get stuck into rebuilding the city and its surroundings.
So far, Israel has served as a reason why, with the struggle against the occupation, no real progress was made with these necessary measures.
Its withdrawal should also open up a way back to implementing the road map, which is what the quartet demanded on 22 September.
When I see though, the way in which, in this little piece of land in Gaza, Palestinian police and security forces in their thousands are evidently incapable of preventing these Kassam rockets from being launched, I really do start to suspect that Israel is being provoked into staying put in Gaza.
We must not allow this attempt to succeed, for there are, in Israel too, people who do not want withdrawal from Gaza, and these elements should not be lent support.
It is in the interests of all of us that we should start as soon as possible on putting the road map into practice.
All parties have signed up to it and must do what they have undertaken to do.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that, in relation to the Middle East conflict, there have been too many statements and little action and that it is now time to act.
Until that happens, I would like to stress that some representatives of the Union have made statements that I do not believe to be appropriate.
For example, the statement of the Middle East envoy, Mr Marc Otte, who told the that â and I quote â âthe Israeli separation wall has a role to playâ.
Perhaps its role is to prevent the establishment of a viable Palestinian state?
Equally unacceptable to me is Point 2 of the conclusions of the Foreign Relations Council of 11 October, which I believe once again displays blatant double standards.
Why does the Council condemn all forms of terrorism, âincluding rocket attacks on Israelâ?
Why, when it states that it condemns all forms of terrorism, does it not add: âincluding that which has killed more than 40 Palestinian children and injured more than 120 so far in Gaza in just 12 daysâ?
Why does the Council state that Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, without adding that the Palestinians have exactly the same right?
If the Council restricts itself to condemning the disproportionate nature of Israeli military action in Gaza, why does it not use that hackneyed euphemism when referring to the Palestinians?
Double standards?
Ineffectiveness?
Yes, in my view, yes.
And I believe we have heard quite enough speeches.
The Palestinians are still waiting.
How long must they wait?
They have been waiting since the Union's Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I would like to start by apologising for the fact that another commitment will require me to leave shortly after I have finished speaking.
There is a specific question I wanted to put to you, Mr Solana, or rather, a comment I wanted to make following on from what Commissioner Patten said.
I am in full agreement with what you plan to do in your four points.
I regard them as well balanced and right.
The only thing is, are both sides willing that we should actually be able to put these plans into effect?
I agree with Mr Gahler that security must be established, but how many security facilities has Israel destroyed over recent years?
Was there really willingness that the Palestinians, insofar as they so wished â and not all did â should really be responsible for security?
Turning to reform of the Authority, how can the Authority be reformed when the sealing of the borders is making Arafat a hero to the Palestinians?
He had been less highly regarded by the Palestinians, and that is where Israel helped him out.
As for economic support, I will vote in favour of it in this House only when I am certain, or can at least take it for granted, that what is invested in infrastructure will not again be destroyed by Israel.
This is a precondition, for the taxpayer â to whom both of you have rightly referred â cannot be expected to rebuild infrastructure only to see it destroyed.
The same is true of elections, which are necessary, and I am absolutely in favour of them.
I also discussed them with the finance minister, for whom you too have high regard, whose hope it is that new young blood will join the Palestinian Authority, but who also told me that the elections must be feasible in terms of the whole infrastructure, and, here again, it is for Israel to make them possible.
So I fully support your programme, which I regard as good, well balanced, and right, but it needs both sides if it is to be capable of being implemented, failing which it will be as vacuous as others have been.
It follows that Israel really must play a full part in it and be willing to put these things into practice.
If it does, then I am in favour of our being as critical as we can be of the Palestinian Authority and as tough as possible in our dealings with it.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall begin by responding briefly to the last comments of my good friend, Mr Swoboda.
The four points I have referred to undoubtedly require the participation of the two parties, not only of the Palestinian Authority â which must participate â but also of Israel.
That is why we are working in that direction.
But we honestly believe â to respond to the request made by Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle a little while ago â that words are not sufficient, that we need to present initiatives, to try to act.
That is what we are going to try to do.
What I have presented this afternoon is a small programme â not small in terms of its breadth but in terms of its profundity â moving in the direction of our fundamental objective: bringing the road map to its conclusion and in good time, not in the next hundred years.
Rest assured that we will take all the measures we can.
I would also like to stress that the withdrawal from Gaza, if carried out within the context of the road map process, is something we support and which would be a good thing.
It would be good if there were the law approved by the Knesset allowing withdrawal of the settlements and funding to allow the people living there to leave.
Previously they were funded so that they could create settlements.
If it is the case that we can achieve the approval of a law to do the opposite within two weeks, it will be a success for Gaza and for the future of the West Bank.
We will see whether this is achieved within a few days.
Will there be sufficient votes to do so?
I believe there will, because in this case the Labour Party is going to support Prime Minister Sharon so that this law can be implemented.
I would insist, however, that the four points I have mentioned require the contribution, support and understanding of the Palestinians and of the Israeli Government.
I would also like to stress, however, that I have talked about something else; we cannot carry on simply with a gradual process.
I believe we must take a more courageous step forward and begin to define the final parameters on which the two parties must agree.
To this end it is naturally essential that there be an interlocutor accepted by both parties.
That is why the support we are going to give the Palestinians is so important, so that they are genuinely able, in their current circumstances, to find the formula for establishing a solid and representative Palestinian Authority which is able to act as a viable interlocutor with Israel.
That is what we would call rationality.
The irrational approach would take a different view.
I regret to say that irrationality may be winning out over rationality.
Unfortunately, we have seen this on numerous occasions.
We politicians must continue to support rational actions.
If the people responsible for leading other countries do not unfortunately feel the same, we must seek the best way to operate in those circumstances.
I would like to say just three more things.
The first is that I have not tried to avoid talking about the regional issue.
It seemed to me that the time set aside for the debate was not sufficient to talk about all the issues of the region.
There is no question that the issue of Iraq, of Iran and all the issues the honourable Member has raised are priorities on our agenda.
It did not seem to me to be the day to go into them and I have not therefore done so.
Secondly, I wished to say to my good friend most respectfully that I have not made any appeal for good will.
We do not belong to charitable organisations.
We are politicians who want the problems to be resolved.
At the end of my speech I made an appeal of a moral nature, but the rest was full of concrete, specific measures, which, if put into practice, must lead to positive results.
I would finally like to defend my personal representative and the representative of the whole of the European Union, Mr Marc Otte, and I would ask Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle to read his comments in their entirety.
Madam President, if you will allow me to change subject, I believe this is the last time I will be in this House, in the European Parliament, with a good friend, Commissioner Chris Patten.
We have spent five years together.
Many people sitting here today thought that we were both going to be disasters, he and I, and doubly so by working together.
Quite the opposite has proven to be the case, and we have shown that two plus two do not necessarily make four, but can in fact make six.
For this, I believe we must thank Chris Patten for his cooperation and particularly for his intelligence.
His good sense and his intelligence have taught us all a lesson in good practice â at least for me, Chris â and I hope that from Oxford your advice will continue to reach us across the airwaves, via the Internet, through your words, books, by whatever means, but that they continue to reach us.
Thank you, Chris, for your cooperation over the last five years.
We will not forget you.
Â Â  At this point, I will close the debate on this topic.
Â Â  The current situation in the Middle East is appalling, and of particular concern is the grave situation in Palestine, where the Sharon government is committing the most terrible crimes against the Palestinian people.
Israelâs provocative arrogance and its governmentâs State terrorism, which has enjoyed the Bush administrationâs unwavering support and which, in common with the occupying forces in Iraq, is killing the elderly, women and children on a daily basis, cannot continue to go unpunished.
The European Union cannot continue to maintain a weak position.
It is time that the European Council took firm measures, turned Parliamentâs opinion into action, suspended the Association Agreement with Israel and demanded compliance with UN decisions.
The provocative arrogance of Sharon and his government, which enjoys the Bush administrationâs support, is appalling.
The Bush administration vetoed a draft resolution condemning Israelâs terrorist activities, whilst the people are fighting for their right to freedom and dignity.
The Palestinian people, just like the Iraqi people, have the right to a State, the right to determine their own destiny and the right to live in peace.
Â Â  â We express our repugnance and condemnation of the constant crime being committed against the Palestinian people by the Israeli Government.
The tragic count at the end of the 'Days of Repentance' was 111 Palestinians dead in 15 days, including children and students.
We condemn those fuelling Israeli aggression.
We condemn the USA for backing and arming the Israeli Government.
We condemn the ÎU, which is against the genocide of the Palestinians in word, but tolerates it in deed by putting both sides on an equal footing.
Condemnation in word only is hypocrisy.
The ÎU continues to provide economic support for Israel through association agreements and to arm it.
Not one delegate from a Member State of the ÎU went to the Hague Tribunal to testify on the Israeli wall.
The 'holy family' at the ÎÎÎ€Î summit in Istanbul unanimously upheld US imperialist plans for a new 'Greater Middle East', which make provision for NATO's relations with Israel to be upgraded.
We are therefore calling for economic and political measures to be taken immediately, including the immediate suspension of the association and cooperation agreement with Israel, in order to force the Israeli Government to stop the slaughter of the Palestinian people, to withdraw the Israeli occupying forces from Palestinian soil, to demolish the wall of shame and to create an independent Palestinian state with its capital in eastern Jerusalem.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Council on the situation in Georgia.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I am going to talk about Georgia, a very important subject, and I am sure that the majority of the people here are very concerned about the situation there.
From the outset of political change in Georgia, the European Union has been fully engaged with the new government and the new political leaders who have been in Georgia since the so-called ârose revolutionâ.
I would like to tell you what we have done so far.
Firstly, we have appointed a special representative, Mr Heikki Talvitie, who represents us in the region, and particularly in Georgia.
The role he has played has been greatly appreciated by everybody, by President Saakashvili, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the government as a whole, and by the countries of the region.
He has been able to act as a link between Georgia and Russia, which, as you can imagine, is a very important element in the situation today.
Secondly, and very importantly, we have included Georgia and two other countries in the region, Azerbaijan and Armenia, in the neighbourhood policy.
This has been the most important way in which we were able to help these countries move closer to the European Union.
We did it rapidly, and you can imagine the happiness this decision has created for the people and leaders of Georgia.
I would also like to say that the European Union has already organised a donors conference for Georgia.
It was a success, right after the change in government.
In July we launched the first ESDP operation for the rule of law in Georgia.
It is working very well.
It is an innovation, one of the many operations and actions the European Union can carry out among the whole panoply of capabilities we have for helping countries in transition.
The situation in Georgia is not good from an economic point of view.
GDP has decreased by almost 60%, which is of very serious concern.
60% of the population are probably below the poverty line and there are still around 300Â 000 displaced persons as a result of the wars in Georgia.
I cannot finish talking about Georgia without talking about the conflicts and the problems facing the country.
Georgia has solved one problem through the autonomy of Ajaria, but there are still two big problems which will not be solved so easily: the problem of South Ossetia and the problem of Abkhazia.
The OECD has a role to play there.
Mr Talvitie, representing us, will continue to work on that.
But the solution of those problems will not be as simple and easy as the one I mentioned before, which was resolved quite smoothly through the autonomy process.
This is going to be more difficult.
It is going to require a good understanding of Russia.
We are ready to play that role if necessary, but we have the impression that these two issues are going to take more time and will be more difficult.
But in any case they have to be resolved.
Without the resolution of the problem there, Georgia's integrity will never be a reality.
I would also like to say a word on regional cooperation.
Georgia cannot be isolated from its two other neighbours in the southern Caucasus: Azerbaijan and Armenia.
We have a relationship with the three countries.
We would like to construct a relationship with the three countries which is vivid, which is important and which is close to the European Union and the European Union dream.
I therefore want to say that President Saakashvili has the support of the European Union.
It was clear from the very beginning that he had enormous problems in front of him.
We are going to help him with the reforms he has to make internally and in Georgia's relations with neighbouring countries, in particular its relations with Russia, which will be highly important.
As you know, there are still Russian troops in Georgia.
President Saakashvili has said he will not accept forces from any other country in his territory and therefore he will give guarantees to the Russians that they can leave without the risk of any forces from any other country appearing in Georgia.
Georgia has a difficult time ahead and needs the help of its friends.
Here we are.
We are friends of Georgia.
Â Â  Madam President, let me briefly address three questions.
How far has Georgia come since the 'rose revolution' eleven months ago?
How have we tried to assist Georgia in this process?
What are the challenges ahead in EUâGeorgia relations?
First of all, Georgia's achievements.
Most importantly of course, all observers judged Georgia's presidential and parliamentary elections in January and March of this year to be the freest and fairest in Georgia's post-Soviet history.
Georgia now has a president and government with a very strong popular mandate to carry out the profound political and economic reforms which we all know are so necessary.
A good start has been made in addressing the structural problems facing Georgia, tackling for example endemic corruption, which has harmed every facet of life in Georgia.
Georgia's state finances have been put on a more stable path to recovery.
Revenue collection has increased, allowing the Georgian Government to pay salaries on time.
Reform of the law enforcement agencies has begun and a new tax code has been presented to the parliament.
It is only a start, but Georgia has done well in the last eleven months.
How have we helped since November last year?
Firstly, we have offered consistent political support to the new leadership and we have encouraged it along the path of reform.
We have been in close touch with it and with the special representative, who has done such an excellent job.
Only recently President Prodi visited Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan.
It was the first visit to the South Caucasus by a Commission President and it visibly demonstrated earlier this month the Commission's support to Georgia.
We have also helped to mobilise significant international financial support for the reform agenda of the Georgian Government.
Colleagues will be aware of the very successful conference that we co-hosted with the World Bank in June.
It went very well.
In June we doubled to EUR 137 million our commitment to Georgia over the years 2004 to 2006.
So we have made a substantially increased contribution to supporting reform in Georgia.
The third way in which we have assisted Georgia is the inclusion of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the European neighbourhood policy.
That has been widely supported throughout the House.
What are the challenges that lie ahead?
Firstly, Georgia has got to keep up the pace of reform.
Turning reform commitments into realities on the ground is, of course, the hardest job, particularly for a country such as Georgia whose state institutions have been so hollowed out, so weakened over recent years.
Secondly, we have to work to exploit the possibilities opened up by the inclusion of the South Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy that I referred to.
As far as Georgia is concerned, the onus will be on that country to demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving political and economic reform, which is the only way of guaranteeing Georgiaâs long-term stability.
That will be at the heart of the action plan which we hope in due course to negotiate with the Georgian authorities.
The other challenge is the conflicts on Georgiaâs territory.
We welcome â and this point was made by the High Representative â President Saakashviliâs statement at the UN General Assembly confirming Georgiaâs commitment to solve the conflicts through solely peaceful means.
Our position in the EU is clear: we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia; we call on all parties to work for solutions to the conflicts through negotiation, confidence-building and exclusively peaceful means.
Our rehabilitation programmes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia can help to build confidence between the communities.
It is essential â if we are to solve conflicts and secure Georgiaâs long-term stability â to see a serious improvement in the relations between Georgia and Russia.
We hope that the presidents and governments of those countries can work to find solutions to the bilateral differences in full respect of each countryâs sovereignty.
From our perspective, the South Caucasus is an extremely important part of the common neighbourhood of the European Union and Russia.
We will continue to place this region high on our bilateral dialogue with Russia.
Our view, as you know, is that strong, stable and prosperous neighbours make the best neighbours.
That is what we mean by working for a better common neighbourhood.
I hope that is also the view of the government of the Russian Federation.
That is the most sensible way of looking at methods of securing a peaceful Europe and European neighbourhood for the years that lie ahead.
Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my friend, the High Representative, for what he said which â to borrow a remark â my father would have greatly enjoyed and my mother would have believed.
It has been a great pleasure working with Javier Solana over the last five years.
It is true to say that even the most scholarly pedagogues and PhD students would have some difficulty in finding any issue on which it was possible to slip a piece of tissue paper between what the High Representative has said in the last five years and what I have said.
It has been a pleasure to work with him.
There is a lot of cynicism about politics, but I just want to underline that he has been a friend through these five years, he will remain a friend for the future, and I wish him the very best of luck as the Constitutional Treaty comes into place and he takes up the responsibilities of Foreign Minister.
I wish my successors as European Commissioners responsible for the portfolio which I have enjoyed the best of good fortune as well.
Finally, I wish to apologise to honourable Members for the fact that I cannot stay for the whole of this debate.
I have a medical appointment which involves manipulation of my neck â though not in as permanent a way as some Members of the House might have wanted from time to time!
Â Â  Well, Mr Patten, I can only hope for your sake that the doctor uses the right hold, and I propose that we now embark on the debate.
Â Â  â Madam President, representative of the European Union, we watch Georgia with hope as it demonstrates a resolved self-determination to establish a democratic legal state.
Its people, who are our European neighbours, need this.
For many years they suffered a Soviet dictatorship, after which they have had to endure internal conflict, foreign interference and corruption.
We must support Georgia as a country which has affirmed its Euroatlantic aspirations and has already begun to take concrete steps to move closer to the principles and standards of the European Union.
It may be that Georgia will have to choose one of the hard alternatives, if the two most important challenges appear too difficult to be solved simultaneously.
Due to the well-known forced division of Georgia into one main and two separate parts, the alternatives for this country are as follows: to either establish a European democracy in that part of Georgia which is loyal to and governed by Tbilisi, i.e. legislative power with a free economy and rights for minorities, or to endeavour to end the division as soon as possible, and to restore the legislative power and administrative control of the Georgian state throughout the country's entire territory.
Of these tests, I would advise that that first challenge should be given priority â the building of a democratic state in the area which today is ruled by Georgia.
However, Georgia's looking to the West, to its European neighbours and the European Union, also presents a test for the European Union.
That is the principle of European openness.
When we consider the Continent of Europe itself, which is home to the land of Antique legends and the Golden Fleece, Georgia is one of the oldest Christian states.
May those countries which accept our ideals, move closer to us in all respects.
And the goodwill of the European Union will encourage their progress.
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, ever since it declared independence in 1991, Georgia has had major problems with regard to guaranteeing sovereignty across its entire territory.
Very quickly, separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have managed, by dint of armed conflict, to wrest important parts of the country from central government control.
Despite almost unceasing attempts by both the UN in Abkhazia and the OSCE in South Ossetia to reach a peaceful political settlement of these conflicts, not a great deal of progress has been made to date.
The continued existence of these hotbeds of conflict constitutes a permanent threat to stability in Georgia.
The outbreaks of fighting in South Ossetia in August of this year are only a poignant illustration of this, as are the unlawful, so-called presidential elections in Abkhazia, which jeopardise the development of democracy in Georgia.
Further to todayâs topic, I should like to make a few more general remarks about the role of the European Union.
We support the line as set out by Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, and other Members of this House will undoubtedly make more detailed remarks.
After eight new Member States from Central Europe joined the European Union, the problems of the neighbouring countries, particularly the states that were once part of the Soviet Union, have drawn a lot closer to us.
With Romaniaâs imminent accession, the lingering conflict over Moldavia about the separation of Transnistria will form a continuing threat to safety and stability at one of the EUâs new external borders.
I can assure you that the situation in Transnistria is very similar to that in Georgia.
These developments give us no choice but to follow what is going on in the countries around us much more closely.
The European Union is required to shoulder much greater responsibility to a far greater extent than before in order to reinforce democracy and stability in those countries.
It follows that a sudden outbreak of conflicts and a permanent suppression of human rights on our doorstep constitutes a threat to stability and democracy in the Member States of the EU itself.
The conclusion of partnership and cooperation agreements and the development by the Commission of the strategy for the new neighbours and the action plans ensuing from this were a first step in the direction of shouldering this greater responsibility.
On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would urge the Commission and Council to promptly translate these initiatives into concrete measures, both in the field of reinforcing democracy and in the field of a thorough reform of economic and social policy in the relevant countries.
The European Unionâs responsibility will need to go further than that, though.
It will also need to include greater involvement in looking for a peaceful solution to the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and not only there, but also in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh.
The European Union cannot manage to do this on its own.
It will need to seek an alliance with Russia, but the Russian Government will also need to stop playing a dual role in many of those conflict areas; it is unacceptable that Russia should act as an intermediary while at the same time siding with, and supporting, one of the parties involved in the conflicts, whether this be in Transnistria or in Georgia.
For the European Union, this is not about wanting to elbow Russia out of that part of Europe and extending its own geostrategic interest in Eastern Europe.
The European Union â where possible in tandem with Russia â has an interest in establishing peace, stability, economic and social progress on or near its borders.
Thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, when I visited Tbilisi with Parliamentâs delegation to Georgia and the South Caucasus, I was struck not only by the sheer decency and friendliness of the people of Georgia, but also by how much there is to change in that country in such a difficult situation. The sheer lawlessness and the need for stronger law and order; the need for the Russian troops to fulfil their promise and withdraw; the need above all for tolerance between neighbouring peoples in the South Caucasus, to adopt the EU model â the way of learning to live in peace and tolerance and respecting each other, which they have to do.
We all agree that it is clearly strongly in our interests to help the Georgian peoples because they are our neighbours and we share a future.
I wish to pay a strong tribute to my friend, Mr Patten, who I see has left to see the doctor already.
He has been a great success as a Commissioner.
We owe him a great vote of thanks and I am sorry we are losing him.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Solana, the popular enthusiasm that led Georgia to conduct its velvet revolution has caused people to have huge expectations. They aspire to better living conditions and political stability and to seeing corruption fought and a state established that is governed by the rule of law.
This new impetus must not weaken, and we all have a responsibility for supporting this peaceful movement.
The escalation in violence, together with the killings and woundings condemned last summer in South Ossetia show the extent to which Georgia, like the whole of this Southern Caucasus region, remains fragile and in danger of tipping over into armed conflict.
This fear is, unfortunately, exacerbated by recent statements by the Russian authorities, who might carry out pre-emptive strikes in the Southern Caucasus under the banner of their security doctrine.
We condemned such strikes in Iraq, and we condemn them in this case.
Russia remains, however, in a key position to resolve these regional conflicts, and not only in Georgia. It cannot, however, continue to engage in double-dealing by, on the one hand, supporting the international community in its efforts to help the Georgian authorities establish a state governed by the rule of law and, on the other hand, supporting the Abkhazian and Ossetian separatists by, for example, granting them Russian passports or opening the railway line linking Soukhumi and Russia.
My first question is simple: what are the undertakings that the European Union intends to request of Russia in order to bring about a lasting resolution in this region of the conflicts that have died down but that have not been resolved?
The EUâs commitment in this region has certainly been stepped up, as you said, in the form of the EUâs Special Representative and the Rule of Law Mission to Georgia â a first, as you emphasised.
The urgency of the situation is such, however, that the EU needs to go further.
It must prepare a genuine road map for its representative, who might serve as a facilitator or negotiator in successfully bringing about a peaceful resolution of the conflicts.
His help might, for example, be valuable at the next meeting between Georgian prime minister MrÂ Jvania and the separatist leader of South Ossetia, MrÂ Kokoity.
Georgia is one piece of a giant Caucasian puzzle, and these countries, let us not forget, are European countries. They will be the last candidates for joining a successfully completed EU.
In this context, the other issue is that of integration. Is the EU to remain deaf to the public request made by MrÂ Saakashvili, President of Georgia, for integration with the European Union?
That is a serious and legitimate question.
We shall not be satisfied with a commitment to the New Neighbourhood policy whereby we, the European Parliament, have forced the hand of the Council with regard to integrating the Southern Caucasus into that new neighbourhood.
Let us not leave these countries alone in facing the issue of European borders.
MrÂ Solana, can we open the doors to the Balkans and close them to the Caucasus?
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Solana, I am genuinely delighted at the statements made by MrÂ Solana and MrÂ Patten on Georgia.
The head of the Georgian state was elected on 4 January 2004, when PresidentÂ Saakashvili received a democratic mandate unprecedented in our part of the world.
He has important tasks ahead of him, which involve reform of the state and not merely the restoration of Georgiaâs territorial integrity.
PresidentÂ Saakashviliâs mandate is also a time of great hope for the entire Georgian people.
As a representative of Poland, I am well aware of the immense difficulty involved in sustaining such hope, yet hope is necessary to carry out reforms as important as those which await Georgia.
I was particularly interested in MrÂ Pattenâs comments on placing the issue of support for Georgia and PresidentÂ Saakashviliâs ambitions on the agenda for bilateral talks with Russia.
I believe we should adopt a very determined approach during these talks, as Russiaâs position is key to solving Georgiaâs problems in the near future.
It is also crucial to resolving a situation which, as can be seen from our motion for a resolution, we all agree is at stalemate, despite all the efforts of the international community.
We would like the pressure exerted by Russia to be reduced somewhat, and for cooperation with separatists both ...
Â Â  Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party represented in this Chamber by myself and Mr De Michelis.
The Caucasus is a region which, for geopolitical and economic reasons, runs the risk of being exploited.
A region where different cultures and ethnic groups, Christians and Muslims, breathe the same air, with all the difficulties which that engenders.
Beslan, the ârose revolutionâ in November 2003 and the troubles in Georgia this past summer are only the tip of the iceberg.
We understand Russian concerns to defend national security and their own borders, and to combat terrorism.
This, however, will not happen through arms and reprisals, and much less by neglecting peaceful and transparent dialogue with all the parties involved.
It is therefore important for the European Union to take prompt action to promote the reform of the legal, prison and taxation systems in order to combat corruption and enable the territory to be controlled effectively; to increase the resources available to the EUâs special representative in the Caucasus; to help to redefine the relationship between the centre and the regions, through the transfer of public assets from the centre to those areas that are most economically depressed and at the same time ethnically diverse, so as to prevent new centrifugal forces; to strengthen the role of civil society, particularly in the secessionist regions; and, finally, to use every possible means to prevent renewed military activity, in coordination with the OECD.
Â Â  âMadam President, MrÂ Solana, we want complete demilitarisation of the region; we want Russia to withdraw from the area.
I wonder what sort of peace the Americans are building by training Georgian soldiers there, and who is currently benefiting from this oil pipeline project.
In the European Union, we teach the rule of law, not how to fire a gun, and this difference should always be made clear to our friends.
The elections that were held were a good example of progress.
Special envoy Heikki Talvitie has done a good job there, but the Caucasus region shows all the symptoms of deepening and continuing conflicts: ethnic, economic, religious, military and political.
In fact, the situation has got out of hand, as far as everyone is concerned, including the Russians in Russia, especially those close to the border.
This is a huge problem for us. It continues to advance and is difficult to halt.
It is good that Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan are covered by our good neighbour policy, but that is not enough.
I think that in this case the key to the situation lies in the relationship between Georgia and Russia.
I would like to ask you something, MrÂ Solana.
You will soon be meeting President Putin.
Will you mention relations between Georgia and Russia when you meet him?
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Solana for his report.
The continuing conflict in Georgia concerns us all, because it creates the conditions for the destabilisation of the Caucasus as a whole, with repercussions on the strategic security interests of the European Union and its Member States, the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East as a whole.
Bearing in mind the energy-related risks in the area, the European Union should immediately take specific initiatives to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Within this framework, convening an international conference under the aegis of the UN might help in finding a peaceful and diplomatic solution.
At the same time, the European Union should work out specific initiatives within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy and make its strategic presence in the area more visible.
Strategic planning is required, together with strong economic aid in the form of assistance from the European Investment Bank and preferential trade relations with Georgia and the other countries in the Caucasus.
Developments in Georgia also concern Greece, because thousands of citizens of Greek descent live in Georgia in a state of insecurity.
Greece has taken important initiatives at bilateral level over recent years to fund infrastructure projects in the sectors of health, education and cultural and educational exchanges, in order to build a democratic civil society.
I should like to close by highlighting the crucial role played by Russia in the area.
The European Union needs to dynamically integrate relations with the Caucasus into political dialogue with Russia.
At the same time, we need to express our constant opposition to the stand of the Putin administration on preventive military intervention, just as we have consistently done on the US doctrine of the Bush administration.
This stand jeopardises peace because it feeds conflict, it feeds the vicious circle of terrorism and organised crime.
Â Â  Madam President, I shall be brief because I believe that we are all in agreement about what is to be done and said about Georgia and about the countries neighbouring our enlarged Europe.
I should like to emphasise three points that, in my opinion, are significant and important.
Political reforms are needed, and we need to support these.
We also need to cooperate with these countries concerning economic reforms, particularly in Georgia.
Finally, we need to help them resolve regional problems.
I should like, however, to emphasise two other points in particular: first of all, relations with Russia, as several of you mentioned.
I can tell you that the issue of relations with the countries of the region is raised at all the meetings we have with our Russian friends, and at all levels; with President Putin, Minister Ivanov and everyone.
I can tell you that, at the meetings in New York, we talked in depth with our Russian friends and examined from all angles and in all ways the issue of the countries bordering upon Russia and the enlarged Europe.
I should also like to emphasise the role of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which no one has mentioned.
The OSCE is the organisation that is qualified to manage the issues between these regions and that also has responsibility for implementing the commitments of the Istanbul declaration concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia in particular.
My friend MrÂ Wiersma talked about this.
That being the case, I can tell you that we are all in agreement as to the need to cooperate with these countries and to provide them with all the political and economic aid they need.
These countries, with their European values, belong in Europe. For the time being, however, we must continue to operate within the framework of the neighbourhood policy and continue to make use of all the opportunities afforded to us by this mechanism.
Â Â  I thank the Council and all those who took part in this debate.
I should like to end by informing the House that the Bureau has received six motions for resolutions and that the vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice, which will also be put to the vote tomorrow in the report by Mr Bourlanges.
I give the floor to Mr Donner to speak for ten minutes on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President.
I would also like to thank you for the invitation to the presidency to exchange ideas with you about the multi-annual programme on Justice and Home Affairs.
Not only have contacts already been established, but there is also a satisfying level of interest in the subject; for example, Mr Bourlanges and Mr Gargani attended the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs ministers on 30 September and 1 October, which was entirely devoted to the multi-annual programme.
The presidency has, of course, read the report that Mr Bourlanges has, as rapporteur, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
As I have already told the Council, this preparation offers the opportunity of distancing ourselves somewhat from current concerns and of considering the medium term.
The Presidency believes that the core questions are: âWhat should we in the European Union be capable of in five yearsâ time?â or âWhat should the area of freedom, security and justice look like at that time in order to meet the then requirements of our citizens?â
The latter is crucial.
The Area does indeed exist for the citizens and not the other way round.
Thinking back to the discussions that have been held in the Council and to Mr Bourlangesâ report, it is evident that the Council and the European Parliament are, by and large, giving their attention to the same items.
Accordingly, I can report to you that the proposals for political guidelines currently being submitted for discussion by the presidency deal with a considerable number of items mentioned in the resolution.
It is indeed important that we can, in that way, give due consideration to this resolution when we reach the final stages.
I do not want to run ahead of this discussion.
To date, only an informal meeting has taken place.
I would, though, in this connection refer to such matters as the extension of the scope of the codecision procedure, civil rights, training police and judicial authorities, mutual recognition and, linked to this, common minimum standards, contingency plans, reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust and also the items concerning immigration, combating illegal immigration, asylum, repatriation and border control.
Those items are also addressed within the meaning mentioned in the resolution.
Needless to say, preventing and fighting terrorism is also an item on the agenda.
At the same time, although â as I also said in the Councilâs introduction â terrorism is at present an acute threat, cooperation in the framework of the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be based on that.
It will instead need to be founded on the positive interests and added value that it brings with it.
With regard to the resolution, I should like to mention one more point, namely the proposed extension of jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
The presidency has deliberately not adopted this item, the reason being that with the already increased workload as a result of enlargement, it would be irresponsible to burden the Court now immediately with the jurisdiction across the board of Justice and Home Affairs.
As you all know, preliminary rulings at present take more than two years.
By accepting the decisions in the field of asylum and possibly also in the field of criminal cases, preliminary rulings can be sought about the interpretation of Community directives in current policy matters.
It is unacceptable that in those procedures, two-year timeframes should apply to legal proceedings where these involve people being detained for that time.
The Constitutional Treaty allows for these eventualities by insisting, in Article III-369, on the prompt handling of cases involving detained persons or aliens in custody.
It follows that the presidency is of the view that additional measures will be needed to enable the Court to implement this provision.
This necessity has also been mentioned in the draft conclusions.
It is therefore not a question of whether or not extending the Courtâs jurisdiction is rejected but rather about making a different choice with regard to the priorities.
Incidentally, I have read with much interest what the resolution specifies about the decision-making by qualified majority in the fields in which this is already provided for in previous treaties.
There are proposals that go in a direction that is certainly backed by the Netherlands and the Dutch Presidency, and I hope that it will be possible for the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and possibly the European Council at a later stage, to make an important step in that direction.
The discussions about the draft conclusions will be held in the next few weeks.
The intention is for the Council, composed of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers, to reach a political agreement on 26 October on the whole package, upon which it will be possible for the European Council to finalise matters on 5 November.
Perhaps I might be permitted to end my introductory speech at this point.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this will probably be my last speech in this House as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its chairman, MrÂ Bourlanges, for its constant support in developing the Tampere Agenda over the past five years.
My participation today in this debate is extremely simple, because I could limit myself to saying that I welcome the resolution tabled by Mr Bourlanges, virtually in its entirety.
This would help me beat the brevity record to which you referred, Mr President, but being so brief would naturally set a terrible precedent for my fellow Commissioners.
I shall add just three brief points.
The first of these, to which you have just alluded, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that I feel that the next European Council should celebrate the decision that Article 67 of the current Treaty can be implemented in full, so that a range of issues can be put to the vote, by codecision and by majority, as the Treaties already allow at the moment.
This decision will raise Parliamentâs political profile, and will safeguard the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is crucial to introducing provisions in such sensitive areas as immigration policy, asylum policy and policies involving the citizensâ fundamental rights.
I welcome the initiatives taken by the Dutch Presidency in this regard and I hope that they will be successful at the European Council of 5Â November.
My second point concerns the question of priorities.
A five-year multi-annual plan runs the risk of gradually taking on the appearance of a Christmas tree; everybody wants to see in it a little of what is closest to his heart.
This programme needs a clear political profile, and that political profile must be the result of setting out a crucial number of priorities in such a way that people can understand them.
I feel that Mr Bourlanges has touched a raw nerve.
It strikes me that the main priority at the moment is to step up cooperation at operational level â cooperation between security forces, between police forces and between judiciaries â in the fight against terrorism.
We shall only be effective if we can build up an atmosphere of trust between the 25 Member States, which will help the security forces to cooperate more effectively in preventing terrorist attacks and in the fight against terrorism in general.
I feel that the second priority is the question of transposing legislation that has been passed into national legislation.
A significant body of legislation has been produced over the past five years.
The deadlines for transposing that legislation into the national legal order of each of the Member States must now be met and the mechanisms for ensuring the quality of that transposition must be safeguarded; in other words, national laws that give practical form to European laws must remain faithful to the spirit of the European laws and be subject to necessary and adequate quality control.
I believe that it is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for Parliament to send out a strong message to the Members of the European Council.
Indeed, the Commission, for its part, set out its priorities clearly in the communication that we sent out in June of this year.
In the dialogue with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were able to enter into greater detail on these matters.
What I should like to reiterate, therefore, in this final debate, is that what the Commission has found â based on the public consultation that we have carried out, and in the process of tabling our own proposals â is that the citizens have three fundamental concerns.
The first is that priority should be given, on the one hand, to civil and commercial justice, to cooperation in the field of criminal justice, and to the fight against terrorism, and, on the other, to joint criminal trials that ensure compliance with the values of the democratic rule of law and to pro-active action in protecting all victims of crime and, in particular, victims of terrorism.
The second concern is a strong desire to see the completion of the second stage of developing a European asylum system based on common procedure and on a common statute for recognising refugees and asylum seekers.
Thirdly and lastly, there is clear concern over security issues.
While the citizens have shown that they recognise Europeâs added value in the fight against terrorism, there is work still to do as regards demonstrating the importance of certain common instruments that have been created, such as Europol and Eurojust, and the need to ensure that, in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, the legislation that has been introduced guarantees that the general publicâs fundamental rights and personal information will be protected.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that probably one of the areas in which the past five years have been less productive is that of regulating legal immigration.
I appreciate that, with regard to this question, we are still a long way from creating the conditions needed to approve joint legislation.
Let us be under no illusions, however; over the next five years priority must be given to common regulation and a common legal immigration policy for the countries of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore like to leave you with the message that I am sure that, with the acknowledged efficiency of the Dutch Presidency and with Parliamentâs extremely substantial and welcome contribution, the multi-annual programme for the next five years will be taken forward successfully by my successor, whom I wish every success in building Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your brevity, Mr Vitorino, but please allow me to say that only time will tell whether this is to be your last speech in this House or whether it was simply the last one before the one you deliver on your return one day to this House.
I now give the floor to Mr Bourlanges, chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for five minutes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, something has gone wrong: I have forgotten my notes.
I have therefore spent the last five minutes trying to put them together again. My speech will therefore be that much livelier, even if it is rather lacking in coherence.
Allow me firstly to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his valuable comments.
I believe that relations between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and yourself have indeed been exemplary and very satisfying.
You said that this was your last speech as Commissioner in this House. I would say to you that tomorrow is another day.
I should also like to thank the Dutch Presidency, which ever since it came into office has demonstrated a very great capacity to listen to the European Parliament, and in particular MrÂ Donner who has shown himself to be very sensitive to the arguments we have put forward in favour of using ArticleÂ 67(2), for the purpose of extending qualified majority voting, codecision and, I hope, the guarantees associated with the Court of Justice to the whole of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
You said, MrÂ President-in-Office, that, where the Court of Justice was concerned, we should have to wait a little.
I understand your reasoning and the difficulty you are in, but allow me to point out to you what a strange argument this is.
Just because a hospital is overcrowded, are people told that they need only go elsewhere to die?
The Court of Justice does indeed have problems.
Fine, let us try to solve them but, in the meantime, this does not signify that people awaiting trial are not entitled to justice.
Let us acknowledge, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the report I am presenting to you is evidence of the considerable unity of the committee I chair, a unity that has not always been in evidence.
The central point of this report, and the one we are emphasising, is the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
We think that qualified majority voting is a guarantee of efficiency, and we think that codecision is a guarantee of democracy.
We would add that supervision by the Court of Justice is a guarantee of legal certainty.
MrÂ President, what is the Councilâs position in this case?
With the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, you have the legal option of implementing the extension.
The political will would also seem to be there, since all the governments have agreed upon a draft Constitution or Constitutional Treaty that provides for this extension.
If, then, both the option and the political will are available to you, allow me to say that you have a duty to implement the extension, unless â most untypically for you, MrÂ President-in-Office â you are to give way to heaven knows what schizophrenic tendencies that are apparently causing worry within the Council.
If, at institutional level, you have a great many things to do in support of the Constitutional Treaty, you therefore have something specific to do in this particular area, in order, as you have said, for this momentous change to take place in April.
There is also the issue of transparency in the Council.
There are a lot of things I could emphasise, for example the protection of fundamental rights.
This Parliament sets great store not only by the protection of fundamental rights, but also by their promotion.
All European legislation must be aimed specifically at extending these rights and at their not simply being perceived in the light of any distortions that they might undergo.
This is a change of direction that also makes us want to see the human rights agency quickly put in place.
Regarding asylum and integration â highly sensitive subjects at the present time that, much more than other topics on the agenda, have certainly been at the root of a number of worries on the part of the members of my committee â let me state very clearly, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that, if there are to be detention centres for asylum seekers, the central issue, on which everything depends, is that of being clear about what is the administrative and legal authority that has jurisdiction over these asylum seekers.
It is inconceivable, as far as our committee is concerned, that it can be any authority other than that of a Member State or of the European Union itself.
In this context, a wide variety of solutions must be considered, provided that there is no desire to impose upon people placed in these detention centres conditions of semi-imprisonment such as are seen in certain places.
In any case, we are convinced, where this point is concerned, that the problem will not be resolved without increased financial solidarity.
MrÂ Vitorino thus appealed to the âJustice and Home Affairsâ Council as follows: if solidarity is to be exercised, money is required.
I shall conclude with a few words on terrorism and fundamental rights.
I would highlight the following paradox, which surprises me.
Now, at a time when everyone would like police forces to be able to exchange information but when, however, prudence is the order of the day when it comes to the transmission of data, the following situation arises: police forces clearly have a lot of difficulties exchanging information, whereas data is spread to every corner of the world under unsatisfactory legal conditions.
We are expecting the November Council to restore some logic to the matter and to ensure that peopleâs fundamental rights will be guaranteed where data protection is concerned.
Â Â  I cannot thank you for making a concise speech, but can certainly thank you for the passion with which you spoke.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the short time I have in which to speak, I will limit myself to one important demand in the area of freedom, security and justice, that being for discrimination of every kind to be combated.
In his report, Mr Bourlanges is right to demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be made the pillar of future policy and, to quote him, that they â that is, the fundamental rights â should be âapplied everywhere and at all times with the same rigourâ.
In the case of many Members of this House, however, these lofty principles fail them when it comes to decisions at home.
Freedom of opinion? â yes, that is self-evident, but the opinion must accord with the views of the Member in question.
If not, then the dissidents can expect, at least, to be banned from any participation in the work of the European Union.
They are then left, at best â if I may use our President, Mr Borrellâs words â to look after beetroots.
Freedom of religion? â of course; it is one of our fundamental freedoms, but you should, if at all possible, be a Shintoist, a Confucian, a Moslem, a Buddhist or a Wahhabi.
If you are a Christian, or a Catholic, then Social Democrats, Liberals, Greens and Communists will declare that such antiquated thinking makes you incapable of implementing the values of the European Union.
Anti-discrimination?
You are allowed to be incapable, but not to be a Christian.
If that is not discrimination, what is?
It is a tragic irony that certain members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, while fondly imagining themselves to be a bulwark in defence of fundamental freedoms and rights, are at present treading these rights underfoot.
Mr Bourlangesâ fine report should encourage us, for we may demand much, but it is for each of us as individuals to act in accordance with the standards we ourselves set.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the 5 November Council, the Member States are going to decide upon new political directions in pursuit of the area of freedom, security and justice.
Given Europeansâ growing expectations in this area, it is essential for us to be ambitious in defining our new priorities.
We have arrived at a crucial moment for the area of freedom, security and justice.
What is certain is that many advances have been made since Tampere.
The ambitious objectives then set enabled the European arrest warrant to be adopted, albeit with difficulty. This is an essential tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
We have also managed to define minimum standards in the field of asylum, even though we might lament the fact that these are bottom-up standards.
Even so, the overall outcome is still unsatisfactory.
The results obtained fall well short of what we might have expected following the Tampere Summit.
There is a striking lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and the unanimity rule has, in many cases, reduced us to paralysis.
As a result, the Member States have failed to transpose European decisions in good time.
Implementation of a large part of European legislation has, at best, sustained unacceptable delays.
In the area of asylum, the unanimity rule has reduced us to settling for the lowest common denominator.
The European context should, on the contrary, permit upward harmonisation, particularly when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights, asylum procedures and the fight against forms of discrimination.
Finally, European immigration policy has been reduced by the Member States to its repressive apparatus.
Thus, the Council has adopted, against Parliamentâs advice, provisions for joint flights for the purpose of removing refugees.
As we have all said, insufficient efforts are being made to permit legal immigration.
Unfortunately, the last âJustice and Home Affairsâ Council does not augur well.
The EUâs part in supporting the creation of national asylum systems in Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya again conveys the impression that the Member Statesâ priority is to push the problems back outside their borders.
Nor must the debate on the handling of asylum requests and on transit camps outside the EU ever lead to asylum being dealt with externally.
The new priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice must, above all, enable all the European decisions adopted to date to be implemented.
The new objectives that have been set must, among other things, do more to promote fundamental rights and genuine harmonisation of asylum.
I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what has become of the directive relating to minimum standards concerning the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
Steps should also be taken in future to ensure that the Member States are forced, within the period allowed, to transpose European decisions into national law.
It is, finally, essential that the European Parliament be fully involved in the area of liberty, security and justice.
I would thus appeal to the Council to follow the lead of our rapporteur and chairman of our committee, who asks the Member States to take the decisions necessary for codecision to be applied in this area.
I shall make use of the few seconds remaining to me to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the work of very high quality that he has undertaken and pursued with the European Parliament.
It is customary to say that no one is indispensable, but when someone is right for the job, they are missed when they are no longer there.
Â Â  Mr President, before I begin my planned remarks, I wish to correct the PPE attempt to rewrite history: the PPE and its right-wing allies voted on Monday to stop Mr Buttiglione being a Commissioner at all.
In the next five years of constructing an area of freedom, security and justice, we need effective and coherent action, democratic legitimacy, legal certainty and respect for fundamental rights.
That would be a great improvement over the last five years.
In spite of the valiant efforts of Mr Vitorino â whom I salute and will greatly miss â even he cannot work miracles on the Council.
Let us look at effectiveness.
As the Commissionâs communication said, the justice and home affairs dimension is now firmly identified as one of the Unionâs priority policies.
However, when the Commission cites the volume of justice and home affairs business being done in the European institutions and the regular appearance of such items on the European Councilâs agenda as evidence of their vital importance, I fear the wrong benchmark has been chosen, for while justice and home affairs generates 30% of translation work in the Council, it only produces 5% of the decisions.
We also know that intelligence and police liaison is inadequate: the German and Spanish authorities had different bits of information that could have identified the 9/11 terrorists, even if it could not have prevented that atrocity.
The record of implementation of EU decisions that are taken is poor.
Italy, the country in which Mr Buttiglione is still a minister, has not implemented the European arrest warrant.
Meanwhile that country is breaching the UN Refugee Convention by deporting migrants to Libya and preventing their access to an asylum determination procedure.
Therefore, coach and horses are being driven through the rule of law by the government that purports to supply the next Commissioner for Freedom, Security and Justice.
The EU record on upholding fundamental rights, already fragile, is at risk and needs to improve radically.
The measures on asylum and immigration in the last five years are incomplete and unbalanced and have incorporated some of the worst aspects of national policies.
In particular, we have made almost no progress on avenues for legal immigration.
No wonder the smugglers and traffickers are laughing all the way to the bank.
We face increasing threats to privacy from various directions, including proposals for traffic data retention, transfer of air passenger data, profiling, merging of various databases, etc.
Meanwhile, data protection authorities are under-powered and under-resourced and there are no European rules specifically for the criminal justice area.
We must uphold our standards and values in future, not erode them further.
The EU should seek positively to raise standards of protection of citizensâ rights and a culture of respect for fundamental freedoms in order to create the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition.
The Human Rights Agency, which I hope will be set up soon, should monitor and evaluate against the standards in the Treaties.
Last, but certainly not least, we urgently need transparency and democratic scrutiny.
Why, as Mr Bourlanges said, is the Council dragging its feet and defying the Treaty of Nice, which requires a semi-automatic passage to codecision as well as qualified majority voting?
The myriad of arrangements on judicial and police cooperation between national officials â not eurocrats, let us note â need to come within the ambit of parliamentary scrutiny, as do the activities of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to draw your attention to the risks that our shameful, indeed culpable, silence is bringing to bear upon what is happening at this very moment on the island of Lampedusa, events that clearly have the blessing of the Council, the Commission and all the authorised bodies, despite the fact that the practices concerned â collective expulsions with no opportunity of appeal â are very obviously taking place contrary to, and in total and utter violation of, extremely important commitments.
That being the case, I cannot believe, listening to you, Commissioners and members of the Council, that we are heading towards reinforcing our common asylum policy and promoting fundamental rights, when we allow to take place, under our very eyes and without any reaction on our part, what is nothing but a wholly illegal act of force, seriously damaging our desire and our efforts â laborious as they of course are â to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy.
Which country, moreover, does the EU nation concerned choose as a place to which to send those who have been expelled?
It turns to a country that is notorious for attacking human freedoms, for acting outside any legal framework in arresting and persecuting people, for giving immigrants the worst possible welcome and for carrying out acts of torture. This country is, moreover, regularly targeted and cited in international reports.
There are therefore many ways in which it breaches several European and international undertakings.
I do not genuinely think that our desire to progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy could survive our silence â and, in my view, a culpable silence â regarding what is happening.
Any Member State could see such silence as an opportunity to put in place bilateral agreements that would totally undo our laborious efforts to devise a common policy.
I would therefore ask you, Presidents of the Commission and of the Council, to express your total disapproval of this type of agreement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this report invokes democracy and the rule of law.
The reportâs nicely polished exterior is, however, a legal âPotemkin facadeâ.
Firstly, the whole project of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice is, first and foremost, a device for bringing about a federal EU.
It is that outcome, and not a concern for justice, that gives the project impetus here in Parliament.
Federalism in conjunction with supranational power means, however, a weakening of the legal systems that have their democratic basis in the Member States.
Secondly, the report overlooks the threats to the rule of law presented by the construction in recent years of huge police and monitoring systems â Schengen, Europol etc â which cannot be monitored and of which it is impossible to take an overall view.
There lies the real threat to the state governed by law.
There is nothing in the report about this.
In short, the report fails to restore the balance between security imperatives and respect for human rights, in favour of the latter.
That is a quotation from one of, in all, eleven amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which, together, serve to remedy the reportâs striking deficiencies in one practical field, namely respect for immigrants and asylum seekers.
Â Â  Mr President, the words spoken a little while ago on the situation in Lampedusa would have received a cold reception last Saturday and Sunday at the international colloquium in which important representatives of African countries of ECOWAS participated, who met with us from the European Parliament to discuss these very subjects.
I have the impression that the new African leadership has far clearer ideas on the subjects in question than someone who talks about such problems from a rather theoretical viewpoint.
They can see with their own eyes the activities of criminal and Mafia organisations, which organise illegal immigration and carry it out, and which in fact devise ways of exploiting the methods and rules which lay down the right of asylum so that they can organise illegal immigration.
The African leaders alert us to such manoeuvres and activities and say that they are ready, provided that they are supported by the European countries from the social and economic point of view, to activate control procedures and policies, including police procedures, on African territory.
That is what the new African leaders are saying, and they are clearly more realistic and take a much more practical and serious view of the problem.
We therefore do not agree with many aspects of this report, particularly where, as supporters of the sovereignty of individual Member States, we hear requests, even on such a sensitive issue, for a qualified majority vote and even for it to be brought in early before the Constitution enters into force.
We believe, in contrast, that Lampedusa actually demonstrates the importance of the role still played by the countries of origin.
Finally, to conclude, I ask myself where the European Union was and where the Commission was when we needed to set up an emergency office to protect the victims of terrorism.
Where was Mr Prodiâs European Commission when European citizens were, as they are now, in the hands of terrorist criminals, at the mercy of their blackmail, their assassinsâ methods, their threats and their barbarous actions?
Where was the European Commission?
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, freedom is a criterion that should always be taken into consideration when making important decisions of any kind.
After all, it is thanks to a thirst for freedom that the European Union exists today, as freedom provided a basis for its creation.
It is thanks to the thirst for freedom of seven of the new Member States, which for half a century were subject in turn to German and Communist domination, were able to join these institutions and become fullyÂ fledged members of the European Union.
The two main threats to freedom today are terrorism, and immigration, in that order.
These threats, may also be perceived as a challenge.
We must rise to it, find a way forward, and deal with the issue of immigration once and for all.
Rising levels of crime represent the next obvious threat to freedom.
I would also like to draw particular attention to the threat to freedom posed by the intrusion of the state into areas of life to which it should not have access, namely areas of private life.
This is an extremely serious problem, because it really is a major threat to freedom.
New technologies also pose a great threat, as they make it possible to monitor citizens to a much greater degree than has previously been possible.
The challenge facing the European institutions and all Europeans is to strike a balance between the desire for a peaceful and safe life and the wish to live in freedom.
I would like to ask whether some of the members of the Commission who voted against MrÂ Buttiglione were not by any chance guided by religious criteria, thus violating the extremely serious issue of religious freedom.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Commission judged in its recommendation about Turkey that that country does not sufficiently respect the political criteria of Copenhagen.
A very novel and original concept was thus concocted by way of a criterion for accession to our area of freedom, security and justice.
So it is that torture is allowed these days, provided that it is not carried out systematically.
It follows that in the Commissionâs opinion, there is no longer a fundamental human rights problem in Turkey.
According to the recommendation, Turkey respects priority being given to international law, the rights of the Kurdish minority are finally respected â albeit only verbally â and the Turks finally enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms.
What happens now, though?
On the very same day on which the Commission qualifies Turkey as a constitutional state, the Austrian newspaper reports that 14% of the asylum applications from Turkey are recognised, and as Reinhard MÃŒller stated only two days ago in the , refugees are people who have fled their countries of origin out of reasonable fear of persecution.
It follows that these asylum applications are either justified and human rights are still being violated in Turkey, or Erdogan is right in his cynical claim before the Council last week that organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are indeed linked to international terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his report, not only on its content, but on his ability to accept the many amendments we have presented to him.
I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges.
I am going to restrict myself to two comments on what this new stage in the development of the European policing area of freedom and justice may mean.
The first is that, in the field of security of the Tampere Summit, I would stress two initiatives which I believe have been very significant in terms of creating this area.
Firstly, the European arrest warrant, which was undoubtedly the consequence of the horrendous attacks of 11 September, and secondly, the action plan against terrorism, which was also the consequence of the horrendous attacks in Madrid, initiatives which we owe largely to Mr Vitorino.
Today, I believe, is a good day to acknowledge this.
An area of freedom and justice, however, cannot be built on the basis of responses or reactions to attacks and we do not want to see the third significant initiative relating to this area being taken following attacks.
We must be capable of replacing reaction with initiative and replacing isolated measures, although they may be part of a plan, with a genuine political plan.
The second consideration must provide us with a methodology on which to base this second phase in the development of the area.
Firstly, diagnosis: the Council must ask the governments what the main security problem facing those countries is and we need to identify the main problem affecting the security of the Europeans.
Like Mr Vitorino, I believe that today it is Islamist terrorism and that, in my view, is the main security problem facing the Europeans.
Secondly, following this diagnosis, we must understand that a political project is more than an action plan; it is not simply a series of measures, it requires effort by the governments, the Council and the Commission in order to deal with the problem.
Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion.
We have to decide how we are going to deal with a specific terrorist organisation in a specific way.
And, after the diagnosis and after the political project, we will then know exactly how to shape and define a European police and judicial area.
But that is the order in which we must do things, not the other way round, as is the case sometimes.
I will end by saying that a European area of freedom, security and justice must be twinned with the diagnosis of a problem and must be efficient in order to resolve problems.
And if we are not capable of being efficient and if we do not relate the area to the resolution of the problem, there will be no common police and judicial area.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on the eve of this most important, not to say crucial, Council concerning the construction of the European judicial area, I should like firstly to express a wish: that there finally be a genuine debate with the Council and that the Council finally listen to what the European Parliament is saying.
My main aim in addressing this House is to inform you of our basic demands in the light of our new political agenda.
Firstly, I think it essential that a genuinely proactive policy on legal immigration finally be adopted.
As, moreover, MrÂ Vitorino sincerely acknowledged a few minutes ago, it has, until now, been mainly the repressive side of asylum and immigration policy that has been given prominence and, as a result, many aspects of this legal immigration policy have been left on one side.
Matters absolutely cannot continue in this way.
Allow me to say a few words about the plan to construct, at the gates of Europe, so-called assistance centres for refugees, which are out-and-out camps.
Let me tell you how totally opposed I am to such a project.
It would in fact be an unprecedented retrograde step in Europeâs exercise of its responsibilities towards populations fleeing from conflicts and would show complete contempt for human rights, something that is absolutely unacceptable.
Nor, certainly, can we be reassured by the recent declarations made by the Commissioner-designate, MrÂ Buttiglione, nor, for that matter, by those I have heard made this evening by MrsÂ Klamt.
Beyond the strict rules for administering migratory flows, there are equally elementary rules concerning respect for individual rights.
On the subject of the priority given to the fight against terrorism, there is of course agreement concerning the basis and essential features of this fight, but there are two things we expect from the Council.
The first is that it implements genuinely effective measures that go beyond mere statements of intent in the manner of the appointment, following the Madrid bombings, of MrÂ deÂ Vries who was provided with no resources for taking action.
Secondly, we want the fight against terrorism to involve seeking a balance between peopleâs security and peopleâs freedom and for us not to imitate our American friends who, in their battle against the terrorist enemy, flout the most fundamental of essential rights.
I shall conclude by saying that the demands we are making seem to us to be absolutely indispensable and that we hope that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will finally give these demands a genuine hearing.
Â Â  Mr President, our fellow human beings are drowning before our very eyes in their quest for a better existence, and we sensitive Europeans, because we cannot bear the sight of drowning people, propose to dump the problem on the doorstep of North Africa.
That is not a solution, that is avoiding the issue, for what is really needed is the European immigration policy for which we have been waiting for so long, which will enable people to enter the European Union legally.
I also have a very concrete question, one that I have raised before and have also submitted to the Council in writing; it has to do with civil rights and freedom of movement.
What initiatives will the Dutch Presidency be taking for the recognition of married homosexual couples, so that homosexuals no longer run the risk of losing their social security, pension, property rights and the right to family reunification when they move to another EU State?
Â Â  Mr President, I speak particularly for the UK Independence Party.
The course of justice and security in Europe took a backward step when internal border controls were abolished.
This has encouraged large-scale movements of people across the continent, not to say much illegal immigration, all of which provides a perfect cover and condition for those you fear most: criminals such as the traffickers in human beings, and terrorists.
They are now free to flourish.
The UK Independence Party will re-establish Britainâs border controls and take back the right to say who shall enter our country.
For centuries we accepted people from all over the world, but in small numbers so that they could settle peacefully and productively.
Now our crowded islands are full and we seek to balance the number of those coming in against the number of those leaving.
We believe in the sovereignty of the democratic nation-state.
Countries are perfectly capable of establishing their own humane criteria for asylum seekers and of managing their own security systems.
The capacities and needs of one country are not the same as any other.
We do not believe in EU style harmonisation!
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to turn the focus of this debate on organised crime and to draw some lessons from our experience in Northern Ireland.
Following the ceasefires in Northern Ireland, we have seen a marked diversion of terrorist muscle and effort, both Loyalist and Republican, to organised crime.
The Provisional IRA is now a key player in this field.
Organised crime has become the main source of income and wealth for Sinn FÃ©in/IRA.
IRA Army Council member 'Slab' Murphy is a leading crime boss in Ireland presiding over a border empire built on fuel smuggling.
The IRA stands exposed by the Dublin Justice Minister as deeply implicated in organised crime centred on Dublin port.
Serial hijacking of huge consignments of cigarettes is acknowledged to be the work of the IRA.
The inescapable truth is that Sinn FÃ©in, which masquerades as a democratic party and has two shameless Members in this House, is largely funded by organised criminal activity.
Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland.
Loyalist terrorists have also made organised crime their forte, particularly in the despicable drugs trade.
They too stand exposed as the grubby gangsters that they are.
My call in this House is that across Europe, under the aegis of each nation-state, organised crime should be relentlessly pursued.
Â Â  I shall now give the floor to Mr Donner, President-in-Office of the Council, given that pursuant to the Council Rules of Procedure he has the right to the floor whenever he requests it.
Before I give him the floor, however, I should like to point out to the Dutch Presidency that, in the sittings in which the Council speaks and makes statements, the Presidencyâs agenda must be set in such a way that it can attend all debates.
This is because debates with Parliament are not mere formalities, but are a crucial element in the relationship between the Council and Parliament.
Mr Donner has the floor.
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President.
In response to your last remark, let me say that I did my level best to do this and ascertained beforehand how much time was needed, and was given that amount of time, as a result of which I was able to plan my other engagements accordingly.
I am truly sorry that the time factor prevented things from going as planned, but it is too late to make amends now.
So I need to go.
The Dutch Presidency will in any event still be represented.
Although this is not my last meeting with Mr Vitorino, I think it is appropriate to take this opportunity of thanking him warmly, also on behalf of the Council, for the cooperation between the Council and Commission in this whole issue.
Thanks to his commitment, the European Union managed to make much progress.
It was not least thanks to his personal charm that it was possible for the Council to reach compromises, and his insight has led to innovative solutions.
I am indeed of the opinion that he was a sound Commissioner for the Union.
The area of freedom, security and justice, which we are in the process of building, has been the subject of all kinds of comments from various quarters.
It was described as a step towards a federal Europe that would prejudice freedom and democracy, because the latter is established from the bottom up.
I myself come from a country where democracy was invented some time in the Middle Ages and took an awfully long time to prevail.
One condition for democracy is that our communities can live in safety, which is what we are trying to achieve here.
After all, cooperation among the countries of Europe implies that an alternative is found to guarantee that our citizens can exercise their rights in freedom and can live in safety.
This freedom and safety are under threat, not primarily by governments, but mainly by those who are our fellow citizens.
In a well-organised society, governments are the first guarantee for citizensâ freedoms and rights.
Needless to say, these governments will need to be monitored and their powers will need to be curtailed, but the absence of an authority is generally the best guarantee for chaos in which the citizensâ rights are the first to be sacrificed.
If, however, government action is based on fear, the rights are often also the first to suffer.
It is becoming evident, however, that it is increasingly difficult for individual countries to deliver on those guarantees, so we are obliged to pool resources, provided that diversity and tradition in this regard are respected.
As already stated, the most important freedoms that are liable to be pushed aside are the freedoms that are sacrificed in the face of crimes against the life of our fellow human beings.
The subject of terrorism has been mentioned in this connection.
I have already stated in this respect that this is an important item at present, but that we should not make the mistake of using fear of terrorism as a basis on which to cooperate in this area within Europe.
We must build on the added value of cooperation, on the actual interests and needs of society.
It goes without saying that, in the short term, no effort should be spared in combating terrorism.
Following the attacks in Madrid, the Council drafted a long list with the necessary measures.
At a given time, the Council showed determination, albeit in another capacity, and adopted a directive and various measures in the area of safeguarding personal privacy.
Those rules apply and are also enforced within the Union.
In addition, there is cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs on the one hand and wider cooperation within the Union, on the other.
Those two should not be kept separate in a schizophrenic fashion which would mean that in the area of justice and home affairs, everything should be duplicated in respect of what has already been achieved in the European Union.
I would now like to address a number of remarks that have been made here about the development and future of asylum and immigration policy.
That is undoubtedly a key item and your Commission representatives who were present know that the presidency intends to make good progress on this score too in the coming months.
Initially, this will inevitably involve striking a compromise and finding a basis that some will, at first sight, regard as a lowest common denominator.
Taking that as a basis will, in fact, enable us to make progress at a later date by going into the detail of the matter.
I have already indicated, and admit wholeheartedly, that the Dutch Presidency intends to put decision-making by qualified majority in place, precisely to make this possible.
This can only be done, though, if the initial basis has been laid by unanimity and that we can continue to build on that basis.
Various things have been said in this House, about such things as what has allegedly been decided during the informal Council on reception centres in North Africa.
Let me point out that our first responsibility and first priority are dictated by the fact that even now, people are still drowning in the Mediterranean on a daily basis in their attempts to reach Europe.
Europe has regulated legal migration, but has failed to regulate illegal migration, which is what is at issue here.
As has also been discussed during the informal Council, it is up to the Member States to find an answer to the question as to how we can solve this matter.
In this connection, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council, talks were held with the High Commissioner for refugees, MrÂ Lubbers, but Commissioner Vitorino also gave his view on the external dimension of asylum and migration policy.
The concern to find an effective and suitable solution to the issue in the Mediterranean was evident in these three speakers.
This was also recognised by the ministers present.
At the same time, it became clear that existing initiatives can be used as a basis for many things.
Statements have been made here about the Italian State, and the presidency has in any case asked Italy about its approach to the issue and what action is taken in the case of people submitting asylum applications.
The presidency has received the guarantee from the Italian Government that those people are admitted to the national asylum procedure and that the High Commissioner is involved in dealing with this.
It is the case, however, that if no asylum application is submitted, people can be returned to the country of origin, or at least of transit.
If people are picked up on the high seas, they can be taken back to the country of transit.
It is then our responsibility to ensure that reception is possible in those countries of transit, which can also be done under the remit of the High Commissioner for refugees.
This is not by definition an issue for the nation states.
There was also the question about the directive for minimum standards with regard to the asylum procedure.
The Dutch presidency aims to complete the decision-making process before the end of its term.
I would like to make a few separate observations, particularly with regard to Mr Bourlangesâ initial remarks further to my comment about the Court of Justice.
