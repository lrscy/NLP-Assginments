It is a caricature of the idea of closer cooperation between nations, some of whom want to see a more advanced social model and some a more independent and more offensive international policy prevail without waiting for an impossible unanimity of 25.
But for that to happen there would have to be a real European political project within the European Council.
But the truth is, there is no project, except perhaps for that very ambiguous one of European defence, made worse by the Unionâs new strategic doctrine that makes your blood run cold simply by reading it.
There is the rub.
The way this European Council has gone and the results it has produced ought to convince the doubters on one point: because of the major changes it will require to the present institutions and directions, a project that our fellow citizens can identify with and feel part of will not, will never come about spontaneously from a conclave of Heads of State and Government.
A convention will not be enough either.
The challenge must now be taken up by the citizens who aspire to it and the parties with which they identify.
In my view, it is this level of ambition, more than ever, that will have to shape the next stage in European policy.
Â Â  Mr President, by way of assessment of your work at the helm of the European Council, all we need to do now is say that the Union is not stronger or more united than it was six months ago, that your governmentâs contribution to increasing the cohesion lost during the battle over Iraq has been insignificant and that your statements on Chechnya, your failure to produce an initiative on the death penalty and the support and lack of criticism you showed for the Bush and Sharon governments have reduced the already poor credibility of the Union as a player on the world stage.
Or else we could point out the disinterested involvement of Mr Tremonti in Ecofinâs attempt to undo the agreements reached by the Convention on the budget, or, again, the outrageous behaviour of Mr Lunardi, who is pushing for European funding for trans-European networks which his company would then like to build.
Your Presidency, however, will be remembered, above all, by Europeans for the failure to achieve agreement on the Conventionâs text.
This will be the case even if you, with the help of your television networks, succeed in convincing the Italians that success was achieved because you have managed to win the seat of the Food Safety Agency for Parma and to produce an agreementÂ âÂ as yet still on the drawing boardÂ âÂ for the funding of a couple of tunnels and a useless bridge.
Of course, it really would not be fair of me to say that the reason for this failure lies entirely in lax preparation or in the original approach of bilateral meetings which provided for no plenary discussion and prevented everyone from forming a clear idea of what the mysterious compromise proposals were or of who was for or against what.
However, we do believe that the agreement that was taking shape wouldÂ âÂ we are sure of itÂ âÂ have created more problems than the current crisis.
I will tell you something else: I do not believe that we can genuinely say today that there is a consolidated agreement on the majority of the 82 points put forward by the Italian Presidency, points which, moreover, are largely unacceptable because they represent a step backwards, and not just with regard to the Convention but with regard to Nice too.
Whether you like it or not, the only text on the table is that adopted by the Convention.
Your weak Presidency and the Spanish and Polish Governments are not the only ones to blame for this crisis.
There are many others, starting with those who rejected double majority voting at Nice and are now setting themselves up as unlikely European political heroes.
Therefore, we accept the challenge posed by the crisis: it might lead to a better Constitution for the future.
However, we need to take note of the fact that the governments of both old and new Member States of the Union are unable to reach unanimous consensus on a viable Constitution for Europe.
It is useless: you will not be able to do it on your own!
The Irish Presidency will not succeed where Italy has failed.
In order to succeed in giving Europe a Constitution, you need us, your citizens, your parliaments, if you want to prevent the project for a united, enlarged Europe breaking down soon in disastrous disputes over the Financial Perspective or over national sovereignty.
The Constitution is not dead; the governments are not the masters of Europe, not least because when they attempt to be they lose their way in domestic wrangles.
We must resume the initiative without delay and prevent the work carried out by the Convention being filed away in some dusty drawer forever with the excuse that we need time to think or to fulfil our electoral obligations.
To this end, we need to find allies both in the national parliaments and among those governments which, like us, can see the urgent need to overcome the crisis quickly, restoring confidence in the European project and restoring its credibility and also asserting the need to abolish the right of veto for institutional reforms.
I regret, Mr Berlusconi, that it is not clear whether or not Italy is one of these.
I hope you will tell me that it is.
Beware, however: we are not yet resigned to the idea that, with the European Union only just reunited, it should already be divided or that the time has come to set its rate of progress on the basis of the interests of a small Ã©lite: we do not believe there should be two different groups or factions.
Our aim must continue to be the reinvigoration of the project for a democratic, effective Europe with which all can identify.
It may be true that an agreement was not far off in Brussels.
If that is so, we call upon the Irish Presidency to convene another Convention without delay to ascertain in the clear light of day whether it is still possible to reach agreement.
Otherwise, the plan must be to relaunch the constituent process after the European elections.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for its work in a difficult situation, both because of international developments and because of the tragedies that have struck several of the European peoples, Italy, in particular.
The memory of those who gave their lives for freedom and democracy in Iraq will be indelibly engraved in our minds as we pursue our political undertaking.
The Italian Presidency said that keeping the peaceÂ âÂ and, therefore, combating terrorism and disruptive forces across the boardÂ âÂ and pursuing stable prosperity for our people and for all the countries whose people live in difficult, tragic conditions because of hunger, poverty or lack of development, or, as is all too often the case, because of oppressive political systems, are the primary tasks performed by society.
The Presidency stressed that, if we are to achieve a stronger, freer, more independent and inclusive Europe, institutional changes are necessary and they cannot be brought about by watered-down compromises.
The European citizens need clarity and efficiency and the Council has a duty to define unambiguously the political, economic and cultural role that Europe must play on the world stage.
Terrorism cannot be overcome by conventional methods alone, without the involvement of the citizens.
The globalisation of the markets calls for new financial and economic rules to replace the obsolete rules of the past century.
There must be renewed cooperation with regard to the geographical areas closest to us, in particular, and fresh consideration must be given in this context to the countries whose languages and cultures are similar to ours.
Mr President, I would like express the regret of the and my own regret as a member of the Convention at the failure to reach agreement on a new Treaty.
The Union cannot have a two-tier system of first- and second-class States, or several individual or alliancesof dominating States, displaying two faces to the world.
A new Treaty is necessary and each State must lay aside the mental reservations which are a barrier to political Union.
The undertakings given to the citizens must be delivered on and we are sure that Italy will give its full support to the Irish Presidency so that what was not achieved yesterday can be as soon as possible.
The citizens of the 25 Member States of the Union want neither a federal superstate nor a Europe consisting merely of a free trade area.
Â Â  Split over Iraq, failure in Cancun, snubbed in Sweden, the stability pact wrecked, and now the constitutional fiasco, 2003 will indeed have been the for Europe!
There will therefore be no European constitution, but not to worry, Europe is so far removed from the hearts and minds of the Europeans that no citizen will miss it or, doubtless, even notice.
I do not really know to whom we owe this âmiracleâ, Mr Berlusconi; whether it is the Spanish, the Poles or, as many are saying here, the French, I think they have acted wisely since it is very obvious that the Europe of the 25 has not grown up and it was premature, to say the least, to give it that mark of political and democratic maturity that is a constitution.
Let us have mercy therefore on Turkey, Mr Berlusconi, and let us think again for a century or two, maybe even longer.
For my part, I think we owe the Brussels fiasco as much as to the corporatism of the European institutions, and first and foremost the Brussels Commission, as to some Member States defending their legitimate interests.
That is what happens, Mr Prodi, when Penelope goes against the teaching of the Odyssey and unravels instead of knitting.
But let us calm ourselves and be consoled: we might not have a European constitution but we have won over the !
Â Â  Like the Constitution then, it may become immortalised!
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, this Europe has acted in the same way as it did at the time of the Balkan crisis and the Milosevic atrocities; in the same way as the Europe which, even today, has no position on the Middle East other than the short-sighted positions of each of its parties and factions.
We failed, you failed to produce a Constitution, a Constitutional Treaty, because we are now experiencing a period of comeback from bureaucracy and false nationalistic hopes, which now carry the weight of new ideologies in this House.
This is not the United States of Europe, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, the Europe of Ernesto RossiÂ âÂ the Europe conceived in prisons by unyielding federalists, liberals and democrats.
This is not the Europe of Robert Schuman or Konrad Adenauer either.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespoâs words on the subject are spot on.
This is a Europe that disappointed Mr Pasqua somewhat, although he finds in Mr Chirac, today, the old, essentially anti-Europeanist, antifederalist position.
You have paid, Prime Minister, for your pretence at arbitration.
You treated the minor economicÂ âÂ but so very understandableÂ âÂ egotistical concerns of Spain and Poland equally, but then gave in to the constant, arrogant, nationalistic blackmail from France, which is used to being the only country to gain anything from Europe.
It was time for France to start paying too, now, as we have all paid.
Well, Prime Minister of Italy, you have certainly failed to remember, you have not put enough faith in those who, more in prison than on luxurious conferences, laid down for us the path set by Parliament in the period 1982-1984.
We need to go back to that time, to the Europe of our Parliament, whose primary task must be to break free from its shackles.
It is a symbol: we do not even have the power to decide where we should meet, when or how.
We are forced to meet in Strasbourg.
First and foremost, we must show an example to the Europeans.
As Members of Parliament, we must decide on the location of our Chamber, in which we will debate the matters which concern us.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, has the IGC been a failure?
Surely it is just a reflection of current opinion at government level about the structure and implementation of a new EU Constitution.
The lack of unanimity reflects divisions that are real within Member States, divisions which are too readily dismissed and which perhaps have been too readily dismissed in this particular debate.
To me the question is where we go from here.
Is it an issue on which we have a realistic prospect of seeing progress during the course of the Irish presidency?
Sweden said at the end of the IGC that it is a matter that could probably not come back before the Council until 2005, and others have talked about it not coming back for at least two years.
I say to the President-in-Office that he should dismiss much of what he has heard in the more recent speeches, not least from Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group.
Mr Watson was up to his sanctimonious best during the course of what I regarded as a number of cheap shots against the President-in-Office of the Council.
The President-in-Office might like to know that when he was endeavouring to reach agreement in the IGC on Friday, Mr Watson had his name on the front page of the Murdoch press arguing in the United Kingdom for a referendum on the outcome of these constitutional talks.
That was just a day after all his members had voted against a referendum here in this House.
That inconsistency is something that we have come to recognise from Mr Watson.
It is worth reflecting that the President of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, has recognised what he believes the route forward should be.
He said that perhaps we in Europe need to move away from this introspective constitutional debate, as it has taken up too much time and energy; and that what we need to focus on are the issues that matter to our European citizens, such as jobs and growth, the environment, human rights and quality of life.
He says that we need to get closer to the citizens we were elected to serve.
These are remarks he made on the BBC broadcasting in the United Kingdom.
They may not be said when he comes to speak to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's group here.
However, I welcome the fact that Mr Cook has endorsed the approach I have adopted in almost every debate we have held in relation to this constitutional issue.
There is much that is contained within the draft Constitution with which I take issue.
This is not the occasion to revisit that area.
But all of us should be committed to the prospect of getting back in touch with what matters to our constituents; and I would just remind everyone that we face them in June of next year.
Â Â  Mr President, the truth is that while I was listening to the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council I had the impression that the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference was being regarded as a rather unimportant detail within the context of six triumphal months of Presidency.
That is not the case.
This Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which met yesterday evening with a great many representatives from national parliaments, has expressed a common, deeply-held feeling of disappointment and concern, together with a common determination to help in every way possible for the constitutional process to be resumed and brought to a proper conclusion.
We must not play down what has happened; we must not hide behind the comforting argument that the European Community has faced other crises and come through them successfully.
This time there is likely to be a deep split in the Union, on the eve of the great enlargement.
This time public opinion in all our countries is likely to suffer a serious crisis of confidence in a united Europe.
Yesterday evening we talked about how to prevent the road to the constitution from remaining blocked.
It is a fact that when the process of drafting the constitution or revising the Treaties stopped being a government monopoly and was entrusted to a European body on which representatives of the national and European parliaments also sat â that is to say, the Convention â the work proceeded in a European spirit and an agreement was reached that was based on the common interests of Europe.
When the process was handed back to the governments with the Intergovernmental Conference, individual interests and even matters purely of national prestige prevailed in crucial areas.
What can be done?
First of all, the approach that you, Mr Berlusconi, mentioned remains valid.
The constitution cannot emerge out of a watered-down compromise.
It would, however, be a good idea to clarify what the Italian Presidency meant by âa watered-down compromiseâ.
What was the actual compromise that was avoided?
A return to Nice, the intangibility of the Treaty of Nice as regards the system for calculating a majority vote?
It would be useful if the outgoing Italian Presidency could tell us more clearly instead of praising all those who took part in the IGC.
Secondly, we must not throw away everything that has been negotiated in recent months.
Well, we still want to know what solutions have been found for the 82 points and they have to be made public, so that we can see what substance there is to these solutions.
Further discussion is also required on one issue that has remained unsolved: the procedures for revising the Treaty.
Lastly, the Irish Presidency has been given an extremely limited mandate.
Our message â as you, Mr Cox, have mentioned â is that the Irish Presidency should interpret this mandate in a broader and more inclusive manner, extending its consultations so as to make good use of the Conventionâs advice and contributions.
Mr Berlusconi, you have finished your work, but Italyâs responsibilities do not end here: as one of the founding countries, it must be a decisive driving force at this critical moment in ensuring that the process of integration continues.
Â Â  Mr President, the truly frustrating thing about the fiasco we saw at the IGC in Brussels was that, Poland aside, a solid agreement was closer to being reached than is frequently appreciated.
Clever brokerage will still be able to achieve a respectable deal upon the outcome of the work of Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention.
The fact that the IGC has failed makes the process and the outcome of the Convention more attractive.
The Irish presidency should certainly press forward quickly to seek to complete the IGC.
For them to be able to succeed they will need assistance and there is nobody more capable of proffering advice than the Convention itself, which should be recalled in January to consider the full package of presidency proposals that was published on 9 December.
Prime Minister Berlusconi says that much has been agreed, but precisely what was agreed?
That the financial system of the Union should deprive Parliament of the last word on the budget?
Was it agreed in the area of the third pillar that the emergency brake clause would suppress qualified majority voting and codecision?
Was qualified majority voting agreed for foreign and security policy, as the presidency proposed?
In the 'passerelle' clause, will the blocking of a single parliament be able to paralyse it?
Parliament has a need and a right to know the answers to these precise questions.
Â Â  Mr President, I think it is impossible not to see that we are faced with a setback.
The problem happens to be knowing what kind of setback it is.
I believe it is the defeat of the construction that you have chosen.
Whom do I mean by âyouâ? The Italian Presidency, the Treaty Convention and the IGC.
You have reduced the conflict that Europe is experiencing to a clash over the political aspect of EuropeÂ âÂ whether it should be as much as possible or as little as necessaryÂ â in short, a clash between Europhiles and Eurosceptics.
By doing so you are obscuring the real conflict and the drama of the choices Europe is being called upon to make.
You have thus stayed within the same real model and have called this conflict â which is over who should make decisions and how â a model when it is not, distancing yourselves even further from the peoples of Europe.
The model is, in fact, a social model of a political construction: it is its international aspect.
You have chosen to constitutionalise the market at a time when neo-liberalism is failing and, although you prefer peace, you have considered war possible, in these terrible times when the world is racked by wars and terrorism.
The uncritical alignment with the Atlantic framework negates any ambition for an independent Europe.
You did not choose the ambition of a model but settled for an accommodation and for staying afloat, which in practice has proved to be a framework of shifting sands, which has exalted the power struggle between powers and between countries.
That is how the construction was blown apart.
It would be good if you at least did not deny your failure, as the Italian Prime Minister has done.
The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party used the word in all its harshness.
Mr Prodi has, I think, also recognised this, but I believe he is wrong in thinking that a solution will come from setting store by the Convention.
In fact, I think the answer will be to stop pursuing a mistaken path which, if we continue along it, will lead to the ultimate crisis of Europe.
We shall have to make a new start, then, but from what point?
The first point is one of method: from a different relationship with the peoples, movements and democratic public opinion of Europe.
The second is one of substance.
There are three core issues facing us: the economy, social conditions and the international aspect, and these are inescapable.
There is not just yesterdayâs failure; there is also the Maastricht crisis, the paradigm for a Europe of markets.
Europe, as the President-in-Office has said, is caught between the political process in the United States, where the dollar favours their competitiveness, and the aggressiveness of economies like Chinaâs.
In this situation, the IGC response is not at all convincing, positioned as it is between a bastard Keynesian view and an attack on the social conditions of the workers.
Mr President, what really needs attention is the rights of the workers and the peoples.
If we do not make a new start based on this reality, Europe can have no future.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Berlusconi, at the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, you amused your colleagues with a joke about how you might make the people happy.
The punchline is that someone advises you to throw yourself out of a helicopter.
We are very glad that you did not do so, but we are not amused by the way you threw out the European Constitution instead.
There are three kinds of failure: you can lose to your opponents, you can fail to achieve goals that are set too high, and you can be your own downfall.
The Intergovernmental Conference brought itself down.
Nobody was against it.
You had the Convention behind you, with an overwhelming consensus of the larger Member States and the smaller ones, the old ones and the new, of parliaments and governments.
Only in your own ranks did you have opponents.
Did you fail because you were aiming too high?
No, for, apart from the Convention proposals, there was no controversy; even with your 300 amendments, you went nowhere near as far as what the Convention had proposed, and not even as far as the Treaties of Nice.
You were the cause of your own failure.
Having been called upon to take responsibility for Europe, you fought for national egoisms; having been called upon to create a balance between the institutions and a European democracy, you tried to build on your own power advantage, and to waste no time in gaining advantages for the national governments.
You had the chance to defend the Conventionâs consensus â which was the greatest that could have been achieved â but instead you lost it.
There is, I believe, one hope left to us.
You, Mr President-in-Office, have tried; the governments have tried â and they have failed.
After the partial failure of Amsterdam and the total failure of Nice, they have now, finally, failed.
All that we can now do is to appeal to the governmentsâ sense of reason in persuading them to accept the Convention draft, Europeâs highest common denominator, after all.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing surprises me any more since I have been sitting in this Assembly.
At least, that is what I used to think, because this morning I confess I am surprised, but not at the outcome of the Brussels European Council or the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I have said on a number of occasions, including here, that I never imagined for one second that the Heads of State or Government, who represent the highest democratic authority in the Union, could reasonably agree to the draft European Constitution prepared by the Convention as it stands, without amending it â at least that is what the ukases of the majority of this Parliament wanted.
No, what surprises me is the behaviour of the federalist majority here present, whose blindness it must be said is beyond understanding.
You never question yourselves.
I have not heard one of you say: âPerhaps we were mistaken.
We must have gone the wrong way.â
No.
You persist, you sign, as if nothing had happened.
Better still, like worthy followers of poor Lysenko, you look for someone to take the blame for your failure.
Like all fanatics, you want heads to roll.
But if you look things calmly in the face, you will see that the cause of this fiasco is not the Italian Presidency, whose excellent work I commend in passing, nor the attitude of some Member States, who have courageously defended their national interests as their peoples demanded, but quite simply our Convention and its incredible draft constitution.
Noble as it may have been, this project was doomed before it even saw the light of day, because it ran radically counter to European political reality, a reality which, whether you like it or not, continues to be determined by the existence of peoples and nations.
In rejecting a division of power based on the federal model, Spain and Poland have rendered Europe a great service by finally saying out loud what many others have been quietly thinking for months, namely that the old Europe of Jean Monnet inherited from the division agreed in Yalta is dead and gone.
Do not persist in trying to resurrect a federalism that is a thing of the past.
Unlike the chairman of the Convention, the draft constitution is not immortal, so let it rest in peace.
Let us rather take the opportunity that is given to us of laying the foundations of a new Europe, one which has rediscovered its natural borders.
Let us build a political Europe which, while never denying its history and taking into account the constraints of modernity, tends towards an ideal of freedom and not of uniformity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am pleased that we are now being given a little more time in which to discuss the Constitution.
Negotiations are complete regarding 99% of it.
Only one very important aspect is missing: the definition of qualified majority.
Then there is the encounter with the electorate.
Why not use the time to prepare referendums in all the countries?
Parallel with the summit, the European Referendum Campaign met in Brussels with 100 participants from many different organisations.
Both MrÂ Leinen and I were among the speakers.
On behalf of SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I should like to undertake to contribute to some solid information work on the draft Constitution.
Let federalists and Euro realists present our different visions for Europe, together with accessible editions of the Constitution wording.
Let us together demand referendums in all the EU countries under a common motto: EU Constitution?
Ask the people.
In Denmark, we are to be given a referendum, but the June Movement would like to help gather signatures for referendums in all the EU countries.
When we have a referendum and vote ânoâ in Denmark, a new referendum is held.
Instead of giving the Danes and the Irish a second ballot, it would be better to consult the whole of the EU.
I should therefore like to collect signatures demanding referendums throughout the EU.
People cannot be given a constitution without permission being asked of them.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the six month Presidency of the European Union and especially for that part of his speech which did not focus just on the Convention, the Constitution or the Intergovernmental Conference, which did not reach a successful outcome.
This does not mean that Europe is dead or finished.
The Treaties are still fully in force and will remain effective and in operation until they are replaced with a new text.
In the President-in-Officeâs speech, I was pleased to hear the reference to issues closer to the citizens, who, I believe, are not particularly interested in whether voting is by double majority, whether Spain should have 27 rather than 28 votes or other such things.
I think the citizens are very interested in major public works, not having tailbacks on motorways, being able to travel on fast trains, having special attention paid to employment and â as Mr Berlusconi recalled â taking action against those countries that operate on the free market without complying with the rules on environmental and worker protection.
Ten years ago in this Parliament I was arguing for exactly the same things, so I was pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council calling for them.
I must also add that this kind of unfair competition is also seen in the pirating of products and brands, and in this context, now that the baton is being passed on to Ireland, we must in my opinion make a great effort to protect our industries, our products, our workers and ultimately our standard of living.
The institutions are important, as is their reform.
We must, however, as Mr Berlusconi has done, pay attention to the living conditions of our citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, over the weekend, I sometimes got the impression that we were discussing the rendezvous clauses rather than having a rendezvous with history, and that the reason why we did not come to any conclusion was that we were perhaps not aware of our responsibilities in all the areas.
My great concern is now that everything is running through our fingers.
When I contemplate the vast timescale, extending into 2005, I fear it will rob the Convention text of its momentum.
I believe that it is for this reason that, on two points, we have to make it clear what we do not want.
I do not want a âcore Europeâ; instead, we should waste no time in resuming the attempt, with the Convention text, to get more of a constitution for a large-scale Europe with twenty-five Member States.
Secondly, I do not want a compromise if it does not increase our capacity to act.
Discussion of that brought the IGC down. There can be no compromise if, having got it, there is less transparency â the Legislative Council springs to mind â or less democracy, of which the Budget debate and Parliamentâs budgetary rights provide us with examples.
Despite these criticisms, though, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency of the Council for having kept close to the Conventionâs text throughout all these weeks and months and for actually keeping the commitment it made in respect of it.
This is why the Convention text still stands; it is now for us to breathe new life into it.
This being so, and in view of Mr Berlusconiâs statement that a number of formerly critical points â apparently 82 of them â had been satisfactorily dealt with in Brussels, it would make sense to hold fast to it if we are to maintain momentum.
For this reason, I believe, the foreign ministers should meet together as early as January in order to consolidate what has been achieved.
That, I believe will enable us to maintain momentum, and you, Mr President, could perhaps prompt them to go down this road.
This could provide a basis on which the Irish Presidency of the Council could put forward proposals for holding a new meeting of Heads of State or Government as soon as possible, although the timetable has to be planned in such a way as to make compromises possible.
This meeting must be held, and must resolve matters, before 1 May, when enlargement is due to take place, for this project is, logically speaking, intended to enable the European Union to be enlarged.
I want to give a second reason why this meeting should be held before 1 May, which is that I do not know how, if things remain as they are today, the Heads of Government and we in this House can face the voters on 13 June.
It is for this reason â so that the voters can have a perspective that keeps them from losing faith in Europe â that it is from this point that the Heads of State or Government must make a new start before 1 May.
I hope, Mr President, that you will, in the remaining weeks of your presidency, join with your successors in setting a project of this kind in motion.
Â Â  â Mr President, the weekendâs summit is a source of danger for Europe, but I want us to be consistent.
For years, we condemned lowest-common-denominator compromises; this time, the lowest common denominator would have been a âNiceÂ IIâ, which would have destroyed the draft constitution.
Let me say, therefore, that it is better that the summit should fail than that the draft constitution for Europe should be lost.
We in Europeâs Parliament will not now allow this draft to disappear back into the archives of history.
It is still on the table.
Working to keep it there will be our first priority in the coming months and years, and we will have to keep working to that end even after the next European elections with our new fellow-Members here in the European Parliament.
Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, and we have to face this crisis calmly.
We must not allow ourselves to be influenced by soothing words about business as usual.
We will overcome crises like this one not by standing still but by getting moving.
Where is this danger that hangs over Europeâs future?
It does not lie in the possibility of the constitution arriving a couple of years behind schedule.
It lies in a new division that is opening up in Europe.
In a stronger and united Europe, there are, on the one hand, governments that seek to use it as a means of promoting their national interests and, on the other, there are governments that want to defend their interests against it.
This gulf must not be allowed to get any wider; bridging it is our most important task.
At the end of the day, the dispute at your summit was about the division of power in Europe, which the world powers have long disregarded.
Therein lies the danger facing Europe.
While you are in Brussels, fighting tooth and nail over influence, Europe is in the process of losing all influence in the world.
Such is the danger of which this summit is the source.
I will dare to say that it is easy to overcome the differences that have become apparent between the governments, but restoring peopleâs confidence in Europeâs future will be difficult.
Yet it is that which will be our task, a task we must accomplish over the coming years and decades, a task in which I wish us all much success.
Â Â  â Mr President, the failure of the IGC may well lead to a failure of Europe because, although it is a marvellous historical goal, we all know that enlargement to 25 Member States without majority voting will be a nightmare: a nightmare in which Europe will be divided, paralysed and impotent in a globalised world.
The final report that Mr Berlusconi gave here for three-quarters of an hour â 82 points âwith one exceptionâ, which must be the success of the IGC â is a clumsy way of giving us an extra dose of misery.
Unfortunately, he is once again concerned with distancing himself from a mark of failure rather than pointing out the right road on behalf of a great founding country like Italy.
Mr Prodi has honestly expressed the extent of the failure and the risks associated with it, and has started to mark out a possible route for the future.
I say yes, Mr Prodi, to an initiative by pioneer States for a Europe that in no way underrates the importance of this broad Union extending from Portugal to the Baltic States, but you know we have to move towards an effective, democratic integration of the Community based on the results of the Convention.
Yes, then, to starting out with those who share the results of the Convention â an honourable compromise â on the new European Community path.
In this way all 25 can be helped to reach the goal.
This is the objective around which we should and can unite as from tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no doubt that the Brussels fiasco has landed the European Union in a grave crisis.
This is the first failure of an enlarged European Union, even before the accession of new Member States.
It represents a setback for European integration, but what brought it about?
The Brussels summit did not focus on the creation of a democratic, social and peaceful Europe.
Instead, power and influence were haggled over, and a narrow-minded nationalism again prevailed in yet another demonstration of the fact that Intergovernmental Conferences are completely unsuited to advancing European integration.
The European idea sustained serious damage at the summit, at which it was the real loser.
There were winners, though, as well; they include, for example, the USA, for it is the USA that will profit from the summitâs conclusions on European security and defence policy, which tied Europe and NATO together as brothers in arms and put us under American guardianship in security policy matters.
I am in favour of a European constitution â a modern and progressive one.
It was with that in mind that I involved myself in the Convention, but it should give politicians like ourselves serious misgivings that â figuratively speaking â nobody took to the streets to demonstrate in favour of the constitution that the Convention produced.
Only 38% of the public at large have ever heard anything about the Convention and only a fraction of them are familiar with the text.
Quite apart from that, the real problem is to be found elsewhere, in that the public are not convinced that their fundamental concerns and needs are a priority.
The degree to which they are right about this is demonstrated, to take one example, by the fact that the IGC as a whole did not even once turn its attention to the inherent contradictions between Part 3 and Part 1 of the draft, and by the manifest fact that two mutually antithetical economic philosophies are to remain in the text of the constitution â the social market economy on the one hand and free competition on the other.
That is not the way to get people enthusiastic about a European constitution.
I hope that the time of reflection â the crisis â will be understood as an opportunity.
I urge you to have an open discussion with the public about the constitutional project, and, above all, take seriously the serious criticisms that civil society makes of the Conventionâs draft.
Â Â  Mr President, we have just seen a spectacular failure in European integration on the part of the Heads of State or Government, who have not been sufficiently statesmanlike to see and preserve the collective interests of all the citizens.
I have often had to hear disparaging descriptions in this Parliament of the historic democratic nationalist traditions, such as the Basque nation, when all we want is to safeguard our identity and our culture and are prepared to share our laws and political competences with the other Europeans.
To this end, not only are we calling for recognition as historic nations, but also a role in the democratic decision-making processes.
It is not we, but certain irritating State nationalist traditions, which are slowing down Europe, as in the case of Mr Aznar, who only thinks about how to block decisions in order to impose his views on others, rather than thinking about how to build a stronger, more prosperous Europe, united in its diversity.
I am convinced that, in order to move forward, the Union must cease to be dominated by State governments, that is, by executives, and become a genuine federal union, in which it is the citizens and their representatives, we Members of the European Parliament, who determine the Constitution and other Community laws.
It is time to leave behind intergovernmentalism and to move towards becoming a full political entity, a supra-State with common laws for all the peoples and nations of the continent or at least for those who wish to build a common future based on dialogue, trust, understanding amongst equals and good for all.
Â Â  Mr President, however it may appear, the Brussels Council on the European Constitution failed for three reasons.
Firstly, the Convention claimed to have reached a consensus, but that was not true.
The IGC has simply unmasked the lie of the Convention.
Secondly, Spain and Polandâs opposition over the method of calculating the qualified majority was in fact motivated by profound differences, which were shared by other States although they did not say so openly: the rejection of a unitary Europe run supranationally by a coopted elite.
Our thanks are due to those countries for defending Europeâs true interests.
Thirdly and lastly, the intransigence of those who clung to the qualified majority formula proposed by the Convention showed that in reality they did not want it to succeed.
Perhaps because they thought the Conventionâs conclusions were not as good as all that.
But perhaps especially because, knowing the state of mind of their fellow citizens, they wanted to defer the problem until after the European elections.
In reality, Mr President, it was the citizens who blocked the European Constitution, even though they were not consulted directly.
Â Â  Mr President, practically all the parliamentary groups and â it appears â all the Member States claim to want a new legal framework for the Union in the form of a Constitution.
Work by many people over many months has resulted in a proposal with which a great majority appear to be in agreement.
The good work of the Italian Presidency has furthermore allowed us over the weekend to add something very important to the agreement, which is the establishment of a European defence doctrine.
All of this acquis, the fruit of negotiation â as Mr Berlusconi has said â must be recovered and consolidated as an approved text.
What then has led to this failure?
I believe that the failure stems from a proposed institutional reform which the President of the Convention came up with at the last moment, which was not debated sufficiently, and on which there was certainly no consensus within the Convention.
Apparently in Brussels six months has not been enough time to complete a compromise.
This is no great tragedy.
We must remember that of the five previous Intergovernmental Conferences which negotiated reforms of the Treaties, only one ended within the six-month period in which it had begun.
The Irish Presidency must simply carry on working where the Italian Presidency has left off.
What I believe should be ruled out, Mr President, is the following: firstly, the absurd idea of postponing this debate until after the European elections; secondly, the idea that what interests me is Europeanist and that what does not interest me is anti-European; thirdly, the nonsense of dividing Europe even before it has been enlarged; and fourthly, the recriminations which get us nowhere, except for some people, of course â such as the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists â who believe that the government of their country is solely to blame, whatever it does and whatever happens.
I believe that the only phrase he knows in Italian is [it is raining â damned government].
He indulges in this type of national opposition in the European Parliament and is then surprised that he loses election after election.
It must be the electorateâs fault, naturally.
In any event, we now all have responsibility.
Mr President, we must keep the IGC open, we must contribute to dialogue and the commitment we all aspire to.
Let us pray that we achieve it before 13 June.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear from the debate here this morning and in yesterday's discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that Parliament is divided into two camps.
The two camps are the optimists and the pessimists.
The pessimists point out that we are in a major crisis, perhaps, I have heard it said, the biggest since the rejection of the EDC Treaty in 1954.
The optimists say no, because 95% of the draft Constitution has not been challenged and has virtually been agreed though I would like to see the text of the final versions of these articles that have virtually been agreed at the IGC.
There is just one key subject left to argue about and settle.
It concerns the voting system within one of the institutions.
We can still do this.
After all, on the original timetable nobody had originally thought we would finish before Christmas, so there is nothing to panic about.
It can all be resolved in due course.
Which of these two views is right?
I tend to be an optimist by nature, but I am a cautious optimist.
We can salvage this IGC but it will need us all and the Member States in the IGC especially to be focused: focused on the remaining issues that need to be settled and attentive to solving them sooner, rather than later.
If we take too long, there is a risk of reopening the debate on virtually every article in the draft Constitution.
That above all must be avoided.
We must focus on the points that remain.
We must ask the Irish presidency to tear up its original plans and timetable for its presidency and focus first and foremost on this.
It is true that business as usual can go on to a degree on the basis of the old Constitution, namely the various treaties that we have, but these treaties are not satisfactory.
They need updating, they need streamlining.
They need modernising.
We need the new Constitution.
The Irish presidency must not just carry on, business as usual.
It must focus on getting a result on this as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, the importance of fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of information, was reaffirmed at the recent Brussels European Council.
In this respect, how can one doubt the contribution made by the President-in-Office of the Council?
This is why I turn to you and to the Members here to underline the extremely serious attack on the multiplicity of information posed by the Gasparri law on broadcasting.
Virtually all public and private broadcasting services in Italy are controlled by the Prime Minister.
The advertising market is also in practice dominated by the companies he owns.
It is not an exaggeration to call it a media , which sets a highly dangerous precedent for the Community countries.
If the problem of the enormous conflict of interests that strikes at the heart of democracy in my country is not addressed and resolved within the Community, the creeping regime that is suffocating Italian society will be consolidated.
What will elections mean if the Prime Minister controls most of the media?
I turn to you, ladies and gentlemen, with bitterness, concern and anxiety, and ask you: what can this Parliament do to protect the freedom of information in Italy?
Please help us, please help my country to save the democracy for which the forefathers of our Europe battled.
Â Â  Mr President, between some peopleâs euro-scepticism, some peopleâs arrogance and the stubbornness of others, the governments of the Member States and their leaders are endangering the adoption of the Constitution that the peoples and the citizens want and need.
Their fight solely over the right of veto not only caused the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference to fail, which is what happened three years ago at Nice, but also managed to obscure the positive aspects and the shortcomings of the draft Constitution, stifling real debate in European society and in our various States and Nations.
These factors have obscured the extraordinary value of the existence of the Constitution, the progress made in external policy since the crisis in Iraq, the leading role given to Parliament and consequently to the citizens, and the shortcomings of our policy for social and territorial cohesion, the failure to recognise national political diversity in Europe as well as in the Member States, which I wish to highlight as a Member of the European Parliament for Galicia and as Chairman of the Intergroup on Stateless Nations.
Mr President, I wish to make it quite clear, since most of us are citizens of the Spanish State - that we are not judging the Constitution on the basis of our State Governmentâs potential power of veto and that we do not share the stubbornness of the current Prime Minister, JosÃ© Maria Aznar, who distinguishes himself now and then by his talent for making enemies and by obstructing the solution to all problems.
There are many more of us who wish political and social union to progress, united in diversity.
Â Â  Mr President, please allow me to congratulate you on the award of the Charlemagne Prize, which is also good news for this Parliament; a Parliament which, since 1984, has wanted a Constitution, through the Spinelli Treaty, then through the Herman, Oreja and Colombo projects which called for the establishment of the Convention in 1997 and which, after Nice, opted for the Convention.
That is why there is a touch of melancholy in the air today.
What I mean is that, although this contradicts the philosopher, this melancholy is not the result of pointless efforts.
The Conventionâs efforts have not been pointless, because â and I firmly believe this â this Constitution is necessary for the enlarged Europe and there is no alternative.
Since the European Parliament â as the poet would say â has yet to speak, we must now consider how we are going to act in the future.
Firstly, we must recover our common sense, and there are a series of things we must not do: we must not talk about dividing Europe, about dividing ourselves, the Europeanists, up; we must not talk about founding countries, about pioneer or vanguard countries, as if to reproach those countries which do not seem up to the job; and, at this time, nor should we send letters to the President of the Commission telling him to reduce the budget to 1% of GDP.
We must recover our common sense.
We must consolidate the constitutional .
You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have said that 82 solution measures have been proposed.
Tell this House whether this is the case and, if it is, they must be consolidated.
Let us consolidate them under the Irish Presidency and, before 1Â May 2004, let us resolve the outstanding institutional issues and let us go into the elections of 13Â June asking the Europeans to vote for this Constitution.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can hardly be surprised that I am not rising to ask you about what has been achieved as regards the constitution.
Many Members have done that already.
I want to refer back to what I said on 2 July, when, in this House, I asked you, as President of the European Council, âWhat do you intend to do to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant?â
On that occasion, demonstrating a distinct lack of charm, you declined to answer me.
Then, in September, I asked again what progress had rewarded your efforts, and I can tell the House that I have received an answer.
The answer to the question as to what you intend doing to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant is ânothingâ.
On 1 January next year, there will be no European arrest warrant.
The area of security, freedom and justice is at the heart of European legal policy, a core policy of the European Union â as, indeed, you yourself said in your first statement to this House.
I take the view that it would have been one of your tasks as President-in-Office of the Council to make this landmark a reality, for the fact is that the failure to introduce the European arrest warrant means that, from 1 January 2004 onwards, the position as regards criminal prosecutions in Europe will be worse than on 31 December 2003.
The absence of the European arrest warrant will make it more difficult to prosecute criminals from 1 January 2004 onwards.
Precisely whom this state of affairs is meant to benefit, Mr President-in-Office, I have no idea, but I know full well who is put at a disadvantage by it, namely the citizens of Europe.
If we want to establish this area of security, freedom and justice, if we want to make Europe more secure, if we want to guarantee more efficient prosecution across frontiers, if we want to combat organised crime more effectively, then this landmark in the area of security, freedom and justice is what we need.
I very much regret that.
Back in September, I believed you were on the right track.
Today, I have to say, with regret, that, on this issue â and let me repeat myself, we are talking here about the accelerated introduction of the arrest warrant, which was necessary in July â you have, lamentably, not only failed to do your homework, but have, in my opinion, proved yourself an outright failure.
Â Â  â Mr President, the tendering directive, the single European sky directive, the directive on takeover bids, the agencies, the concrete work on economic growthÂ â one need only recall the decisions made on major public works and the finance mechanisms associated with themÂ âÂ and the careful analysis launched by the Italian Presidency, followed by specific proposals on competitiveness, a subject which lies at the root of the Lisbon process which is only slowly taking shape in the way we want; the specific measures on immigration â which should take place legally with flows regulated by individual countriesâ requirements â with particular regard for the border control agency; the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations, whose main task will be an assessment of the dialogue between religions in the hope of curbing fundamentalism, since this is terrorism in the making; the action in the Middle East â where we have worked hard towards a dialogue between the two sides, and Italy in particular has also provided a venue â with the launching of an intervention plan with a EUR 5 billion budget for the next five years: these are undeniable achievements that attest to the generosity of the Italian Presidency.
There is, of course, one discordant note: the mechanism for giving the European Union a new formal constitution has jammed.
At this moment we must pay particular attention to the sirens of the material constitution.
We need time to reflect, because what emerged in the heat of the moment is certainly worrying.
I will not mention those involved but rather the issues: a two-speed Europe, the emphasis on closer cooperation, a Europe made of concentric circles, in which all share the same policies but each group remains open to new associations â this is not the political scenario that the 25-Member Europe needs.
We must not lose what lay at the heart of the Convention: the general interest of Europe, which gave rise to the decision to abolish national veto rights in most cases and proposals for a transparent and credible voting system.
In the general interest of Europe we must make a fresh start and work with new formulas that we can create if we so wish.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the American hyperpower has just scored a double victory.
After dividing Europe by unleashing the war in Iraq, it has just prevented Europe from giving itself the constitution it needs to operate with 25 members, at the very moment when it was arresting Saddam Hussein.
Over the last century, the only wall of freedom will have been the Wall of the Atlantic.
Since then, we have had the Berlin wall and the Jerusalem wall.
That is not the way to build peace.
To those who added a brick to the wall of Atlanticism this weekend I want to say that the cement of peace, security and stability that our continent needs will not be built with walls like that.
Since 1986, the European Union has experienced a divorce between the nature of its project and the institutions able to sustain it.
Before now, we did not have the right to frame the question in those terms.
But because enlargement reverses the numerical ratio, it forces us to raise the question of the institutions in such stark terms.
And the Heads of State or Government are unable to deal with it because then they can only go back home with bad news and they do not have the double legitimacy of the nations and states.
That double legitimacy existed in the Convention.
That is why we reached an outcome that ought to have been validated by the Heads of State or Government.
Now, Europeâs contribution to the world balance will not be consolidated on the blocking power some wanted to introduce this weekend.
Do those who rejoice at this failure, imagining a hard core resigned to not having a working Europe of 25 and allowing this wall of Atlanticism to be built want to be the agents of division and of new rifts in our continent?
Let us note those things where we can make progress, but let us not give to those 82 points.
Let us look at them one at a time and see what can be done.
Your Presidencyâs conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, where national egotisms have carried the day, turns its back on the hopes that were born of the Convention.
The mandate given to the Irish Presidency is not equal to what is at stake.
Those who still want to provide our continent with the conditions for its stability must take up the flag again.
Â Â  â Mr President, it would be wrong to say of the Intergovernmental Conference held in recent weeks that it was a failure.
On the contrary, under the Italian Presidency we were able to keep the basic ideas of the Convention virtually intact and agree jointly on 22 of the areas involved.
Consensus was reached on an important issue relating to future security: the development of common European basic defence structures.
When the IGC realised it should include the Conventionâs original wording regarding the relation between the position of the non-aligned countries and security guarantees, Finland, Sweden and Austria were also able to become fully involved in security cooperation.
A by-product of the summit was the way it also resolved disputes over where to locate EU agencies, wrangles that had long been a source of irritation.
Italy can therefore go away happy to brag about Parma ham and prosciutto and we Finns on the other hand will monitor the situation from the Chemicals Agency and ensure that they do not use the wrong ingredients when they produce them.
The argument over how the voting rights of the countries in the Council should be allocated left everything that had already been agreed open.
As President Chirac himself admitted, the failure of the Nice Summit was the reason for this.
We cannot be biased and point an accusing finger at the country currently holding the presidency nor even at Poland or Spain.
It is natural that Germany was unable to accept the Nice decision.
It is just as natural, however, that it cannot dictate the solution; instead, we are now to have talks aimed at a balance, talks which take a balanced view of the status of small countries, and not just the large ones like Spain and Poland.
A return to genuine double majority voting â half in respect of the population and half in respect of the countries â must certainly be one aspect of the solution which would also reassure the small countries that they are not going to be dictated to by the large countries in the future.
It is important, however, that debates on matters that have already been agreed on are not reopened on account of a row that has not been settled.
If that happened we could really say that the Brussels Summit and the IGC have failed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the failure of the draft constitution has obscured the fact that a number of positive decisions were taken at the Brussels summit, on such matters as, for example, the European security strategy.
How, though, is such a strategy meant to be implemented if both the common political will for it and common institutions â such as a European foreign minister â are absent?
Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have declared, and rightly, that we are in a very, very precarious position as regards competition with the United States of America and with Asia, and you also referred to the state of affairs in the Far East, which amounts almost to anarchy.
You were right to do so; how are we to compete successfully with them without a common will and common institutions, if we do not join together as Europeans in, for example, ensuring that Kyoto is implemented as a whole?
Already, I hear many European industrialists saying, âWe cannot be the only ones to implement Kyoto, or we will lose our competitive edge.â
That is only possible provided that a minimum of social and human rights is enforced, along with protection for the environment, provided that this shared constitutional Europe comes into being.
The capacity of common purpose to accomplish something has been demonstrated by the way in which the Americans have dispensed with steel tariffs.
If Europe acts together and presents a united front, we too have the opportunity and the capacity to get things done together.
This leads me to agree wholeheartedly with MrÂ Poettering that we need a European constitution as a symbol and as an instrument if we are to make this common purpose a reality on the global stage too.
It is for that reason that I do not see the creation, at this point in time, of a core Europe as a way out.
I might add that it is generally not the core of a fruit that is interesting, but its pulp, so creating a smaller core Europe is not a way out.
Instead, Europe must be great, and we must hold it in common.
If a few are unwilling to join in, then we have to consider how we are to achieve this constitutional Europe, this Europe in which as many as possible can share and which is open to all.
What this means is that both the Italian and Irish Presidencies of the Council must now carry the message that we have to work in order to bring about a common Europe with a common constitution and with as many Member States as possible.
We must not allow our vision to fade away, nor must we, under any circumstances, abandon a common Europe with a common constitution!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe will never be finished, but we must press on with the project for political union with determination and vision, and on a Community basis.
If we do not, the public will lose confidence in us.
If we do not, we will achieve neither integration nor consolidation.
If we do not, we cannot discharge our responsibilities for our continent on the world stage, and mistakes can be made.
They can be corrected, and they must be.
What has happened, though, is not just a matter of mistakes being made; what I find lamentable is the lack of sufficient political will on the part of the Heads of State or Government who took part and hence the lack of European leaders, indeed of European statesmen.
Will, courage, emotion, enthusiasm â all are wanting, and so, therefore, are credibility and confidence.
Whenever the future of Europe depends on unanimous approval by the Council rather than on agreement between the Community institutions, crisis is in the air.
It happened with the sanctions against Austria, it happened with the Iraq crisis, it happened with the Stability and Growth Pact.
More and more frequently, we blame the Community objectives for problems at national level.
So let me conclude by saying that the Convention has not failed, the Commission has not stood in the way, Parliament is not putting the brakes on a Europe that is more democratic, more transparent and closer to its citizens.
We say a forthright ânoâ to unanimity and âyesâ to a dual majority, which is democratically fair, ânoâ to the apportionment of blame and âyesâ to shared responsibility in Europe, ânoâ to a more nationalised internal policy and ratification process and âyesâ to their becoming more European, ânoâ to the Intergovernmental Conference method and âyesâ to the Convention in which governments and parliaments are represented, âyesâ to a European Union of peoples and citizens, ânoâ to an intergovernmental core Europe, âyesâ to shouldering our responsibilities within Europe and around the world, ânoâ to a reduction of Member Statesâ contributions.
We say âyesâ to the idea of summoning the Convention after Christmas in order to discuss the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference and in order to speedily implement all that came out of the Convention, or was agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference, and is feasible on the basis of current law.
Â Â  Mr President, let us send a positive message to the citizens, huge numbers of whom have supported the work of the Convention and the draft Constitution it has drawn up: in 2004 â whether one likes it or not â Europe is going to have a Constitution.
Otherwise, we would have to face working with a botch-up, like the Treaty of Nice, carrying out enlargement without deepening the Union, under bad conditions, and discussing the financial perspectives in a stifling political atmosphere.
In view of its content and the way it has been produced, the Conventionâs draft Constitution is good for the citizens and today, following the failure of the Brussels Summit, even those who criticised certain specific aspects of it accept it as a good document.
The Convention was a success and the Intergovernmental Conference is a failure.
There are certain obvious contributors to the failure of the Brussels Summit and, for me, as a Spaniard, it means a great deal to hear the praise of the Eurosceptics in this House for the President of my countryâs government, he of the âletter of eightâ and of the last Brussels Summit.
The process of producing a Constitution must continue and that European Constitution must be created during 2004.
Of course we do not want a Europe of varying speeds, nor pioneering groups.
We want a politically united Europe, a Europe which is autonomous in its external actions, a Europe with competencies and resources to resolve the demands of the people and, therefore, we must strongly urge the Irish Presidency to call an Intergovernmental Conference in January in order to consolidate the 95% agreed and to resolve the outstanding issues in a negotiated and appropriate manner.
Why not also call the Convention, which has legitimacy?
And naturally the European Parliament must play its historical role as a driving force, in this case as the driving force for the European Constitution.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should subject everything that happened last weekend to a very sober analysis.
We may perhaps then come to the conclusion that we have, in recent years, not engaged very seriously with the question of whether the EU can be made both deeper and wider at the same time.
Let me put that question in very graphic terms.
The reason why the Convention was so very successful was that this issue was the cement holding the whole thing together.
It was because there was a common interest â on the part of the actors, but not on the part of the Member States â and hence it is now important that we give some thought to what really are the common interests of the 25 Member States that will be joined together in this European Union from 1 May onwards.
That needs to be analysed in a very matter-of-fact way.
What are the tasks that we have to perform at the European level?
What are the tools, what are the procedures, that we need in order to perform them?
What kind of financial framework does this Europe need if it is to be able to perform the tasks allotted to it?
Only when we have come up with serious answers to these questions will we be in a position to draw the necessary conclusions, and learn the necessary lessons, from what was completed at the weekend, and that means that we also have to ask ourselves whether, at the moment, a deeper EU is perhaps more important than its enlargement over and above the twenty-five â which will mean discussing what a Europe of 25 Member States has in common.
I think we must start by fulfilling the fourth Copenhagen criterion â that was indeed laid down at Copenhagen.
We must be able to concentrate on what we have in common.
What is within the EU must be made capable of sustaining enlargement.
That is the task we have to tackle in the coming year, and with a great deal of commitment, and then we will be able to draw from it the helpful conclusions that we need.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our feelings can be summed up in one word: disappointment.
Not only are we disappointed, however, the overwhelming majority of European citizens, who are in favour of a European Constitution, are also disappointed and perplexed.
Fortunately, and to the despair of the Eurosceptics, the European Constitution is a popular idea and one that mobilises the people.
The European project is the finest idea that the twenty-first century has inherited from the violent twentieth.
Today, Europe stands at a turning point.
Enlargement will bring change; we are creating another political entity.
I am not indulging in political metaphysics here â this is the reality of the situation.
Enlargement without a Constitution is something that can no longer be contemplated, less still accepted.
This is something that the recalcitrant Member States must understand.
Unfortunately there are a few States that attempt to counter the spirit of Europe with the old myths and delusions of grandeur or of national importance and still advocate the political fossil, albeit a recent one, that is the Treaty of Nice.
Europe must be built, however, through a positive, not negative spirit.
Some leaders act as if the Union gave them rights but no duties whatsoever.
We cannot and must not fail in our confrontation with history.
Europe urgently needs a Constitution and it is within our reach.
Long live the Constitution!
Â Â  â Mr President, the disappointing outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference is a surprise to no one.
It was an expected disappointment, perhaps, â but no less disappointing for that â to find that a yearâs work by our 105 members of the Convention could be called into question in a few hours for futile considerations of the respective weighting of the different member countries of our Union.
If there is a lesson we can and must draw from that, it is that we cannot hope for any progress in an intergovernmental context towards the completion of European integration since, as Mr Pasqua rightly said, in that context the Heads of State can do no other than defend their national interests tooth and nail, even at the expense of the general interest.
I do not share the view of those who imagine that, in the weeks ahead, the Irish Presidency will be able to reverse the trend that has now been set.
We must therefore prepare ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, to ask the real questions that remain in the course of the forthcoming European election campaign.
After all, it is an ill wind and it will give the campaign added interest.
Having said that, President-in-Office of the Council, you raised the general issue of security, which you rightly understand to be a major concern of our fellow citizens in Europe.
In this connection, while welcoming the good intentions shown, I cannot help remembering the proverb that says that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
I therefore hope that Europe will go beyond mere words and commit itself, in reality and not just virtually, to constructing the instruments necessary for establishing its objectives and implementing its strategy in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have heard a great many criticisms which I endorse but which there is no reason for me to repeat.
I want to dwell on something correct which you said when, speaking of the statute of the European Central Bank, you pointed out that it was inferior to the statute of the Federal Reserve Bank, because it does not contain the objective of supporting economic activity as well as the objective of price stability.
It is important that you are the first Prime Minister and President of the European Council to point out the shortcomings in the statute of the European Central Bank from such an official tribune and I thank you for that.
I trust that the Italian Presidency's proposal that the Council should have the facility to amend the statute of the European Central Bank by a qualified majority will be accepted and I hope that the statute of the European Central Bank will soon be amended along the lines you indicated, so that the European Central Bank can finally start to encourage investments, especially public-sector investments, instead of trying to strangle them at every step, as if they were illegitimate children.
Â Â  â Mr President, today we should all have liked to welcome the agreement that would have given rise to the first European Constitution, but it would be a serious political mistake â which some have already made â to say that Europe is finished, to persecute those responsible and to give up in the face of the difficulties encountered along the way.
This is why we must continue to press forward in the spirit of the Convention and on the strength of the considerable results achieved through the Italian Presidencyâs hard work, and in the certainty that the final objective can really be achieved.
It is worth remembering that 95% of what was decided by the Convention was adopted by all those taking part in the IGC.
It should also be highlighted that the Italian Presidency has remained faithful to the commitments made in this Chamber six months ago, starting with the decision not to put its name to a low-profile compromise that would be an affront to the work of the Convention.
Another positive aspect has been the relationship with this Parliament, which has at last, for the first time, been truly involved as a major player in the work of the IGC and has been kept constantly informed about the Councilâs work.
The other decisions by the Italian Presidency that Mr Fiori has mentioned should therefore be judged favourably.
Indeed, the work of these last six months cannot merely be assessed superficially, acrimoniously and in a partisan spirit or, worse still, with a concern just for the internal affairs of the countries of the Union.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo does not practise what he preaches when he talks of Community spirit, for he only seems concerned about the Spanish elections, and the same applies to Mr Watson, who often worries about Italian matters but loses sight of the interests of Europe.
Some of the Members from my own country seeking visibility or lost consensus also seem to care little about European matters when they use this House to talk about local issues, and unconvincingly at that.
A word to Mr Schulz, who has raised the matter of the European arrest warrant for the umpteenth time.
The Italian Presidency has, as is its duty, asked all the governments what progress had been made with their national legislative measures to adapt their laws to the decision on the European arrest warrant.
The answer was clear: only three countries out of 15 will have taken the necessary measures by December; four others said they would need three or four months longer; the other eight countries are even further behind.
Mr Schulz, you cannot really be asking the Italian Presidency or any Presidency to overrule the sovereign voice of the national parliaments â that would be unthinkable.
In conclusion, I want to make an appeal to get down to work involving all the countries, abandoning the idea that a few should move ahead and leave the rest behind, and looking towards a Europe of values that does not want to give up its Judaeo-Christian roots.
Â Â  â Despite Mr Tajaniâs conclusions, I must turn to you, Mr President-in-Office, to say that in your statement you tended to minimise the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference.
This is the second time in just a short while that the intergovernmental method has failed, and this time it had behind it a complete, widely supported draft prepared by the Convention.
What is even more disconcerting is the lack of prospects that can be inferred from your terse statement handing over to the Irish Presidency.
In this context, there is a real risk of facing both the European elections and enlargement without a constitutional treaty, but it does not seem to worry you very much.
If you would like to dwell a little on the prospects in your reply, I should be very grateful.
The end of a presidency period is also a time for weighing things up.
In foreign policy, no attempt was made to secure an active political role for the European Union and the United Nations: there was coolness towards the important Middle East peace initiative at Geneva, which you did not even mention; the commitments made here were ignored, such as the acceptance of the arrest warrant and the moratorium on the death penalty.
We welcome the growth initiative but it will not be enough because only control of the economy, at least in the euro zone, can ensure the recovery and quality of the European economy.
Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, information.
You are aware that, during the six months of your presidency, this Parliament decided to enhance the status of media freedom and multiplicity in Europe, particularly in Italy.
The fact that the President of the Italian Republic sent back to parliament the dreadful, dangerous law on this issue that was presented by your government and voted for by a majority in it confirms these concerns.
In short, apart from the quite commendable conclusion of certain dossiers mentioned by you and Mr Prodi, how would you describe what the six months of this Italian Presidency have meant?
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank you and all the Members who have spoken in the debate.
You have, in general, shown your disappointment with the fact that, in the sixty days available to the Presidency of the Intergovernmental Conference, no concrete result has been forthcoming. In truth, everyone had said such a result would be a miracle and it has been clear for some weeks now that it was not going to be possible to achieve one.
I believe, however, that this disappointment should not lead us to adopt a pessimistic attitude towards the future.
I believe that recriminations serve no purpose and that it is always necessary to be optimistic.
I have never known a pessimist to achieve concrete results; only optimism, faith and willpower can lead to positive results.
I also believe that Europe should not be divided into a first-class and a second-class Europe, which would be profoundly wrong and would only dampen that enthusiasm, passion and desire for Europe and for common action that I have witnessed over these months of close contact with the government leaders, and not only the leaders, of the ten countries preparing to become members of the European Union.
They represent a large number of Europeans â a young, highly educated force â and a major market for us.
I believe, therefore, that we should do everything we can to ensure that the old Europe is reinvigorated by the contribution of this new Europe, which, I repeat, is enthusiastically about to join us.
The considerable achievements of the Convention and of all the countries during these six months must be enhanced and maintained: let us not forget that the Intergovernmental Conference began on 5 October and went on until 13 December.
I wish, in this respect, to reassure everyone who has spoken about what remains from the work of the ConventionÂ âÂ work that we have always sought to praise and to improve uponÂ âÂ and the work of the Conference.
Clearly the final decisions of the Conference that I inserted in the concluding statement approved unanimously by all members have not been examined carefully.
I would like, therefore, to read you a paragraph, which might perhaps seem pointless, but I feel I must underscore it: âThe Italian Presidency has conducted the Intergovernmental Conference with the intention of keeping as close as possible to the Conventionâs draft, fruit of an in-depth, democratic debate, open also to examining in a constructive spirit the proposals of each Member State in order to consider legitimate needsâ.
A second point: this hard work has led to the definition of a text on which the great majority of Member States have agreed and which will, from this point on, be considered an indisputable , thus completing a significant step forward along the road to closer integration of the countries and citizens of the enlarged Union.
This means that the States making up the Council have unanimously adopted a political commitment not to reopen those points â practically all of them â on which agreement did not exist previously.
In response to Membersâ questions, I would also like to point out that these points are all contained in the proposal presented by the Italian Presidency after the Naples Summit; this proposal is available on the Italian Presidency website along with the text of the European defence agreement reached in Brussels on the first day of the new meeting.
This is something specific, and on this basis work must now begin towards an agreement on majority decision-making, which is the fulcrum of the agreement to be reached, in order to have a Europe capable of making not only correct but also prompt decisions, in particular on the adoption of international positions.
Only in this way will we not only have a Europe capable of being a world leader alongside the other major powers, and of being a decisive factor in the development of commerce and increased well-being â as we have been committed to doing, and not least in the Millennium Declaration â but a Europe that can also be decisive in spreading democracy and exporting freedom all over the world; a Europe that, together with the other countries of the West, is committed to providing those in need with food, water, health and education.
These are all assets that cannot be guaranteed if the primary asset giving rise to all the others is not guaranteed: this is the asset of freedom, which can only be guaranteed and maintained through democratic forms of government.
I believe that this is the Westâs duty and hence Europeâs duty, and I believe that Europe will be able to achieve this result only if it can endow itself with a decision-making method that is not based on unanimity: as we saw just two days ago in Brussels, you only need one country to oppose a decision for it not to be made.
I will respond to just one of the objections that have been raised: the fact that the Italian Presidency did not have formulas for a watered down compromise on the aforementioned majority decision method.
The Italian Presidency held out for the system envisaged by the Convention: that of 50% of the States and 60% of the population.
We tried everything to persuade the countries of this, but they would not hear of it.
When we realised it would be impossible to reach an agreement, and since agreement on all the other points was possible, we resorted to temporary formulas, proposing that we should maintain the Treaty of Nice until 2014 and introduce the system envisaged by the Convention from 2015 onwards.
Some Member States said yes, others no.
So we proposed another formula that was acceptable to the Member States that had previously proved less willing: the Treaty of Nice will be applied and tested for four years.
At the end of 2008 we will decide by majority vote whether the Treaty of Nice has worked and should be maintained (if necessary, improvements will be made); or whether it is possible to go on to the double majorityÂ â of Member States and the citizens, or whether another voting system has to be found.
It was not possible to reach agreement on these proposals, which are not either watered-down compromises or otherwise but are aimed exclusively at providing Europe with a new Constitutional Treaty straight away.
Thus all participants have chosen to postpone making a decision.
This is, therefore, not the conclusion of a debate but the continuation of a search for an agreement that I am sure will soon be reached â I hope under the Irish Presidency or the subsequent Dutch Presidency.
Therefore, the Constitution project has not failed.
I would like to conclude, Mr President, with a word of optimism.
The desire of all our governments to achieve a constitutional treaty for Europe was strong and everyone felt responsible for the failure to reach a decision.
Unfortunately we did not succeed, but I believe that if we could not do it, with all the patience and determination with which we pursued these decisions to the last, nobody else could have done it either.
Everyone has granted me that.
Nevertheless, we believe that a solution on the majority vote to replace more than 50 years of unanimous voting can still be found, and the desire to find one is unanimous.
This is not a simple problem since, with the majority vote, Member States clearly give up their sovereignty on many matters, and that means it will be a very difficult birth.
This birth will have to have the support of the various national parliaments and will probably also have to be put to a referendum in the various countries.
I believe, however, that there is a unanimous desire to move in this direction.
The Intergovernmental Conferenceâs sixty days of work were fruitful.
The results, as I have said, are there and there is also the political commitment of the Council members to consider these results valid and they should no longer be open to discussion.
Then there is the work to be done on the new majority voting method, and I am convinced that, in the end, Europe will be endowed with institutions and working methods that will allow it to play an important role for the well-being, peace, freedom and democracy of its citizens and the citizens of the world.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a somewhat urgent question to put to MrÂ Prodi before he speaks.
We have just heard that Mrs de Palacio announced at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting that the Kyoto Protocol is dead.
I should like to hear from you what the Commissionâs position is on this and whether Mrs de Palacio has acted within her mandate.
Â Â  . Mrs de Palacio was expressing the well-known concerns within the Commission regarding the dangers of the non-adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and the need, therefore, to react to this situation.
The Commission wants to continue to work with Russia and the other countries that have not ratified it in order to achieve ratification.
We have not put out any other message, and I can assure you that Mrs de Palacio too is committed to the ratification of Kyoto.
Naturally, the fact that Russia is hesitating and continually putting forward alternative strategies is a serious cause for concern for us.
A very brief observation, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen: I should like to thank you all for the debate we have had, especially because it has been directed more towards the future than towards recriminations for the past, more to solving our current concerns than to blaming one another.
I should, however, like to make an observation that I think is of vital importance: be careful, ladies and gentlemen, not to throw away in a few minutes all the work done in preparation for the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference, by hastily describing proposals on which there is not yet agreement as an .
While it is true that a consensus seems to have emerged on many points, particularly at Naples, for instance on the Council presidencies, research policies and a great many other fundamental issues, this consensus does not actually exist.
Let us not deceive ourselves: it does not exist.
I refer above all to the large number of decisions on the return to unanimity, degrading not only the text of the Convention but also the Treaty of Nice; not to mention, ladies and gentlemen, the lesser role envisaged for the European Parliament in approving the budget procedures.
It is clear that the overall result of the negotiations and bilateral concessions does not mean total acceptance by everybody, not even if you look for agreement on the lowest common denominator.
It is also clear that nothing is accepted until everything is accepted, and that the conditions for acceptance will depend on our future.
Let us not, then, throw away any of the great work that has been done, but let us openly acknowledge the problems that exist.
This is the best way to solve them, and for that reason the Convention text remains our constant point of reference.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last meeting before the fifth Christmas we will have spent together, and the last of this Parliament and this Commission.
I should like to close by offering all of you and your families my best wishes for peace and happiness, and my thanks for your valuable collaboration.
Â Â  I should like to thank the President of the Commission for his best wishes, but as you know, colleagues, we have a few important votes to get through this week, including the budget vote, so do not start the holiday season prematurely!
Â Â  . The failure of the Intergovernmental Conference is to be welcomed.
The inability to reach agreement was caused by the enormous contradictions between the largest European powers and their divergent interests.
The uncompromising positions of France and Germany were unacceptable to Spain and Poland, who would have lost voting rights Nice.
It is obvious, however, that they had the more or less open support of other countries.
Although the interests of neoliberal capitalism unite the right and social democrats in Europe, the interests of individual nations, international alliances and of various economic groups do not match Franco-German interests.
One example is how the Bush Administration has shared out the contracts amongst its friends, allowing US and European companies to work in Iraq.
Not everyone gets a fair share of the plunder.
We knew that we were at a particularly critical time for European integration, because of the increasingly centralised decision-making, the more aggressive form of capitalism, and the increasingly less democratic and dangerously militaristic approach.
We know that the failure of the Brussels Summit has not solved the problems, but it has not made them any worse.
This gives new hope for the battle that we must continue to fight in order to achieve a Europe of greater social justice, development, economic and social cohesion and of peace and cooperation with the peoples of the entire world.
Â Â  . In the wake of the breakdown of IGC negotiations on the proposed draft Constitution of the European Union, I welcome the breathing space which will result.
I urge the UK Government to make maximum use of this interval to review its position on key areas of concern to Scotland.
The reference to marine biological resource conservation must be removed from the list of exclusive competences.
Furthermore, assurances are still required in relation to the protection of Scotland's offshore oil and gas reserves and the need to ensure that control and licensing powers are not conferred upon the EU.
The example set by many small nations, independently negotiating their own terms and conditions at the IGC, underlines the need for Scotland to regain her independence and therefore the full rights of participation and voting in all international negotiations.
Â Â  . â The European Summit has ended in complete failure; no Constitutional Treaty has been established.
This has not come as a total surprise, nor is it a total disaster because for the time being, Europe can continue to function in the same ramshackle way as it has done so far.
Unfortunately, though, it does illustrate once again that this way of decision-making, involving Heads of Government who have to reach consensus behind closed doors, does not work.
It is also regrettable that these days, governments have to prove their worth at home by the extent to which they manage to prevent the rest of Europe from doing something.
To my group, what remains paramount is that the Constitutional Treaty must culminate in one voting Commissioner per Member State, and in the election of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament.
This is what we defend in The Hague and in Strasbourg.
The EU becomes more efficient to the extent that it becomes more democratic, and, in achieving this, it is crucial that there should be codecision across the board for the European Parliament and that the role of national parliaments should be greatly reinforced.
Â Â  . My congratulations and heartfelt thanks go to Mr Berlusconi, whose six-month presidency of the Council started in such spectacular fashion in this Chamber in July 2003 and led to the fiasco in Brussels at the weekend.
Perhaps he really has helped to kick into touch this awful Constitution.
If only.
The one thing the European Union cannot do is take NO for an answer.
We first saw this when the Danes vetoed Maastricht.
No doubt huge pressure will be put on the plucky Poles and others to ensure a signing ceremony on 9 May 2004.
If this does not succeed, some states will press ahead and a two-speed EU will emerge.
Some in my country might be happy with life in the slow lane. But to me, it just prolongs the agony and keeps us heading in the wrong direction.
Increasingly, the peoples of Europe are saying 'Let us go in the opposite direction'.
Â Â  I should like to record today a moment that, I believe, is significant in the lifetime of this Parliament.
It relates to the long negotiations we have had since the Seville European Council, between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the issue of better lawmaking.
On behalf of Parliament, I should like to thank four colleagues from our House who led this work and who made substantial contributions: Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Clegg.
Thanks to the leadership of Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the Danish, Greek and Italian presidencies, we are now in a position to sign a draft interinstitutional agreement today.
The challenge of this agreement was to improve the quality of lawmaking in the Union through a greater focus on relevance, transparency, coordination and effective transposition by Member States.
What we sign today, by way of an is an agreement on greater transparency, which Parliament introduced.
It means in particular that the Council, in its political dialogue with Parliament and its committees, will engage at all stages of the legislative process in a transparent dialogue with Parliament.
Secondly, the three institutions will seek collectively to programme our legislative workload.
Thirdly, the recourse to instruments other than EU legislation, where appropriate â in other words, so-called 'light-touch regulation' â must be subject to parliamentary control and must be under full conditions of transparency.
This agreement insists that before any proposal is launched, and in a public way, there should be pre-consultation.
This agreement insists that there must be impact assessment of legislative proposals, including the amendments of this House, in terms of effects on employment, environment and competitiveness.
The agreement insists on the effective monitoring of the transposition of EU law by Member States and effective enforcement.
I believe our delegation succeeded in bringing Parliamentary scrutiny and transparency into this process in a real way.
The agreement is a significant step forward.
On behalf of Parliament I want to say that we, as an institution, will apply this agreement fully and firmly.
It is an important step forward which anticipates perhaps some of the areas to be covered in a future constitution.
I should like now to invite the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, to step forward with me for a signing ceremony.
I also invite our Parliamentary colleagues â Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Clegg â to join us, along with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio and â should he like to do so â Mr Berlusconi, for a family photograph.
(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, the announcement by Mr Cox is very important for Members of the European Parliament in one particular regard.
Members will have noticed that he mentioned the idea of impact assessments on amendments proposed by Members of this Parliament.
That is a very good idea, but it will come into operation as of January 2004.
What we need to know is who is going to do these impact assessments and how the system will work.
I invite the President to set up a working party which must, I suspect, work over the Christmas period to produce some proposals as to how this system will work.
Having had this great signing ceremony, it is up to us to make the agreement work.
Â Â  I am informed by the services, Mrs Jackson, that the process will come into place gradually.
There is nothing there at the present time.
However, your comments will be passed to the President of Parliament so that he is fully aware of the position and wishes of this House.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is a vote on two questions concerning parliamentary immunity.
I think it is right that our Assembly should allow the Members in question to address the full Assembly in the same way as they are able to do in committee.
It seems to me that, in institutions that are rightly very concerned about rights of defence, that would be a natural guarantee and I will shortly be lodging with the competent committee a proposal to amend the rules to that effect.
Â Â  Your wish is well within the Rules, MrÂ Gollnisch.
I should like to point out, however, that we have had the debate on this matter: we are now dealing with the vote.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, please do not object if I speak now, since we have no hesitation is losing five minutes for a photograph to be taken, one where there was no gender mainstreaming, although there was at least one Luxembourger, the usher.
You can therefore easily give me two minutes.
Mr President, since 1993, when the internal market became operational and border controls were abolished, the Customs authorities have ceased to be a source of basic statistical information on the trading of goods between Member States, but such information is still needed, and that is why the system known as Intrastat was set up.
It could have celebrated its tenth anniversary this year, but the people at Eurostat are at present not in a celebratory mood.
If, though, the changes over the past few years are to be taken into account, then the 1991 Regulation urgently needs to be adapted; the proposal put before us by the Commission is a good one, and one that we can largely accept.
Above all else, both its text and its rules have become simpler and more comprehensible.
The scope has been more clearly delimited, and that is something that we do not always see.
The Member States have been left more room for manoeuvre where the collection of statistics is concerned.
Finally, we can welcome the way in which the Commissionâs text takes account of the SLIM programme in lessening the burden on firms.
Despite this, I tabled a handful of amendments, which were adopted unanimously, and I might add that I did this with the agreement of the Italian Presidency of the Council.
For a start, the threshold at which firms are exempted from providing information is raised by 1%, which will allow thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises to cut costs without the quality of statistics being adversely affected.
Another amendment is aimed at excluding goods which are imported into a Member State only temporarily but without being altered there.
Such would, for example, be the case if I were to get married and hire my wedding dress in a neighbouring country, and then take it back there. That would not be included in the statistics.
Â Â  Thank you very much Mrs Lulling!
You always keep the House up to speed.
I am sure we are much better informed on this matter now.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment requires clarification.
I personally am in favour of its substance, and, like the majority in this House, I also voted in favour of it at first reading stage, but the Council could not be persuaded to accept it.
We have just voted on a compromise with the Council.
Amendment No 38 is not part of the compromise package agreed with the Council, but Amendment No 58 is, and replaces it.
I believe that if we vote in favour of Amendment No 58, we will be making it possible for the directive to be adopted without a conciliation procedure.
That does not mean that Parliament has changed its mind in this matter; indeed, we made this clear not only at first reading but also, repeatedly, on other occasions.
In this procedure, though, we should not insist on the amendment.
Somebody asked me, âHow, if you have principles, can you compromise on such important issues?â
I believe that Europe demands compromises of us in matters of policy in order that we may make progress.
I do not believe that politics should be left to people who have no principles. That is why I ask you to vote against Amendment No 38 and in favour of Amendment No 58.
Â Â  . â I am taking the floor to thank Parliament, and particularly the rapporteur MrÂ Lehne and all the committee members, for this important vote which at last gives us a European rule on takeover bids.
We have been trying to achieve this result for 15 years.
At last we have succeeded.
It is an important step towards unifying the markets and providing greater efficiency.
It is the outcome of hard work, and I should like to express the Presidencyâs satisfaction.
Â Â  . I am supposed to say the following: I regret the outcome of the vote.
I have taken note of the position expressed by a majority of Members.
In accordance with the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission, I will raise the issue in the College of Commissioners in order to consider carefully the Commission's position under these circumstances.
The Commission will, in due course and in an appropriate way, inform Parliament of the outcome of these considerations.
Have a nice lunch!
Â Â  Commissioner, I can only assume that means you are not withdrawing the text.
(1)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . As has been stated many times on this matter, it is crucial to undertake a thorough streamlining of Community law, in order to make it more accessible and understandable to the citizens.
This idea is all the more relevant in the context of the Cohesion Fund, which involves various actors, both institutional and private.
It is only by simplifying the bureaucracy, which is directly linked to the intelligibility of legislative texts, that the aims of these mechanisms will be effectively served.
Consequently, the clarity and transparency of Community law also depend on codifying legislation that has been amended many times â legislation that has, in the case in question, been preceded by consolidation in all the official languages of the European Union.
This proposal for codification therefore warrants my applause and full support.
Â Â  .
Milk is a product of strategic importance to the economy of the Azores, due to the economic activity and jobs that it creates, accounting for 80% of regional gross agricultural product and 25% of national milk production and because it provides income for around 5Â 000 highly productive milk producers.
Since the 1999/2000 season, the level of production has reached 500Â 000 tonnes, and even attained around 523Â 000 tonnes in the 2002/2003 season, which would have led, if the derogations had not been secured, to producers having to pay supplementary levies for exceeding their quota, causing many to go bankrupt.
Given the specific characteristics of the Azores, the milk quota for this area needs to be increased, particularly because there are no viable economic alternatives in this outlying region.
The agreement reached at the Luxembourg Agriculture Council of 26Â June 2003 still fails to meet the Azoresâ needs.
The additional quota of 50Â 000 tonnes from 2005/2006 to 2014/2015 and the derogation from the 23Â 000-tonne exemption threshold for supplementary levies are not enough.
The fairest thing to do would be to turn this exemption into a quota and guarantee its permanence.
The Portuguese Government acknowledged the need to increase the quota by 100 000 tonnes, but deplorably accepted considerably less.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because I believe that account must be taken of the special circumstances and needs of this beautiful Portuguese island region â the Autonomous Region of the Azores â where the milk sector plays a crucially important role.
The process of stabilising the milk and dairy products market must be achieved whilst ensuring that Azorean farmers have a reasonable amount of time in which to adapt to the constraints imposed by the regulatory instruments and that their traditions and way of life are respected, in a broad framework of understanding for the specific problems arising from their location in an outlying region.
Because I am aware of the reality of the situation in the Azores, I believe it is crucial to allocate to this region a supplementary quota and temporarily to extend this derogative system because, in coordination with national and regional authorities, the Union must promote the dissemination and adoption both of viable alternative forms of production and of other ways of keeping farmland profitable without condemning it to abandonment and desertification, for the sake of the much-trumpeted and rarely observed economic and social cohesion.
Without this effort, the unemployment, loss of character and the (e)migration that result from the potential decline in the milk sector could threaten the Azores, as has already happened, specifically at the time of the âorange crisisâ, which had a devastating effect on the archipelago in the nineteenth century.
Â Â  . We voted against the Daul report on the 3% reduction in the tobacco harvest premium in order to fund the Community Tobacco Fund, because this retention will reduce even further the already miserly incomes of the poor tobacco producers, especially in Greece, in order to promote research into how tobacco farmers can diversify into other crops or professions.
In brief, they are asking tobacco producers to uproot and to pay for the privilege.
The proposal for the Community Tobacco Fund is in keeping with the imminent reform of the regulation, which aims to shrink tobacco farming until it no longer exists.
However, any such move would spell ruin for tobacco-producing countries such as Greece, because the areas farmed with tobacco are not suitable for other crops, in that they are mainly located in barren mountain areas and are almost the only form of employment and method of survival available to the people who live there.
In 2005, when the new reform of the CAP will apply, the sums which the Fund will have collected will be enormous and will be used to deceive and uproot tobacco producers Â· at their own expense.
At the same time, they will support the American tobacco multinationals, which supply 70% of the tobacco consumed in the ÎU.
The hypocrisy and cynicism of the ÎU have reached their zenith in the name of a senseless anti-tobacco offensive, not a responsible anti-smoking campaign, which we support.
Â Â  . I welcome the renewal of the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America, which was adopted by the Council in its decision of 13 October 1998, and which entered into force on 14Â October 1998.
Because I am aware of the common heritage and values that bind us, I have stated the importance of the transatlantic relationship and the need for the Union to maintain and improve its partnership with the USA.
This agreement, the implementation of which already demonstrates clear mutual benefits in the field of science and technology, is a step closer towards achieving this.
In the hope that this agreement becomes even more advantageous to both parties, which is a very real possibility, particularly if its existence is given more publicity and if awareness of it is raised, I naturally voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . I support this proposal, and the work carried out by the rapporteur, MrÂ Pirker, and I congratulate the Council, which took account of most of the proposals tabled by the European Parliament at first reading.
This initiative is intended to turn Directive 92/109 into a regulation, so as to enable the legislation to be simplified, making it easier to apply in a uniform way and at the same time.
This has become even more relevant with the enlargement of the Union, because otherwise, for every amendment tabled to this Directive or to its annexes, national implementing measures would have to be established in 25 Member States.
This is, therefore, an attempt to achieve the harmonised monitoring of the trade in drug precursors and to prevent their being diverted into the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs.
The intention is also to facilitate legitimate trade in precursors within the internal market, used for legal and legitimate purposes, such as the manufacture of medicines.
Given the growing increase in the production of and trade in synthetic drugs, effective and rigorous monitoring of the manufacture and marketing of these substances must be set up, as they can be diverted to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
At the same time, there must be close cooperation between the competent authorities and the economic operators in the chemicals industry.
Â Â  . Given the increased consumption of synthetic drugs, I believe that the measures that have been taken represent a significant step forward for the flexible and effective monitoring of many types of precursors available in the Community area in large quantities, thereby preventing their illicit use.
The recommended simplification of legislation, which seeks to remedy shortcomings in the current system, could facilitate improvements in monitoring and control, which would mean progress in the fight against drugs.
Similarly, and given that these substances are not used exclusively in the illicit manufacture of drugs, but also for legal purposes, we must ensure closer cooperation between the industry and the public authorities.
I voted in favour because I believe that there has been a significant improvement between the first and second readings, which is duly reflected in the unanimous vote that the latter received in the committee.
We Moderates believe that cultural policy is not best conducted at EU level.
Culture is a part of our society that operates best without political interference.
We are therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  . The âCulture 2000â programme was set up to provide a single funding and programming instrument in the field of cultural cooperation in the European Union, replacing existing sectoral programmes, namely Rafael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope.
Culture 2000 was given around EURÂ 167Â million and will end on 31Â December 2004.
The new framework programme for Culture is not due to start until the beginning of 2007.
The Commission plans to extend the current programme to 2005 and 2006 in order to ensure continuity in the actions that have been undertaken, which we believe is a positive step and we consequently voted in favour of this proposal.
We feel, however, that the sum allocated to this single instrument is clearly insufficient to meet the needs in the field of cultural cooperation.
The sum proposed for 2005 and 2006, of around EURÂ 67Â million, is particularly low, given that enlargement will have taken place.
An evaluation of the impact of the current programme is becoming crucial because, as the Commission admits, some changes will have to be made.
Examples are: greater support for preserving and restoring cultural heritage of European interest that is considered to be cultural heritage by UNESCO; greater participation and support for cultural cooperation initiatives by local associations and institutions, greater support for acquiring cultural equipment by local associations.
Â Â  . We should support the Commission proposal to extend the Culture 2000 programme, which combines the three previous cultural cooperation programmes, namely, Rafael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope, creating a single funding and planning instrument in the field of cultural cooperation.
This framework programme seeks to establish a common cultural space, by promoting cultural dialogue and knowledge of the history, creation, and dissemination of culture and the mobility of artists and their works, Europeâs cultural heritage, new forms of cultural expression and the socio-economic role of culture.
Bearing in mind the consolidation of the European project â something we all wish to see â I would highlight the usefulness of this intercultural dialogue and the need to maintain, promote and disseminate the cultural diversity of the Member States, which constitutes one of the Unionâs greatest assets.
When implementing a policy of cultural cooperation we must, therefore, shun narrow-mindedness, the cultural âmonologueâ and, above all, historical revisionism in the light of utopian projects.
I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . The vote on the discharge in respect of the Convention budget provides an opportunity to point out that, despite the praise lavished on it by the federalists, that body was largely responsible for the final deadlock in the Brussels Council on the European Constitution.
First of all, its membership did not at all reflect European public opinion, since the separatists were hardly represented.
Gisela Stuart, the British representative who was nevertheless a member of its Praesidium, recently referred to it as a âself-selected eliteâ.
Its conclusions were not inspired by a consensus at all.
On the contrary, they were manipulated by the European institutions.
Countries or individuals that did not agree were marginalised in accordance with ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaingâs formula that âconsensus is less that unanimity but more than the majorityâ.
In those surroundings, a microclimate developed, a kind of infectious euro-enthusiasm driven by the federalists; it caused many members to lose sight of their national positions and interests and they had their revenge later.
Finally, to completely rewrite the treaties was over-ambitious and at the last moment it became evident that a good number of problems had not been dealt with properly.
Â Â  â The report deals with the procedure for adopting derogations concerning the creation of a common system of value added tax.
If the European institutions were concerned about the interests of the majority of the public then they would standardise VAT by proposing to abolish it, which would simplify the procedure at the same time.
Of course, though, the European institutions, like the individual States, chiefly want to exempt private companies and the privileged social classes from the tax burden by making the public, including the poorest people, bear the bulk of it.
Indirect taxation, in particular VAT, serves to do this.
It is especially unfair because, since it is not proportional to income, then it hits the poor harder than the rich.
We obviously voted against the report.
Â Â  . The apparent aim of this proposal for a directive is to prevent the double taxation of company profits, to be precise, ensuring that profits taxed and paid as dividends by a subsidiary to its parent company are not taxed twice.
In fact, however, the proposal seeks to resolve the âdisadvantageâ in taxation between multinational groups and national groups, thereby responding to requests from the âbusiness communityâ.
The proposalâs base consequently seeks to extend the directiveâs scope to cover more types of company and to lower the minimum participation threshold from 25% to 10% for one company to be considered the parent and the other as its subsidiary, with the aim of guaranteeing exemptions, for example, from deduction at source.
The rapporteur, who would prefer there to be no threshold, suggests one of 5%, which is lower than the one proposed by the Commission.
In other words, the issue at stake is not so much double taxation, but one of providing the legal means for multinational groups to manage their tax benefits, enabling them to use cross-border exemptions and deductions actually to reduce tax on their profits, thereby increasing the âlegalâ possibilities of tax evasion, which is not acceptable.
Portugal is one of three countries where the threshold stands at around 25%, which means that this directive will increase pressure for amending arrangements that apply to national groups.
Â Â  . The proposal for a directive on high standards of quality and safety in connection with human tissues and cells fills a huge gap in Community legislation to safeguard a high level of quality and safety for tissues and cells intended for transplants or any other uses which need to be accurately defined.
Similarly, it will result in comparable levels of quality and safety in all the Member States.
On the basis of the positions of my group, the GUE/NGL, I voted against block Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 and Amendment No 38 and I voted in favour of block Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 58.
The European Parliament should not restrict the operational breadth of the directive for reasons of conservatism but should safeguard high levels of safety and quality.
Â Â  . The main thrust of the report is to advocate the non-commercialisation of human tissue and human cells, preventing the human body or its parts from becoming a source of financial gain, ensuring that tissue and cells are not collected for the purpose of making a profit.
This would provide a guarantee that such tissue and cells are donated, that the donation is voluntary and unpaid (as in the case of transplants) and cannot be paid for.
This means combating trafficking and the huge profits of the health-related industries and groups involved in such tissue and cells.
We must combat the attitude that life can be turned into a commodity, which means that transparent criteria and rules are needed, without jeopardising scientific research for therapeutic purposes.
This is why my group supported the compromise solution that was voted for.
Â Â  . â The lifting of the anonymity of sperm donors is the least controversial point in this proposal.
The correction of defects and injuries of the human body by means of tissues and cells, on the other hand, remains a sensitive issue.
There is, quite rightly, strong opposition to the creation of children with a view to having embryos available, by means of abortion, as suppliers of human repair material, and an equally justified aversion to commercial exploitation, whereby people sell material from their body as a means of making money, as has been the case for a long time with blood donors in America.
I support rules that are intended to prevent human material being obtained by these means, but I do not approve of attempts to make the rules stricter, so that research of stem cells, for example, is banned.
If it transpires that by means of stem cells, defects and injuries of the human body can be corrected, then it is short-sighted to rule out this alternative in advance.
The same criteria should apply to organ transplantation, for which a separate arrangement is underway.
I respect the view that man should not try to improve on Godâs creation, but if we follow this line consistently, then some elements of existing health care also become illegal.
Â Â  . It is impossible to set standards for quality and safety on an issue as sensitive as human tissue and cells, in which the main concern is to ensure a high level of health protection, without laying down some ethical standards at the same time.
The absolute need for ethical standards should not be questioned, and furthermore, as the rapporteur rightly states in his explanatory statement, many of the amendments containing ethical considerations that have been tabled seek precisely to guarantee a minimum level of health protection.
Consequently, I do not believe that the legal basis set out in ArticleÂ 152 of the Treaty is breached by tabling a certain type of amendment, such as the voluntary and unpaid donation of human tissue and cells, or the ban on making the human body or its parts a source of financial gain.
Unless the common position takes account of these important aspects outlined by the European Parliament at first reading, it will be very hard to accept.
Nevertheless, as I am aware that this directive is of the utmost importance, I supported the compromise that was achieved, which is also supported by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, of which I am a Member.
Although this is not a perfect text for this issue, it sets a reasonable level of health protection and achieves a balance that is better than nothing.
Â Â  . I voted for this report and I am glad that a large majority of Parliament did the same.
Thanks to the compromises negotiated with the Council and Commission, everything is ready for this directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells to be quickly adopted and implemented.
This is excellent news for the fight against a number of incurable diseases, which can increasingly be treated by transplanting human cells and tissues, and it gives new hope to many of our fellow citizens.
There does of course need to be transparent and strict regulations for such therapeutic practices and medical research both in order to minimise the risks and to ensure that ethical principles are followed.
The result obtained is quite satisfactory in this respect.
The principle of voluntary and unpaid donation is therefore established.
The principle that the human body is not to be treated as a commodity is also recognised, avoiding it being regarded merely as a source of financial gain.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are too many Members in the Chamber.
I am not used to giving my explanation of vote with so many members present.
If you want us to wait until everyone leaves, I am happy to wait.
Otherwise, I shall begin to give my explanation of vote.
Â Â  Mr Fatuzzo, the order of the House requires me to call you now.
It seems you have a larger audience now than you sometimes might have had in the past!
Â Â  â Mr President. I voted in favour of Mr Lehneâs proposal on takeover bids, but I thought about savers, both pensioners and those who are not pensioners, who, I am sorry to say, have not been protected, in the case of Argentinian debts, from huge losses in their savings and from money invested in Argentinian bonds.
This has led to the impoverishment of a large number of pensioners, workers and citizens and I hope the European Union takes steps to ensure that no similar situations occur and intervenes to tackle problems affecting citizens of all European Member States who placed their trust in their governmentsâ controls.
Â Â  The right of ownership is a fundamental prerequisite of the market economy.
The fundamental prerequisite of the control that will take place though the directive on takeover bids must be respect for the right of ownership.
For many years in Sweden, we have had a system that works, involving a division into A and B shares. The control to be carried out must provide an opportunity to retain this system.
Â Â  . After years of discussion concerning harmonisation of the law in respect of takeover bids in Europe, we have finally reached the only common sense conclusion: that it is better not to seek harmonisation on the sensitive points, but to allow States the freedom to choose the system that best suits their economic and cultural context.
What a lot of time has been lost in getting there!
In particular, we support the compromise that was found on defensive measures against hostile takeover bids. Some Member States will be able to allow boards room for manoeuvre, others will leave it solely to the general meeting of shareholders.
Let us hope that this provisional compromise will become the norm: it in fact foreshadows a more pragmatic and less standardising view of the European market, which in our view is the right one.
We regret, however, that this compromise did not include the question of âgolden sharesâ or in French, which some States use to maintain a public interest in large privatised enterprises, especially when there is a risk of foreign takeovers.
The Commission and the Court of Justice are fiercely against the system, but it affords protection and it should be given greater legitimacy.
Â Â  â In the case of takeover bids, some Members would like staff representatives of the businesses concerned to be better informed than this directive provides for them to be.
So be it, but why then does one of these amendments simultaneously propose the acceptance of âconfidentiality clausesâ, which in the end means restricting information to certain delegates and denying it to the workforce as a whole?
In addition, even if these amendments were adopted, that would not protect workers at all from the tragic consequences of buyouts, in particular, mass redundancies under the pretext of restructuring.
European authorities are concerned with bringing some degree of unity to this jungle-like system, as this House is doing regarding takeover bids.
They are, however, wildly scorning those who, year after year, takeover bid or not, find themselves in ever greater numbers back on the streets because reducing the workforce, and therefore the salaried masses, is one of the ways in which those who possess capital can increase the price of their shares on the Stock Exchange.
Only a ban on mass redundancies could protect workers from the tragic consequences of takeover bids for jobs.
We voted against this report.
Â Â  .
For over a decade now, we have been debating the takeover directive, the first version of which, as we know, was unable to get over the last hurdle in this House.
I am glad that, thanks to the negotiations involving the Council and our rapporteur Mr Lehne, the adoption of this important text is now, at last, within our reach.
The Portuguese-Italian compromise arrived at in the Council and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs strikes me as the best possible result in a complex situation.
Stipulating the Europe-wide applicability of Articles 9 and 11 whilst allowing the Member States the option of not making them binding on their businesses, although not ideal, is the only compromise possible, to which the alternative would be not having a directive at all, and nobody wants that.
A small step in the right direction is always better than marking time on the spot for years.
I would argue that there are a few highly strategic areas in which the Member States should be accorded special rights, which they would be entitled to use in the event of takeovers.
The report before us indirectly covers the possibility of the Member States availing themselves of the right already referred to, and also solves the specifically Scandinavian problem with securities with multiple voting rights without jeopardising the important level playing field, which guarantees enterprises equal opportunities.
Â Â  . Although I have voted in favour of the directive, I have great difficulty with it and I have been tempted to vote against.
A few elements, such as the compulsory bid as a means of protecting minority shareholders, constitute a slight improvement.
After years of political tug-of-war, the legislative proposal has degenerated into a watered-down compromise.
In fact, the term 'directive' is not even justified; 'empty shell' would be a more accurate label.
The directive's original goal, namely to create equal conditions for company takeovers across the entire EU, has been completely eroded away.
Since it is up to Member States to decide whether they want to transpose the directive into national legislation, defensive mechanisms in the EU will continue to form a barrier to the free movement of capital.
As a result, the internal market's desperately-needed dynamism is under-used.
The fact that the Council and Parliament have accepted this proposal demonstrates once again that national interests still prevail over enhancing the competitive capacity of the EU as a whole.
With this, some of Europe's powerlessness is once again exposed in a painful manner.
I have from the very outset pleaded in favour of a complete breakthrough rule.
Only a complete breakthrough rule guarantees a fair internal market for takeovers, which is of crucial importance for optimising the EU's competitive position compared to the rest of the world.
This is also the view of all the Members belonging to the VVD, the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy.
Â Â  . The EPLP is disappointed that additional amendments to strengthen information and consultation provisions in the directive were narrowly defeated by a PPE and Liberal led coalition.
The EPLP supported amendments affording employees more extensive rights of information and consultation during the bid process.
Nonetheless, we accept that this directive does represent an improvement for employees on information and consultation, compared with the July 2001 directive.
Articles 6, 9 and 13 represent an improvement on employees' rights.
Indeed the original Commission proposal provided that the provisions of the information and consultation directive would be without prejudice to the takeovers directive, now it is explicit that the takeover directive is without prejudice to the information and consultation directive.
For the EPLP, it comes down to question of political judgement: Is it better to have no directive thus allowing the continuation of an unregulated market for takeovers, with no disclosure or transparency of corporate structures and little or no guarantee of employees' rights to information and consultation, or, is it better to vote in favour of a directive allowing substantial progress on creating a open, transparent framework for takeovers, introducing new standards to guarantee both employees' and investors rights?
We voted for the latter.
Â Â  . â In the past, companies were meant to last.
Despite conflicts of interest, entrepreneurs and workers agreed that their companies would provide jobs for future generations.
The entrepreneur who had founded the companies saw this as his lifeâs work.
He believed in his product and in his contribution to progress for his town or region.
For the workers, it was the place that provided them with a source of income and brought them and their colleagues together.
More say in the business and a better income were the future.
These days, companies are commodities.
They are bought, closed down or plundered to release the capital for activities that yield more profits for the owners.
Anonymous international forces are quick to call an end to all the old certainties.
Legislation about takeovers can serve very different goals, one of which is to protect the employees and their permanent living environments, while another is to facilitate the trade in companies in order to yield maximum benefit for their shareholders.
These two goals are not very compatible.
This is why those who claim that the fact that a directive on takeover bids is being introduced is more important than its content are wrong.
As in 2001, I am once again voting for everything that contributes to a directive of the former kind and against everything that leads to one of the latter.
Â Â  . On 4Â July 2001, I took part in the Conciliation Committee meeting on this matter, at which the agreement between the EP and the Council was blocked.
At the time, the issue at stake was that of forcing the management boards of companies subject to a takeover bid to refrain from adopting defensive measures against the offer or company.
Today, the European Parliament has basically adopted a set of rules in this field which mean that Member States and companies will have the option â but not the obligation â to make these defensive measures illegal unless they have been formally approved at a general shareholders meeting.
This new wording, designed to protect minority shareholders in the event of a takeover bid and which unblocks this issue, which is of importance to company law and to international economic and financial life, leads me to consider that this report warrants my favourable vote.
Â Â  . This proposal seeks to integrate European markets, to harmonise conditions for company restructuring, to strengthen the legal certainty of cross-border takeover bids in the interest of all concerned and to ensure protection for minority shareholders in the course of such transactions, thus increasing the transparency of defensive structures and mechanisms.
This is the third proposal for a Directive and I have given it my support because what we are now seeing is the outcome of overcoming many obstacles and heated debates, in the context of institutional cooperation and consultation, which I welcome.
In fact, strengthening the internal market and the vitality of European competitiveness â particularly in relation to the USA â will lead to gradual improvements in our own financial services, which promote a healthy competitive environment between European operators, in a context of fairness, transparency and sustainable growth.
I also believe that the main obstacle to this directiveâs adoption in 1989 and 1996 â the effect of takeover bids on employment and their social repercussions in general â must remain at the heart of regulatory concerns.
This is the only way of understanding the scale of the Unionâs fight to achieve real âCorporate Social Responsibilityâ.
This is furthermore the only way we will attain the goals of economic dynamism and competitiveness, which are intended to create more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Â Â  I have chosen to vote against the report and the proposal for a directive, which was however adopted by 325 votes, with 221 votes against and 7 abstentions.
A certain harmonisation of the EU countriesâ rules governing the financial markets may be needed in order to favour the internal market and, thus, growth. The directive on takeover bids is, however, along the wrong lines.
If the directive is adopted, the Swedish system of A and B shares will continue as an exception.
The directive is to be reviewed after five years, with an obvious risk of the Swedish system again being brought into question and abolished once and for all.
The system of A and B shares is open and non-discriminatory and based upon purchasing agreements freely entered into.
There is no evidence for assertions to the effect that the system involving differentiated vote values impedes company takeovers.
A more principled objection is that forms of ownership should not be decided upon at EU level, nor the right of ownership brought into question nor long-term shareholder liability in a company impaired.
I have also voted in favour of amendments aimed at giving company employees an opportunity to give their views of a takeover bid through having the companyâs board consult their representatives.
Â Â  . I voted against this directive because three crucial amendments were rejected that were aimed at ensuring that the workers of both the bidding company and the target company were fully informed and consulted in good time in the event of a takeover bid.
Some claim this is already guaranteed by other directives and that there is therefore no point in dealing with the matter in this directive.
That view is shared by Commissioner Bolkestein.
I am not convinced and it is hard to understand why the introduction of a minimum amount of social dialogue into this directive should meet with such opposition.
But I do agree entirely with Mr Bolkestein that this directive, as it has been adopted with the Commissionâs and the Councilâs agreement, is not a social directive, it is even a clearly antisocial directive!
After more than 15 years of debates, I regret to note, like the ESC, that neither the Council, nor the Commission, nor the majority of Parliament have been able to understand something so simple and obvious as that workers are just as important as shareholders and that they have in particular the right to be informed and consulted over mergers.
It is a sad day for the European social model.
Â Â  â Mr President, this document refers to VAT, value added tax, on postage stamps.
I had a vision: it was the year 2013 and I was still a Member of this Parliament and Mr Schmidt was again presenting a report on stamps.
In the future, however, increasingly fewer European citizens used â I am speaking as if the year were 2017 â postage stamps and the ordinary postal services so Mr Schmidtâs directive made provision for financing people who write letters by paying them the postage on their correspondence.
I mean to say, Mr President, that postage stamps and postal services are becoming so rare that letters will become antiques, just like vintage motor cars.
That is my last statement today; indeed it is my last statement of 2003.
Thank you and .
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
I think you have brought the House to silence with your remarks.
Â Â  . I do not agree that, in the name of competition between state and private services provided in the postal sector, we should be led to increase the cost of postal services to citizens and to a complete denial of the utility function of state post offices.
That is why I too, like the whole of the GUE/NGL Group, voted against the amendments by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the proposal as a whole.
Â Â  . The Liberal Democrat delegation did not vote with the rest of the ELDR Group on the Schmidt report.
We voted against Amendments Nos 1 to 13 and the proposal, as we wished the proposal in its current form to be withdrawn.
Our reason for doing so is that we believe VAT on postal services, especially in respect of securing a universal service for packages below two kilogrammes, is a matter best left to national governments under the principle of subsidiarity.
However, we remain open to considering future proposals aimed at ensuring greater competition.
Â Â  . â The report concerns itself only with those distortions of competition that are liable to be detrimental to the private enterprises that are taking over the postal sector; in no way does it reflect the interests either of users or of postal workers.
For over a century, the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability.
The efficient running of public services, and of the postal services in particular, has for some considerable time been one of the most reliable indicators of a countryâs level of development, and, dare I say it, of its level of civilisation.
It was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role; it was because they did not exist to be profit-making but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and criss-crossed the land with a dense network of post offices.
Such is the progress that both the nation-states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing.
We are absolutely opposed to this exercise in the destruction of public services, which is both regressive and socially unjust.
To this fundamental reason for voting against this report, we would add another, namely that we are opposed to VAT and hence to its being applied, as also to the price increases that it will entail, and from which users on lower incomes will suffer most.
Â Â  . In the present European context, especially with regard to the problems raised by taxation and indirect taxation in particular, I cannot accept the Commissionâs proposal to remove the VAT exemption for postal services.
How can such a proposal be made, knowing that the 1977 sixth directive has still not been updated, that the problems of harmonising VAT rates persist, and that an impact assessment has still not been made of liberalisation in the postal sector?
Regardless of the matter of VAT liability, how are we to believe in healthy competition to the sole benefit of users in the Member States when the Commission proposes an optional reduced rate for conventional postal services, which can only highlight the technical problems relating to weight and the disparities in rates between Member States.
Once again, the Commission is putting the cart before the horse and trying to persuade us by autosuggestion. Well, we are not stupid and we reject this text.
Â Â  . This Commission proposal seeks to remove VAT exemption for postal services, which has been in place since the sixth directive on VAT of 1977.
The Commission is thereby seeking to achieve two things: to continue the process of establishing a single VAT system and to contribute to the current process of liberalising postal services at EU level, as recommended in directive 2002/39/EC.
Consequently, as a result of this process of gradual liberalisation which I reject because this undermines public service and its universal scope the effect of removing this exemption, which would oblige public operators to charge VAT at the full rate, would be higher costs for the services provided, especially for private individuals and would encourage the subcontracting of external services.
I therefore agree with the recommendation by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject this Commission proposal, even though this is not the position held by the rapporteur.
Consequently, I welcome the rejection of the proposals for amendment tabled by the rapporteur himself, with the support of his group and of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which sought a compromise that would make it possible to adopt this proposal for a directive.
Â Â  . I opposed the Commission's proposal to harmonise VAT between state postal services like the Royal Mail and private sector delivery services.
The Commissionâs bad timing was not lost on Scotland with the debate taking place in arguably the busiest week for postal services across Europe and I am glad it got the knock-back it deserved.
It is often rightly assumed and argued that many of us now have access to e-mail and other communications technology and that the cost of postage stamps is irrelevant.
However, many pensioners and low-income households still depend on reliable and affordable postal services.
It would be their pockets which would be hit hardest if VAT was put onto the price of a stamp.
I call upon the Commission to reflect on this and shelve the proposal.
Â Â  That concludes the explications of vote.
(2)
Â Â  Mr President, at the start of the part-session yesterday, I wanted to make a proposal and I asked for the floor.
However, I was not given it due to a lack of time.
I wish to make that proposal now.
Would that be possible?
Â Â  I am afraid that I cannot give you the floor, Mr Patakis, because you were not originally given the floor, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I cannot give it to you now.
Â Â  Can you tell me, as you do not now know, if I will have the opportunity to express my position during this part-session, and if so when?
Â Â  I will pass on your request, Mr Patakis, and I am sure we will find a way for you to take the floor.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0473/2003) by Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the year 2004 as modified by the Council (all sections)
(11357/2003 C5-0600/2003 2003/2001(BUD) 2003/2002(BUD))
and Letters of Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3/2004
(14837/2003 C5-0570/2003, 14838/2003 C5-0571/2003, 14839/2003 C5-0572/2003)
to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004
Section I European Parliament
Section II â Council
Section III â Commission
Section IV Court of Justice
Section V Court of Auditors
Section VI Economic and Social Committee
Section VII Committee of the Regions
Section VIII(A) European Ombudsman
Section VII(B) European Data Protection Supervisor
Â Â  . â Mr President, since the last time we discussed the budget in this House, significant progress has been made, particularly following the joint meeting between the Council, Commission and Parliament on 24 November.
Finally, an agreement has been reached about the funding of Iraqâs reconstruction.
From the 2004 budget, EURÂ 95Â million will be taken from the flexibility reserve and EURÂ 65 million from Heading 4.
The fact that it was Heading 4 means that cuts will need to be made in other lines and that the lines by which some groups set great store have lost some of their importance.
However, I welcome the fact that there is an agreement.
We have also reached agreement about the increase in payment appropriations: 2.3% compared to the 2003 budget.
This means that, irrespective of whether 15 or 25 Member States are involved, in 2004, we will in all probability spend 0.98% of the gross national income.
I am not certain whether everyone knows this, but that is the lowest percentage since 1990, and as far as that is concerned, we fully comply with the objectives which we set ourselves at the beginning of this year in the directives for the 2004 budget, namely to draft an economical budget.
There is also agreement about common foreign and security policy.
A Police Mission can be sent to the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia.
We hope that with this agreement, the provision of information to the Parliament will also improve, for that is of extreme importance to us.
All praise goes to Mr BÃ¶ge and Mr Colom i Naval for the agreement on the programmes under codecision, particularly the programmes following enlargement.
That is, in my view, quite a feat because in future, it will considerably simplify decision-making and budgeting.
The same compliment can be made to Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop and to the rapporteurs of the various specialised committees for the agreement that has been reached on subsidies.
Finally, there is the result of the most recent conciliation meeting.
Not only will we save about one billion on agricultural expenditure but the Council of Ministers has also adopted Parliamentâs priorities in agriculture.
Enlargement was the single most important element in the 2004 Budget, and I am therefore delighted to be able to announce that Parliament has agreed to the majority of applications of new Commission posts.
We will put 25 posts in reserve.
We want the Commission to comply with certain other conditions, but I think that the Commission has received most of the posts it had requested.
An important initiative has also been taken in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises.
In our opinion, the economy in the new countries and in the old Member States can ideally be boosted by increasing the opportunities for small and medium-size businesses.
This is also something which we managed to secure via this budget: considerably more credit has been made available.
As to agencies, with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, Parliament should also gain a better insight into personnel policy of these agencies.
This year is still a transitional year, but in the next few years, Parliament will be paying a great deal of attention to this.
As far as reserves are concerned, according to the result, at least of the votes in the Committee on Budgets, the reserves will be maintained for the NGOs, Eurostat and for Afghanistan.
At the beginning of this year, Parliament declared itself in favour of a budget for 25 Member States.
What we will be voting on this week, is a budget of 15 Member States.
The groundwork has been done, though, and has been done well, so that we, on the basis of the agreements of Copenhagen and on the basis of Parliamentâs first reading, can submit a sound, amended budget, or approve one for the ten new Member States.
With regard to the 2005 Budget, with a reduction of the financial perspectives, the 2005 Budget will become considerably more difficult than that of 2004.
I would therefore wish Mr Garriga Polledo and my successor every success.
Finally, as is known, we in this Parliament have an excellent secretariat for the Committee on Budgets, without whose efficiency, it is obvious, the work here in the Parliament would not have been completed.
I should like to express my warm thanks for this.
I should also like to thank all the group coordinators.
In my view, cooperation was excellent and I am very grateful for this.
Cooperation with the Italian Presidency has also been very successful, for which my thanks.
Finally, I should like to say special thanks to two people: the first of whom is the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
I have valued him for years, but I have now also seen him in action close-by.
I can only express my admiration for the way in which he has done things.
My thanks for this.
Finally, I am also indebted to my personal assistants, particularly Mr Marko van Workum.
Â Â  . Mr President, this budget for the other institutions sets the foundations for the imminent enlargement in stone.
It will equip all the different components that make up the European Union to meet this historic challenge, at least in administrative terms.
My aim has been to ensure that the EU hits the ground running when we have a Union of 25 next year, also to achieve a balance between the necessary increases in resources and at the same time ensure value for money for the European taxpayer.
Earlier this year I outlined my main priorities.
I shall now encapsulate four of these priorities.
Firstly, to prepare for the final stages of enlargement.
I am pleased that we were able to fine-tune the original predictions from the secretaries-general for enlargement.
However, it has to be recognised that the scale of some of the budgetary increases for individual institutions are up to 50% higher in some cases.
This will fundamentally change how those organisations function a note of caution therefore.
It is crucial that this change be managed with care and to ensure that effective change management strategies are in place to avoid chaos.
Secondly, to advocate greater reform.
All the institutions have to modernise if they are to meet successfully the challenges of the future.
Let us not underestimate the challenge of 25 countries working together.
Last weekend's deliberations point to lessons that need to be learnt by the other institutions.
Complacency will lead to gridlock.
Thirdly, to push for greater openness, transparency and accountability.
Every single element of the EU has to be more user-friendly.
We need to make greater use of new technology, rationalise more processes, focusing on the Internet as a tool of communication to achieve our objective to get closer to the citizens and to communicate more effectively with the people of Europe.
We have sown the seeds for this, and of course we will need to build on this.
Fourthly, to alleviate the pressures on the ceiling of Heading 5.
We have overcome this by frontloading buildings for the Court of Justice this year.
I believe that Parliament's policy of frontloading for building expenditure has been vindicated as we now have huge pressure on Heading 5.
This policy has contributed to reducing this pressure this year and next year.
It therefore makes sense to replicate this policy for other institutions as well.
I am pleased to report that I have had considerable successes in meeting some of these objectives; but there have also been some frustrations along the way.
Firstly, on the successes, we have made progress on all the issues I have just outlined.
This budget achieves value for money.
We can congratulate ourselves that we have achieved the juggling act of managing to finance enlargement without breaking the ceiling on Heading 5.
This budget therefore fundamentally completes the process of enlargement budgeting and is a good result for the European taxpayer.
Moving on quickly to the frustrations, we could have expected greater economies of scale given the expansion proposed.
However, my biggest regret is that we have not made significant inroads into introducing activity-based budgeting in the other institutions.
This is a missed opportunity, given the immense pressure on Heading 5, as I have just said, in the remaining years of this financial perspective.
In 2005 and 2006 it will be much harder to prioritise and to ensure that there is an effective financial decision-making framework.
The lessons I have learnt throughout this process are that we need better budgeting and improved planning processes.
The regularity of the last-minute request for unforeseen expenditure is relentless.
