The fury of the earthquake highlighted the insensitivity of the capitalism sweeping the area.
The disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes.
The predatory interventions in the environment by large companies looking for excessive profits are largely to blame for turning natural disasters into humanitarian disasters.
Capitalism is preparing to re-build the interests of the multinationals on top of the graves, to turn the human tragedy into contracts and stock exchange indicators, to turn any 'humanitarian aid' into interventions by the imperialist centres.
A newspaper in the United States terrifyingly wrote that the rich nations are providing the aid and they will dictate the terms.
This means funding for projects with a depressing economic philosophy so that the multinationals can reap the benefits of 'reconstruction', ignoring the needs of the people.
The money raised as a result of grass-roots solidarity must not be embezzled.
The peoples who ran to help must not allow it.
The creation of a trustworthy observatory to implement and strictly control reconstruction programmes for the benefit of the peoples, the writing-off of the debts of these countries and the provision without cutbacks of the aid programmed for other third countries are just some of the measures for relieving the victims.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the resolution before us because it addresses my concerns in this area.
Tragedies sometimes have one positive aspect: they show that human nature â and the nature of the institutions â is also capable of good deeds.
As well as the unspeakable horror that was visited on South-East Asia, and past, present and future suffering, what also hit home were the images of world solidarity on an unprecedented scale.
The globalisation of everything, even suffering, responds to tragic events with decency.
Consequently, the readiness to help shown by everyone, and in our particular case by the EU as a whole and by each of the 25 Member States, is worthy of praise, but only if the promises of help correspond to effective help.
This time, also very much due to the efforts of its citizens, Europe lived up to what its stature should be.
Let us hope, therefore, that this will set a precedent.
Lastly, this should also be an opportunity for the problems of the least-developed countries to be addressed from a fresh perspective, with a fresh approach and with fresh determination.
Let us ensure that tragedy does not produce more commotion than action.
Â Â  . The scale of the tragedy in Asia, with the material and human damage inflicted on the affected populations, has been terribly heart-rending.
Whilst we are sad, however, we must also focus on the crucial need to help the people affected, not only in terms of immediate help for the countries concerned, but also in terms of ensuring that long-term mechanisms of cooperation and assistance can be set up, so that disasters of this nature can be prevented from happening again.
Against this backdrop, I feel that it is essential to set up an EU civil rapid reaction corps, in order to enhance the effectiveness of European help in humanitarian crisis situations.
Throughout this nightmare, we must pay particularly careful attention to the children who have been orphaned, not only because they are the ones who suffer the most but also because they are vulnerable to rape and to physical and sexual abuse.
I therefore urge the EU to make use of all the resources at its disposal to enable prompt and rapid action to protect young victims.
All that remains is for me to express my sincerest appreciation of all citizens and governments who have, so generously and spontaneously, contributed towards financing humanitarian actions to help the devastated peoples.
Â Â  . However paradoxical it may seem, it is at moments of suffering overseas that EU Member States manage to speak with one voice on the international scene â the voice of solidarity.
I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the EU and its Member States could not turn a blind eye to the human and material loss caused by the appalling and unprecedented tragedy of the terrible seaquake that hit Asia and the Indian Ocean.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I welcome the interinstitutional agreement that has been reached permitting recourse to emergency funds and to flexibility instruments and enabling significant funds to be released, despite their not being initially budgeted.
Accordingly, as well as expressing their compassion and their grief, the EU and its Member States will in the short term have more than EURÂ 1Â billion at their disposal.
From a logistical point of view, this tragedy reinforces the urgency of the EUâs civil reaction corps for humanitarian operations.
In addition to emergency first aid, the EU will also play an active role in the interim phase of rehabilitation and the long-term phase of reconstruction.
Lastly, as well as the public help, I must express my satisfaction and my pride ...
Â Â  . Following up previous Parliament resolutions, the intention of this resolution is to âstrengthen the partnershipâ between the USA and the EU, renewing and stepping up the determination of these two capitalist blocs to share influence and domination.
In a clear sign that this is something that unites them rather than divides them, the EU is playing the supporting role to the American big brother that has historically been attributed to it.
The hypocrisy and the cynicism on both sides of the Atlantic â which has also been demonstrated in the recent case of support for the countries affected by the tsunami in Asia, especially when one compares that support with the money spent on the war â manifests itself in the power to decide who can and cannot have arms, what type of arms they can and cannot have, and who are the democratic organisations and countries.
It is also seen in the definition of the political domination structure of bodies such as the Security Council, a body that seeks to consolidate positions so as to ensure the legal status quo in world domination, bypassing differences of opinion as regards the attack on and invasion of Iraq, the violation of international law, the International Criminal Court and the fact that the Kyoto Protocol has not been signed, and suggesting that an âaction communityâ be created ...
Â Â  We support quite a few of the resolutionâs proposals concerning, for example, increased economic cooperation between the EU and the United States, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and support for the International Criminal Court.
We have nonetheless chosen to abstain in the vote on the resolution as a whole because it is, in general, aimed at strengthening the EU as a global actor in relation to the United States and the rest of the world.
Â Â  The recent EU/US agreement over Airbus / Boeing should do much to improve the climate of trade talks between the two.
Mr Mandelson deserves our warm congratulations for brokering this settlement.
However, other serious transatlantic problems remain, such as the failure of the US to sign-up for the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto protocol.
Progress in these issues could lead to effective joint action by the two sides of the Atlantic.
As the resolution rightly points out, a transatlantic 'Community of action' could help resolve the Middle East crisis in Palestine, Iran and Iraq.
It could help in the fight against international terrorism and could contribute to achieving the Millennium development goals of reducing poverty, disease and environmental degradation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that, following the US elections, the President of the United States will be visiting Europe at a time when, objectively speaking, we have a chance to improve relations between the two sides.
Whilst the situation in Iraq remains tense and dangerous, it has improved.
Dozens of parties have registered to take part in the elections, abductions are increasingly a criminal matter and attacks are becoming more sporadic.
The focus now is on building the future.
In Ukraine, we had the same concerns, we spoke up for the same values and principles and we achieved the same result.
In the Middle East, following the elections to the Palestinian Authority, we have the chance to be on the same side.
As regards Iran, the United States is waiting to see how effective the agreement reached by the EU has been, given that there remain some potential difficulties in this regard.
Lastly, both sides of the Atlantic reacted in exactly the same way and with the same degree of commitment to the recent disaster in Asia.
Accordingly, it is crucial that we make the most of President Bushâs next visit to restore transatlantic relations in full and without any grudges.
We are, in all senses, on two sides of the same ocean.
We have our differences, but we are united by the same core values.
Â Â  . The free world in which we live would be no more than a mirage had we not forged the close and productive relations between Europe and the United States that have freed our continent from the yoke of Nazi and Communist totalitarianism.
More than a mere historical curiosity, this relationship is crucial and indispensable, given the challenges and opportunities facing us.
I therefore vehemently oppose those who try to turn allies into opponents or rivals.
I believe that the same history that today records our joint victory would take a dim view of allies who, having defeated the most visible enemy, turn their backs when the threat becomes dispersed and almost invisible.
The fact that we do not always agree should be a catalyst for promoting dialogue and not an excuse to foment sterile and counter-productive tensions, which are of use only to those who have always wanted to see us divided.
I am delighted that the same Parliament which, only a short time ago, let itself be taken in by anti-US rhetoric, is now sending a responsible message by declaring its will to work together to resolve problems around the world and to receive President Bush the next time he visits the Community institutions.
Working together, we can achieve more.
Â Â  I totally support this Joint Motion.
Cancellation of 80% of Iraqi debt is certainly something to be welcomed.
Having visited Iran with a delegation from this Parliament I am keenly aware on the dire needs of the population there.
However the willingness of the Paris Club to act in this case begs the question whether debt relief decisions are being made on the basis of need or that of US political imperatives?
It is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the world continues to increase military expenditure and reduce expenditure on aid.
This leaves us as far away as ever from the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Aid, and not even in sight of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals.
Lets put an end once and for all to our disgraceful record of broken promises and half-measures.
Lets recognise that a debt moratorium for indebted countries will not do half enough to allow them rebuild their battered communities.
Lets go for real debt relief, that is cancellation of their debts.
That's the only way we can offer them real pain relief instead of simply deferring and dragging out their suffering!
Â Â  . External debt is a means of exploiting developing countries and of placing them at the mercy of the countries and the international financial institutions that are their creditors and of the economic interests that represent it.
This is wrong, it is immoral and it constitutes a major hindrance to development.
It also diverts enormous amounts of money from the basic needs of the people of these countries, which more often than not earmark more money for debt repayment than for the total amount that they spent on health and education, thus preventing them from tackling diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis or problems such as illiteracy, and many others.
Maintaining the debt is unacceptable.
It is worth pointing out that the countries in debt have already paid seven times what they owed in 1982 and have, worse still, seen their debt rise fourfold.
Furthermore, most of them have a history of colonial exploitation, which makes them creditors rather than debtors of the industrialised countries.
This ongoing situation is all the more incomprehensible following the writing off of 80% of Iraqâs debt, due to the imposition of the USA military occupying power and given estimates as to the active exploitation of Iraqâs wealth and the lucrative âbusinessâ of reconstruction.
It is therefore essential that the debt of developing countries is cancelled, so that they can build a fairer world.
Â Â  We are well disposed towards different forms of international aid to developing countries.
We do not however believe that the European Parliament has the competence to produce recommendations concerning debt relief for developing countries.
This issue should be dealt with at national level and within the framework of already existing international structures, for example the Paris Club.
We also note that money immediately loaned by the EU must be written off and that it must thus be entered in the accounts as an item of budgetary expenditure.
For the above-mentioned reasons, we have chosen to vote against the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . Debt relief for developing countries is a welcome measure that demonstrates â or ought to demonstrate â a genuine desire on the part of the international bodies and of the wealthiest countries to make an active contribution to those countriesâ economic growth and development, and to fairer distribution of the costs of that process.
Furthermore, unlike those who advocate the unrestricted opening of borders to all immigration, I believe that the best, most efficient and fairest policy is to endeavour to foster development in the countries most in need, instead of promoting the draining of their most capable human resources.
In this context, it is important to acknowledge that, in the past, this debt was often the result of objectionable policies, and that in the future the development of these countries depends to a large extent on their own decisions, their own policies and their own level of commitment.
Accordingly, I advocate processes such as the one before us aimed at debt relief for developing countries.
The proviso of such a process must be that the funds thus released must be spent on sustainable development policies and not on policies that cannot and must not be endorsed.
Â Â  . The policy of Community cooperation must favour economic and social growth in developing countries, and the gradual integration of those countries into the worldâs economy.
One must bear in mind that the countries in need of help must be subject to close scrutiny, in terms both of enhancing the processes towards democratic consolidation, and of progress in respecting human rights.
The economic growth of developing countries must be people-focused.
This is the only way in which we can make sure that their economies will grow and that their external debt requirements can be reduced, and in which we can make sure that they are meeting their obligations.
We welcome the New Partnership for Africaâs Development and the measures announced at the G8 Summit, which, quite apart from constituting considerable efforts towards economic progress in developing countries, are intended to promote and consolidate democracy, good economic management, peace and security in those countries.
Within these constraints, I feel that the process of public debt relief must be speeded up and stepped up, thereby enabling developing countries to allocate resources to basic services and, in so doing, to achieve the millennium development goals.
Â Â  I voted against the resolution on the grounds that it does not even achieve the objectives stated by the Presidency.
Our amendments seeking written-off debts were voted down.
Â Â  .â The foreign debt of the poor, developing countries comes from loans imposed with particularly unfavourable, predatory terms by international imperialist organisations, especially the World Bank and the IMF.
They were granted for the purpose not of strengthening the economies of these countries and combating grass-roots problems, but for the purpose of control of the markets and wealth-producing resources and fierce exploitation of the peoples, with the result that these loans exacerbate the position of these countries, increase their dependence on the international imperialist centres and strengthen the position of the large monopoly groups, the multinationals, especially the American multinationals, so that they can control the markets.
Without deluding ourselves that the character and objectives of the international organisations may change, we are calling for the wiping out of the foreign debt of these countries, the demand for and imposition of international economic conditions based on mutual assistance and equality between countries and support for grass-roots interests against the interests of the multinationals.
That is why the fight by the peoples of these countries cannot be confined to writing off the debt.
It is an anti-imperialist fight.
They are fighting for international relations to change radically.
They are fighting to defeat the imperialist system.
They are fighting so that the peoples themselves can determine their future and exploit the resources for common progress and advance.
Â Â  . Two aspects of the recent electoral process in Ukraine stand out.
The first is the capacity of the majority of the Ukrainian people to fight for democracy, for freedom and for a social model that is essentially identical to that of the EU.
In the context of that struggle, the name of Viktor Yushchenko comes to the fore, but only as a first among equals.
He has been the head of a body that is solid, determined and united behind a single idea.
Secondly, it is abundantly clear that action by the Community institutions and the European leaders, at both Community and national level, had an important role to play in the outcome of that process, which could otherwise have led to an extremely serious situation.
These two aspects justifiably led to expectations among the Ukrainian people as regards their future accession to the EU.
It is now therefore up to Ukraine to follow a path that corresponds to the clear will of the people.
Similarly, it is up to the EU to react positively to the expectations that have been generated.
It is this approach, an integral part of the resolution before us, which led me to vote in favour.
Â Â  . In the context of the election observation mission in which I took part on 26, 27 and 28Â December 2004, I was able to monitor the circumstances in which the re-run of the second round of presidential elections took place.
I was also able to note, I am pleased to say, that the winning candidate wishes to move closer to the EU.
In this respect, I had the opportunity, along with other Members of this House, to write to the President of Parliament to notify him of this wish and to request that the Ukrainian President-elect address this House soon.
I hope that power is handed over swiftly and properly, so that democratic normalisation can take place and that levels of anxiety and tension â which were, admittedly, never worse than tolerable during the electoral process â can be reduced.
I feel that we should not overlook the fact that Ukraine is a country of strategic importance to Russia.
I believe that the firmness shown by the EU in defence of democracy and freedom should not be misinterpreted, nor used to antagonise a neighbour of its importance.
Ukraineâs political stabilisation must first serve to encourage the Russians to follow the path of convergence with those shared values.
At the same time, I feel that, if that is the Ukrainiansâ freely expressed desire, then we must pave the way for them to be able to come and join the EU.
Â Â  â Voting time is over.
Â Â  The sitting is resumed.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I represented the President at the meeting of Ambassadors from the ASEAN countries, who attended the debate we held in this House on the tsunami.
They asked me to express their gratitude for Parliamentâs support for ensuring a rapid response to these tragic events and for the forward-looking, constructive and non-politicised debate they witnessed, in the best tradition of the European Union, with a view to providing humanitarian aid to those parts of the world desolated by tragedies such as the recent tsunami we have tragically seen in South-East Asia.
Â Â  Mr President, as you were about to say, we now come to the matters of urgency and the human rights issues.
Today we have three topics related to Asia, but serious violations of human rights are still going on in Europe.
I am therefore glad that we have with us two campaigners for human rights, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya, who are here today to receive the Robert Schuman Medal from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I am glad that these campaigners for human rights, who have thus exposed themselves to great dangers, are listening to this important debate today.
We can assure them that we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that human rights prevail in Russia and in Chechnya.
Â Â  We take good note of what you have said and we are grateful for the information, Mr Posselt.
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Tibet: the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche(1).
Â Â  â Mr President, 26 January will be the second anniversary of the execution of the monk Lobsang Dhondup.
This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored.
In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired.
Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others.
We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations.
Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China.
Our demands are still on the agenda.
A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks.
This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers.
In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China.
Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested.
It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained.
The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it.
What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice.
One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
Â Â  Mr President, just two months ago we highlighted the plight of the Tibetan monk Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche who was sentenced to death on 3 December 2002 in an unfair trial on politically motivated charges.
We return today to his case.
It is a reminder to us all that, even though this is 2005, some people in our world today still cannot practice their religious beliefs without the threat of violence or, in Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case, death.
Since we last spoke about his case in this House, there have been rumours that his death sentence has been suspended and may be commuted to a life sentence.
I am pleased to hear Mr Mann's comments.
I suggest that we still urge the Chinese authorities immediately to clarify the situation and urge â as our resolution says â the Chinese Government to commute the death sentence handed down to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche.
We should also ask the Chinese authorities further to clarify where Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is being held and whether he is in good health.
For the time being, no one knows his exact location.
I also believe this House should strongly support the continuation of the EU embargo on arms sales to the People's Republic of China until such time as the human rights situation has improved and China has taken the vital step of signing the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Further to this, we must continue to exert pressure on China to abolish the death penalty and place an immediate moratorium on capital punishment.
We should be stressing to the Chinese authorities that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche deserves a fair trial and not a sham trial.
To conclude, there are many like Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche out there in our world today who deserve our support and the right to live in a country where religious freedom and human rights are respected.
I hope this House can support this resolution.
Â Â  The Chinese authoritiesâ increasing interest in establishing good relations with European governments offers us a good opportunity to tackle the situation of Tibet and to state once again, as we have done before, that it is necessary to find a fair and lasting response to Tibetan demands.
In their dealings with the Chinese authorities, European governments must take very good account of the enormous risks involved in any lifting of the European Union's arms embargo and must deal with the issue of political prisoners and the risk of their being sentenced to death, as in the case we are dealing with of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche.
Furthermore, it is urgent that we appoint a European Union special representative for Tibet, in order to demonstrate both the importance of the Tibetan issue within the context of European Union-China negotiations and in order to facilitate the path towards a Chinese-Tibetan dialogue to put an end to the repression suffered by the Tibetan population, religion, language and culture for decades.
Â Â  Mr President, Tibet has been recognised as part of Chinese territory, against the will of its original people, for a long time.
It is an area in the course of colonisation by the Chinese and one where many newcomers fulfil the function of official, policeman or military.
Violent means have for many years been used to repress opposition to this humiliating state of affairs.
The death penalty, whether to be carried out immediately or delayed, has been used by the Chinese state as a means of quashing the wishes of a large part of the population of Tibet.
We in this Parliament, right across the political spectrum, have every reason to be indignant about the death penalty and certainly about its use as a political instrument, and we hope to prevent the execution in two weeks time of a respected and influential Buddhist lama.
Present day China is akin to South Korea of recent years.
In that model, economic growth is paramount, over and above man and the environment.
If, on the basis of short-sighted European self-interest, we were to reason in the short term, there would be a considerable temptation to withdraw the criticism we have levelled at China.
Indeed, China is the country with the largest population and the faster growing economy.
For a century, that country stagnated on account of domestic wars, foreign occupations and idealistic, but ill-considered experiments, and has, internationally speaking, been placed off-side.
It now looks as if it will be playing a vital role in the future.
Do we resign ourselves to the fact that such an authoritative country applies the death penalty, treats its minorities badly, neglects its environment, pays its workers badly, tolerates unsafe living and working conditions and is not a democracy?
Or do we in Europe want to promote over there our views about a democratic constitutional state, diversity of political and religious opinions, freedom of association and democratic majority decisions?
That is why Europe must explicitly dare take sides with threatened minorities and movements, which, in future too, must be able to continue to play their role.
In their relations with China, the Commission and Council must not work from the assumption that this is a big country with a fast-growing economy, but that this is a country which refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above anything else and for the rest also violates human rights.
Only then can we expect results.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the European Unionâs new Member States are well aware of what is meant by human rights violations, as such violations are still fresh in our memories.
The situation in Europe today has improved tremendously, although the fact that MrsÂ Estimirova and MrÂ Kovalev are present in this Chamber now indicates that much still remains for us to do in Europe in this respect.
It is worth mentioning once again that Tibet has always been an independent state, which, being naturally cut off from the world, has never had any ambition to conduct any kind of foreign policy.
This cannot be taken to mean, however, that China is entitled to declare Tibet part of China, as Tibet is most certainly not part of China.
In spite of this, the Tibetan authorities and the Dalai Lama are prepared to hold a dialogue and would be satisfied with mere autonomy.
Yet this is the bare minimum due to them, which we must call for on their behalf.
This House is to adopt a position on this issue today, and we must call on the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Tibetan people and to respect the rights of minorities.
We must call, and indeed we are calling, for the death sentence imposed on Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to be lifted, and for him to be released from prison.
We are also calling on our institutions to maintain the arms trade embargo against the Peopleâs Republic of China, and not to lift it.
The free world has an instrument available to it to prevent tyrants from abusing those subject to such tyrantsâ power against their will, and this instrument is appropriate economic sanctions.
We must therefore call for our institutions to apply these sanctions, as well as for dialogue to take place between China and the whole of Chinese society, above all the Tibetan people and their representative, the Dalai Lama.
We would like the President of Parliament to forward this resolution to the European Council, the European Commission, the UN Secretary-General and all those who can bring any influence to bear on China to encourage the country to start respecting human rights.
We should not only feel pangs of conscience when a disaster such as the tsunami strikes.
Instead, we must always be alert to the poverty and misfortune of people the world over.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Chinese have a proverb to the effect that one should throw away oneâs watch before beginning to negotiate.
This wise saying must not be misunderstood; it counsels stubborn determination rather than inactivity, and it is when, as sometimes happens, we begin to become resigned to the persistence with which the same human rights issues resurface over and over again, that we must continue to speak out with tenacity and a clear voice; we must be unrelenting in the defence of human rights, whether this be in the face of the Chinese Government or of other regimes that trample these rights underfoot.
We must not, though, misinterpret this saying to mean that we should do nothing.
We must be impatient when we protest against the large-scale violations of human rights that occur in a country like China, which is such an important partner.
Our specific concern today is with the fate of a senior Tibetan monk and of a bishop of the Chinese underground church, the brutal persecution of both of whom violates the universally accepted principle of freedom of religion.
Let me make it plain to our Chinese partners that it is unworthy of an ancient and highly-developed culture like their own to suppress another â that of Tibet, which is equally ancient and venerable.
It ill becomes such an advanced culture to oppress and persecute faith communities such as the Buddhist community and the Catholic Church.
China has no need of such a thing, and by doing this it does massive damage to itself.
We Europeans must back up our words with deeds and try to exert pressure to enforce the observance of human rights, even when the state violating them is a large one and an important trading partner, such as Russia in its dealings with Chechnya, and China where Tibet and freedom of religion are concerned.
In these matters, we must apply the same standards, rather than condemning the small states while grovelling to the big ones.
Only if we do will Europeâs human rights policy remain credible in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I would like again to make it clear that, at the beginning of this twenty-first century, our Constitution is an unequivocal expression of the importance to us of the rule of law and of the rights of citizens.
These two things â as well as human rights â are important to us, and not to us alone.
They matter to everyone throughout the world, and so our group emphatically reiterates its demand for the rule of law, and our demand that the Chinese Government promptly commute the death sentence passed on Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and not only the sentence passed on him, but also the sentences passed on all those others in China upon whom the death penalty has been imposed.
On behalf of my group, I also demand that capital punishment be done away with, including in China, for it is unworthy of a civilised people.
Â Â  â Mr President, despite the sign of hope we have been given today in the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, we must continue to demand that the case against him be reopened and conducted according to the principles of the rule of law.
If we do not, we will forever more be stalling, and we will always have cases of this kind on our hands.
Not just in this case but in many others, a fair trial is what is needed.
Now that we have passed our resolution on the Constitution, we in this House must continue to defend human rights and endangered minorities throughout the world, supporting their efforts and protecting them against arbitrary repression.
We have to demand of our own governments that they do not allow themselves to be dazzled by the prospect of good business contacts, so that human rights fade out of the picture.
We have to make use of developing relations with China to help human rights to prevail there too and to return autonomy to the people of Tibet at last.
Â Â  Mr President, in the framework of its political dialogue with China, and more recently on the occasion of the 7th bilateral EU-China summit held in The Hague on 8 December 2004, the EU has constantly addressed the issue of the safeguard of the rights of minorities, especially as regards Tibet.
It has, in particular, urged the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
These issues have also been systematically dealt with in the context of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights.
During this dialogue, the EU has regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities, at every session, and most recently in Beijing on 24 September 2004, the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their beliefs.
The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is one such case.
At the beginning of 2004, the EU made an official dÃ©marche in Beijing to request information on his whereabouts and state of health, expressed the hope that the death sentence would not be upheld and asked for judicial review of the case.
More recently, on 15 November, the EU Troika made a new ad hoc dÃ©marche in Beijing, during which the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche was again highlighted.
The EU is fully committed to urging China not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute, in this respect, to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination.
It takes the view that the application of the death penalty to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche would send out a very negative signal and would have an adverse impact on relations with China.
We have just learned that the Luxembourg presidency - and the Commission immediately contacted it - is currently preparing a dÃ©marche that would also associate the Commission.
The dÃ©marche will be sent to China asking it not to administer the death penalty and to re-examine the case.
On a more general level, the EU has called for years, and will continue to call, as part of its overall policies vis-Ã -vis Tibet, for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities as the only realistic way of finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet.
In this context, we consider the recent third visit to China of the Dalai Lamaâs special envoys to be an encouraging sign of progress.
In the dialogue with China, the EU has regularly expressed concern over the extensive use of the death penalty.
While reaffirming our longstanding position in favour of abolition, we have continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium.
We have also stressed the need to comply, in the fight against terrorism, with the basic principles governing international relations and safeguarding human rights.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon, following the debates.
. â The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on torture in Iran(2).
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, politics in general and bilateral relations in particular often make compromise necessary.
This is particularly the case if one wants to make progress with partners with whom one has little in common.
I therefore accept the fact that, in some way, and even though the parties do not admit it, a deal has been done, one that involves, on the one hand, Iranâs compliance with the IAEAâs (International Atomic Energy Agency) demands on nuclear matters and, on the other, the resumption of negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU, as happened in January.
There is, however, one area in which no deals can be done, and that is in the field of human rights.
Iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned, but this House, at any rate, will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights, and I would also like to remind the Commission and the Council that any agreement has to be approved by this House.
If the human rights situation continues to develop as it has done so far, I have grave doubts as to whether it will be.
Even the UN General Assembly, when it met on 20 December last year, denounced the deteriorating situation in Iran as regards the freedoms of speech, opinion and the media, as well as the arbitrary arrests without charges or court proceedings.
It is journalists and those who write for the Internet who are on the receiving end of this sort of treatment, and I have learned from the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders that the Nobel Peace Prize holder Shirin Ebadi was yesterday summoned to the public prosecutorâs office in Teheran.
The reason for this is not yet known, but my hunch is that this is another case of good old-fashioned intimidation.
Quite apart from that, it is unacceptable that death sentences should still be being carried out, particularly on juveniles and the mentally handicapped, and there is still no confirmation that execution by stoning is now a thing of the past and will not be revived.
Let us then send out a clear message that we will not allow Iran to continue with such a policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, not only internally is the EU in a process of constant development, but its cooperation and contacts in matters of foreign policy are also becoming ever more extensive.
That is not only important in terms of defending our economic interests, but also and primarily in terms of building up networks whereby human rights, peacekeeping, respect for nature, and much else, can be demanded and put into practice.
This is an area in which many delegations from this House are active, and these contacts have enabled us to achieve a great deal.
Parliamentâs desire to establish and build up inter-parliamentary delegations with Iran in order to enter into dialogue with that country is something to be welcomed.
During its preparatory stages, many sensitive issues will have to be addressed and stipulations made.
As we have just heard, the Iranian Government has, in recent years, acceded to a number of UN Conventions, including that on the rights of the child, and signed up to the Declaration of Human Rights.
Changes have also been made to its penal code, and execution by stoning prohibited, although this ban has been inadequately implemented.
I regret to say that this list does not include the Declaration on the Rights of Women.
In this resolution, we highlight the very large gaps in many areas and the inadequate respect for human rights, with particular reference to the imprisonment of women and to arbitrary arrests.
The treatment of journalists also leaves much to be desired, and the situation must be improved as a matter of urgency.
What is going on in Iran must be carefully investigated and examined, and so there are two points on which I cannot endorse this resolution, and in respect of which I will be moving an oral amendment.
We must clearly express what we think joint cooperation means and stick to our principles, whilst also accepting that Iran has its own structures and must itself decide in what way it is to change, difficult though this may often be for us to understand.
The only way for us to change anything is not to pass up the chance of a new start.
Â Â  â Mr President, even though Iran is one of the largest countries on earth, it still has a government whose actions we view with concern.
I am delighted to learn of the efforts being made to foster dialogue with it, and of the pressure that the European Union is exerting in connection with the state of human rights there.
During the fourth dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, held on 14 and 15 June 2004 in Teheran, Iran undertook to improve human rights, and that is a good thing, but we can also see that there is an urgent need that something be done about this, for international organisations estimate that every year still sees between 300 and 400 executions carried out, with some 80Â people being flogged and an unknown number stoned to death â all this despite, as you have heard, these things no longer, officially, being in the Iranian penal code.
What shows how much contempt a government can have for its own people is the relevant article â no. 119 â from the former Iranian penal code, according to which the stones used at a stoning must not be so large that the condemned person dies from the impact of one or two of them, nor so small that they cannot be described as stones.
Such a thing is torture, legitimised by the state with the intention of causing death, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is no longer carried out today, at this stage in the twenty-first century.
Reference has also been made to the human rights of juveniles; although death sentences are pronounced on them, the sentence is not carried out until they are 18.
That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called âeducation campsâ, waiting to be executed, instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to.
We have just heard what the UN has had to say on the situation in Iran.
I am very glad that the letter sent by the President of this Parliament, Josep Borrell, to the Iranian ambassador has helped to get a stoning, due to be carried out at the end of last year, delayed and the sentence commuted.
Let us continue to exert this sort of pressure, for only in that way will we, in the eyes of the world, do justice to our own objectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since this Houseâs last debate on this subject, in October of last year, there has been some discernible progress, but also a number of reverses.
I am relieved to learn that the United Kingdom, Germany and France have managed to press on with the negotiations on the atomic energy programme.
Above all, I am glad that â as we have just heard â there have been positive responses when we have raised individual cases of grave violations of human rights in Iran.
We are evidently being listened to after all, and can hope that our intervention in the human rights sphere can meet with success.
In this process the European Commission is a partner in negotiation and dialogue, and so it is to them, in the first instance, that I appeal that human rights should not be treated as a secondary issue, but put centre stage in exactly the same way as economic relations with Iran or the issue of how to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons.
I also want to make it clear to our Iranian friends that dialogue and negotiation mean critical dialogue; Iran must listen when we criticise some of the things that go on there and that we cannot accept and never will, such as the maltreatment and oppression of women, the stonings and the executions.
I do not see last Decemberâs United Nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue, but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us.
It is also, unfortunately, evidence that our concerns about the human rights situation, the restrictions on the freedom of the press and the persecution of journalists are more than justified.
Let me once again appeal, as a matter of urgency, to the Iranian authorities to do something more than make announcements and instead cancel the stonings, give women real rights in practice, and offer more than lip-service to what this dialogue is about.
We are also very concerned about the accusations levelled at the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi.
I believe that not only all Members of this House, but also the Commissionâs and Councilâs representatives, are making it plain that we expect her good work not to be hampered in any way.
Although my group will be voting in favour of the resolution, we will be asking for item 9 to be deleted, as this debate is not the place for it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union and Iran have returned to the negotiating table in order to resume talks on a joint trade and cooperation agreement.
The reason for this, or so we are told, is that Iran has now agreed to allow monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and has put a stop, for the time being, to the enrichment of uranium.
I ask myself how it is that Iranâs stance in the so-called ânuclear controversyâ can be the only criterion that the Commission considers when deciding to restart the negotiations.
There are still serious problems where human rights are concerned, and every one of the European Unionâs trade and cooperation agreements contains unequivocal statements on the human rights chapters on which cooperation depends.
The Commissionâs attitude gives the impression that human rights have, overnight, ceased to be a problem in Iran.
This resolution presses home the point that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Iran.
Sharia law continues to be imposed with its full rigour; executions, stonings, torture and arbitrary arrests continue day by day.
The work of human rights activists and journalists has become even more difficult and even more hazardous; the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has again been summoned before a court.
These facts lead me to regard the European Union as acting utterly deceitfully in resuming negotiations with the Iranian Government at this stage.
I appeal both to the Commission and to the Council to take their own demands seriously and not to allow themselves to be bought â in the truest sense of the word.
Rather than negotiating with Iran on cooperation in economic policy matters, the European Union should be sitting down with those forces that are actually doing something for democracy, to change Iran, to make it democratic.
I think that what Mr Gahler came out with was another attempt at coupling one thing with another, so let me ask him, in plain language, to name one country that behaves in the way Iran does.
If we are not to suspend trade relations with Iran, with what country does he want us to suspend them?
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to say that I agree with Mr Markov and we should be calling on some of our colleagues here to wake up, because the EU policy of appeasing the cruel, fundamentalist dictatorship in Tehran has simply encouraged the mullahs to introduce increasingly repressive measures and carry out more sickening displays of barbarity.
Public hangings are now an almost daily spectacle, often involving the execution of children, the mentally handicapped and even pregnant women.
Six pregnant women have been executed this year alone.
Stoning to death, amputation of limbs, floggings and torture are commonplace.
This is a fascist regime that has made a farce of democracy and has consigned human rights to the dustbin.
Only today the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been summoned to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which is an outrage.
I hope you will write to the Iranian Ambassador and object to that.
Last month, Maryam Rajavi, the charismatic leader of the Iranian opposition movement, came here to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and told us that the solution in confronting this challenge is neither appeasement nor a military invasion.
The Iranian people themselves, through their courageous resistance movement, have the capacity to bring about change. But we have to offer them encouragement.
So it is vitally important that we support Article 9 of this resolution which would enable us to look again at the EU terror list which, at the insistence of the mullahs, includes the name of the Iranian resistance, the People's Mujahedin.
As a major US intelligence investigation recently disclosed, there is no justification for keeping the name of the Mujahedin on the EU terror list.
Indeed, by agreeing to this demand from the mullahs, we have given them a further reason to impose the death penalty on supporters of the resistance movement.
Right now, three men are awaiting execution in Iran simply because they support the People's Mujahedin.
They have been accused of no other crimes but, according to the mullahs' website, the death penalty is justified because the Mujahedin appears on the EU terror list.
This is the result of our squalid attempts at appeasement and we must do something to stop it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to add my voice to that of the previous speaker and to the voices of all those who have made every effort to express our indignation at the continuing, and worsening, violation of human rights in Iran.
It is only three months since October, but we have been forced to return to this House due to the deteriorating situation.
I should like to call on those Members who wish to backtrack on this resolution so as to withdraw these oral amendments and to withdraw this proposal thus making the text less contentious. This is because the question before us is whether or not we are sending a sufficiently clear message to the Iranian regime, and whether we are addressing the regimeâs latest action, which was to summon the Nobel Peace Prize winner to the police.
This kind of appeasement will bring us the worst possible results.
I therefore call for the withdrawal of these proposals and for a unanimous vote in favour of the text as it is.
Â Â  . Mr President, last month, Mrs Maryam Rajavi, leader of the main opposition party in Iran, visited the European Parliament and addressed 150 MEPs.
She drew attention to the injustice that is still being done to the Iranian people because the Mujaheddin, who fight for a democratic constitutional state on European lines, still feature on our list of terrorist organisations.
It is from that European list that the regime of fundamentalist religious fanatics derives the right to execute political prisoners who can be linked with it.
The regime has devoted much negative attention to Mrs Rajaviâs visit.
Those who wish to continue to kill and torture opponents unhindered, have every reason to demonise and isolate the democratic opposition that has been driven into exile.
It is high time for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs to reconsider the list of terrorist organisations and in doing so, help to end the violation of human rights in Iran.
I consider the full acceptance of the proposed resolution, including Paragraph 9, as an appeal to that effect.
That is vital in order to achieve a democratic constitutional state in Iran.
Â Â  Mr President, the Iranian regime is responsible for many violations of human rights in Iran, and we believe that the soft policy adopted by some EU governments has been a great failure.
When we maintain diplomatic relations with this regime, and especially when the Council labels the main opposition as terrorists, we are encouraging the regime to carry on its violations of human rights more than before.
The most serious message that we could send to Tehran is to remove the name of the Iranian Mujahideen from the list of terrorists.
In reality, the criminal mullahs are the real terrorists.
They hang their own people, including children, and also send terrorists to neighbouring Iraq.
This is, frankly, a very soft resolution.
However, we support it and, in particular, the paragraph on a review of the terrorist list by the Public Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Â Â  Mr President, our debate today coincides with resumption in Brussels of negotiations between the European Union and Iran on the conclusion of a trading and cooperation agreement, alongside talks about political dialogue and combating terrorism.
This is a particularly positive development in the continuing Paris agreement of November 2004 between France, Germany and Great Britain, on behalf of the European Union, and Iran on the moratorium on uranium enrichment and control of Iranian activities in the nuclear sector.
These developments confirm the international credibility and the huge political potential of the European Union when it acts as one to resolve important international problems through dialogue and political means.
Bearing in mind the negative experience in Iraq and in the face of the unilateral philosophy of the United States, the European Union is in a position to formulate its own alternative proposal on international problems, in close cooperation with the UN and its competent agencies.
The ÎU is Iran's first trading partner, a fact which proves the importance of reinforcing Euro-Iranian relations as a tool in the European strategy for the democratisation of Iran, for respect of its international obligations and for reversing its internalisation and isolation.
A balanced policy of, on the one hand, pressure and checks on Iran for the respect of democratic freedoms and human rights and, on the other hand, of incentives to develop relations, is the only effective way of establishing a climate of mutual trust and reversing confrontational outbidding and the unilateral strategic approach to the resolution of regional problems.
We must continue to be constant supporters of human rights in Iran, of cooperation with civil society and of dialogue at all levels.
Within this framework, the European Parliament must take specific initiatives.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
One of the European Unionâs main roles is to act as spokesperson for the needs of people in difficulty and to promote human rights, freedom, democracy and tolerance.
We therefore all agree on pressing the Iranian authorities to comply with international conventions on the freedom of the press, on the outlawing of torture, and on respect for the rights of children, women and minorities.
The ringing of many alarm bells tells us that the situation on political and social reform is in fact deteriorating rather than making progress.
The United Nations, too, expressed growing concern about the situation in its resolution of 21 December 2004.
We all hope that Iran, a country with plenty of potential and in great cultural turmoil, can become a fully operative economic and political partner as soon as possible.
All future trade, however, must be closely matched by careful monitoring of the true social situation in the country and must be made conditional upon the establishment of the required reforms and their effective and unequivocal application.
The recommendations that the European Council made in December, which are in line with this approach, therefore need to be put into practice very soon.
Â Â  Mr President, as the last person to speak in this debate and before giving way to the Commissioner, I would like to say that my views coincide with those of many speakers, in particular those of the spokesman for my group, Mr Casaca.
And as a member of the delegation for relations with Iran, I have seen very many diverse cases of human rights violations in that country and hence the need for this Parliament to maintain a firm position on this issue.
If there is any purpose to Europe and to the European Parliament, it is our approach to human rights; it is the main source of our identity.
I would like to say, in the few seconds left to me, that it is not just the new Member States such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia who have suffered dictatorships; unfortunately, other members of our generations have also suffered dictatorships: in my case, the Franco dictatorship, one of the cruellest and most lasting of the twentieth century.
We are all, therefore, very sensitive to this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, The European Commission shares Parliamentâs concern at the human rights situation in Iran and the recent testimonies of torture.
Like the Council, which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004, the Commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years, despite the commitment made by the Government of Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law.
That is why the European Union has decided unanimously to co-sponsor the resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran adopted at the United Nations General Assembly of November 2004.
This resolution expresses serious concern in relation to a number of human rights issues, including the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, such as amputation and flogging.
At the same time, the resolution recalls the announcement of a ban on torture by the head of the Iranian judiciary in April 2004 and the subsequent passing of related legislation by the Iranian Parliament in May 2004.
Those are interesting developments and issues which, together with the recent allegations of torture, warrant being raised directly with our Iranian partners.
The European Union is committed to pursuing the human rights dialogue initiated in December 2002, which remains an important channel for dialogue, not only with influential representatives of the judiciary, but also with Iranian civil society.
I would also like to highlight the visits undertaken by a number of United Nations special rapporteurs to Iran since our human rights dialogue opened.
That is quite remarkable in a country which previously had remained closed to United Nations visits for 16 years.
Finally, I would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front, the European Union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the Iranian Government on trade, investment and economic issues.
These talks will provide an opportunity to highlight once again to our Iranian partners that all the relevant issues â political, nuclear, trade and human rights â are mutually inter-linked.
The Commission is in favour of constructive engagement with Iran, but that engagement is not synonymous with acting irresponsibly as regards areas of concern that matter so much to Parliament, the European Union and the world at large.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon, following the debates.
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the trafficking of women and children in Cambodia(3).
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
In Cambodia, women are the first to become victims of internal political instability.
It is a problem which certainly cannot be solved by a discussion on a Thursday afternoon in the Chamber of the European Parliament, but I should nevertheless like to draw your attention to a broader phenomenon in this part of the world - sex tourism.
When we talk about the abuse of children and women, we must have the courage also to talk about men, for it is men who bear special responsibility for this.
Tourism is of course a legitimate activity with its own cultural and educational values. But when tourism is abused, it can destroy the morals and culture of many Asian countries, including Cambodia.
This is a moral tsunami, resulting mainly in the abuse of young women and even small children through prostitution and people trafficking.
We must continue to address those who are responsible.
We must act with resolution.
We should persist in confronting all media which are not fighting against the sex industry.
The protection of women and children in Cambodia against abuse begins here, with us, in our Member States.
The persistence of poverty and the exploitation of people give rise to extreme disquiet.
Asian women are well aware of their dignity.
They wish to support their fundamental cultural values.
This awakening is one of the most important signals of our times. But, despite this, poverty and the exploitation of women remain a serious problem throughout Asia.
Illiteracy among women is far more widespread than among men and the right to life for female children is subject to far greater risks.
The actions of our Member States must above all have regard for the values held by these women and ensure that their cultures are respected.
Â Â  Mr President, through this resolution we are condemning the crime of people trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors, and also the fact that the people responsible for these crimes so often go unpunished.
In the Chai Hour hotel in Phnom Penh, prostitution was taking place and women and girls were forced to take part in it.
On the initiative of the AFESIP organisation, 84 of them were freed and were transferred to that organisationâs refuge.
The pimps were arrested in the same operation.
According to our information, the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel.
In the mean time, a violent group broke into the refuge, took away the women and girls and, undoubtedly, put them back to work as prostitutes.
So the organisations dedicated to protecting sexually-exploited women and girls, such as AFESIP, are seeing the girls they rescue and try to rehabilitate socially being sold back into prostitution.
This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work.
In this particular case, I would like to state that the Socialist Group supports, and calls on Parliament to support, the President of AFESIP, Mrs Somaly Mam, who is in great danger and has had to flee her country, having had her life threatened by the mafias who control this criminal business.
It should be noted that Mrs Mam has received significant recognition in Spain, France and Italy.
This impunity is the result of the corruption that is generated as a result of the huge financial profits created by sexual exploitation and people trafficking, and what makes this worse for us is that a large proportion of these profits come from sexual tourism by Europeans.
The Socialist Groupâs appeal is addressed to the governments of our countries, to tackle sexual tourism and strengthen the fight against the mafias operating within it.
We are also addressing our appeal to the Commission and the authorities of the countries in which child and forced prostitution is an everyday reality, such as Cambodia.
We should urge them, in their relations with those countries, to become involved in combating this type of activity, amongst other things by supporting the organisations involved in rescuing and rehabilitating the victims.
Â Â  Mr President, trafficking and sexual exploitation is, in effect, modern-day slavery.
In Cambodia alone, it is estimated that a staggering 8Â 000 to 100Â 000 women and children could be caught up in the sex trafficking industry. That is according to a Cambodian Government report.
Those figures have increased dramatically since the 1990s.
It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94% of the cases brought to court.
Prosecutions need to be increased, but must also result in convictions, meaning that corruption has to be stamped out.
Often it is the poor who are convicted â a mother selling her daughter, for instance, to put food on the table.
According to one Cambodia NGO, the police, military police, army and other state personnel are involved in this trade, and are running or protecting trafficking rings and brothels.
Traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials.
The EU must work with governments and local and international NGOs to put an end to this trade.
Cooperation between Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, is absolutely imperative in order to stop the flow of sex workers across borders.
We also need education and training for border police.
Sex workers should have access to affordable legal advice so as to increase the conviction rate.
Regarding HIV and Aids, prevention is also a priority.
NGOs need increased funding and assistance, not only for these areas, but also to rehabilitate victims.
The EU must continue targeting development aid to the poverty-stricken areas of Cambodia so that young women who escape have an actual alternative and are not lured back into the trade through desperation.
Â Â  Mr President, we are all agreed that trafficking in women and children is a crime; this case in Cambodia is, alas, but one among many, and there are a great many such cases around the world that are not known about.
Over recent weeks, public opinion around the world has been disturbed by reports in the media according to which child victims of the tsunami are being trafficked.
What makes this case in Cambodia all the more disconcerting is the fact that it is only by chance that it has reached the public â us in this House â and is, unfortunately, not unsettling people around the world.
Nonetheless, where the worldwide trade in women and children is concerned, it is but the tip of the iceberg.
I believe that it shows how prevalent corruption is in Cambodia, that the countryâs justice system has not been reformed, and that, no matter what the sex industry is up to, the Cambodian Government should have ensured that the pimps were not, within a matter of days, set at liberty to again be a menace to their victims.
We must also, though, ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade.
The constant increase in the number of landless people in Cambodia is contributing to an ever-worsening situation, in that these people have no prospects unless they sell their sons and daughters.
This is something we have to denounce; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian Government, so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again.
We also have to voice our concern that the committee that has been appointed may well be a mere formality, a sort of sedative pill to calm down the public and us as well.
We therefore hope that the debate in this House will prompt others to bring these crimes more to light and to the attention of the world, and to combat them.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the Cambodian Government, or any other government for that matter, takes inadequate action against the trafficking and abuse of women and children is wholly unacceptable.
Womenâs and childrenâs rights should not be treated as second-class issues.
It is the EUâs moral duty to deploy all the leverage at its disposal in order to change this situation.
This sort of modern slavery must be banned, and this will need to be one of the priorities of the EUâs external policy.
In addition, it is of the utmost importance for support to be given to those NGOs and people who are involved in the fight against the abuse of women and children.
That is a task for both the EU and the Member States.
As such, I would like to warmly thank those who have worked on this resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, hardly any country has suffered as much as Cambodia over the past 60 to 70Â years: first there was the Second World War, which raged there with the same brutality as elsewhere; then came the two wars in Indo-China, the Khmer Rouge with their stone age communism, and the Communism imposed by the Vietnamese, who claimed to come as liberators, while, today, the state is falling apart and there is organised crime on an unimaginable scale.

Nevertheless, it has rightly been said that none of this can be a reason to tolerate or accept what is currently happening there, and before our very eyes.
What we see going on is a particularly unpleasant form of contemporary â I refuse to call it modern â slavery, in the shape of the sexual exploitation of this countryâs women and underaged children.
It is, of course, in the first instance, organised crime in Cambodia that bears responsibility for this to a massive degree, but that responsibility is shared by two other bodies, and so I see items 12 and 13 of our resolution as very important.
There is, on the one hand, the Cambodian Government itself, which must, at long last, ratify and implement the relevant UN Convention and the relevant agreement on the combating, firstly of trafficking in human beings, and secondly of organised crime.
It is we, though, in the European Union, who share responsibility to an equal degree.
This trade in slaves could not exist in the absence of a market for them; the demand for them comes not exclusively or principally from Asia, but, to a massive degree and not least, from Europe.
For that reason, our responsibility is not only to use our foreign policy, security policy and development policy as a means to the end of doing away with this form of slavery; we must also be unrelenting in using all the means with which we, in Europe, combat cross-border crime and fight for our internal security, to hunt down the operators and organisers of this sort of sex tourism, for if we do not, we will have not the least right to point the finger at others.
We must start by discharging our own responsibilities in Europe and then press home the point to our Cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch, and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system, but also, within the EU, to clean our own house.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President, in this world that has been numbed by materialism it is unfortunately only major disasters, such as the tsunami or the terrorist attack in Beslan, which can still trigger pangs of conscience and act as a catalyst for aid and reflection.
Dramatic events that can only be described as the unleashing of the elements have however been happening on a day-to-day basis for many years, with such events being primarily a source of physical evil.
By way of contrast, a person without a conscience or moral principles may cause much greater harm by insulting the dignity of human beings and making it impossible to live in the fullness of humanity.
We have witnessed both moral and spiritual destruction for many years in the countries of Southern Asia and in Cambodia, the country we are debating today.
This destruction can be seen particularly clearly in the treatment of women and young children, who are forced into prostitution, taken away to work in warehouses, factories or on rubber plantations or sold for profit.
Such treatment is plainly an insult to human dignity.
According to overall estimates, over 2Â millionÂ people are sold in this region every year, and trade in children ranks third in terms of profitability for the criminal world, after drugs trafficking and arms trading.
According to such estimates and the UNâs reports, in Cambodia it is particularly difficult to combat the trade in women and children or their sexual exploitation, as both the police and the authorities are corrupt and accept large bribes from rich and depraved tourists.
Exploitation of this kind is a barbaric form of modern slavery.
Over 60% of women and young girls are forced into prostitution, and the majority of them are either infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS.
The most obvious cause for this is poverty, or rather destitution, as in this region almost one quarter of the population, a population which amounts for one third of the worldâs inhabitants, live on less than one dollar a day.
In circumstances such as these, millions of women and children are forced into life-threatening work and tricked with promises of legal employment.
This results in their sale and export abroad as slaves.
There, they are exploited not only for work, but also for various deviant practices, including sexual practices, paedophilia and child pornography.
Another cause is illiteracy and the Communist ideology of the Khmer Rouge, who attempted to build a new society by means of terror, threats and lies, claiming over a million victims in the process.
After years under Pol Potâs rule, both the country and its health service and medical care infrastructures were left entirely destroyed, and millions of children who had lost their parents were left without anything to live on.
Unfortunately, over the past few years the state has also moved towards economic liberalism.
It is not insignificant that liberal destruction of the family and the much-lauded utilitarian and hedonistic model of life are characteristic even of those who help humanitarian non-governmental organisations, some of whom accept a shameful form of payment in kind for this help by exploiting women and children sexually.
It is for this reason that this Houseâs resolutions and debates will do little to improve the situation, as even educated people in high-ranking positions mock the sanctity of the human being and the family.
It is not only financial aid and the much-praised market economy that are needed, but above all moral renewal and ethical principles.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission resolutely condemns all forms of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation, especially of children.
The Commission fully shares the concerns of the Members of the European Parliament about the existence and the extent of human trafficking in Cambodian citizens.
It is particularly revolting that the perpetrators of this evil crime focus their attention on the poorest of the poor in one of the least-developed countries of south-east Asia, where the high level of poverty and the limited capacity of the national agencies, as well as local corruption and collusion, make it easier for them to operate.
These conditions have facilitated the development of trafficking of migrant workers for economic exploitation, the trafficking of women - both inside Cambodia and across its borders - for prostitution, and the trafficking of children for prostitution, begging and illegal adoption.
The Commissionâs cooperation activities in Cambodia are directed ultimately at reducing poverty but are also designed to reflect the EUâs commitment to human rights and democracy, including equal treatment for men and women and the protection of children.
More specifically, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission has already committed almost EUR 1.9 million to UNICEF and Action by Churches Together/DanChurchAid in support of two large programmes to secure legal protection for children in Cambodia, as well as funds to support the development of local human rights NGOs.
Furthermore, in the Commissionâs programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for 2005 and 2006 for Campaign 2, called 'Fostering a culture of human rights', for which Cambodia is eligible, it is planned to address the issue of trafficking in children and women.
The campaign will also promote the rights of human rights defenders.
It will improve the protection of, and raise awareness about, the situation of those who work, at personal risk, to advance human rights through non-violent means, taking into account the recommendations of paragraph 13 of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders.
The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem, including the signature of memoranda of understanding with Thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries, participation in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking and the establishment of a Department of Anti-Human Trafficking in the Ministry of Interior in 2002.
I very much welcome these important initiatives and I have no doubt that these initiatives will also be welcomed by the Members of this Parliament.
But the practical realities and the evident difficulty of implementing these measures have been drawn to the attention of all of us by the recent events involving the NGO AFESIP, which has received support from Spain, the UK and the Commission.
These events have rightly given renewed concern to all of us.
The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation reacted immediately with a statement, calling for a full investigation and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.
On 12 December, the government announced the establishment of an inter-Departmental Commission to inquire into the events.
The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation joined other donors in a further statement to welcome this announcement and to express the hope that the conclusions of the inquiry would be credible and transparent.
I can assure you that the EC Delegation to the Kingdom of Cambodia, in collaboration with the Member States' missions in the country, will follow closely the progress of the government inquiry and will continue to report on developments.
Â Â  Mr President, please accept my apologies, but I had already said at the beginning of this debate on human rights that two prominent human rights activists, Mr Kovalev from Russia and Mrs Estemirova from Chechnya were here today to receive our groupâs Robert Schuman Medal.
Although you had extended a warm welcome to them, they were not actually here yet.
They have now arrived, and I would like to assure our two guests that we will not cease from the fight for human rights in Russia, Chechnya and throughout the world.
Commissioner, I can still recall how, one Thursday afternoon, this House declared its support for human rights in Slovenia and for that countryâs freedom.
Today, we have a Slovene Commissioner, and I hope that we in this House will live to see, one day, freedom, human rights and independence for Chechnya and Russia.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  The next item is the vote on the following motions for resolutions.
Â Â  Mr President, the end of paragraph 7 should be amended to read 'insists that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of privacy and calls for the immediate release of all persons held for such activity'.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to propose an oral amendment to section 8, the last third of which I move should read as follows: âin expecting action by Iran to address also other concerns of the EU regarding the fight against terrorism, the respect for human rights and Iranâs approach to the Middle East peace processâ, and I ask you to accept this proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that what we have voted on, and regrettably has been rejected, is the paragraph amended by Mrs Prets; it is not the amendment, but the paragraph as amended.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we will have to change the agenda, because, as I expect you already know, the President of Ukraine, Mr Yuschenko, cannot be with us today as planned, due to the weather conditions seriously affecting the whole of central Europe which have prevented him from taking off this morning.
Â Â  We had planned to dedicate a statement and a minuteâs silence to the memory of the Auschwitz-Birkenau tragedy today and I believe we must go ahead with that.
Ladies and gentlemen, today is a sad day of commemoration for the whole of humanity.
On a day like today in 1945 the soldiers of the Red Army liberated the Nazi extermination camp whose name has become engraved on man's collective memory.
It has become engraved on our collective memory as the name of absolute horror, of evil, in its most extreme form, of industrialised, planned and documented crime.
We are still all astounded that it could have happened.
But it did happen.
It is unimaginable, but it was real.
Today, a delegation from this Parliament, made up of the presidents of all the political groups, and the largest of the delegations to go to Auschwitz, will participate in the ceremony in tribute to those victims, together with former prisoners, Heads of State or Government of many countries and some of the soldiers who liberated the camp.
In that way, we will be paying tribute to the victims, but, above all, we will be remembering that evil that led to the deaths of millions of Jews merely because they were Jews, and of ethnic minorities, homosexuals and political prisoners of various nationalities.
It is an evil that affects all of us.
Of course it affects the victims and their descendants, but it also affects those of us who were not there, those of us who cannot remember because we did not see it.
Auschwitz should remind us of the battle between remembering and forgetting, the battle of memory against something we would like never to have happened, because people who forget their history are destined to repeat it.
The Holocaust is a great problem for the whole of humanity.
It is not just a problem for the Nazi murderers and the Jewish victims.
Its roots are deeply embedded in some of the characteristics which have frequently shown their hideous face throughout human history.
Today, 60 years later, we must continue to fight everything that made it possible: racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, interracial hate, the indifference of our society, which believes that it has nothing to do with it, until it finally realises that it does, that it also affects it, but by then it is too late.
To that end, and so that we do not forget it, we shall also vote today on a resolution on the memory of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the obligation to work every day, not just when the fascination of round figures, 60 years, â why 60 and not 59? â revives the memory, but every day, so that the values of our Constitution â peace, human rights, respect and tolerance â which are entirely contrary to what happened in Auschwitz, are spread and defended in schools, at work, on the stairs, in the street, in the bars, in everybodyâs shared daily lives.
Remembering Auschwitz offers us an opportunity to defend the values of our Constitution and to take this opportunity to defend human dignity, which was so horrifically violated in that place.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that we observe a minuteâs silence.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, following that moment of respect in memory of the victims of Auschwitz, the sitting is suspended.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have come to an agreement with different groups in order to find a compromise acceptable to the majority.
The compromise contains two points. The first part of our amendment would become an addition, while the second part would be the subject of a separate vote.
The wording that we are putting to the vote would therefore strongly encourage President Abbas to demonstrate his willingness to bring the violence to an end and would welcome the measures taken by President Abbas with this in view. The rest of the wording remains unchanged.
The second part of the amendment, that is to say the phrase whereby the Israeli authorities are asked to accept and implement the roadmap and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, would be the subject of a separate vote.
Â Â  Mr President, as colleagues realise, this resolution largely deals with the results of the very happy election in Palestine on 9Â January when 28 colleagues observed the elections, chaired by myself and with Mrs Napoletano as deputy chairman.
The resolution we are voting on not only deals with the approval of the election itself, but also the follow-up we expect the various organisations and institutions to take.
Paragraph 15 is inappropriate in this context.
It deals with the internal procedures in the European Parliament.
I have discussed with Mrs Napoletano and others the necessity to delete paragraph 15.
My invitation to the House is to delete paragraph 15.
Â Â  This amendment would affect the text as follows.
Firstly, there would be a specific reference to the estimated number of victims who died at Auschwitz, some one and a half million persons.
Secondly, the amendment provides for a reference to the 15Â 000 Russian prisoners who died there.
I ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, he is speaking on the wrong paragraph.
He should be speaking on paragraph 5, indent 2, which is the wording in Polish of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum.
Mr Sonik has just spoken on recital A, but he is supposed to be speaking on paragraph 5, indent 2.
Â Â  Mr Sonik, there has been some confusion.
What you must present now is your oral amendment to paragraph 5, indent 2, but you have presented something else.
So please now present your oral amendment to paragraph 5, indent 2.
Â Â  That is the case. I apologise for the mistake.
The amendment does indeed concern the inclusion in the resolution of a reference to the National Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum at OÅwiÄcim as a special Holocaust education and remembrance centre, along with the Holocaust Centre in Berlin.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to table an oral amendment to recital A. A number of discussions have taken place over the past few days and during the past hour, and I can perhaps go some way towards ending them by briefly explaining this amendment.
It is undoubtedly true that we are all faced with a difficult situation, in that on days like today every word must be weighed very carefully.
Whichever wording is used, our primary consideration must be the victimsâ dignity and the perpetratorsâ guilt.
In order to take everyoneâs concerns into account, I therefore propose that we amend the second phrase of recital A, the original of which read; âthe 60th anniversary of the liberation of Hitlerâs Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...â.
We propose that âHitlerâs Naziâ be replaced by âNazi Germanyâsâ, with the text then reading; â...Nazi Germanyâs death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau...â.
As I see it, this would convey Germanyâs guilt and special responsibility, whilst at the same time making it clear that it was the Nazis who placed themselves under the burden of this guilt.
It is a fact that there were German victims too, and this wording also commemorates them.
I therefore ask the House to vote in favour of this amendment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, after the many debates on this issue, I should like to confirm that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of this oral amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, could we have some clarity on this subject?
There are two separate amendments here.
The first â the oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group that Mr Sonik moved â is to the change the wording, which, in English, would now read: âa combined total of up to 1.5 million Jews, Roma, Poles, Russians and prisoners of various other nationalities and homosexualsâ.
Could we please vote on that first, before we come to the separate issue, that Mr Schulz has just spoken on, of Amendment 1 by the UEN Group to replace, in English, the phrase âHitlerâs Nazi death campsâ with âGerman Nazi death campsâ.
Two separate votes are required here.
With respect, the confusion has arisen not least owing to the services, which have put it all on the same line: recital A, oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group, and the amendment from the UEN Group, about which MrÂ Schulz spoke.
Could we have two separate votes, please, first on MrÂ Sonikâs oral amendment, and second on the UEN-Schulz-Poettering package?
Â Â  Yes, Mrs Ludford, we have three things: the amendment by Mr Sonik, the amendment just proposed by Mr Schulz and Amendment No 1 by the UEN Group.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Schulz is right; all our words and all their consequences are of enormous importance.
One thing is certain; MrÂ Schulzâs amendment has nothing to do with the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and should be regarded as an entirely separate issue, because the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group contains unacceptable statements that we cannot and do not wish to tolerate.
We would therefore ask that there be no confusion over this matter.
This was the first point I wished to make.
The second point I should like to make is as follows; we acknowledge that the two largest groups in this House â and rightly so â wish to reach a broad consensus on this issue, and this is why we are able to join this consensus.
We would, however, like to stress that some of the discussions that took place on this resolution during preparations for this session were â and are â unworthy.
This is a point we must emphasise.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that there is nothing left to add.
If you would put MrÂ Sonikâs oral amendment and my own oral amendment to the vote â incidentally, the aim of my oral amendment was to supplement the original text and to ensure that the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was rejected once and for all â we would have precisely what we want, namely a text that is in keeping with the dignity of this day.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Schulz has said that we must weigh every word today to ensure that it does justice to the victims and to the perpetratorsâ responsibility.
It took a very long time for my country, Austria, to admit its shared responsibility for the crimes of National Socialism.
âHitlerâs Nazisâ, which was the wording used in the first version of this resolution, makes this shared responsibility clear, as it implies that Germans were not the only ones involved.
Yet this shared responsibility is blurred again by the wording that has now been proposed.
I do not wish to drag out the debate on the issue, but I think it important that an Austrian should take the floor of this House today to join other Members in deploring his countryâs shared responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to voice a strong protest against what MrÂ Cohn-Bendit has just said.
It seems to me that his statements were based on a misunderstanding, as he said that some of the content of our amendment, tabled by myself personally, was unacceptable.
I cannot think what he meant, as my amendment concerned one single word.
I proposed replacing the word âHitlerâsâ with the word âGermanâ.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has not tabled any other amendments.
One may or may not be in favour of the amendment, but I wish to protest against deeming it unacceptable, because I do not consider that to be the case.
I must make it quite clear that my amendment only concerned the inclusion of the word âGermanâ.
The reason for this is that in recent days the people of Poland have been very upset by references to Polish concentration camps and Polish gas chambers in leading European newspapers.
Such references are quite simply incorrect and deeply offensive to the Polish nation.
That was the one and only reason for my amendment.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we have one amendment presented and some oral amendments.
We are not going to go back to a debate on the main substance of the issue.
Â Â  Mr President, I can clear up MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs confusion.
As I understand it, Amendment 1, by the UEN Group, just consists of the words âthe Germanâ instead of âHitlerâsâ.
Amendment 1/rev. was withdrawn because it was not accepted by the services.
I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring to that â if I may say so, a bunch of men is creating a great deal of confusion here by the failure to attend to detail â Amendment 1/rev. was withdrawn and, therefore, the question of deleting words like âhomosexualsâ is no longer on our agenda.
We are dealing with the oral amendment by the PPE-DE Group and then the amendment by the UEN Group â which Mr Schulz seems to be amending again â but not the rest of the revised amendment by the UEN Group, to which I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone in this House agrees that all those who took part in this crime â whether they were German, Austrian or of other nationalities â should be condemned, and this is conveyed by the phrase âNazi Germanyâ.
The key point is the responsibility of all those involved, and it is to this responsibility that we must draw peopleâs attention.
I therefore ask that a vote now be held and that Members consider the matter once again.
It is not a question of whether it was Germans or non-Germans who were involved; what matters is that we refer to all those associated with the criminal regime of Nazi Germany.
This is the gist of MrÂ Schulzâs amendment, to which MrÂ Poettering has lent his support.
Â Â  Mr President, after so much consolidation and solidarity in relation to amendments, I will ask you to accept one very small oral amendment to the last line of recital A, concerning only two words.
After the reference to victimisation on the basis of race, ethnic origin or religion, it is to insert âsocial classificationâ.
This is because we are insisting that Europe must not forget its own history.
Millions were deprived of all their rights, including their lives, for social reasons, the final solution with âclass enemiesâ.
âSocial classificationâ is a very soft wording and I would ask you to support those two words on the grounds of history.
Â Â  Mr President, I only wish to say that Baroness Ludford was right and that her interpretation was correct.
However, you did not allow me to speak.
It is obvious that there are some mental reservations and discrimination in this House.
Mr Cohn-Bendit did not know what he was talking about, as he was referring to an amendment which had not been tabled.
I would like our group to be respected in the same way as the other groups, otherwise the racists are the people who speak out of turn.
Â Â  Mrs Muscardini, at this point we are no longer debating the fundamental ideas.
We are voting on amendments.
Let us therefore continue with the procedure.
Â Â  . The conclusion of this protocol, in keeping with other similar protocols since May 2004, clearly demonstrates the global impact of EU enlargement.
Nonetheless, these protocols are clearly necessary, because there must be legal uniformity and harmony in the enlarged Union.
I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation.
Â Â  . The purpose of this proposal for a recommendation is to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and between the European Communities and the Republic of Croatia, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic to the European Union.
This is also a consequence of the accession of ten more Member States.
Indeed, the accession of those countries entails a range of legal adaptations, in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs, the economy and competition.
I naturally voted in favour.
Â Â  . The conclusion of this protocol, in keeping with other similar protocols since May 2004, clearly demonstrates the global impact of EU enlargement.
Nonetheless, these protocols are clearly necessary, because there must be legal uniformity and harmony in the enlarged Union.
I therefore voted in favour of the recommendation.
Â Â  . The purpose of this recommendation is to obtain parliamentary consent to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic to the European Union.
This is a necessary consequence of the recent enlargement.
The accession of those countries in fact entails a range of legal adaptations, in order that they can be placed on an equal footing in the areas of customs, the economy and competition.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The June List is voting against increasing the appropriations with respect to the Councilâs original proposal.
Digital content is most efficiently created and made accessible by the market or through decisions at Member State level.
Â Â  . The balance struck between the sum initially sought by the Commission and the funds made available by the Council, commensurate with necessary budgetary limitations, is a reasonable one.
I therefore voted in favour.
Most importantly, however, the eContent programme â in common with other similar initiatives â should be an effective means of enhancing the information- and knowledge-based society.
Â Â  .â As well as contributing towards the Lisbon Strategy and towards reinforcing Europeâs competitiveness in the knowledge-based economy, the multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, enables us to achieve satisfactory results in terms of economic growth, job creation, innovation and consumer choice.
This programme is designed for end-users, whether they be ordinary citizens, students, researchers, professionals who want to improve their skills or âre-usersâ who want to improve or exploit digital-content resources as a profitable activity.
The purpose of the ongoing Community project, as well as to facilitate user access to information, is to transform the content distribution sector and to reinvent the way in which companies, public bodies and governments interact with each other and with the general public.
It is therefore important for the development of Europeâs economy that funding earmarked for the programme making digital content more accessible be raised from EURÂ 135Â million to EURÂ 149Â million.
If so, the Community action programme will have a much greater chance of being implemented successfully.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  In welcoming the successful Palestinian election, the European Parliament should firstly emphasise the non-development of democratic structures during Arafatâs time in power.
It would also have been desirable to highlight the absence of demands for democratic reforms from other countries, together with the tacit support for undemocratic development in Palestine permitted during Arafatâs time.
The presidential election in Palestine was also made more difficult by large groupsâ wanting to sabotage the election and, by extension, the democratic process.
The resolution should also place clear demands on the new leadership to implement democratic reforms and should make clear the Palestinian Authorityâs responsibility for preventing terrorist acts.
At the same time, Israelâs legitimate right to enjoy security and defend its people against terrorist attacks must be recognised.
It is important here to emphasise the difference between the Palestinian terroristsâ systematic attacks on civilian targets and the Israeli Governmentâs interventions against terrorists.
What, finally, are missing are a condemnation of all terrorist acts, including suicide attacks carried out in the Gaza Strip, and an expression by the European Parliament of its deep sympathy for the victimsâ families.
Â Â  The June List supports the peace process in the Middle East and hopes that the parties can soon agree on the Roadmap for Peace.
For this to happen, the leaders of both Israel and Palestine must be able to demonstrate statesmanship and political courage.
The June List believes that it is the United Nations that has the main responsibility for mediating between its Member States and for preventing conflicts or bringing them to an end.
Throughout history, we have seen how neutral countries have had an important role in this work within the United Nations.
Even if we essentially support the main thrust of the resolution, we do not believe that the EUâs role within foreign and security policy should be extended.
We wish to protect Swedenâs freedom of action and the United Nationsâ unique position as an international peace organisation.
Â Â  . I welcome the reasonably fair and free elections of Palestine and commend the satisfactory manner the elections were conducted despite the circumstances due to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories.
The results of the presidential elections should be seen as an opportunity to re-launch negotiations between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authorities.
I urge Israel to fully respect the internationally recognised rights of Palestinians and call upon the Council and the Commission to develop another EU observatory mission in Palestine as compliance with the EU-Israeli Association Agreement needs to be enforced, notably Protocol IV of the Agreement.
Israelâs infractions of the Fourth Geneva Convention continue to be a grave concern of the international community whereby constructive efforts of Quartet members acquiescent with Israel and Palestine is imperative for furthering the development of a final and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The settlement is not only crucial for the Territories themselves but also for the promotion of peace and security for the whole of the Middle East and Arab World.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this joint resolution essentially because I agree that, as things currently stand in the Middle East, in particular in Palestine, there is a unique opportunity finally to resume the peace process.
Against this backdrop, the balance-sheet on the Palestinian electoral process is in credit.
There are some aspects, however, from which I should like to distance myself.
The international community, and the EU in particular â cannot treat the State of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the so-called âarmed Palestinian groupsâ as though they were equals.
A democratic state cannot be bracketed in the same category as terrorist groups.
Such obfuscation is unacceptable.
Â Â  . The Middle East conflict has been the cause of frequent instability and tension, and the international community has been dragged into repeated attempts to alleviate the political and economic deterioration that the region has undergone for a number of years.
Abu Mazenâs election as President of the Palestinian Authority has given fresh impetus to the relaunch of the diplomatic process in the region.
The new Palestinian leader has the opportunity to instigate new political dialogue with Israel, based on criteria of democracy, fairness and mutual respect, in which terrorism is something to be combated and effective and lasting peace is a goal to aim for.
In this new era that has just begun, it is also important that Israel gives signs of hope, good will and cooperation, and pursues its justified and legitimate struggle against terrorism in compliance with the principles of international law.
I voted in favour, in the hope that peace, which goes hand in hand with democracy â long established on the Israeli side and just beginning in Palestine â can finally take root in this most troubled region of the world.
Â Â  Dare one talk in terms of a thaw?
There is certainly a desire to believe that relations between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming warmer.
The signs are there: to begin with, the success of the Palestinian elections, and then the coming to power of Mahmoud Abbas.
The man who, in 1993, orchestrated the Oslo Accords has campaigned on the subject of the demilitarisation of the Intifada.
This amounts to more than just speeches; it is a conviction that has been constantly reaffirmed.
We have also seen the spectacular actions taken by the Palestinian security forces against the terrorists and those forcesâ deployment throughout the Gaza Strip, the Israeli moratorium on targeted executions, the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and, today, the announcement by Ariel Sharon of a meeting in two weeksâ time with Mahmoud Abbas.
Nor must we forget the support of the United States which, with this second administration of President Bushâs that has resolved to bring the process to a conclusion before 2009, is clearer and easier to interpret.
A window of opportunity therefore exists in which the European Union is committing itself more firmly than ever, as evidenced by this election observation mission, the largest ever delegated by the EU.
That is what is pointed out in our resolution, which I have voted in favour of, as, at my request, the unacceptable part of paragraph 12, which condemned the indiscriminate terrorist violence from both sides, has been rejected.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be brief.
I have abstained from voting on this resolution, obviously not because I do not acknowledge the suffering of the Jewish and other victims of a criminal national-socialist regime, criminal like so many other socialist regimes and dictatorships.
I did not vote for this resolution because I only feel disdain for people and politicians who use this suffering for their own party-political ends and for the fight against parties that want to continue to uphold European values and the identity of the European peoples.
I also regret that the present resolution does not breathe a word about todayâs anti-Semitic terrorism, about todayâs anti-Semitic attacks, about the fact that today in our large cities, for example in Antwerp, Jewish people are being attacked by Arabs and Islamists who are todayâs anti-Semites.
Needless to say, I also regret that the appeal to curb the free expression of opinions was made, because democracy is not possible without it.
Finally, I notice that Communists who have never distanced themselves from Communist regimes, which committed acts of terror and boasted concentration camps, were allowed to sign this resolution.
I consider this to be a scandal.
Â Â  Mr President, we intended to vote against this resolution if reference to German responsibility was excluded from the document.
As it happens, this amendment was adopted and we supported the resolution.
It is, however, very important to emphasise German responsibility for the Holocaust, especially since we have reports such as that in yesterdayâs , which mentioned Polish gas chambers and crematoria â gas chambers and crematoria!
This is what the press in Britain was writing yesterday.
We had to insist that Germany be mentioned in the document.
It has been mentioned, and that is why we have voted for the document; otherwise, we would have voted against it.
Â Â  . As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, we remember and condemn the horrific tragedy of the Holocaust.
We cannot, and must not, forget this tragedy, which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continentâs history.
Let it serve as a lesson to all of us for the future, so that we can combat the extremes that lead to intolerance, discrimination and racism.
I support the idea that the 27th should become the day on which, throughout Europe, we remember the Holocaust and pay tribute to its victims.
I am concerned at the growing signs of anti-Semitism and racism, and at the rise of extremist and xenophobic parties.
It is up to the EU and the international community as a whole, fully and effectively to promote and protect civil and fundamental rights in the Union and in the world.
The EU must remain faithful to the values that form part of its shared heritage, must strive to safeguard the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination and must promote social, economic and political integration.
It is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia, because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout EU territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures.
Â Â  This resolution deals with extremely important issues.
The concentration and extermination camps are among the darkest and most shameful aspects of European history.
Racism, extremism and historical revisionism must be vigorously condemned and opposed.
The resolution points out the need for such action in a clear and elucidatory way.
Conferences and awareness-raising activities are positive measures that can contribute to increased tolerance and a more humane society.
We are, nonetheless, of the view that it is, in the first place, the task of the UN and the Council of Europe, rather than of the EU, to arrange such events.
The Council of Europe operates with respect for democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law.
It also has more members than the EU and is, in that sense, more pan-European.
The content of schoolsâ teaching programmes is an issue for the Member Statesâ respective parliaments.
Â Â  . Racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are being cultivated and used as and when it suits capitalism, which is based on exploitation and suppression.
For as long as it has existed, Communist ideology has rejected these phenomena, distinguishing solely between the exploiters and the exploited.
Communists are fighting for the brotherhood of peoples and workers the world over, irrespective of gender, race, colour or creed.
That is why they are the primary victims of fascism.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote for the joint motion for a resolution, because it makes no mention of the tens of thousands of Communists and other anti-fascist fighters who were murdered in the Nazi concentration camps.
That is contempt for history.
The European Parliament is again failing to take a position on the official revival of fascism in the former Baltic States, where homage is being paid and monuments are being erected to Nazi collaborators.
Political forces which, being in the governance of the Members States of the EU, cultivate and foment racism, are making a show of condemning it in the resolution.
All the discussion about anti-Semitism is a bid to conceal the Zionist policy of the Israeli State, which is applying a policy of genocide to the Palestinians, like the genocide experienced by the Jews martyred in the Nazi camps.
The peoples of Europe must honour the 27 January and 9 May as they deserve, far from the opportunistic distortions of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . It is incredibly important to always accurately remember the atrocities committed at Auschwitz, liberated 60 years ago today.
Collectively we must share the guilt across the EU for all of the suffering inflicted on the victims of The Holocaust.
The European Union as it currently stands is the biggest safeguard we have against a recurrence of such horrors.
However, we can always work to strengthen our joint provisions to protect human rights and individuals from discrimination.
By remembering the grim past that the European Union has grown from it can help guide us in the most appropriate direction for the future.
Â Â  The real subject of the resolution I have voted in favour of is not only Auschwitz but also Dachau, Mathausen and those 23 concentration camps that give chilling and resounding echo to the nature of mankind, characterised as we are by oceans of darkness, as well as of light.
Clarity and divinity were, however, what was really needed for a genuine moment of truth to emerge.
Clarity was needed, without the verbiage that covered three pagesâ worth of resolution; clarity, without the mediocrity of dismissing Christendom as just one more belief system; clarity, without the indignity of forensically listing the nationalities of martyrs or, above all, of hunting for a name to describe the executioners â a process that has seen plenary carefully weighing up oral amendments that proposed âNaziâ as a designation, as if the Holocaust could be reduced to a handful of âBâ movie villains, with no account taken of the blame attached to the tide of descendants of the Goths, Visigoths and Ostrogoths who, under the name âGermanâ, have made others experience the brutality of their thoughts and vices.
Divinity, that of the breath and of the Spirit, was needed because what was really necessary here, as in the European Constitution, was reference to God, not as an object of belief but as a higher law independent of Man, who clearly has a dual mentality: part reptilian, making a Hitler out of one Austrian; and part divine, making a Mozart out of another.
Â Â  . Today, we commemorate the atrocities of a large and powerful state that was founded upon the principle of inequality of people, and which therefore thought it was entitled to starve and subsequently slaughter peoples it considered undesirable in its own country and in other countries.
It is important that this is now widely condemned and that virtually everyone wants to prevent a repeat of it.
Even the parties represented in this Parliament who can be associated most with the Nazi past have not voted against the resolution but abstained, one of the arguments being that my group is also one of the parties submitting the resolution.
My group was divided over the text, because it appears that the major role of Communists in the resistance to Nazi barbarism was concealed on purpose, and without amendments, one could be forgiven for thinking that Poland shares the responsibility with Nazi Germany for the destruction of millions of Jews.
As a descendant of the victims who were killed in Auschwitz, I do not so much consider the precise text as I do the extent of the condemnation.
Auschwitz should teach us that that humanity can only survive on the basis of human dignity, equality and solidarity.
Â Â  . Sixty years after the liberation of the Auschwitz camp there is little more to be said, except that we must constantly remember.
After that, all that remains is silence.
Each image reminds us of the horror of human complicity, and the eternal risk that this might happen again, because we do not know how far evil can go.
This is why all mechanisms to promote peace and freedom are so crucial.
Human beings, after all, are capable of both wonderful deeds and abominable behaviour, as history has shown.
Â Â  . Today we commemorate one of the most troubling dates in the history of the human race: the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.
It was a joyful day for the survivors, the liberators and the entire civilised world; yet it was also a day of profound pain and shock at the stark realisation of the extraordinary scale of the atrocities committed.
Auschwitz must never be forgotten, and there can be no tolerance for attempts at rewriting our shared history in such a way that the constant, methodical and premeditated massacre of millions of innocent people goes unnoticed or is glossed over.
I feel that there is still much to investigate with regard to the actual scale of the crimes committed during the Second World War.
I am also concerned at the fresh outbreak of anti-Semitic attacks and incidents, perpetrated and incited mainly by extreme left-wing organisations and Islamic radicals, as well as the Nazi extreme right.
I vehemently condemn such acts.
Europe, which considers itself tolerant, must, in this instance, show character and be resolute in combating this kind of organisation and activity.
If the Nazi atrocities are to serve some purpose, let it be that, in remembering this darker side of history, we can be morally armed for the struggle to ensure that barbarities such as Auschwitz are never repeated in the biography of the human race.
Â Â  There are just a few hundred of them now, in the cold and the snow of Auschwitz: the survivors of the survivors, the last sentinels.
They are still there, still standing to tell of what was the absolute evil, indeed the quintessence of evil.
Upon them is the gaze of the world and of the inhabitants of this century, 60 years after the Holocaust.
My heart and spirit are in Auschwitz today, with them and all the others, those who did not return.
As this era, that of the last witnesses, draws to an end, it is our absolute duty to consider how this memory is to be passed on without them.
We owe them truth.
To them first of all, but also to our children and to future generations, because those who would insensitively deny the Holocaust or, worse, attempt to trivialise it, have not waited for the survivors to disappear before trying to demean this most singular of memories.
What we are requesting, and what we are fighting for, is to have the Holocaust taught in our schools, with knowledge serving as a barrier against racism.
Auschwitz was at the heart of Europe 60 years ago.
That past must not disappear from sight, ever.
Â Â  . It is essential that children should understand the appalling and unique nature of the Holocaust, and Holocaust education should certainly be included in school curricula.
Children also need to understand the consequences of regimes based on totalitarian ideologies â the Nazi responsibility for the Holocaust is clear; the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and China have also committed mass murder on an enormous scale.
Parliamentâs resolution includes the suggestion that âEuropean citizenshipâ should be a âstandard element in school curricula throughout the EUâ.
I do not accept that the EU has any competence or responsibility to determine the content of the school curriculum in the United Kingdom and I reject the idea of any programme of education seeking to advance the false concept of âEuropean citizenshipâ.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Prime Minister of Pakistan having visited this House this week, I should like to remind everyone that the parliaments in Pakistan have repeatedly demanded that democracy be implemented, and called on PresidentÂ Musharraf to separate his civilian and military functions.
He promised not to appear again in public in military uniform as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005, yet nothing has changed and he continues to do so.
I believe that this House has always supported democracy and opposed dictatorships.
We should therefore support the parliaments in Pakistan in their calls for more democracy, and, during our contacts with the Pakistani authorities, urge that PresidentÂ Musharraf keep the promises he has made.
Â Â  A lot of blood was shed in the battle to achieve the right to freedom of speech, which is sacred to all democrats of Europe.
This especially applies to those European nations that have only recently fought for and gained their freedom of speech after having been freed from communist dictatorship.
It was this right that Hungarian revolutionaries sacrificed their blood and their lives for in 1956, and a very valid and extraordinary historical and emotional political cause is needed to infringe this sacred right.
A worthy cause, not unlike many of the recent proposals advocating a ban on the use of the much-hated Nazi symbol, the swastika, in homage to the victims of Nazi atrocities and guided by responsibility towards future generations.
Unfortunately, the history of the reunited Europe includes another evil totalitarian dictatorship, red Communism, which, during its short 20th-century reign, was also responsible for the systematic murder of millions of innocent people.
Therefore, if the Union wishes to propose a ban on the swastika, I suggest adding the symbols of the hated and bloody communist dictatorship as well.
Such a ban has existed in Hungary for over ten years.
No more Nazism in Europe, no more communism in Europe!
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, communities of nations cannot be built upon lies and a false interpretation of history.
If we dispense with historical truth, we may well heighten the threat posed to some by the new ideology of death and contempt for the individual.
Allow me to remind Europe and the world that the Second World War was started by the Germans, who were possessed by hideous convictions on racism and death.
Six million Poles died in that war.
On the territories occupied by them, and notably in Poland, the Nazis created numerous death camps where torture and forced labour also took place.
Auschwitz was the largest of these camps, and it was conceived in order to eliminate the flower of the Polish nation.
Some four million people of different nationalities, including Jews, Poles, Roma, Russians and others, died in that place of unspeakable suffering.
Every one of the lives lost there is of equal value.
It would be unworthy of us to play dirty games on the graves of millions of our innocent brothers and sisters.
We must not demean ourselves by seeking advantage from their deaths.
Above all, we are duty bound to remember, honour and pray for the victims murdered by the Nazis.
Let humble reflection on the tragedy of Auschwitz cleanse the guilty and be a warning to todayâs world.
We must learn from the truth about Auschwitz.
As long as we continue to allow the innocent to be slaughtered in todayâs society, we will have failed to grasp that truth.
I am referring also to the slaughter of unborn children.
Every individualâs life is sacred.
We need to learn from the example of love and reconciliation shown by the holy martyrs of Auschwitz; Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish monk, and Edith Stein, a Jewish nun.
Saint Maximilian, Saint Edith, Sister Benedicta of the Cross, pray for us.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that Mr Borrell is not in the Chair.
After the Barrot affair, I know there is a great desire to stop discussing any difficulties there may be with this Commission but, given that I got that one right, I would like to think that Mr Borrell will take the letter that I hand-delivered to him a couple of weeks ago rather more seriously.
There are very grave doubts about the hearing of Commissioner Kallas, who, as you know, is in charge of the anti-fraud drive within the European Union.
He gave an incorrect date, there was a mistranslation of a question and, in my view, he gave some very misleading information to this Parliament.
I have written to Mr Kallas asking for some correct answers, and Mr Borrell received a copy of that letter.
So, through you, I am asking Mr Borrell to ensure that we get some correct answers from Commissioner Kallas, for, if Mr Borrell does not do that, then this Parliament and the whole hearings process will fall further into disrepute.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, last week proceedings were opened in the German Parliament concerning large-scale infringement of the law, corruption and collaboration with criminal organisations by officials at German consulates, with the consulates in question mostly located in Russia, Ukraine and Albania.
This is not a new phenomenon, and it does not only concern Germany.
It is actually a problem for the whole of Europe, because third-country citizens with links to organised crime can obtain travel documents illegally.
They then pose a threat to the security of the whole European Union, as they can of course move freely over the territory of the whole of the Community.
To date, attention has focused mainly on the new Member States, which have been criticised for corruption amongst those responsible for internal security and for a lack of transparent procedures.
Special clauses on protection are in force, and the new Member States are being monitored to ensure they meet their commitments in connection with assessing their readiness to become part of the Schengen area.
The controls applied to the old Member States regarding their implementation of these commitments are not at all as strict.
Would this not be an appropriate opportunity to dispel the myth that corruption and irregularities of this kind are particularly rife in the new Member States?
In my view, the Commission and the Council should devise an assessment process applicable to all Member States equally.
Such a process would also cover procedures and practices for issuing visas.
Â Â  Mr President, for 16 years now the family of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane has campaigned for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his murder.
Clear evidence has emerged that the police, the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder.
Former Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Finucaneâs murder and identified the basic requirements for a public enquiry.
One of these was that the tribunal should have full power to subpoena witnesses and documents, together with all the powers usually exercised by a commissioner in a public enquiry.
However, the British Government has recently published a draft inquiries bill.
This bill is a wholesale departure from both Irish and British Government agreements and the Cory recommendations.
It gives a British Government minister the power to determine whether an inquiry sits in private and what material is withheld.
These provisions attack the very independence essential to any inquiry.
The British Government is continuing to hide the truth of Mr Finucaneâs murder for its own political reasons.
The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2, any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory.
Today I raise this matter and put the British Government on notice that it cannot hide the truth from the Finucane family or the European Parliament for much longer.
Â Â  Mr President, this week has seen a very remarkable occurrence: the European Union, on one issue at least, finds itself in complete agreement with the UK Independence Party.
How did this come about?
Earlier this week, Mr Michael Howard, Leader of the Conservative Party, announced policies supposed to halt the flow of uncontrolled asylum seekers into Britain.
However, EU officials quickly informed him and the British public that this is an area of policy, like so many others, that is now under the control of the European Union and not the British Government.
Not that Mr Howard was being honest anyway: Conservative MEPs in this place voted in favour of Turkish entry and are also in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian entry.
The Tories pretend to be against unlimited immigration at home, but here they support giving the right of entry into Britain to an additional 94 million people.
The only way for Britain to regain control of its immigration and asylum policy is through the UK Independence Partyâs policy of Britainâs unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to certain statements made by MrÂ Buttiglione, the Minister for European Affairs in the Italian Government.
These statements were detrimental to the image of the European Parliament, and were made in January, when MrÂ Buttiglione gave an address at the University of Lublin during an official visit to Poland.
The address was subsequently printed in , the leading Polish daily, under the striking title of âThe humiliation of a Christianâ.
MrÂ Buttiglione complained that the European Parliament did not endorse his candidature for Commissioner because of his views on homosexuality.
He failed to mention his opinions on the role of women, single mothers or asylum policy.
He levelled accusations at us, alleging that a powerful Brussels lobby wishes to impose on all Member States the recognition of same-sex marriages and the active promotion of a homosexual lifestyle by all countries.
I shall spare you his other accusations and come to my conclusion, which is the following.
MrÂ Buttiglione states that it is essential to reform the European Parliament so as to avoid future injustices of the kind perpetrated against him.
There is a threatening ring to such a statement on limiting the rights granted to Parliament by the Treaties, made by someone who is a Minister for European Affairs and failed candidate for Commissioner.
I leave you to make your own ethical and political assessment of the statement, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  On the 60thÂ anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, the world, and notably Europe, chooses to forget Hitlerâs words when he told his followers that their first task was to wipe Poland off the face of the earth.
The aim was to do so by brute force, and they were to be brutal and show no mercy.
The Nazis sent people to Auschwitz simply because they were Jews, Poles, Roma or Russians.
The innocent were slaughtered on the streets in the name of a hideous ideology.
Whole nations were exterminated, and sadly the atrocities continued after the end of fascism.
People are still being killed every day.
There are many doctors engaged in ending the lives of thousands of patients, including newborn infants.
The killing of unborn children is widespread, and some 50Â million of them die every year.
Millions more children are starving to death, and many are the victims of sexual exploitation.
In the course of adapting itself to the EU, Poland was transformed into a market economy.
The economy was ruined, which led to unemployment, poverty and the collapse of health care.
This will result in the gradual extermination of the Polish nation.
At the same time, history is being falsified in a slanderous manner, and it is being implied that the Polish people took part in the Holocaust.
Poland survived two totalitarian regimes, and this is why it has taken it upon itself to sound a warning against what the Holy Father has termed the civilisation of death.
Beware of the cult of money, and of perceiving the market as the only purpose of life, as this is bound to result in the annihilation of Western civilisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a major debate on the economic future of the European Union is currently under way.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to make a strong protest and appeal to all upright Members of the European Parliament and of national governments in Europe who claim to long for a great and strong European Union based on the principles of honesty, social justice and solidarity.
Moves towards a 20% cut in the current European budget will inevitably mean that future development of the Union will be at the expense of its smaller and less-developed members.
The latter actually need considerable investment, particularly for infrastructure, so as to have equal opportunities for development.
I therefore believe that a policy of this nature runs counter to all the ideals that are supposed to underpin the European Union.
It creates social inequality and injustice and transfers costs to the poorest countries.
This is unfair, and I call for a review as a mater of urgency.
After all, we cannot have more Europe for less money, and richer countries cannot change policies following the admission of poorer ones, when they had previously promised them substantial resources.
Â Â  MrÂ President, euthanasia was first legalised in the Netherlands, and sick newborn babies are being killed there completely irresponsibly.
The authorities are quite indifferent to this.
Infanticide takes place at the Academic Hospital in Groningen, and hospital representatives have admitted that euthanasia was practised there on four children in 2003.
According to the Dutch Ministry of Justice, some 30 children have been killed in this way since 1997.
The Dutch authorities have failed to react.
Practising euthanasia on sick newborn babies amounts to murder and is on a par with the actions of the Nazis, who eliminated the sick from society.
It is an infringement of the most fundamental human right, the right to life.
Killing sick children by administering a lethal dose of sedatives is an act of unspeakable barbarism.
Europe has gone as far as protecting even the rights of animals, yet at the same time defenceless newborn children are being killed.
I move that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take up the matter, and that Parliament should hold a debate on practising euthanasia on children.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago in Cyprus a terrible, atrocious crime took place.
A father, a mother and their 15-year-old daughter were abducted from their home and shot at close range just outside Nicosia in the unoccupied part of Cyprus.
Five Turkish Cypriots are very strongly suspected of being the assailants in this case.
The Cypriot police issued warrants for their arrest but unfortunately they have managed to cross into the occupied part of Cyprus.
In the occupied part of Cyprus, illegal police are holding them and are protecting them against being handed over to the legal Cypriot police.
I ask you to use your offices, Mr President, to convince the illegal regime in the occupied part of Cyprus, and perhaps also to convince the Turkish Government which is their guardian, to hand them over to the legal police to be tried.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again become aware of weeping and wailing in European Commission circles over the alarmingly high cost of translation into national languages within Parliament and other European Union institutions.
The Commissionâs crocodile tears really are ridiculous.
The cost has indeed exceeded EURÂ one billion this year, but it must be recognised that this is also a matter of demonstrating an appreciation of the value of linguistic and national diversity.
It is precisely that diversity, together with the respect for national identity which is largely expressed through the use of the language, that ensure acceptance of the concept of the European Communities by the citizens of the Member States.
I would suggest that those seeking to save by reducing translation should consider cutting costs elsewhere.
The best way to do so would be by reducing their own salaries.
Â Â  I would like to draw the Parliamentâs attention to a rather unsettling development in Romania.
Lately, Romanian authorities have been disrupting the screening of a film about the Trianon Peace Treaty by police action, as they claim it conflicts with state interest.
The film merely expresses an opinion and thus does not violate any laws.
This action of the Romanian authorities is incompatible with European democratic norms, which have been voluntarily accepted by the Romanian State as part of their bid for membership of the Union, and it also violates the norms of universal human rights.
This is the message I would like to articulate: the Romanian authorities must put a stop to this action.
Â Â  Mr President, I would appreciate it if your bench would occasionally look in this direction.
I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz.
Therefore, I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose.
On the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz, it is very important that we remember and honour the Jewish victims and the other national victims, like the Poles, Russians etc., who died in Auschwitz.
However, one group has been completely forgotten â the group that Hitler first attacked and continued to attack to the very end, in every concentration camp and in universities and hospitals throughout the Reich: the disabled.
In fact â not in Auschwitz but in other concentration camps â the ovens were made originally to eliminate disabled people.
Disabled people of all nationalities were exterminated for the simple reason that they were disabled.
Of all the groups, none are currently in threat of their lives simply because they belong to that grouping â except the disabled.
The disabled remain forgotten.
In most countries with abortion, and in those countries with euthanasia, people can now be exterminated simply because they are disabled.
I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims, but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect, which is what Hitlerâs Reich was looking for.
Â Â  Mrs Sinnott, the Presidency would beg your forgiveness because we did not notice that you were asking for the floor for an oral amendment.
Please understand that there was great confusion in the Chamber at that point and I did not see you.
Please forgive me.
Â Â  Mr President, with a heart and a half I forgive you!
I am very short but would appreciate it if you would look over here occasionally!
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 January.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important for the President to make two statements on two events, one that has already taken place and one that has yet to take place, which affect us directly.
Firstly, as you know, the first of the planned referendums on the ratification of the European Constitution took place yesterday in Spain.
As you also know, the result of this referendum was 76.7% in favour.
I would remind you that a month ago this House approved the European Constitution by a majority of 74%; the support of the Spanish people has therefore closely reflected, and in fact exceeded, this Parliamentâs support for that draft.
We could say that the result of the vote in Spain on Sunday is very similar to the vote in Strasbourg when this Parliament debated the resolution relating to it.
The turnout was slightly less than that for the last European elections in Spain and also very close to the average across all 25 countries of the Union.
I believe that on the whole we can see the result of the process in Spain as being very similar to the vote of the Members of the European Parliament and, therefore, as President of Parliament and also in my capacity as a Spanish citizen, I am very pleased with the result.
Immediately after hearing it I congratulated the President of the Spanish Government and all the political groups who had participated in this process.
The second communication refers to the visit to Brussels of the President of the United States.
The visit by President Bush this week is being presented as a meeting with the European institutions.
He is coming to Europe, but he is coming, amongst other things, to meet with the European Union and that means with the Unionâs institutions.
As President of the European Parliament and supported by all of the political groups, we have taken the view that our institution (the European Parliament) could not be absent from these meetings; we believe that the strength of the Unionâs institutions and the image of the European Union, in particular with regard to its relations with third countries and more especially with regard to the transatlantic relationship, is linked to the proper functioning of the institutional triangle: Council, Commission and Parliament.
To this end, I have held talks with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, and I have kept the Conference of Presidents constantly informed about the progress of those talks, and I can tell you that following the exchange of letters that took place last week, and having heard the opinion of the political groups and also speaking by telephone with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, I can tell you that the President of the European Parliament, on behalf of this institution of course, will participate in the meeting which the 25 Heads of State or Government will hold tomorrow with Mr Bush in Brussels.
It is not a meeting of the European Council in the real sense, but nevertheless, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, and MrÂ Barroso for agreeing that the Presidency of the European Parliament should be present at this meeting, and I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude for what they have done to bring this about and thus to strengthen the European Unionâs institutional triangle, which I referred to just now.
I will not, therefore, be able to be here in Strasbourg.
Do you wish to say anything in this regard, MrÂ Poettering?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were delighted to hear what MrÂ Borrell had to say on the American Presidentâs visit to Brussels, and we agree entirely with his comments.
Our group has always been very much in favour of the President of the European Parliament being present during this visit, whichever institution held the meeting.
I would call on the European Council and the governments to ensure that a discussion of the kind we have seen over the past few days and weeks is not repeated in future.
I should like to express my wholehearted thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, for having made it possible to achieve such an outcome, but there should be no more discussions of this kind.
It should be self-evident that Parliament is involved whenever a president â in this case the American President â visits the European institutions.
I hope, Mr President, that your visit to Brussels tomorrow will be successful.
The European Parliament is the epicentre of developments in Europe, and your presence at tomorrowâs meeting is therefore to be welcomed.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Poettering.
In any event, allâs well that ends well.
Regardless of the details of the process, tomorrow the three institutions will be present and I would like to make it very clear that the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have always agreed on the need for that to be the case.
If there has been any difficulty, in no way has it been caused by them.
Â Â  The next item is the order of business.
The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 17 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
No amendments have been proposed to the agenda for Monday or Tuesday.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has proposed including the issue of the situation in Lebanon following the assassination of former Prime Minister, Mr Hariri, in the Council and Commission statements on EU relations with the Mediterranean region.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not sure whether I have correctly understood the formal announcement you have just made.
Our group would agree to the situation in Lebanon being included in Wednesday morningâs debate on the Mediterranean region.
We would then be able to consider an appropriate way of discussing the issue in greater detail in March, perhaps on the basis of an oral question to the Council and the Commission.
This would allow us to leave the agenda as it stands, and then to discuss the issue in more detail in March.
I was somewhat surprised to have been given the floor, but I hope that I have been able to help resolve this minor problem.
Â Â  I understand then that the request has been withdrawn.
Â Â  If this is how the proposal now stands, we are also fully in agreement with this solution.
After all, we do not want to interfere in Lebanonâs affairs; our aim is to ensure that the country is able to act entirely independently when taking decisions regarding its future.
What I am trying to say is that we should leave the agenda as it stands, and set ourselves the task of including a separate item on the issue on the agenda for the March part-session.
Â Â  Alright, we will deal with it within the item on the agenda which has already been included on the subject.
We are not talking about including a new and specific item on the agenda.
The Socialist Group has also presented a request with a view to reversing the order of the oral questions, on the expiry of the WTO Agreement on textiles and clothing and on action against hunger and poverty.
It is not a question of withdrawing either of them, but simply of reversing the order of the oral questions.
Â Â  Mr President, the proposal is as you have outlined it, and there is no need for any special explanation.
Â Â  Since nobody else wants to speak, we shall proceed to the vote.
The political groups have agreed to establish a margin until 6.00 p.m., so that all the items on Wednesdayâs agenda which should involve the Council can be dealt with before that time.
No amendment to the Thursday sitting has been proposed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am not sure whether I have misunderstood something.
You said that matters requiring the presence of the Council must be completed by 6.00Â p.m.
Does that also apply to Question Time?
Question Time with the Council is scheduled for Wednesday, and the Council will naturally need to be present then.
Â Â  The Council will be here for Question Time and for all the items for which it is required, and it will therefore also be present for Questions to the Council.
We have received two requests for urgent procedure: a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 as regards a specific action for transfers of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami in 2004.
In view of the urgent problems facing the fisheries sectors in the countries affected by the December tsunami, this proposal establishes an essential legislative framework allowing the Member States to authorise the transfer of small vessels to those fishing communities.
The second request relates to the proposal for a Council regulation imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities in view of the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
The urgent procedure is justified since it is very important that this Regulation be approved as quickly as possible in order to prevent the transfer of funds and resources that should be frozen.
Parliament will give its opinion on these requests for urgent procedure tomorrow, Tuesday, at the beginning of the sitting.
I am telling you this so that you can come tomorrow duly prepared to make a decision on this.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak because I am extremely concerned about the state of democracy in the European Union.
We are being told that it can be considered a great success if a small proportion, or just over one quarter, of the citizens entitled to do so vote âyesâ in a referendum, the most important public expression of collective will.
It is also coming to light that propaganda tricks were used during the campaign, for example that Spanish citizens were told that a vote against the European Constitution would be a vote against Europe, which is a blatant lie.
We are particularly concerned about public money being spent on the âyesâ campaign, and about the plans to spend even more on it.
This amounts to cheating Europeâs citizens, and we demand equality before the law.
Â Â  The Community cereals market is in a critical state.
At the request of Austria, backed by the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Poland, Hungary and France, the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries at its last session expressed its concern over the grave situation facing European cereal farmers.
The twenty-five Member States produced fifty-two million tons of surplus in cereals this year, more than seven million tons of which were offered for Community interventions.
Half of this, more than three million tons, was offered by Hungary.
Three problems have arisen in the Community cereals market.
First of all, there is the problem regarding the unfavourable changes in the Euro/Dollar exchange rate.
Secondly, non-coastal countries, such as the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, are at a disadvantage when it comes to competition for tendering.
Finally, my third point: the decrease in export aid presents further problems.
I would like to ask Commissioner Fischer Boel to take effective measures towards solving the problems of the cereals market.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with what has been said and I would like to thank the President of this Parliament for what he has said about the referendum held in my country yesterday.
It was a lesson in democracy.
The day passed without incident.
Everybody in favour of a âyesâ vote, everybody in favour of a ânoâ vote and also everybody in favour of abstaining participated fully.
Nobody can therefore give our country lessons in democracy, since everybody was free to act with total freedom.
Furthermore, an important radio station owned by the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Catholic Church campaigned constantly for the ânoâ camp and the results are there to see, but nobody stopped it from defending that position, which was as legitimate as any other.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few days ago, the President of the Greek Parliament, addressing the new President of the Hellenic Republic, told him that, in the light of the referendum â in the light of the endorsement of the Constitution â Greece needed to restrict its national borders and its national sovereignty.
This is dramatic.
The Greek people need to be told why, for the prosperity of Europe, they need to be deprived of land and sovereignty.
That is what was heard.
A way has to be found of at least allaying the concerns of the Greek people.
We want Europe to prosper, but not of course at the expense of the national borders of our country, at the expense of national sovereignty.
We need to ensure that, if the Constitution is passed, Greece will not lose land, as â I repeat â the President of the Greek Parliament said.
As far as Spain's referendum is concerned, 33% of the Spanish people voted in favour.
There was a very poor turnout ...
Â Â  Mr President, every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes.
This year alone, 190 million more of the highest-value banknotes in the world will hit our streets, and a suitcase full of these is worth seven times as much as a suitcase filled with 100-dollar bills.
In today's electronic world, banks do not need large denomination notes: they are of value only to criminals.
Why else did 10% of all the euros issued at its launch suddenly disappear into Russia?
Why is it still the currency of choice for the Russian mafia?
Why did Hussein invoice Iraq's secret oil sales in euros when he was trying to avoid sanctions?
Last year, the number of counterfeit 500-euro notes rose by ...
Â Â  â Mr President, we hope that the unification of Europe, at least as far as its economic and monetary union is concerned, means the lifting of barriers, means the lifting of borders in the economic sector.
This is the quintessence of the common market and of the single European market.
Greek euro-scepticism is directed at exactly what the European Union is; a European Union which has not progressed with the same speed as far as its political union is concerned, as far as acquiring a genuine, authentic European defence identity is concerned.
That is what the President of the Greek Parliament said.
She stated the obvious; that the economic borders have been lifted and that there is a single, homogenous economic area.
Â Â  Mr President, ever since this Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse the European Constitution a month ago, some of those who were in the minority have sought to disrupt and discredit the position taken by the European Parliament.
They waved banners in this hall when we took our vote; they tried to disrupt the official launch of the European Parliament's information campaign; they have made the claim that it is somehow illegitimate for this Parliament to present its view and its conclusion to the outside world.
Even when we have been invited by national parliaments to present our assessment of the Constitution, they have written to them and complained that we have accepted such invitations.
Today, we hear them claiming that the result of the referendum in Spain was somehow illegitimate.
Of course it had a low turnout it was not controversial and it had overwhelming and broad support.
But the bottom line is endorsement by a huge majority, which I am sure will be repeated in other countries.
Â Â  Mr President, this House should wholeheartedly welcome the referendum held in Spain and the Spanish publicâs clear âyesâ to the Constitution.
I believe we should thank the Spanish Government, and everyone else involved, for having informed and engaged the public, and in particular for having involved civil society in the referendum campaign.
I myself spent several days in Spain with other Members of this House, and was able to see how openly, democratically and peacefully the referendum passed off, providing a genuine example of European democracy.
What MrÂ PÄk has said in this House is utterly absurd, and I am sure that only a small minority of Members share his views.
At the same time, however, turnout for the referendum demonstrated the need for the public to be provided with even more information.
Mr President, we should call on the governments and the Commission to pursue, once and for all, a policy of proactive information on what the Constitution contains.
We have no more time to lose, as the dates for the next referendums have already been set.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks.
In view of the disastrous state of the health service in Poland and the hunger strikes staged by health workers, I should firstly like to ask that health services no longer be viewed in market terms, and that medical services be excluded from the services directive.
