Â Â  The services are checking on that, but I have not received any request for a split vote.
Bono will be pleased.
Â Â  â Mr President, I rise to ask again whether you have finished checking the split vote on Amendment NoÂ 36.
You were going to check it and announce the result.
My group asked for a separate vote on Amendment NoÂ 36.
You have voted only on the first part.
I would like you to vote on Part 2 now.
Â Â  I did not put Part I to the vote. I put 36 to the vote.
I have received no request for a split vote.
We have voted on 36.
Every other group has one vote, but the PPE-DE Group seems to have two votes on this.
We will now wait with the vote on the motion for a resolution for a short time unless there are any objections.
Â Â  Mr President, as we seem to be having a bit of a breather, I should like to ask Mr Corbett whether he feels that the voting procedure we have undertaken is in conformity with the new Rules of Procedure we drew up for this House to try and simplify voting.
The amendments relating to Mr Nobilia's report, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, were voted in blocks.
However, we are now having a very contentious, long vote on a report drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I believe is not in conformity with the Rules of Procedure.
Now you are asking us to delay the final vote.
Under which Rule are you doing that, Mr President?
Â Â  There are provisions in the Rules of Procedure for a delay.
That is why I asked if there were any objections.
I will not give the floor to Mr Corbett because I will not have him chairing the plenary from the floor.
Of course we have complied with the Rules of Procedure, otherwise I would not have proceeded.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report arose from a petition to the European Parliament signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe.
The organisation which organised that petition, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, is represented in the gallery today and I want to thank it very much for the effort it has put in to bringing this issue before the House.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are not being difficult about the final vote on Mr Herzogâs report, but I do ask you to have the vote now, because many Members are already leaving.
Â Â  â Mr President, with all respect to Mr Poettering, who wants his lunch, this is so complicated that we can vote on the other amendments first and then let Mr Herzog say what he has to say.
I regard these tactics as unworthy of a parliament.
If you have difficulties, people get the idea that ...
Well, life is like that!
We will carry on debating until he has given his opinion.
That is how it is?
Do you not have anything else to say?
Well, you should!
Â Â  Colleagues, the Rules of Procedure are clear.
The rapporteur is entitled to ask for a delay unless there are objections.
As there now clearly are objections, I shall give the floor to the rapporteur and then proceed to the vote on the resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, although in my view there are still many negative points regarding the substance of the text, I consider that we are enabling the discussion process on this important subject to continue with a legislative act, with the rejection of the Commission procedure without codecision, and with very clear signals regarding the rejection of liberalisation in some sectors and we are introducing a sound evaluation process, so I am voting in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs SandbÃŠk, the rapporteur, has agreed to change 'working' to 'being exploited', meaning that the wording would now be: 'this must extend to women being exploited'.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would just like to table an oral amendment to MrsÂ Boudjenahâs amendment inserting the word âNotesâ at the beginning: âNotes that the Action Plan for Africa announced by the G8 in 2002 has still not been reflected by precise commitments; calls on the G8 and the EU swiftly to help to make the necessary resources available so as to help achieve the aims set by NEPADâ.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .â The purpose of this report is to protect fisheries and the European Union tuna processing industry against competition from elsewhere.
This concern is even more disputable given that the Community tuna fleet is already the largest in the world and is using the whole worldâs fish resources, including those of many poor countries.
Moreover, the competition often comes from fleets which, even though they operate under the flags of other countries, belong to investors from the European Community.
The report is right to express concern about the reduction in tuna resources.
Competition, which causes waste and crises in all sectors of the economy, has even more disastrous consequences in the case of natural resources, which can be completely exhausted by fierce and irrational competition.
The only logical conclusion that can be drawn from this report is that a system based on competition is damaging and that the only sound way of managing natural resources would be to manage them collectively, in a planned manner.
This management should be done at global level and not with the sole aim of protecting European Union production, as tuna have the annoying habit of not respecting borders and territorial waters.
We abstained.
Â Â  . Community fleets account for over 20% of the world tuna catch and are among the main sources of raw material supplies to the tinned fish industry.
Portugal accounts for 6% of EU tinned tuna production, which in turn represents around 40% of Portuguese tinned fish production.
This illustrates the importance of the tuna fleet and industry based in less developed, outlying regions that are highly dependent on the fisheries sector.
The sector has lost competitiveness in the face of pressure from foreign imports, as a result of bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements, and has also been adversely affected by the last reform of the common fisheries policy, which took place in December 2002.
I therefore endorse the main idea underpinning this report, namely that the Commission draw up a study on the state of tuna resources, the fleet and the industry as a whole, and subsequently present an action plan for the tuna sector that provides a global framework of structural aid and a plan to protect the sector against competition from third countries.
We have always advocated the need for compensation or consumption subsidies to support the canning sector and for monitoring imports, in order to ensure that imported fish meets the same criteria for food safety and quality as products from the Community industry.
Â Â  In spite of some sound efforts, current fisheries policy still means that the EU is buying the right to misuse the natural resources of the poor.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
What is required is genuine reform of fisheries policy and a totally altered view of our relations with poor countries.
I have therefore chosen to vote against the aforesaid report in its entirety.
Â Â  .The aim of the report is to strengthen the few large fishing companies through economic and institutional measures in order to improve their competitiveness.
As excuses for this strengthening, the rapporteur cites the indisputably high nutritional value of the product, its economic value, employment, maintaining stocks etc.
These excuses conceal the fact that this activity concerns a few large companies in the ÎU and that the developed countries overexploit the world's marine wealth at the expense of poor and developing countries, in that the international fishing agreements are imbalanced, safeguarding as they do the rights of the strong.
The report's acceptance of subsidies to renew the fleet, export subsidies and duty on and technocratic obstacles to imports provocatively strengthens certain businessmen and makes the international division of labour even more unfair here, at the expense of poor and developing countries.
We wish to point out that, in the report, subsidies for withdrawing large vessels from the tuna fleet are described, and rightly so, as counterproductive and catastrophic, which is why it proposes that they be abolished and redirected towards renewing the fleet.
However, the same subsidies for withdrawing small and medium-sized coastal and short-haul fishing vessels are put forward by the ÎU as structural funds allegedly to restructure the corresponding sectors.
This contradiction again confirms the class policy of the ruling circles of the ÎU at the expense of small and medium-sized fisheries for the benefit of the large capitalist fishing companies.
Â Â  . Given that tuna is the most commercially successful fishery resource in the world, I congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for this own-initiative report on the tuna fleet and processing industry.
The report concludes that Member States stand only to benefit if the EU decides to do more for this sector of the fishing industry.
It is impossible to argue with such a conclusion, in view of the Community tuna fleet and industryâs loss of competitiveness, along with the major contribution of these areas to the EU â the canning industry provides around 40Â 000 jobs in the EU and tuna accounts for almost 60% of total tinned fish production.
I endorse the suggestion that the Commission should draw up a specific action plan and an overall structural support framework for the tuna sector.
I acknowledge the importance of the EUâs making absolutely sure that, within the Regional Fisheries Organisations, the fleet is adapted to available resources, which will, where possible, ensure stability and renewal.
This adaptation must involve combating the over-fishing practised by illegal vessels flying flags of convenience, and this might entail, as envisaged in the report, drawing up a list of those vessels that comply with the relevant rules and will be allowed in the fisheries, and imposing trade sanctions for vessels that do not comply.
Â Â  .â Everything should be smiling on the Community fisheries and tuna industry.
They have enterprising professionals of high quality, particularly in France and Spain, and are offering healthy, natural food, for which there is high and growing demand.
However, even though the Commission claims to be the sole embodiment of the âcommon European goodâ, it is itself weakening European competitiveness.
The draconian and constantly increasing constraints of Community legislation particularly affect security, monitoring, the health conditions of production, the protection of the environment and social protection, resulting in much higher costs for the Community fleet and its producers than those of their competitors.
The ideology of systematic and complete opening up of the market that drives the Commission is being applied to marine produce, with the permanent extension of the list of the countries benefiting from tariff preferences, with a particularly opaque system of certificates of origin, and the tuna loins quota and canned tuna quota opened for Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.
Our rapporteur highlights ââŠthe opening of the Community market to foreign products with less strict requirements and insufficient monitoring, which is damaging the competitiveness of Community products.â
It is time to put a stop to this discrimination imposed by the Commission to the detriment of our economies and jobs.
Â Â  .
This regulation is aimed at updating the current Community legislative framework relating to detergents, which dates back to the beginning of the 1970s and has been spread across a number of legislative instruments.
Despite certain limitations and the fact that it does not go far enough, the regulation does contain some excellent proposals aimed at preserving the environment, such as monitoring biodegradability, and aimed at protecting consumers, who must be guaranteed information on the composition of products, lists of ingredients and effective labelling.
We therefore support the compromise amendments tabled to the report before us and endorsed by seven parliamentary groups.
We regret, however, that labels are not required to carry explicit warnings of the risks, especially to children, of ingesting detergents, and that the use of images that may be misleading, such as images of fruit, are not banned.
Let us not forget that behind regulatory harmonisations there are always ulterior political motives towards greater market integration and the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of goods.
This leads us to have strong reservations, as it may undermine the right of Member States to legislate effectively on crucial questions such as the protection of human health, of the environment or of consumersâ rights, by imposing restrictions on products that do not comply with such rules.
Â Â  . What is negative about this proposal is that it gives priority to eliminating barriers to free movement.
On a positive note, though, Member States that have, for the protection of their environment, already put legislation in place that is stricter than this regulation will not be hindered in enforcing it.
The reason for this regulation is that by washing and cleaning, not only are contaminations added to clean water, but also components of soap and other surfactants.
For many years, attempts have been made to encourage the production of phosphate-free detergents.
This proposal now also tries to discourage animal tests, the addition of substances that break down with difficulty, toxic chemical substances and substances with hormone-disruptive characteristics.
The disclosure of the composition of detergents is indeed a major step forward.
Attempts are being made to that effect by requiring manufacturers to inform the government of their products' composition and by obliging them to list the actual content of preservatives, colour-protection products and aromatic substances on the packaging.
Openness with regard to harmfulness is to be welcomed, and so we should try to convince the Council of this, but a general ban on harmful substances would be preferable.
The proposed adaptations to the regulation in the longer term may be able to contribute to this.
Manufacturers may protest, but stricter measures are unavoidable.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would just like to say that I voted in favour of Mr De Rossaâs report out of my conviction that apes and other exotic species are among our planetâs valuable resources and that any modern and highly-developed system of protection for nature and the environment should protect and maintain these resources for the sake of future generations.
I regard Mr De Rossaâs report as an excellent piece of work towards this end, one that will contribute to the protection and maintenance of endangered species.
It also draws attention to the need to protect such species and raises popular awareness of that need.
It was good that Amendment NoÂ 2 was adopted; I had hoped that the two other amendments would be as well.
That has not happened, but, as what we have here is in any case a workable solution, I have voted in favour of it.
Â Â  .â Who could disagree with the general idea of protecting wild animal species, some of which are in danger of extinction?
The report, though, marks out the limits of its own proposals by rightly stating that the âissue of bushmeat hunting and its threat to endangered species, notably the great apes, must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviationâ.
No proposals are made in this respect, however.
How can proposals be made without calling into question the existing economic and social system, a system that is starving millions of human beings for whom bushmeat is often the only source of animal protein, particularly in tropical areas?
Under these circumstances, the methods of monitoring or retaliation proposed will be entirely ineffective in the majority of cases, particularly against organised gangs who carry out mass hunts, often for Western markets, and will affect only a few starving people.
We abstained on this report.
Â Â  . This topic would not have found its way onto the agenda had it not been for a petition signed by nearly 2 million people and had it not been for the Committee on Petitions, which took the decision, a year ago, to draft a report on the subject.
The 'bush meat' phenomenon is already enjoying wide public attention in Great Britain, but not yet elsewhere.
Despite this, it is important for development cooperation, public health and the environment that awareness of this phenomenon should increase in Europe and that a policy on it should actually be adopted.
The population in the developing countries is growing fast, while scope for trade and transport is also increasing.
In the past, small groups of people used to hunt wild animals living in the jungle for their own meat consumption.
These days, this meat of monkeys, reptiles and snakes is not only consumed by poor local residents, but is also sold in African towns and even exported to Europe as a delicacy for the rich.
The commercial hunt of animals and the felling of tropical forests result in the rapid extinction of animal species, including gorillas and chimpanzees.
Scarcely-controllable animal diseases, such as Ebola, are spread among people.
Development cooperation on the part of the EU takes no account of this destruction or of the environment in general.
I support proposals for eco-tourism, protection, education and legislation, even though they probably leave something to be desired.
Â Â  . In spite of the potentially ambiguous nature of the word âbushmeatâ and of evidence that hunting is not solely responsible for decimating wild animal populations â in Europe this is often a factor in protection and in stabilising numbers â I voted in favour.
The term âbushmeatâ, or wild animal meat, describes the food product of wild animals, the trade in which has had a devastating effect on the African Great Ape population.
The effect of the illegal trade in bushmeat has attracted worldwide attention.
UNEP and UNESCO established GrASP (Great Apes Survival Project) and there are many other organisations working to find ways to address the problem.
The EU has so far, however, paid only scant attention to the issue, as highlighted by the rapporteur.
On 12Â July 2000, the Committee on Petitions received a petition on the protection of species endangered by illegal hunting and trade, as part of a campaign against bushmeat.
By voting in favour, I am simply expressing my agreement that developing countries do indeed need greater support to ensure that, while local traditions are respected and particular account is taken of the shortage of food, we see greater rigour ...
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report as soon as Parliament adopted Amendment NoÂ 2, in which bushmeat is defined as meat from âwild animals in tropical areasâ.
Otherwise, an unfortunate situation would have arisen in which hunting restrictions and animal protection would have applied to meat from all wild animals, including Swedish species such as elk.
Swedish elk stocks are stable, while hunting is carried on in such a way that the species is not in decline, still less threatened with extinction.
Regulated Swedish elk hunting and the illegal hunting of apes and other wild animals threatened with extinction occupy quite separate worlds.
Â Â  .â By adopting the Herzog report, the European Parliament has adopted some excellent statements on âthe fundamental importance of the subsidiarity principleâ and on the need to respect the free choice of the Member States in terms of the missions, organisation and financing arrangements of services of general interest at national level (see paragraph 18).
At the same time, however, it has left the way open for a European regulation process which, if developed, would violate that subsidiarity and once again lead to protests in a few yearsâ time against intervention from Brussels.
As I said during the debate, I regret having to say that the previous French Presidency was behind the idea of a European legal framework.
The current French Government appears to have gone back to a more cautious position as, although it is still calling for a âcross-border legal instrumentâ, it wants to limit the content to a sharing of responsibilities between the Member States of the EU, authorised financing and monitoring procedures.
This is still too much, and the Commission will still find arguments for infiltrating and wanting to regulate everything.
In our view, it is sufficient to state that services of general interest fall under the competence of the Member States, who choose their missions, their organisation and their limits.
Â Â  .â Despite all the concessions made by the author of the report to the reactionary political forces working for the privatisation of public services, he now seems to have been overcome by those whose support he wished to obtain.
Amended or not, the Herzog report legislates for the disappearance of the public services, including their name, which has changed to âservices of general interestâ.
We are opposed to this report and, of course, to the amendments that make it worse.
Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supplies, electricity and waste disposal should remain or be restored as public services that are separate from the stupid and inhuman laws of the market, not to produce private profit but to satisfy collective needs.
Moreover, the process set out in the report translates into drastic reductions in staff, in other words a social catastrophe.
On the pretext of harmonising practices between the different countries that make up the European Union, its authorities are creating a serious social decline.
Nevertheless, harmonisation could be done on the basis of development of the public services and expanding them, especially by building social housing, if the European institutions and the Member States were serving collective, rather than private, interests.
We therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  .â Driven by the socialist and social democrat political family, the notion of services of general economic interest was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam (Article 16) at the heart of the principles on which the European Union is based.
As a step further, the European socialists resolutely committed themselves to defending and promoting services of general interest, as a fundamental aspect of our shared values and of our European social model.
Upon this concept, democratic and social guarantees for European citizens are founded: equal access for all, information, consultation and participation for users and employees, quality and universality and financial viability while respecting employment and collective guarantees.
Our battle lines have been drawn; our demands are clear.
We are asking for the missions, organisation and financing arrangements for services of general interest to be guaranteed and laid down in a framework directive, a commitment made by Parliament as a whole in November 2001 when it adopted the Langen report.
We want a democratic and pluralist evaluation of the social consequences of free competition to be conducted before there is any further liberalisation.
This is an urgent issue judging by the flurry of texts submitted to the European Parliament in order to speed up liberalisation all over the place, in particular in transport, postal services, energy, the water market, waste treatment.
Â Â  â The trend of the votes on the recitals, paragraphs and amendments of the Herzog report is a perfect illustration, even a caricature, of the weight of liberalism and the single market, and of their precedence over all other considerations in modern-day Europe.
Paraphrasing Jean de la Fontaine, it could be said of the large parties and political forces of the European Parliament, that ânobody died from them, but they affected everyone â
For a large majority in Parliament, and therefore much of institutional Europe, public service is at best a commodity like any other when it is not âa barrierâ to the happiness money brings.
I therefore voted against this report without any uncertainty or hesitation.
Â Â  . â Introducing high-performance and efficient services of general interest for all, that is to say services which play a full role in social and territorial cohesion, means not only acknowledging and asserting that these services of general interest are an essential goal of Member Statesâ economic and social policies and among the fundamental elements of our European model of society, but also that we adopt and defend the basic principles that serve as the operational basis of these services of general interest, namely the universality of services, continuity, affordability and quality.
Without the adoption of certain amendments, including those relating to the framework directive, it is these principles themselves that are likely to fall by the wayside; there is a risk of the drift toward ultraliberalism caused by sectoral directives becoming the norm.
I do not wish to take such a risk.
Without voting on these amendments on the requirement of a framework directive, I rejected the text at the final vote.
Â Â  . â The Herzog report attempted to reconcile the irreconcilable, championing liberalisation and defending services of general interest at the same time; hence the discordant voting.
Must we support this âhybridâ product which âhighlights the fact that liberalisation has not been to the detriment of the provision of universal serviceâ, which âconsiders the liberalisation to date in the gas market insufficientâ while considering that the problems encountered in the liberalisation of certain sectors make it necessary to assess the impact on employment in a pluralist and open manner?
The rapporteur, faced with his mutilated draft and having taken the ultraliberal forces of Parliament hostage, thought that, all considered, it was worth supporting.
As for me, along with all those who have not succumbed to Stockholm syndrome, I have kept a cool head.
The amended text is indefensible and I therefore voted against it.
Â Â  . â I voted against the motion for a resolution on services of general interest since the voting trends of the majority of MEPs do not give an objective picture of the consequences of the liberalisation undertaken to date.
Furthermore, they pave the way for the liberalisation of other sectors.
Today, as we have already asked in the past, we must hold a serious, pluralist and open assessment of liberalisation policy and make the conclusions public.
We must re-examine the liberalisation that has taken place, in order to make the adoption of a framework directive as effective as possible.
Furthermore, it is high time we definitively excluded some sectors from the prevailing competition policy at Community level.
This applies particularly to health, education and social services, including social housing.
Finally, we must guarantee the subsidiarity under which local or territorial powers are exercised.
This motion does not establish European services of general interest as an added value of the European structure but as a means of achieving the EUâs territorial, economic, ecological and social cohesion goals.
Services of general interest are an essential element of our social model, which we must defend and promote.
Â Â  . We voted against the Herzog report in the final vote, because we considered it fell short of what was required, having been watered down by proposals from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The odd improvement was made to the report in plenary, but the amendments that had been tabled did not change it significantly.
The final result illustrates the aggressiveness of the neo-liberal and conservative offensive currently sweeping through the EU, in the wake of rushed-through privatisations enshrined in the âLisbon Strategyâ and attempts to enshrine these in the Constitution last December.
The report is fundamentally biased against the public sector and against the role of the State in the economy, as it is based on the false premise that it is ownership that determines good management.
The clear aim is to feed the most lucrative sectors and public services to the greed of the major economic and financial groups.
The report endorses and encourages the process of liberalisation/privatisation in various key sectors and abjectly glosses over the economic and social consequences, from quality and access to public services, to job losses in the targeted sectors.
We all know that the expression âservices of general interestâ was not chosen by accident.
Its clear aim is to put an end to the concept of public service and, in so doing, to alleviate the Stateâs burden of responsibility.
Â Â  We voted against the Herzog report, which shows once again that this Parliament is no more in favour of progress than are the Commission or the Council of the European Union.
The ultraliberal majority in Parliament introduced this report as a paean to the destruction of public services.
To quote only one point from ten or twenty articles which are along the same lines, we read that Parliament âwelcomes the liberalisation in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy, which has led to modernisation, interconnection and integration of the sectors, has led to price reductions through increased competition, and has led to the creation of nearly one million jobs across the European Unionâ.
And it wants to speed things up.
What we see at work here is a mendacious dogmatism that collides head-on with the wishes of the European people.
It is regrettable that the rapporteur, like a significant proportion of European socialists, chose to vote for this report because it opens up the prospect of a framework directive on services of general interest.
But must we do it on such a liberal basis?
In this setting, only street-level activism on the largest scale can create a positive outlook in the face of the destruction of public services.
Â Â  This report is political trickery pure and simple because, in spite of the tragic comedy played out in this Chamber, right and left are basically on the same track, which is to say: destroy public services by forever subjecting them to Community competition law, a law which, as everyone knows, has always been the least discriminate instrument of the free market.
French MEPs belonging to the UMP party, bound by the decisions of their ultraliberal parliamentary group, voted against Franceâs better interests by approving a text containing numerous provisions that plainly doom the existence of public services in France.
As for the socialist-communist left, it has, in the name of blind European federalism, never ceased to call for the adoption of a âframework directiveâ on public services, a text that would inevitably involve Member Statesâ competences being transferred to the European Commission.
Resolutely opposed to the euroglobalist ideology that inspired this report, and which is itself a product of the shameful alliance of political federalism and economic ultraliberalism, the members of the were the only French members to clearly and coherently state their rejection of this new antinational and antisocial offensive against our public services.
Â Â  Trains used to run, planes used to fly, the post used to arrive, healthcare used to exist, schools used to teach and there was light, all thanks to national public services.
But the Commission of Brussels wants to privatise them, flying in the face of reason, fact and social concerns.
Intelligence takes a back seat as we slip from the glorious notion of services provided to the public, in the name of the common good and the , to the wretched concept of services provided by general interest.
Market integrationism flies in the face of facts when it refuses to see that private trains in Britain are derailing, that electricity in California is cutting out, that the planes of private airlines such as Flash Airlines are crashing and that American commercial schools are leaving souls helpless.
Social concerns are sacrificed because with liberalisation, there is two-tier access to healthcare, university, transport or even water: services for the rich and services for the poor.
All this is led by Mr Herzog, the communist rapporteur who has become âparty to the routâ of economic and social democracy.
Â Â  . I am an advocate of a Europe in which the economy is gradually brought more under democratic control.
This requires an entirely different course than that currently being pursued with the Green Paper on services of general interest, which makes Europe even more neo-liberal.
The Stability Pact is used as a big stick to compel Member States to liberalise and privatise important sectors of their economy, at the expense of democratic say and control over the social and public sectors.
Despite the acknowledgment that certain services must be accessible and affordable for everyone because social coherence and solidarity depend upon them, there is hardly any part of the public sector that is sacrosanct.
In fact, opportunities are being offered to place higher education, public health, social services and the provision of drinking water in private hands.
In addition, old sectoral liberalisation plans are strictly adhered to for postal services, gas, electricity and public transport.
The results of past liberalisation programmes are being extolled, mistakenly so, as shown by the experience of the Netherlands and of other countries, where, quite in contrast, the liberalisation of public transport and energy has proved highly detrimental to the inhabitants.
Despite what the Green Paper claims, they have become more expensive.
The provision of services has gone down and employment is in the balance.
My party advocates a course that is entirely different from the one described here and will therefore be voting against this proposal.
Â Â  .
I welcome this Report on the Green Paper on services of general interest. It gives Parliament the opportunity to outline the future for public services.
This should not involve unbridled liberalisation; it should involve a careful reflection on what has gone before and on what has and has not worked.
There are some areas where I differ from my colleagues in the Socialist Group.
I believe that public radio and television broadcasters who play a major role in preserving cultural diversity and identity should be exempted from the competition rules.
The same should be the case for charitable organisations which carry out a public service.
The last point I wish to make is that, when the legislation comes back to Parliament, there must be full engagement of that institution and that means codecision.
Â Â  While not without its critics, Community competition law does not preclude maintaining public services. This compatibility is established in Article 295 of the EC Treaty, and set out so that public services must respect rules of competition.
Although there have been corporatist protests from the eternal supporters of the status quo who, under the pretext of defending public service, only want to preserve their statutory privileges, we must also note that opening public services up to competition is ultimately a vehicle for modernisation and competitiveness.
The real problem here concerns the sharing of competences between the EU and the Member States.
In this regard, however, a âframework directiveâ defining âgood government in the area (âŠ) of services of general interestâ, a motion backed by the Left in this House, is absolutely unacceptable to the real defenders of public service: those who reject the pervading demagogy and support a Europe of nations, because it would end up communising public services.
The vital point in this matter is that competences relating to the organisation and functioning of public services remain the sole preserve of the sovereign States.
Â Â  . The creation and maintenance of services of general interest represents one of the pillars of the âEuropean modelâ of development, as it guarantees that, within a market economy framework â or rather, a social market economy framework â certain fundamental rights are sacrosanct.
The individual citizen holds rights, and is not merely a unit of production or a pawn of the free market.
I agree with the rapporteur that special attention must be paid to rural and socially disadvantaged areas, with emphasis on the outermost regions.
I also endorse his view that social services of general interest that carry out social security and social inclusion functions should remain exempt from competition rules.
I support the idea that, in accordance with the Treaties and with the necessary respect for the principle of subsidiarity, the Community must be neutral in relation to Member Statesâ options on forms of property.
The proposed clarification of the concept of services of general economic interest and of criteria for distinguishing between categories of services of general interest must not be allowed to lead to greater centralisation or to artificial standardisation.
It is essential that the public authorities responsible for such services should enjoy freedom of choice.
In light of the vote in plenary on the matter before us and given that proposals for a framework directive were not passed, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . Because the British experience of liberalisation has generally been a positive one, albeit one with unequal benefits for consumers and the economy, the EPLP concurs with the general approach of the Commission.
However, the EPLP believes there is a need for universality of service and for the protection of workers' rights and other social, environmental and economic benefits, both at the individual and the collective level.
To this end the EPLP has voted to support those amendments which focused on those areas.
Rather than a framework directive as called for by the rapporteur, the EPLP believes these issues should be decided on a sector-by-sector basis.
The EPLP does not want to halt liberalisation, nor does it wish to prejudice competition laws and regulations.
These are necessary in order for market reform to complete the single market and to achieve the Lisbon goals.
Â Â  As a former pupil of the âPublic Serviceâ department of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, and as a local councillor specifically responsible for maintaining local public services, I do not think that the best way to preserve the notion of public service is to adopt a European framework directive, which would affect the freedom of Member States to define the tasks they intend to entrust to public services, in accordance with the wishes of their people.
It is not for countries that have historically lacked a public service culture to prevent those which do possess one from providing these services when they think it justified to do so.
It is unfortunate that the incoherent and contradictory text resulting from the vote on the Herzog report will not clarify the debate.
While it does have its good points, such as reiterating the âfundamental importance of the subsidiarity principle, in accordance with which the competent authorities of the Member State are free to make their choice of missions, organisation and financing arrangements for services of general interestâ, at the same time it leaves open the possibility of imposing a uniform European definition of these services, which would deprive States of their regulatory power and would necessarily be inspired by a majority to whom the notion of public service is alien.
This is why I abstained from voting on the final text.
Â Â  I have today voted in favour of MrÂ Herzogâs report on services of general interest and have, in that connection, also supported a list of amendments that support the idea of a framework directive in this area.
In this connection, it must be made clear that we only want a framework directive that respects the principle of subsidiarity and that is confined to regulating services of a general economic character and does not therefore seek to regulate areas such as education, public health and services of general social interest.
Â Â  . HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria kill around 20Â 000 people every day, and thousands more new clinical cases are diagnosed.
These diseases are particularly prevalent in developing countries, especially in the least developed countries ravaged by war, poverty, economic decline and the collapse of essential public services, especially health care systems.
The harsh reality is that âmillions of people in developing countries continue to die each year from infectious diseases, most of which can be prevented and cured by medicineâ.
This is the profit-driven approach, an approach that commercialises health, adopted by the large pharmaceutical multinationals which are primarily based in developed countries.
Patents on medicines and lack of investment in the production of local medicines are thus significant hurdles that must be overcome.
Any minor progress in the framework of the WTO continues to come up against formidable financial interests.
The EU programme currently under discussion, aimed at combating these diseases, is to be welcomed, yet does not go far enough.
The efforts of the international community must focus especially on strengthening the human, institutional and infrastructural resources of developing countries, particularly in order to restore public services and basic health care systems and to ensure that medicine can be produced independently.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs Programme for Action entitled âaccelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction; outstanding policy issues and future challengesâ was based on three approaches: improving effectiveness, making medicines more affordable and increasing R[amp]D (Research and Development).
I endorse the rapporteurâs proposal to encourage patent-holder companies to grant licences that allow other companies to manufacture their products at lower cost; using safeguards in international trade agreements that can help governments to expand access to medicines and protect public health.
We need to see more R[amp]D and new medicines and instruments of diagnosis that are easier to use, more effective and more affordable.
Similarly, particular emphasis must be given to disseminating routine child and maternal health care, so as to reduce mortality rates.
The EU must not remain indifferent to such issues and its financial contribution must increase accordingly.
I voted in favour, as I feel that the problems arising from poverty-linked disease are so serious that only by establishing a broad range of far-reaching policies and strategies will we be able to solve them in all their aspects.
Â Â  . The OECD emphasises that 'Investment in health is an important means of economic development and substantially improved health outcomes are a prerequisite for developing countries to break out of the cycle of poverty.
If the health of poor people is to improve, a âpro-poorâ health approach is needed.
This goes beyond the health sector and includes policies in areas that disproportionately affect the health and economic security of the poor, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation.'
HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are direct causes and consequences of poverty, which particularly expose women and children.
I welcome the goodwill of the international community and I urge our governments to enhance respectful partnership, specifically in the field of health.
Nevertheless, I must abstain: the means proposed to fight the 'very high and rising' number of HIV/AIDS-infected women, is to provide 'appropriate sexual and reproductive health information and services', to protect against, 'unwanted pregnancies'.
Pregnancy is not an illness: children are a richness in developing countries.
This reveals another agenda which interprets reproductive health to include abortion.
However, this is not the position of the Council, which has clarified that 'reproductive health' does NOT include 'abortion'.
Until this is clarified by the Commission, I cannot support this ambiguous terminology.
Â Â  We voted against this report, which takes a cynically paternalistic attitude towards African countries.
For example, how dare it state that these countries âshould devote resources to establishing a strategy of sustainable, equitable and viable development opening the way to genuine employment of the right to food, health, education, housing and other necessities for African peoplesâ? Even in rich western countries, the dominant class deprives a large proportion of the population of these rights!
African peoples have to bear, however, in addition to those of their own privileged class, the far more considerable impositions of industrial and financial groups of imperialist countries.
From the time of the slave trade to the present day, where these countries are bled dry by the global banking system, through the pillaging of the colonial era, western capitalism has never stopped impoverishing this continent.
Today, the European Parliament, the parliament of the countries whose leaders can be blamed for reducing African countries to misery, gracefully leave these countries to repair the damage done to them over the centuries themselves!
It is deplorable.
Â Â  The subject is much debated, in as much as the very neoliberal tendencies of NEPAD raise legitimate questions among all those who dream of finally seeing Africa emerge from under-development.
I also support the criticisms made by the report, particularly with regard to the absence of democratic consultation of âcivil societyâ, of unions and even of national parliaments.
Conducting an independent study on NEPADâs impact on social rights, food safety, access to raw materials and protection of the environment is undoubtedly the greatest encouragement to emerge.
The fact remains that the responsibilities of the EU and of the G8 must not be relinquished, whether this means it is necessary to cancel the debt â which continues to drastically and unjustly suffocate budgets â or a reform and increase of public aid for development.
It is estimated that 64 billion dollars are required per year to achieve the goals set by NEPAD.
Fund providers must face up to their responsibilities.
Welcoming the Heads of State that established NEPAD to the G8 with great pomp is one thing, backing up words with actions is quite another.
Finally, the drafting of a legally restrictive framework accompanied by sanctions for businesses that contribute to conflicts would also be appropriate in preventing conflicts that are often murderous.
Â Â  NEPAD is without doubt a development project conceived and adopted by the African states, but it should not be looked upon as a project that will emancipate the African people.
Indeed, it is increasingly denounced, like the Cotonou Agreement, the WTO and the IMFâs structural adjustment policies, by sectors of civil society such as the Addis Ababa African Social Forum and the Peopleâs Forum held in Siby in Mali in 2003.
In fact, it is part of a neo-liberal logic, the actual consequences of which run counter to the objectives laid down.
There can be no appropriation of development at either national or regional level while the Washington Consensus, imposed on the current African leaders to later be taken over, provides for the private appropriation of the most profitable economic heritage by the multinationals.
Thus, the social rights and freedoms acquired over the last three decades of independence are being dismantled through the revision of national labour and investment codes.
The fact that NEPAD consulted the multinationals and the G8 rather than the African people says a lot about its idea of democracy.
As a result, we cannot vote for a resolution that merely criticises the lack of consultation while concealing the fundamental, harmful logic underpinning NEPAD.
Â Â  . This report on the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), a political initiative of major importance undertaken by five African Heads of State, as part of an ambitious project known as âAfrican Renaissanceâ, places emphasis on conflict prevention and on implementing support mechanisms for restoring and maintaining peace, action against corruption, which is essential for good governance.
The initiative is further underscored by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), which I also endorse.
I agree, furthermore, that it is essential to encourage the participation of members of civil society, including human rights organisations.
The role of women in African society must also be brought to the fore in development projects.
Notwithstanding the occasional criticisms made of NEPAD for its top-down approach, I feel that we must give the initiative our wholehearted support and must contribute towards improving its effective human and social impact.
We must help to remove hundreds of people from the mire of underdevelopment and play an active role in combating the corruption and tyranny endemic in large parts of the African continent.
I therefore voted in favour.
I particularly welcome this report, as I have striven for a new perspective on Africa, a new perspective on a forgotten continent and a perspective of fraternity and solidarity towards a brother Continent.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as a citizen of Venice who has therefore inherited a strong historical, cultural and linguistic identity â I recall the Most Serene Venetian Republic â I hope that all the countries in the European Union will adopt policies aimed at devolving the competences of the state to the regions, especially policies on state-sector education, culture and the protection of cultural assets.
We believe that it is precisely our cultural diversity and cultural identities that form the major attraction of this Europe, which should not try to centralise but should leave room for the regionalisms and identities of all the peoples it embraces.
I therefore want to underline the need to refocus on these identities in their own local areas, so that the great cultural heritage that unites all the peoples of Europe can be an example of democracy and especially of the great strength of our diversity in this our European identity.
Â Â  â As the report states, it is necessary to arrive at a legal framework under international law for the right to cultural diversity.
In addition â something that is very important from the point of view of the independence and regionalist movements such as the one I represent in this Parliament, the Lega Nord â the report quite rightly underlines the need for vigilance concerning the treatment of minority populations and languages, especially including indigenous languages, within the context of an enlarged Europe.
With regard to the protection of the languages of minority populations, the Member States are invited, where appropriate, to pay particular attention to the conservation of monuments, buildings and everyday implements, which form the material history of these cultures.
There is a need, however, for a much broader and more thorough measure to protect everything that makes up the immense cultural heritage of minority languages and peoples: literature, art, folklore, books and manuscripts, which are in danger of disappearing.
Within Padania, for instance, there is an immense linguistic cultural heritage, ranging from Piedmontese to the Venetian language, as mentioned by Mr Gobbo, to Lombard, Ladin and a host of endangered minority languages.
For them, it is vital that the devolution policy sponsored by the current Italian Government should be adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, we are committed to safeguarding cultural diversity in the Union and to promoting a pluralistic media.
However, we abstained on the proposals set out simply because we believe that they are largely inoperable and that other instruments can be used in order to achieve our objectives.
Overall, we concur with the rapporteur on the desirability of linguistic diversity, the definition of cultural goods as a public good, the desirability of public sector broadcasting and the undesirability of media concentration.
However, paragraphs 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 32 and 33 unnecessarily pre-empt the UNESCO conclusions to be drawn in 2005, let alone inhibiting, as they do, the room for manoeuvre on cultural areas in the negotiations in Cancun.
Â Â  Mr President, like the majority in this House I have voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs Prets on this very sensitive issue.
The problem is that whenever stateless nations of the European Union, such as the Basque country, try to implement approved guidelines, the French and Spanish authorities adopt a thoroughly contemptuous attitude.
Last week in Bayonne, people were ejected from a court of law and sprayed with tear gas because they had dared to speak in Basque and promote the use of the Basque language in public services.
Members of this House will shortly receive full information on this regrettable incident.
I must point out that the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, attached to this report, states that cooperation policy in the European Union is 'unthinkable without respect for and promotion of cultural diversity as an integral part of the identity of the political entities and communities involved.'
Â Â  . â The Radical Members voted against the report not only because it opposes the liberalisation of international trade and surrenders to cultural relativism, as well as protectionism, but also because it does not seem to understand the dangers of cultural and linguistic annihilation at the hands of nationalists and proponents of state control.
National policies that undermine linguistic diversity in the teaching of foreign languages â that is, the obligation to learn just one foreign language, English â are dominant in both the European Union and the acceding countries.
The European institutions themselves are often mono- or bilingual.
The resolution lacks any reference to innovative solutions to communication requirements on a non-discriminatory basis, for instance by envisaging the use of neutral languages like the international language Esperanto.
It also lacks any reference to the little protection afforded to the languages of indigenous populations and immigrants and to sign language.
Of the concrete proposals that have already found a certain consensus at an international level, I should like to mention the proposal by the Esperanto Radical Association for the Language Policy Observatory, which was also recently recommended by UNESCOâs 32nd General Conference.
There is indeed a need for an up-to-date picture of language practices and legislation and of the use and recognition of minority languages within states.
Â Â  .
I broadly welcome this own-initiative report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on preserving and encouraging cultural diversity, especially so during a fresh round of WTO talks.
Unesco therefore took the initiative, at its conference of 17Â October 2003, to begin work on producing a draft Convention on cultural diversity, with the aim of creating an international legal instrument that will protect and promote cultural diversity.
The report before us makes a positive contribution towards this aim, with a series of recommendations to Member States and the Commission regarding Unescoâs work, such as consolidating cultural rights, fostering the development of public cultural policies in each State and committing all the parties involved to international cooperation.
Among other points in the report, I welcome its reaffirmation of the principle of preserving and promoting cultural diversity and access to culture, as a contribution towards mutual understanding between people and towards peace.
I endorse the reportâs position that States have the right to define their own cultural policies.
I also welcome the reaffirmation â as advocated by Unesco â that culture is not âmerchandiseâ and that it must be excluded from any process of liberalisation, be it multilateral or bilateral, as well as the reaffirmation of the role of public services.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  We fully share the view that cultural diversity should be recognised as a fundamental right, and we therefore choose to support MrsÂ Prets report on cultural diversity.
The EU is, and must remain, a mosaic of minorities and cultures.
As liberals, we always put the private individual at the centre of all political decisions.
We therefore believe it to be of the greatest importance both to confirm in international law that every state or group of states has a legitimate right freely to decide what cultural policy they wish to pursue, and to strengthen the policy of international cooperation and solidarity on cultural issues.
Linguistic diversity must also be retained within the EU.
We are, however, dubious about the idea of the EU being legally entitled to take measures within the area of culture and the media in order to preserve and promote cultural diversity.
We do not therefore wish to support the EUâs developing a legal instrument for cultural diversity.
Â Â  . The EU is doing a great deal in order to involve a young generation in projects intended to link European unity and ideas about progress.
These projects may end up verging on being propaganda rather than education.
In channelling money to cultural organisations that propagate 'the European idea' by pursuing a general European interest, the EUâs objective is to create a more uniform European elite.
In the worst-case scenario, the EU will eventually evolve into a power centre, with the power ending up in the hands of a Europe-wide English-speaking elite, putting anyone who does not speak this language at home or has an insufficient command of it at a disadvantage at work, and in terms of their ability to participate, and have a say, in politics.
Deviating national and regional customs are then treated as a form of handicap.
That is why it is positive that we should now finally set to defending cultural diversity against commerce and centralistic governance.
I completely share the view of Mrs Prets, the rapporteur, that cultural services and products, and certainly the diversity of opinions, are not consumer goods capable of simply being handed over to the market.
I support her ambition to exclude everything that pertains to this from trade liberalisation by WTO/GATT and to have it protected by a convention to be concluded in the framework of UNESCO.
Â Â  . We agree with several points in the report at debate.
For reasons of principle, we agree with the need to safeguard the right of cultural self-determination and the cultural diversity of the peoples of Europe and the whole world.
The report partially formulates correctly certain of the causes of gradual cultural homogenisation and the commercialisation of culture (pressure from the WTO, internal rivalries both between the USA and the EU and within the ÎU itself, inability of UNESCO to play its role etc.).
Because we firmly believe in cultural diversity, as one of the last bastions defending the historic existence and continuing identity of peoples and as an historic necessity (as the report also recognises), we consider the proposed measures to be completely inadequate.
The problem cannot be resolved within the framework of organisations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, let alone the ÎU.
The only way to check and reverse this preplanned and culturally catastrophic advance is for the peoples to take the matter into their own hands, to fight against the logic and practices of the laws of the market dictated by imperialist globalisation and to demand respect for the values of their culture.
For these reasons, the Communist Party of Greece did not support the report and abstained from the final vote.
Â Â  . As our rapporteur (and the draftsman of our opinion) so eloquently expressed, âpreserving the cultural heritage as the common heritage of mankind is a central concern of our civil society, and the preservation and encouragement of cultural diversity helps to ensure peace, security, stability and developmentâ.
This preservation requires specific actions.
It was in this light that the Universal Declaration of Cultural Diversity drawn up by Unesco, and the Council of Europeâs Declaration on Cultural Diversity appeared.
These declarations succeeded in going beyond mere trade aspects of educational and cultural services and cultural goods, by encompassing specific objectives such as the development of viable local cultural industries and improving the worldwide distribution of cultural works.
The respect for and protection of cultural diversity are of crucial importance, from the point of view not only of collective awareness, but also of hopefully sustainable development.
Cultural diversity is, in turn, in harmony with the world around us and is something that each generation inherits and then passes down.
I believe that the EU must take a pro-active role in the discussion and emergence of new instruments at the next Unesco General Conference, capable of addressing the needs of a new world in which Europe must foster, with steadfast determination, the promotion of cultural diversity, make a contribution towards cultural dialogue and promote mutual understanding and respect.
Â Â  .
As well as providing an excellent discussion of the importance and the richness of cultural diversity, the report expressly calls for the rule of unanimity to be applied. This is not a blocking tactic, a charge all too frequently levelled, but the best guarantee of obtaining the consent of States and of the citizens.
Another reason for us to be satisfied is the most compelling case the report makes for the need for the principle of subsidiarity to be respected and for âthe right for the Member State, the regions and sub-state entities where appropriate to define, implement and adapt cultural policiesâ before emphasising that âservices and cultural products and education are not merchandiseâŠ and must therefore be made subject to special conditionsâŠ [which] must take account of the fact that the market cannot be the measure of all things, and must guarantee in particular diversity of opinion and pluralismâ.
The Members of the delegation to the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have no alternative proposal.
We support the concept of public service and reject the liberalisation of these sectors under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).
It is regrettable and worrying that these guidelines should not have been extended to all services of general interest in the vote on the Herzog report, but we give our unreserved support to the resolution on preserving and promoting cultural diversity in association with UNESCO.
Â Â  . â Following on from MrÂ Cappatoâs explanation of vote, I must underline the importance of the OSCE, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
The OSCE promotes security in all ways other than direct armed intervention, and therefore makes every effort to promote respect for cultural and linguistic diversity.
Two institutions operate within the OSCE to achieve this: the High Commissioner on National Minorities and the Representative on Freedom of the Media, who have continually been directing their attention to the subject of languages.
Recently, at their meeting in Maastricht in December 2003, the foreign ministers of the OSCE countries adopted a decision on tolerance â Decision 4/03. Article 10 refers to the High Commissioner on National Minorities and his recommendations on education and languages, including in radio and television broadcasting.
The decision also refers to the recommendations on this subject by the Representative on Freedom of the Media, the text of which can be found at www.osce.org.
In 2002 and 2003 he carried out a thorough study on the media in multilingual societies, taking five countries as examples: Luxembourg, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and Serbia-Montenegro.
On 13 and 14 September the OSCE is organising a conference on racism and xenophobia, to be held in Brussels, during which I hope the subject of linguistic diversity will be addressed.
Â Â  . The 2002 annual report on equal opportunities is relevant to the EUâs objectives.
We have noted, however, a number of shortcomings in the report.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I believe it is essential to take a two-pronged approach, with the aim of ensuring equal treatment and equal pay, and genuine political mainstreaming of gender issues.
Given that the growth of employment, particularly of women, is directly linked to whether it is possible to combine work with family life, the employment strategy must include references to funding and setting up facilities to care for children and dependents, and access to paid parental leave.
It must also include targeted support measures to assist women in returning to work after raising a family.
Every effort must be made to encompass areas as diverse as social security, training, enterprise initiatives, the inclusion of women in the decision-making process, extending working life, domestic violence and the trafficking of women.
Â Â  . The own-initiative report by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities rightly draws attention to important aspects of the framework strategy and to annual work programmes and reports on equal opportunities between men and women in the EU.
These include the fact that the aims for the strategy have yet to be defined in measurable terms and that the annual reports do not manage to combine addressing the political aims that I have highlighted and a thorough analysis and evaluation of the current situation.
Although it contains certain aspects that I consider contradictory, I agree with the report when it highlights the lack of coherence between UN policy â as defined in the Beijing Platform for Action â and EU policy on equal opportunities.
I also welcome the fact that it points out the lack of information with regard to the execution of a number of Community programmes, and when it expresses disappointment that the 2003 work programme, relating to priority actions, does no more than reiterate previous intentions.
I also agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the need for a report summarising the 1995 Platform for Action in Member States, to be tabled before the end of this legislative period.
Unfortunately, good intentions have not been translated into reality.
In the neo-liberal offensive against workersâ rights, social rights and other social gains, the first to be affected are always women, who face unemployment and unequal pay.
Â Â  . The Commission is required to provide us with annual reports on the current situation as regards equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union.
Today, we are to state our position on the annual report for 2002, a good practice that permits us to assess how things stand when it comes to implementing the fine European directives and programmes that are meant to guarantee equal treatment and equal opportunities to women and men.
We all know that, where this is concerned, not all that glisters is gold in the Member States or in the accession countries, and that this House should and must denounce this is not a matter of dispute.
There are, however, some passages in this otherwise astonishingly sensible motion for a resolution from the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities that have to be modified.
Various Members of this House have objected to the requirement that Member States and accession countries should, by 2010 provide good and affordable childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years of age and school age and for 33% of children under the age of three.
They wonder whether that is either desirable or realistic, that is to say, affordable.
Â Â  . On average, women in the EU earn 84% of what a man does, and the average unemployment rate for women in 2001 was 2.3% higher than for men.
In the Explanatory Statement, the rapporteur demonstrates incisively that the many fine words about equal opportunities for men and women are, in practice, leading to little action, partly owing to a lack of measurable results.
No clear objectives were set beforehand, and the assessment criteria laid down by the European Commission in its Framework Strategy for the period 2001-2005 do not reappear in its Annual Report for 2002.
It is thus unclear what has been done or not been done, and what the results are.
Furthermore, the Commission and the Council are working independently of each other.
During the Finnish Presidency in late 1999, the Council established nine indicators with regard to women in responsible and decision-making jobs, to which were then added French indicators for the reconciliation of work and family life, Belgian indicators for unequal pay and Danish indicators for domestic violence against women.
These are all nice things for ministers to tell their grass-roots support back home.
No further mention of them is to be found in the annual reports, and the underlying documents remained confidential.
It is a shame that the motion for a resolution adopted unanimously in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities lacks the firmness of the clear Explanatory Statement.
I fear that, once again, little will change there.
Â Â  . I feel that equality between men and women is of the utmost importance, and have always condemned sex discrimination.
I am forced, however, to disagree with the rapporteurâs position, which, rather than fight for equality, seeks to impose egalitarian extremism.
In order to make equality a reality it is not necessary to have the exact same number of men and women doing a particular job, it is much more important first to ensure that there is equal access to opportunities.
The egalitarianism in the report before us is an absurd imposition, which offers a superficial impression of equality and would only reflect true representation, if at all, by coincidence.
I do feel that many of the rapporteurâs ideas, in terms of EU law, could not be implemented in the EU, as they fall within the competences of Member States.
I nonetheless endorse some of the points made in this own-initiative report, which do not, in any case, pertain exclusively to equality between men and women.
I agree, for example, with the rapporteurâs criticism of the lack of transparency of decisions made within the Council, which prevents Parliament and the citizens from making a proper evaluation of its activities and its decisions.
I voted against.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparations for the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a former United Nations human rights fellow and indeed as a former chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, I am particularly pleased that my first address to Parliament should be on the European Union's preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions of 10 December 2002 contain concrete recommendations as to how the Council and the European Parliament can work more closely to achieve openness and transparency in the European Union's human rights policy.
The Council is committed to putting those recommendations into practice.
Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is an important focus for the Irish presidency.
Today's debate is a valuable part of that discourse.
This is an area where we can make real progress if we work together.
The European Union has always been determined to assume its international responsibilities.
The Union's size, wealth, history and geography all point to our Union playing a prominent role in the period ahead.
Human rights will remain at the heart of that role.
A concern for human rights is at the core of European integration.
We are much more than an economic area and an alliance of convenience.
Ours is a Union which is based and built on values.
Those values are essential conditions for membership.
They are a compass that helps guide our external relations.
We are committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for universal and indivisible human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
There can be no compromise on or denial of these principles.
Europe has been at the fore in developing the concept of universal human rights.
It was on our continent, Europe, that the idea of protecting human rights via written norms was first elaborated: the Magna Carta of 1215, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789 are all landmarks, but they are not the only landmarks.
The attachment of Europe to human rights is not an abstract one: it was forged in the bitter experiences of European history â our common history.
We need only look back to our own history to understand why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers in the starkest language to: 'disregard and contempt for human rights that have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.'
That sense of outrage has been used positively in the past half century to construct a new Europe that has learned from and not forgotten its history.
This presidency believes strongly that human rights have a strategic part to play in confronting the major challenges of our time.
There is no need to emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other.
Our presidency will reflect the central importance of human rights in all our external actions.
Our Union can, rightly, be proud of the achievements of the last 50 years.
We must never, however, become complacent.
There is no part of the globe which is absolutely free from human rights abuses of one form or another.
None of us in Europe, for example, is without fault: acts of racism, xenophobia and intolerance have not disappeared from our own societies.
Believing in human rights means being ready to accept criticisms and working every day to strengthen respect for the freedoms that we all hold dear.
We must remind ourselves, each and every day, that human rights are not for export only.
If human rights within the Union are respected absolutely, unquestionably and visibly, our foreign policy will be more effective and more persuasive.
We will be in a position to demand respect for basic principles and values â upon which all individual integrity and human decency are founded â from the international community only when those principles and values apply without equivocation in our Union.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has played a pivotal role in the promotion and protection of human rights.
It has been the standard-setter establishing monitoring mechanisms.
The international community should rightly take pride in the Commission's unique contribution to this process and to the progress that has been achieved since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
While much has been achieved, more remains to be done.
The European Union remains committed to cooperating with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations human rights mechanisms, special rapporteurs and representatives as well as with Treaty bodies.
The European Union will reinforce its efforts towards achieving the United Nations Secretary-General's goal that the rights of all men, women and children must be 'at the heart of every aspect of UN work'.
Before addressing the preparations for this year's Commission on Human Rights, I would like briefly to address the outcome of last year's session, because it is indicative of the challenges that we face next March and April in Geneva.
The 2003 session of the Commission was challenging.
The beginning of the session was overshadowed by the looming war in Iraq.
The war started during the Commission's second week yet, and quite remarkably, the atmosphere, while occasionally fractious, was a significant improvement on the atmosphere of 2002.
There was a more positive approach by all groups on a number of issues which had previously caused serious difficulties, most notably the follow-up to the Durban World Conference against Racism and on the rights of the child.
The return of the United States to the Human Rights Commission was another positive and welcome development.
The European Union played a positive role at the Human Rights Commission.
On individual country situations, the Union successfully tabled resolutions on the human rights situations in Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Turkmenistan and North Korea.
The Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories.
The European Union also agreed a Chair's Statement on Colombia.
However, initiatives from the European Union on Chechnya and Sudan were defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a no-action motion.
A number of important EU initiatives fell in 2003.
This was in significant part due to the composition of the Human Rights Commission. It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members.
It also reflects the very large number of proposals coming forward from the European Union.
Turning to thematic resolutions, the EU initiatives on the death penalty and the rights of the child were adopted by the Human Rights Commission.
One of the more emotive issues addressed by the Commission, a Brazilian resolution on human rights and sexual orientation, co-sponsored by the Union, ran into vigorous objection, in particular from the Organisation of Islamic Conferences.
This issue was remitted to the 60th session of the Commission and it is likely to be very sensitive in the upcoming session.
Before turning to the EU's preparations for the forthcoming Commission, I wish to mention the decision by the African Group in Geneva to challenge the nomination of Australia as Chair of the session.
In line with the current system of geographical rotation, the Western Group has nominated Australia as its candidate for Chair of the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.
The African Group in Geneva has indicated that it intends to call for a vote.
We are very concerned about this development and its negative impact on the Commission on Human Rights.
Australia enjoys the full support and the endorsement of the European Union and of all other members of the Western Group.
Accordingly, the European Union has called on the African Group to reflect on its decision in advance of the election, due on 19 January 2004.
I hope that the African Group can be dissuaded from calling for a vote on the Chair of the Commission.
In making this call, I am guided by the need to work constructively with the African Group at the forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights and to improve relations with the Group generally in that forum.
The President of the Council has already made our anxiety clear to move Africa up the agenda of the EU, so there is no question as to our goodwill on this issue.
Against the background outlined above, I would like to give you as much information as I can about the current state of the Council's preparations for the Commission on Human Rights.
Time does not permit me to touch on every aspect of the Commission's work.
However, I wish to share with this Parliament the essence of our approach as a presidency.
At a general level, the Human Rights Working Group, COHOM, has been working since last autumn on improving the Union's performance, based on our experience from last year's session.
The first meeting of the Human Rights Working Group of the Irish presidency will take place on 21 January.
In advance of that meeting, the various Common Foreign and Security Policy geographical working groups have been asked to present their priorities and their recommendations for action this year.
With the help of this input, the Human Rights Working Group meeting on 21 January will identify countries which may have formed the subject of EU initiatives at this year's Commission.
COHOM is also likely to request detailed reports from EU heads of mission on human rights situations in these countries.
I should stress that no final decision on any initiative has as yet been taken.
The Human Rights Working Group will take a final decision at a further meeting to be held on 4 February.
If there are any particularly controversial issues outstanding, these will be considered by the Political and Security Committee and, if necessary, be decided by the Council at Council level.
The expressions of the Union's concern in regard to the human rights situations in countries will not be confined to formal resolutions.
In the traditional statement under agenda item 9 â human rights situations in various parts of the world â the EU will refer to a number of country situations in the context of the thematic approach.
The presidency intends to keep this draft as concise and as targeted as possible.
We believe that by doing so we will have the maximum impact.
Another effective approach is the type of human rights dialogue that the Union has entered into, for example with China and in the EU-Iran dialogue.
As regards thematic resolutions, again no final decision has been taken.
However, the European Union is again likely to table resolutions on the death penalty and on children's rights.
Preparations have also begun for a number of EU statements, including one on the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights and others on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, the right to development, economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights, integration of the human rights of women and the gender perspective, the rights of the child, contemporary forms of slavery and human rights defenders.
This list is by no means exhaustive.
It does, however, give you some indication of the very thorough engagement which is envisaged by the European Union in this year's Commission on Human Rights.
The timing of this session for Parliament is very welcome because it means that the Human Rights Working Group will be in a position to take into account the deliberations of this Parliament in framing the Union's priorities for the Commission.
The European Parliament's suggestions for initiatives are most welcome and I will be very attentive to any suggestions that come forward here today.
A major aim of our presidency is to achieve a fruitful and an effective session of the Commission.
The climate of confrontation, which increasingly characterises debates in the Commission on Human Rights, is a problem which we will address with our partners.
It is a problem that must be resolved, a distraction that the Commission on Human Rights does not need.
The actions of the European Union in the field of human rights are clearly perceived by part of the international community, for some reason, as being suspect.
Unfortunately, the very principle of universality of human rights and the conviction that they cannot be constrained or limited by any social, economic or cultural exception are being called into question.
Ireland will work very hard to counter this perception of the EU stance during our presidency.
I would like to conclude by reiterating the important and central position of the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Union's external relations policies.
Peace, security and international stability are founded on full respect for human rights.
This is not empty rhetoric; it reflects the objective recognition of a reality that should be clear to all.
It is also a reality that is destined to have an ever more decisive influence on governments' external policy choices. It must also inform the strategies of international organisations.
In conclusion, I wish to thank Parliament for the opportunity to outline the Council's preparations for the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and to look forward to further developing the dialogue between the Council and Parliament in this vital area, which is so close to the heart of all democrats.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission welcomes this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
I subscribe wholeheartedly to the statement that has just been made by Minister Roche.
We need to fully guarantee the coherence between respect for human rights internally in the European Union and the central role that human rights play in our own external policy.
The Commission would like to contribute to this debate on the basis of some of its specific points of view.
As Mr Roche just mentioned, the Commission on Human Rights of the United Nations is no stranger to controversy.
In the statement on the CHR preparations delivered on behalf of the Commission to Parliament last year, Commissioner Nielson noted that Eleanor Roosevelt, the first Chairman of the CHR in 1946, would be turning in her grave at the election of a Libyan Chair.
To that sorry saga we must now add the African Groupâs provocative indication that they will request a vote, and vote against, the Western Groupâs nominated candidate for Chair â Australian Ambassador Mike Smith â which can only serve to embitter the atmosphere in Geneva ahead of the 60th session.
Even by the standards of an increasingly politicised CHR â a body which saw fit to reject last yearâs EU resolutions on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Sudan â this is an unprecedented move.
The Commission supports the swift efforts of the Irish presidency to mobilise a concerted EU and Western Group response, with a series of dÃ©marches in African and Asian capitals.
A final decision on the European Unionâs country and thematic initiatives has not yet been taken and consultations continue between the Council Working Group on Human Rights and geographical working groups.
As the European Parliamentâs Annual Report on Human Rights noted last year, the European Union is one of the most active players at the Commission on Human Rights.
The EU cannot carry that burden alone, and the search for goodwill and burden-sharing with members of the Western and other groups is vital.
The EU must make best use of the revitalisation of the United States' interest in both the General Assembly Third Committee and the Commission on Human Rights.
Whilst acknowledging that EU and US views diverge sharply on several issues, the successful cooperation on the resolution on Turkmenistan last year shows that playing to the strengths of our relationship with the United States can pay dividends.
Cooperation with Latin American countries â not least on the omnibus resolution on the rights of the child â stands as a good example of partnership with other groups.
Moreover, Brazilâs courageous, and inevitably controversial, decision to table a resolution on sexual orientation â an issue which will be re-visited this year â also demonstrates the value of encouraging important human rights initiatives from other players.
The potential success or failure of draft resolutions cannot, of course, constitute the primary factor in decisions on EU action.
The very act of tabling a resolution sends a strong signal of concern and the situation of human rights on the ground must be a pivotal consideration.
That said, in rejecting entirely justified resolutions, the Commission on Human Rights is falling far short of fulfilling its mandate to promote and protect human rights.
Such resolutions do not only stand as a mark of the international communityâs preoccupation with a particular countryâs human rights record; they provide the basis for the work of country and thematic rapporteurs, charged with the investigation of human rights concerns.
It is a mark of the lightness with which certain members of the Commission on Human Rights carry their responsibility to the institution that 35 of the 53 state members have failed to extend a standing invitation to those rapporteurs and other visiting mechanisms.
We must make every endeavour in our dialogue and cooperation with such countries to prompt a more acceptable approach.
That is entirely in line with the EUâs determination to draw on the work of the Commission on Human Rights as an important element of our relations with third countries, to ensure that the approach we take throughout the year is consistent with what goes on in international human rights fora and to ensure that the mainstreaming of human rights in external relations is a meaningful process.
The Commission therefore welcomes this debate.
We consider it an important contribution to the building-up of the EU position in the forthcoming session.
I shall conclude by underlining the Commissionâs intention to extend every assistance to the Irish presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the Commission on Human Rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, every year, we have this human rights debate immediately before the UN Commission on Human Rights meets in Geneva, and every year we are able, in fact, wholeheartedly to endorse what the Commission and the Council have to say.
The fact is that the principles that we proclaim are common to us all and there is no doubt in anybodyâs mind that we give them our full support.
The President-in-Office of the Council has quite rightly said that human rights are an indispensable requirement if peace, stability and prosperity are to be secured.
That, though, brings us on very quickly to the deficits, and the Commissioner has stressed that the Human Rights Commission does not really use its opportunities in the way that it could.
I believe that the Irish presidency does honestly want to make action for human rights a keynote of its presidency.
This is something for which Ireland has a very good record; it has produced such outstanding figures as Mary Robinson, who have distinguished themselves in this area.
With reference to something else â the Constitutional Treaty â your Prime Minister said today that he wants to do his best, but that he is not alone.
Where human rights are concerned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are indeed, unfortunately, not alone.
The chairman of my group said something on this subject this morning, to the effect that it would be a good thing if action for human rights in major States were to be given some substantial expression, that is, in joint communiquÃ©s.
According to the old Prussian principle of administration that âgovernment is done in writingâ, that which is not on file does not exist, and if, in your dealings with Russia or China, you discuss things behind closed doors without mentioning them in a communiquÃ©, then â politically speaking â nothing has happened.
I therefore ask you, when you represent the European Union at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights, to support resolutions on China, on Russia and also on Iran.
I am the rapporteur on Iran and believe that the present situation makes it necessary that we do this.
Let me draw on a proposal by the House dating back some years and advise you not to concentrate on our 15 or 25 Member States, but to act in concert with all the democracies that sit on this Commission, consulting with all the functioning democracies around the world and coming to agreements on what your common concerns are.
Turning to the Africans, one cannot but wonder what they actually want: appreciation on the one hand for the way in which they are establishing high standards under NEPAD, the new programme for African development, and for even establishing the peer review mechanism that we spent yesterday evening discussing, but when it comes to getting practical, they shy away, even objecting to Australia assuming the presidency â probably because Australia has taken a high-profile line on Zimbabwe.
I regard all that as highly dubious, and we have to ask ourselves what we are going to do with the Africans.
I said yesterday that I am very much in favour of us supporting those who do something practical in defence of human rights, but, contrariwise, that also means that we have to impose sanctions on those who do not.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament is naturally very pleased to see that the Council and the Commission are taking its opinion into account before the Geneva session.
During this term, it has expressed several concerns that it hopes will be reflected at the session, and I would just like to mention five of them.
The first is ensuring that human rights are not subject to double standards.
A failure to condemn flagrant violations of human rights in major powers such as China â torture, disappearances and the death penalty â Russia â with Chechnya â and the United States â with GuantÃ¡namo â would be unacceptable to the public.
Large and small must be in the same boat.
The second issue relates to the European Unionâs decisions: its votes must reflect the concerns that Parliament has expressed in its annual reports and its resolutions, in particular with regard to strengthening international law as a guarantor of human rights in the world.
Parliament has on many occasions highlighted the importance of ensuring that every country adopts the international conventions on the abolition of the death penalty, torture and antipersonnel mines.
It has regretted and strongly criticised the pressure the United States has exerted on certain countries to force them not to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Moreover, it has emphasised specific topics such as violence against women and children in particular, which you mentioned as one of the thematic issues.
The third concern is that condemning terrorism and countries that shelter terrorists must go hand in hand with condemning all of the abuses and violations of human rights perpetrated today in many countries in the name of the fight against terrorism.
This fight is certainly important, but it must not flout international law nor infringe upon human rights.
This concern of the European Parliament, highlighted in its resolution of January 2003, will be clearly reflected in the 2003 report on human rights in the world, for which I am rapporteur.
The fourth issue, the right to reproductive health, which covers all of the services relating to sexual and reproductive life, was also given priority in that same report.
I need not remind you that maternal and infant mortality, epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases and deaths following illegal abortions are the cause of more deaths today than any armed conflict. These tragic and unnecessary deaths continue to be the lot of the Developing World, and Africa in particular.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will give a very firm commitment in relation to this right to reproductive health.
Fifthly and finally, the European Parliament welcomes the coordination between the Commission and the Council and hopes that this will continue.
As in 2003, it would like an delegation to be able to attend the next session in Geneva.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, representative of the Commission, I believe that it is a pleasure for this Parliament to be able to hold this debate on the preparation of the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Human rights are a priority issue, which must be applied in a universal and indivisible manner, regardless of the cultures on which each country is founded.
I was extremely pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that human rights were going to be a key element in the Irish Presidencyâs work.
I am also pleased to hear that the European Union must not just defend human rights with a view to exporting them, but that there must also be work to ensure that human rights are always protected and respected in the various States of the European Union.
In this regard, loutish acts of racism and xenophobia, or those associations that advocate certain cultural identities, must be completely outlawed.
I would also point out that, since the European Union is a continent with a significant amount of immigration, it is possible that some of these actions will be directed at immigrant groups.
Since I cannot naturally refer to all the points that I believe must be argued at this session in Geneva, I will just refer to three specific ones: firstly, the issue of Cuba, where illegal detentions are taking place, specifically for crimes of opinion; in this regard, guaranteeing freedom of expression, of association and of meeting is a priority issue.
The European Parliament awarded the Sakharov prize to Oswaldo JosÃ© PayÃ¡ in 2002 and I believe this is an issue that we must be concerned about.
Secondly, on that very island of Cuba there is GuantÃ¡namo.
I am not going to go too far into this, but there are 700 people there, awaiting trial in a situation which is legally indefensible.
Finally, there are also other countries such as North Korea where people are being imprisoned in situations that we can only condemn.
I myself have lived for many years in a country in which human rights were not guaranteed and I believe that the European Union must be committed to defending these rights here and throughout the world.
Â Â  Mr President, here at the beginning of 2004 the climate of obsession with security has become more pronounced.
The fight against terrorism is now held up to justify any repressive, authoritarian or discriminatory measure.
Freedom of expression and freedom of movement, indeed all democratic rights at times, are suffering in many countries, including under George Bushâs administration, which has just established a specific procedure for officials of airline companies from 10 countries to enter American territory.
Throughout the world, there are also numerous examples of an offensive against those men and women who campaign tirelessly for human rights.
In anticipation of the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, I would like to mention a few of them.
I am thinking of Sihem Bensedrine, a writer, journalist and former spokesperson for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, who was attacked in the middle of the street a few days ago in Tunis on her way home.
A group of 15 lawyers lodged a complaint on her behalf and Sihem Bensedrine blamed, and I quote, âthe political policeâ.
As usual, the Tunisian authorities rushed to deny the existence of any such police.
The many recent interventions by this courageous and passionate campaigner to denounce breaches of human rights in her country in the European media, before a parliamentary committee in Germany or even when her last book came out have certainly not seemed to please the Ben Ali regime.
The harassment suffered every day by Tunisian human rights defenders shows that the Tunisian regime has not made progress, despite the shocking statements to the contrary made by the French President, MrÂ Chirac, in Tunis in December.
On the contrary, freedoms as fundamental as the freedoms of expression, of opinion, of association and of assembly continue to be violated every day, treating the European Parliamentâs repeated requests with disdain.
This assessment is also shared by Mrs Hina Jilani, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders.
In my view, the European institutions, the Council and the Commission, must shilly-shally no longer and must, at the session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and in general, assert an unambiguous position regarding this regime and use their influence to demand respect for all freedoms.
The credibility of the EU-Tunisia links must measure up to this requirement.
We welcome the very recent release of political prisoners in Morocco, and in particular that of the journalist Ali Lmrabet and several Sahrawi prisoners who had been in jail for many years.
Their release is proof of the importance of international solidarity.
I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate and by the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan to Brussels to receive the Sakharov Prize to reiterate demands that have already been stated here but which are still relevant.
I would like to talk about the issue of Western Sahara and to call on the governments of the Member States to give their full support to the current efforts of the United Nations.
As the deadline has been set for 31Â January, there is an urgent need to put pressure on Morocco to accept, as did the Polisario Front so courageously, and to implement without any further delay the UN peace plan, which at last provides for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people through a free and democratic referendum.
The Council and the Commission have the resources to help bring this about.
Finally, I would like to mention the situation in Palestine.
The people of Palestine have had enough.
Every gesture of goodwill, like the Geneva peace initiative adopted by Israeli and Palestinian leaders, is immediately scorned, to say the least, by Sharon.
Accusations of treason, the circulation of black lists, fatal shootings by the Israeli army in the Occupied Territories and the sentencing of young, refusenik soldiers are just some of the blows to the very idea of peace in the Middle East.
The escalation continues to be dangerous and bloody.
In this respect, I can only welcome the beginning of the next session of the Court in The Hague, which is due to give a ruling on the legitimacy of the âwall of shameâ.
However, as regards condemning breaches of rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the European Union must assume their responsibilities.
Â Â  â Mr President, 2003 was an exceptionally gloomy year for international human rights.
The year began for me in South Africa, where I was working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which had been investigating the legacy of apartheid, and I would not want to see inequality, racism or discrimination on anything like the same scale ever again anywhere.
We are now, however â real or imagined terrorism having become a factor in any analysis of the world order â in real danger of sliding towards global apartheid.
As we happily swear by the notion of multilateral security based on cooperation, the European Union, as a Community of values and in its human rights work, which has a key impact on security, has been a disappointment in terms of practical work in this area.
Amnesty Internationalpublished a report this week called, in which EU human rights policy came in for some heavy criticism.
Amnestycomplains, for example, that the governments of the Unionâs Member States often do not even take the trouble to reply when it contacts them.
We, too, however, have experienced the same sort of frustration in relations between the European Parliament and the Council.
Major violators of human rights, such as China and Russia, just get away with it year after year.
Parliamentâs expressions of concern have in these cases, as in many others, come to nothing on account of the passive attitude of Member States, differences of opinion between them, and the commercial and other sordid interests they have lurking in the background.
Good intentions, both in the thematic and geographical sense, therefore often remain inexcusably empty, futile gestures.
What is needed is muscle and effect: I refer here for example to statements on human rights and democracy.
The country holding the presidency, Italy, at any rate chose childrenâs rights as its theme for its human rights forum.
With respect to these, one nevertheless fears that the guidelines for children and armed conflicts agreed in December will not be effectively implemented, as was the case with the action programme against torture before it in 2001.
The new European security strategy will, meanwhile, remain without any sustainable content unless it is anchored to a consistent, coherent and credible human rights policy which the Council also wholeheartedly embraces.
All eyes turn now to Ireland.
Unless there is a wind of change both in our bilateral relations and in the United Nations we will have to prepare, not just for a combination of virtual farce and disaster, such as we saw at the fifty-ninth sitting of the Commission on Human Rights, but also for the fact that we will be wasting what is historically a golden opportunity right now when our work could have crucial, not to say epoch-making, importance.
Â Â  â Mr President, as Mr Ahern reminded us this morning, respect for human rights lies at the core of European politics.
Despite all the Unionâs efforts, however, human rights are still being violated in too many areas, not only in the rest of the world but even within the EU itself.
Trafficking in human beings, trafficking in organs, new forms of slavery that demand our attention in the third millennium, the unregulated use of the Internet that all too often breaches our countriesâ laws and becomes a vehicle for paedophilia, for the trade in human beings and for spreading information among terrorists who have no respect for human life and dignity â these are just a few of the many examples we could give.
We must call on the United Nations to ensure that rights that are violated in so many countries today are respected.
The children that are forced to work or become guerrilla fighters in order to survive are also those children who in our rich societies see their images and their bodies used for commercial activities, in violation of the rights that their age confers on them.
Too many words and statements have been uttered in reaction to urgent situations which actually require strong political decisions, such as the decision to stop the use of children to advertise or promote income-generating activities, and the decision to make certain economic relationships with third countries conditional on respect for human rights.
Those countries that do not have a secular system but one based on enforcing the , with everything that that religious law entails in violation of human rights, should be made to face clear decisions by the Union and the international community.
Although cooperation remains a way of getting closer to the population, maintaining normal economic relations with governments that breach the principle of human rights would be wrong and would clearly contradict all the fine words we have uttered in recent years.
We ask the Irish Presidency, with the support of Parliament, to put forward the need for stronger and more political statements at its next meeting with the United Nations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to ask the Council and the Commission to put the situation in Vietnam on the agenda for the coming 60thÂ session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
A picture of growing government repression in Vietnam emerges from several reliable sources, some local and this applies even more to the second half of last year, 2003.
To illustrate this, I should like to give some details of the national situation.
Even official figures show a doubling in the number of death sentences in 2003 compared to 2002, particularly for drugs and economic crimes.
In addition, citizens are being arrested on allegations of spying or criticising the government on the Internet.
The Protestants in Vietnamâs central highlands are undergoing particular suffering.
They are subject to constant ethnic and religious persecution, including the ultimate government sanction of deprivation of their livelihood, their land.
Incidentally, Hanoi has strictly forbidden these hill tribes to maintain contact with the outside world.
Gatherings of more than two people are also prohibited.
It is no wonder that these people, known as Montagnards, are attempting to flee their heavily militarised territory, which is resulting in a refugee crisis.
All in all, we are seeing shocking breaches of human rights here.
Council and Commission, I trust that you will call the Vietnamese authorities to account for these matters via the global forum ofthe UN Commission on Human Rights.
It is of practical importance that the United Nations demand that Hanoi grant their special rapporteurs for freedom of religion or belief and for refugees access to the central highlands.
The Council and the Commission should push for this promptly in Geneva too.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I am grateful for the information, but I should like to ask a question, make a comment and lastly, perhaps, make a proposal.
The question is this: do we agree that, when we speak of âhuman rightsâ, we also mean civil and political rights?
In other words, do we agree with the position of Kofi Annan, who recently declared that democracy is a human right in itself, as can be inferred from Article 21 and others of the Universal Declaration?
The question I am asking is a very important one, and one that also arose from a conference on democracy and human rights held in Yemen a few days ago, organised by , at which fifty countries from the Arab world released a statement that very clearly affirms this.
The second point is a comment: the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is, of course, not only a recent instrument â it was founded in 1993 â but also a very weak one, and precisely because of its weakness it has become extremely politicised.
It is a body that never has sufficient, clearly defined financial means, not to mention institutional powers or human resources.
In short, it is at best a whistle-blowing body, but one which even in these terms has never done its job properly, precisely because it is composed of opposing blocs in which everyone protects the members of their own regional group.
Commissioner, while it is quite right to be concerned about the African Groupâs questioning of Australiaâs nomination as Chair, it must be added that it is also true that last year Europe abstained on a call for a vote against the nomination of Libya as Chair on regional grounds.
Perhaps it is worth remembering this, Commissioner and Minister, because if we had adopted a clearer position last year â not as regards the Chairâs country of origin but as regards the standard of application of human rights in that country â perhaps today we might have some extra cards in our hand with which to support the Australian candidate.
Lastly a proposal: I do not believe we can make any further progress with simple, albeit necessary, criticisms towards various countries, from Tunisia to Vietnam, and we could add a whole list of names.
I believe the problem is to strengthen the institutions responsible and thus the policies.
For instance, I still do not understand â and I have been asking this since 1995 â why the European Commission does not have a Commissioner for human rights.
It is a complete mystery to me, and nobody has ever given me an answer.
Finally, I believe that the episode of the Australian candidacy itself reinforces the need to create a community of democracy and of democracies within the United Nations.
Only a strengthening of the institutions can make a policy progress from words to deeds; so far there have been plenty of words but certainly very few deeds.
Â Â  Mr President, respecting, promoting and safeguarding human rights is one of the cornerstones of European integration.
The Union therefore has the moral obligation and responsibility to defend and promote fundamental rights and freedoms.
Consequently, we have the obligation and responsibility to improve the operation of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to make it the worldâs political conscience, and I am pleased with what has been said here in this regard.
It also has the obligation and responsibility, however, to condemn with great clarity and courage the violations of these rights which are taking place, wherever they happen and regardless of the economic or foreign interests existing between the European Union and the countries where these violations take place or the motivations leading to the violation or jeopardising of fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Rule of Law.
Not to do so means covering them up, becoming accomplices in them, accomplices in what is happening in Chechnya, in Guantanamo, in Cuba, in Tibet or in Iran.
In this way, the Union would also be clearly contradicting the principles and values on which it is based and would lose all credibility, and without credibility it will not have the authority necessary to promote and demand from others respect for the principles we claim to defend.
It is not sufficient, however, to condemn.
We must also implement the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and ensure that others implement them.
Otherwise, our commitment will be purely rhetorical, and through rhetoric alone, however long the list of declarations adopted may be, it will be difficult for us to make a more humane world a reality for everyone.
This morning, the Irish Prime Minister, on presenting the programme of the Irish Presidency of the Council, made a particular reference to the issue of human rights.
The Geneva session offers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that the words spoken this morning, which we have all applauded, truly respond to the will to ensure that the Union actively fulfils its commitment to the world to defend the fundamental freedoms which form the basis of the Community edifice.
I am convinced, having heard what you have said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that that will be the case.
Â Â  â Mr President, we welcome the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council that there can be no compromises on the subject of human rights.
Unfortunately, the experience of the European institutions shows that the reality is often quite the opposite.
I should like to say a few words on two subjects on which I believe Europe should summon up all its political prestige and use it in Geneva.
The first is the death penalty.
The Italian Presidencyâs about-turn on the resolution for a moratorium on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly, which was announced by the Presidency but never tabled, is a serious occurrence that has left the European Union exposed and, above all, has eroded some of its political authority.
This shows that even on a subject apparently as widely agreed on and as precious as human rights and the abolition of the death penalty as a judicial solution we are held hostage to many governmentsâ petty self-interest.
This is a battle that must be fought at a political level, starting in Geneva.
In China last year 3Â 138 executions were recorded; there were also plenty of executions in many so-called liberal democracies, from Taiwan to Thailand, from Japan to India to the United States.
We cannot address a matter like this on the slippery slope of political convenience and, above all, we cannot expect it to be a battle based purely on principle and evidence, because it is not like that.
This is shown by the fact that the Governor of Illinois recently decided to commute 167 death sentences, and I believe it was because he felt the impetus and pressure of international public opinion.
Another important point, Mr President, concerns journalists; in other words, the right to speak out and not to remain silent, which is a fair indicator of the real quality of a democracy.
In the last ten years more than 400 journalists have been killed, and for very few of these do we have any legal certainty.
In the last six months there have been 228 arrests and 250 unjustified trials, many of which were in countries that belong to the so-called group of western democracies; the latest case emerged only two days ago and involves Turkey.
Among other things, we believe that the forces of repression against journalists and press freedoms have learnt to use more underhand methods.
Violence against the freedom to speak out and not remain silent is committed and consummated also by gagging, censoring and taking broadcasts off the air; unfortunately, these are practices that have also recently found a place here in our countries, including my own country.
In this respect we want to call on the Presidency to exercise a rigorous and courageous mandate, a political undertaking that I should like to try and define in the matter of human rights with just two words, which are the words Parliament has always sought to convey to the Commission and the Presidency: on human rights we will not tolerate any exceptions or any omissions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Treaty of Amsterdam provided the European Union with a legal basis for taking action to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
That led to the adoption here a few years ago of a directive against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in employment and elsewhere.
In the course of the enlargement process, we have consistently and successfully insisted that penalising sexual contact between persons of the same sex be abolished before a country could join the European Union.
In this House, we have also repeatedly reminded countries such as Zimbabwe and Egypt, with which the European Union has concluded agreements, that they should put an end to discrimination and punishment of sexual contact between adults of the same sex.
We make ourselves very clear on this point every year in our reports on human rights in the world and within the European Union.
It is only logical, therefore, that we also raise this policy at the United Nations.
As has already been said, last year, Brazil presented the UN Commission on Human Rights with an initiative to include combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the human rights policy of the United Nations.
This year, that proposal will be further elaborated and then raised again.
This elaboration will probably include mention of discrimination on grounds of sexual identity.
That is a subject on which the European Court of Justice passed a landmark judgment just last week.
My group hopes, therefore, that the EU delegation will support this Brazilian initiative in full â every last part of it â and also cooperate on elaborating it further.
All further attempts to destroy this initiative by countries minded to do so must be prevented, in cooperation with at least the EU Member States that are members of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Â Â  Mr President, I too am pleased that we are holding this debate on the preparations for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
At long last it gives me an opportunity to remind our European Parliament of its commitments on the question of indigenous peoples and in particular on our institutionâs dialogue with those too-neglected peoples and its representation to them.
It is my duty, Mr President â and you know what I am talking about â to remind you again of our 1994 resolution on action required internationally to provide effective protection for indigenous peoples, which in fact called for the setting-up of an interparliamentary delegation composed of Members of this Parliament and representatives of indigenous peoples.
After ten yearsâ hard work, the indigenous peoples have for their part succeeded in creating and organising themselves in an Indigenous Peoplesâ Forum.
On the Unionâs side, however, we are more than discreet; I would even go so far as to say we are not present.
The proof is that neither the Council nor the Commission have made any reference to indigenous peoples and Parliament itself has still not arranged its delegation.
We must remedy this lack of consideration for a question that nonetheless affects peoples on five continents.
I shall therefore be proposing that the Union invest its resources and its will in organising the next Indigenous Peoplesâ Forum jointly with the UN here in this place and in ensuring that the rights of these populations also remain among our priorities.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is very hard to know where to begin.
This has been a superb debate, and what has struck me listening to it has been the extraordinary range of issues addressed.
As I mentioned at the outset, this debate is greatly appreciated by the presidency: it provides a timely reminder and an opportunity to exchange views with Parliament some two months before the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights opens in Geneva.
Members of Parliament â including the last speaker â have, in making their meaningful and fruitful contributions, highlighted areas in which there is still much work to do.
I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate and to assure them that the Irish presidency will see to it that the points they have raised will be brought to the attention of the appropriate Council instance as we prepare for Geneva.
Members have cited a considerable number of country-specific issues, as well as several thematic issues, which need to be worked on.
It would be invidious of me to select specific issues from among all those which have been commented on today.
Let me simply say that my colleagues and I have been very careful to note the contributions and will ensure that we go through the record methodically.
I would, however, like to refer to one point made by MrsÂ Bonino.
The Union has been a strong supporter of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights since its establishment over a decade ago.
Secretary-General Annan has yet to appoint a successor to High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello following his tragic death in Iraq.
Let me assure you that this presidency will provide broad and strong support for the Office of High Commissioner at the Geneva meeting, not least because we owe it to the memory of the distinguished incumbent who was cut down in Baghdad, a man who did so much for the cause of human rights.
I would like to end by again thanking the Members who have made contributions today.
I can assure them that their contributions will be taken on board.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would also like to thank Parliament for its contribution to the preparation of the European Union's position.
A Member of Parliament raised the issue of the fight against terrorism and its impact on human rights.
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is of the opinion that the European Union should support the Mexican resolution on protecting human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism, in the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Concerning Tunisia I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Commission has recently published a communication on human rights in the Mediterranean, in which we clarified our position on the human rights situation in Tunisia.
Third, I would like to associate myself with Mr Roche's remarks as he paid homage to Mr Vieira de Mello, the former High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was tragically killed in Baghdad.
My last comments concern Mrs Bonino's remarks.
I could even go as far as to say that I share her view.
As you know, the Commission said last year that it would be a dangerous precedent to change the way the President of the Commission is chosen by replacing the concertation and acclamation procedure with a vote.
Therefore we are prepared to support the efforts of the Irish presidency in avoiding making such a choice a source of conflict.
Such a conflict cannot but undermine the credibility and role of the Commission on Human Rights, which is important for us.
Finally, Mrs Bonino, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that last December the European Council decided to hand the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, a specific competence concerning the guarantee of fundamental rights in the European Union, therefore creating the basis for what one could call an agency for fundamental rights in the European Union.
When it comes to fundamental rights outside the Union, the responsibility lies with my colleague, Mr Patten, whom I am replacing today.
When it comes to the internal policy of the European Union, I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am the Commissioner responsible for human rights!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on 10 February 2004.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0445/2003) by Mr Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission on immigration, integration and employment (COM(2003) 336 â 2003/2147(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very proud to be presenting this report today.
This report is unique in that it comes from the employment and social affairs side of this House and which for the first time tries the joined-up approach pioneered at the Tampere Summit.
I am proud to be presenting it because it joins up the issues of immigration, integration, employment and partnership with third countries: many of the most sensitive issues that we deal with in the European Union, but also issues with which we must deal in a comprehensive way.
Very often in this House we have dealt with these issues separately and they have been sensitive separately.
Indeed, they are sensitive issues together.
In this report I have tried to ensure the joined-up approach and have approached the whole task by trying to unify colleagues in this House around some key points.
It is a key point that the demographic challenge that we face in the European Union of the future is one where immigration may be one solution, but not the only solution.
We have some amazing statistics.
In the 25 Member States, the working-age population is set to shrink from 303Â million to 297Â million by 2020, then to 280Â million by 2030, almost doubling the old-age dependency ratio.
It is the duty of this House to deal with these kinds of statistics.
We cannot plan for the future and expect that immigration is not one of those solutions.
If immigration is to be a solution, it must be joined up with the vital issue of integration.
Integration is often an issue which is misrepresented.
It is a vital issue.
We are dealing in this report not just with new immigrants.
People coming to the European Union for the first time to work may stay temporarily or they may stay forever.
We are dealing in this report in a joined-up way with those ethnic minority communities in the European Union â people like myself and my family â who are settled in the European Union but who also ask Member States for solutions to discrimination to ensure that full integration really takes place.
This involves the issues of citizenship requirements, language and a plethora of other issues relating to new immigrant communities, as well as settled ethnic minority communities.
We should be proud in this House that for settled ethnic minority communities, we now have â through ArticleÂ 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty â anti-discrimination legislation.
There is so much in this report to commend to the House; it is difficult to name just one integration measure â there are so many.
I urge the House and my colleagues across the House to look very positively at those integration measures for what they are.
Where we look at more sensitive issues â for example partnerships between the European Union Member States and developing countries; family unity and immigration â I have also been very sensitive in this report.
I have tried to bring together the whole House in agreement that Member States very often have the primary responsibility in these issues but that we should share best practice.
That is vital because we are dealing with some issues which we know are politically charged and politically sensitive.
The key achievement, I hope, in this report and the key achievement of the Commission communication was not to deal with these issues separately, or to pretend that they could be dealt with separately.
It was to take a firm hold on the Tampere agenda, bring it back to this House, use the progress of the Greek presidency which took many of these issues forward, and try to create what I would call a positive agenda.
I know that there will be some problems for some Members in this report.
I have tried very hard to bring all parties together because this is a politically sensitive issue.
Integration is something that should be the duty of all of us to move forward.
For that reason, I realise there are some sticking points.
I have done everything I can â for example on paragraph 32 and the right to vote â to bring the House together on these issues.
Unfortunately, not all issues will be to the satisfaction of everyone, but I urge colleagues to look at the result of the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs: 27 votes to 1, with 3 abstentions.
There was a general consensus around many of these issues and in the way they were approached.
I urge colleagues to vote positively and to think of the people who will be affected by this report, people who we represent: both new migrants who will perhaps become European citizens, but also people like myself who are now European citizens but look to being represented properly in a report which is moderate, comprehensive and should appeal to all sides of the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to be here today to present the main aspects of the Commission communication on immigration, integration and employment, and would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on the excellent quality of his report.
This very important Commission communication completes our response to the Tampere mandate and fulfils the pledge to examine the role of immigration in relation to the Lisbon strategy.
The communication carries two key messages.
The first â which has already been expressed in the Commission communication of November 2000 â is that, in the context of demographic ageing and decline, sustained immigration flows are likely and necessary if the European Union is to meet the Lisbon goals.
Secondly, the full potential of immigration and its contribution to economic development can only be realised if immigrants are fully integrated both into the labour market and into society in general.
Given the estimated speed of population decline from 2010 onwards and the results of the national survey conducted by the Commission, there is an urgent need to strengthen integration policies, as was called for by the European Council in Tampere and more recently at the European Council in Thessaloniki.
The Commission is pleased that the rapporteur has laid the emphasis on the potential which migrants bring with them.
It fully agrees that integration is a matter for society as a whole and that it is a two-way process, based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations, which implies that both the immigrant and the host society must adapt.
I would also like to emphasise that we fully agree that we must ensure a European legal framework for the admission of economic migrants and that Member States must keep to the promises made in Tampere.
The Commission has taken note of the difficulties encountered when negotiating in the Council the directive on admission for employment purposes, and is currently considering how best to approach bringing forward this politically sensitive issue.
A Green Paper, followed by an extensive consultation procedure, is envisaged and we are also undertaking a study on the links between illegal and legal migration, which may provide pointers for the future development of a more coherent legal framework for the admission of migrants for employment purposes.
Adoption of the directive on the admission of researchers is also envisaged for the very near future.
Negotiations on the directive on the admission of students is now entering the core phase and I am convinced that this proposal too will shortly be adopted.
The communication considers that, in order to ensure successful integration, there is a need for an holistic approach that takes into account not only economic and social aspects â these are very important â but also issues relating to cultural and religious diversity, civic citizenship, participation and political rights.
The Commission is therefore pleased to note the specific attention paid in the report to the concept we put forward of civic citizenship and the need to promote a sense of belonging.
A key condition for the successful implementation of an holistic approach of this type is that there should be improved overall policy coherence and synergies between immigration, integration and employment policies at all levels and across all disciplines and between all relevant actors, bearing in mind that prime responsibility for successful integration ultimately lies with the Member States.
Finally, I would like to stress that I fully agree with, and welcome, the rapporteur's suggestion to establish programmes for the initial reception of persons arriving in an EU Member State.
We are currently implementing the pilot projects in support of the integration of migrants.
There has been enormous interest in these pilot projects and the programme has been oversubscribed to a factor of ten.
We allocated EUR 4 million and applications have been made for more than EUR 41 million.
Let me end by saying that I believe, and hope, that this communication on immigration, integration and employment will provide a basis for strengthening integration policy for immigrants, which will be crucial both for the development of the EU economy and for the promotion of social cohesion in the next few decades.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am standing in for the draftsman MrsÂ TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, who had to return to Spain on a matter of urgency.
The speech by Mr Vitorino and the report by Mr Moraes both seem to me to be fully acceptable, in view of the opinion adopted by the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which underlines the following points: the Councilâs delay in adopting the legislative instruments presented by the Commission to implement the Tampere programme, a delay which, fortunately, was partly made up for in December with the adoption of the important directive on long-term residents; the need to retain a global view of immigration policy linked to employment policy and social integration policy; the usefulness of agreements with the countries of origin in order to guarantee the transfer of social security entitlements; the need to combat illegal immigration with repressive measures directed not against the illegal immigrants but against the traffickers who profit from them, and to combat illegal employment without discriminating against immigrant citizens; the usefulness of facilitating legal access for immigrants to the labour market so as to reduce demand and supply on the hidden market; the suitability of fighting discrimination and paying particular attention to the precarious situation of immigrant women.
The opinion underlines in particular the usefulness of creating the form of citizenship known as âcivic citizenshipâ, which enables third country nationals legally resident in the European Union to have economic, social and political rights and duties, including the right to vote in local and European elections, as the European Parliament has often requested.
Only in this way will all workers and residents be able to feel that they are participants and jointly responsible for the future of the Community, sharing its values and contributing to its growth and to living together in peace and solidarity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would thank the Commission for using its communications constantly to provoke discussion of immigration as part of the EUâs response to the ageing population and the ever shrinking workforce, over and above the other aspects of Europeâs encounter with other cultures.
These are controversial subjects in all the nation states, but it is high time we obtained analyses of the problems and challenges and proposals for common European solutions.
I should next like to congratulate MrÂ Moraes on the report.
It is a particularly relevant and necessary report right now.
I am grateful for MrÂ Moraesâ having integrated the opinions of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities on the need to apply a gender perspective to immigration and integration policy.
If this is not perceived as discriminatory, I also believe that this is due to MrÂ Moraes' particular background.
If we are to succeed in creating a successful immigration and integration policy at European level too, it is absolutely necessary for a gender perspective to be applied at all levels.
That is something of which I should like to remind the combined Commission once again.
I am aware that MrsÂ Diamantopoulou and her Directorate-General are working hard on this, but it is necessary for you, MrÂ Vitorino, as her colleague, to do so too.
Quite honestly, I find it just a little bit wearisome having to go on picking up the pieces of the Commissionâs initiatives and ploughing the same old furrows.
The headscarf debate is in full swing in many places in Europe at the moment.
Should we not, however, be looking, rather, at a number of other areas such as better integration, the ways in which we enter into dialogue and the ways in which we give the women concerned power over their own lives.
It might then be that the headscarf debate would solve itself.
It is important that immigrant women who, as such, are bearers of a culture also be given opportunities without being totally disowned by their families because they want both to embrace their own culture and a European attitude of gender equality in society.
If the women are not integrated, there is a danger of their sons or daughters not being so either and of their, in that way, being stuck in outdated gender roles which, in the Europe of today, are of no use in terms either of family life or of the labour market.
Think of the emphasis that is now being placed upon the need today also for male managers to be able to incorporate feminine values into their management styles.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Vitorinoâs statement that immigration is a two-way process which involves both rights and duties that have to be accepted.
There are also other facets to this problem, amongst which we should certainly examine the issues of entry, housing and civil liberties; in short, integration into our European society.
I believe it is a question, in this case at least, of turning these guest workers into citizens.
What image of Europe are we projecting to the outside world, Commissioner, if, at the point of entry into the Union, the Schengen system, instead of helping to create an area of freedom, security and justice, is often gradually turning into a formidable instrument of electronic data collection and control?
Then there are the problems of housing, the head-in-the-sand attitude, the tendency â helped by the media â to focus our fears and turn them into spectres that have much to do with highly misunderstood aspects of the cultural identity of our societies.
Thus we often have a reductionist image.
The report, with which I fully agree, should perhaps in my opinion have developed certain aspects which are plainly set out in the Commissionâs communication: civic citizenship; guaranteed core rights and obligations; respect for diversity; action to combat discrimination; women; family; civic, cultural and political life; participation; education; and, not least, religion.
I believe these varied aspects have to be taken into account, particularly in view of the legal tradition and the humanistic values which form the heritage that is still shared by our society.
Commissioner, Mr Moraes, we must reject the reductionist tendency of seeing immigrants merely as man- or woman-power, from a purely economic point of view.
This attitude must be utterly rejected: these people must be regarded as human beings who enrich our society, not just in terms of their ability to create growth and well-being but above all as people who embody values and a human, spiritual and cultural identity.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on his efforts and the good work he has done on a report on immigration, integration and employment, which I believe deserves to be viewed favourably.
These are issues that provide fertile ground for personal feelings and opinions, as well as for political temptations, and for that reason I wish to refer to the content of the Communication.
Immigration is a reality that needs to be regulated, and we must not bury our heads in the sand or look the other way.
In Europe, particularly in the countries with the lowest birth rate (Spain and Italy, amongst others), immigration is a necessary remedy.
If the estimated population of the European Union of 25, as the rapporteur has said, is going to drop from 303Â million to 297Â million by 2020 and to continue to drop to 280Â million in accordance with the estimate for 2030, the reduction in employment could have negative effects on economic growth, given that growth results from increased employment and productivity.
For this very reason, immigration must not be seen as a problem, but as an opportunity.
This is of course an opportunity, however, that raises certain problems which we must resolve.
Without being exhaustive, I would point out the problem of the integration of foreign children, children of immigrants, into schools; that of inter-cultural coexistence in communities and workplaces; that of family reunification, with all the problems raised by the very concept of reunification in a broad sense or in a narrow sense; of the regulation of people without documentation; the fight against illegal immigration and the mafias which exploit it; in particular, the problem of the specific situation of women immigrants.
In conclusion, immigrants are necessary, but how many can we accept?
Everybody who wants to come?
I think that is impossible.
It would be like transferring the problems of the countries of the immigrants are trying to leave to some of the Member States.
Bearing in mind that in the countries with very low birth rates, without immigration, the ratio between active and passive workers would become unsustainable in the medium term, I believe that the best approach is to integrate them.
They represent workforce, but, above all, they are human beings who the Member States need.
The Tampere proposals are therefore still valid: cooperation with countries of origin, a common European asylum system, management of migratory flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals.
For those who each State can legally receive and with a view to their integration, I believe that the European Unionâs Charter of Fundamental Rights offers us the course to follow in its Articles 4, 5 and 14, or, which comes to the same thing, the prohibition of inhumane or degrading treatment; the prohibition of forced labour and the right to education.
Since we are placing considerable emphasis on the idea of employment, more specifically, Article 15 states that the third-country nationals authorised to work in the territory of the Member States have the right to the same conditions as nationals.
Article 20 lays down equality for people before the law.
Article 21 prohibits all discrimination on other grounds, including on grounds of nationality; Article 23 guarantees equality between men and women in all areas, including employment, work and pay.
The report by Mr Moraes describes situations and proposes measures which are generally acceptable in view of the situation of immigrants who are frequently disadvantaged in terms of pay, health and safety conditions at work, hours and illegal employment.
In summary, often, in more cases than we would like, and we would like there to be no such cases, we are talking about exploitation.
We said that the first means of integration was employment, naturally followed by cultural integration, but we must not forget that Article 1 of the European Unionâs Charter of Fundamental Rights tells us that, âHuman dignity is inviolable.
It must be protected and respectedâ, and talks about the dignity of all human beings.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group of the European Parliament, I should like to start by emphasising that my group expresses its full support for the text of the report that we are debating today.
The Moraes report has remained precisely within the spirit and letter of the decisions taken at Tampere, expressly calling for a more dynamic policy to integrate immigrants, in the aim of granting rights and obligations similar to those which apply to the citizens of Europe.
Of course, immigration policy cannot mean just guarding borders, it cannot only be identified with repressive measures, repatriation and readmission.
The Europe of human rights and the Rule of Law needs to recognise the basic labour and political rights of immigrants, to recognise what they have to offer, their valuable contribution to the economic development of Europe.
Of course, social integration makes no sense without recognition of political rights and obligations, in other words the right to vote and to be elected.
I think that a huge moral issue is in the making with the position of numerous conservative Members, who gladly accept the exploitation of the manpower of immigrants, especially in jobs which Europeans have abandoned, and at the same time see them as a solution to the demographic problem, but who say nothing about recognising their political rights.
Equally immoral is the stance of those who, with opportunistic and expedient positions and practices, feed xenophobia and racism in Europe in an endeavour to raise new Berlin walls in people's minds and conscience.
Over the last ten years, my political group has been fighting for a more humanitarian approach to the problems caused by large waves of immigrants and refugees and we are fighting for a pluralist and multicultural Europe, for unity within our differences, where everyone will have their place and rights without discrimination and without notional walls between us.
European integration, social cohesion and the Lisbon strategy will be unattainable objectives, as you too stressed Commissioner, without the full safeguarding and application of all the human and political rights which European governments have promised to guarantee.
I should like to express my satisfaction, because I heard Mr Ahern this morning confirming that the promotion of human rights is one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency.
Only if their rights are respected will people of different origins and cultures feel part of the society in which they legally live and work, bearers of rights and obligations with their say on their everyday life, work, education, language learning, housing, health services, social services, their cultural environment and their political activities.
Parliament has repeatedly proposed full recognition of the political rights of anyone who has been resident in the European Union for five years.
I should also be obliged, Mr President, if you would allow me, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to call for something which is missing from the Commission communication: the integration of the gender aspect in all policies relating to immigrants' rights.
Women are the most vulnerable group and often the first victims of economic and sexual exploitation.
That is why special measures need to be taken to combat discrimination and facilitate their integration into social and professional life.
Such measures might be vocational training, childcare facilities, individualisation of their rights, counselling, specialist research etc.
Â Â  Mr President, anyone who has ever lived or worked in a different country or even in a town or city distant from home will have experienced some of the difficulties that may be encountered in moving from one environment to another.
Such difficulties become even more important when the change in linguistic and cultural context is a major one.
Yet history tells us too just how mutually beneficial migration may be, provided that it is appropriately managed.
The Moraes Report tackles the issues in a way that is at once realistic, sensitive and robust.
It makes practical suggestions.
Experience in Canada has already shown a number of these to be effective in achieving desired outcomes.
I am particularly grateful for the extent to which the report identifies problems for migrant women and measures to assist in resolving these.
I am speaking too on behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak.
Unfortunately she cannot be here today, but she would like me to express her thanks for the support that her amendments received in committee.
We rather regret that, given the degree of consensus the report achieved there, it has been opened up for amendments in plenary.
That said, we can support the majority of them, either in whole or in part.
We particularly support Amendment No 10, which makes the report more positive to enlargement, and Amendments Nos 7 and 12 on family reunification.
We do, however, have major difficulties with Amendment No 4, which backtracks on the commitment already made in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Finally, I would like to thank Mr Moraes for the work he has done to produce such a worthwhile report and express the hope that it gets the support it so much deserves.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a follow-up to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, the Commission has drawn up various proposals to control migratory flows and to combat illegal immigration.
The fact is, however, that the image of Fortress Europe that the European Union has generated, as a result of its profoundly restrictive immigration policies, stands in stark contrast to the real economic need for immigrant labour.
This is why this Commission proposal presents immigration as part of the solution to the ageing of Europeâs population and to the decline in its active population.
I deplore the fact that the Commission attaches greater importance to the economic and demographic aspects that lead to immigration than to the social and human aspects or to improving the living and working conditions of immigrants in the various countries of the European Union.
The fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings cannot result in a repressive policy that targets illegal immigrants.
It must instead target the traffickers and employers who exploit this situation.
This is why we have presented a set of what we believe to be important proposals to improve the Moraes report, in the hope that they will be adopted.
These include opposing the content of the Council directive on family reunification, which contravenes the fundamental right to live in a family and contains an unacceptable proposal to subject all immigrant children of at least two years of age to a test, before deciding whether they can join their parents.
I would also highlight our appeal to Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, adopted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution No 45158 of 18Â December 1990.
In addition, however, the overwhelming majority of immigrant workers who do not have residence permits but who do pay taxes and social security contributions in their host country should be automatically legalised.
We also hope that account is taken of the fact that the overwhelming majority of immigrants are citizens of third countries who emigrate to European Union countries to flee situations of extreme poverty in their country of origin and who must, therefore, be treated as victims and not as potential criminals.
Lastly, I am sorry that the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use the Moraes report to call into question established political rights, specifically the right of immigrant workers to vote in local elections to the European Parliament.
Immigrants must not be viewed as disposable workers who can be thrown away after use.
Immigrants, and women in particular, should be deemed worthy of reception conditions that respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and equal economic, social and cultural rights.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this very rich report, which covers a very wide area.
Part of the problem that we see in the European Union is that certain Member States now see themselves moving from countries of emigration to countries of migration, and other countries are coming face to face with the fact that they have made a very bad job in terms of using the talents and skills of many long-term migrants and, indeed, second and third generation nationals, as they are now in some countries.
In an ideal world migration should be a matter of free choice, not forced by circumstance, so we welcome the recognition in this report of the need to reduce the causes of forced migration.
Whether people wish, by choice, to come and help us out with out labour shortages and our demographic problems will depend on the circumstances of their welcome and the treatment that they receive here when they are resident.
I welcome Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the positive position of many other speakers this afternoon.
There are a number of issues concerning, in particular, the labour market and equal treatment, which form part of this will to come and work in the European Union.
The Article 13 directives tackling the racism and discrimination faced by many migrant workers are extremely important, as are the issues surrounding access to the market itself and equal pay and working conditions â rather than the exploitation of cheap migrant workers.
There is evidence in quite a number of European countries that certain industries rely very heavily on migrant workers whose status is often in doubt.
We need to be very careful that the demands of our economy do not encourage the proliferation of poor working practices and the trafficking of workers.
On the question of civic citizenship, we very much agree with that as it stands in the report.
We support the current text, including voting rights.
The UK experience, for example, is that a number of our local councils benefit greatly from the representation of first generation migrants.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating Mr Moraes in showing tremendous skilful diplomacy and good-humoured tact in dealing with what could be a very controversial and divisive issue, and finding common ground and a consensus between Members from the different political groups within this Parliament in an effort to move towards these common goals.
It is important that he emphasised that this issue is within the competence of the Member States and that it is through cooperation and coordination, rather than direction and enforcement of individual acts of legislation, that the best results can be achieved.
We are all presented with a common challenge on how best to manage migration flows and integration policies.
We in the European Union are on the threshold of our largest enlargement ever, when we open our doors to ten new countries and ensure that this European Union can continue to give benefit to the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.
They have suffered for so long from lack of opportunity, lack of economic development and lack of political freedom and skills.
We are also, as the Irish presidency announced today, emphasising the Lisbon Process to make Europe work to ensure that the people who get jobs get proper returns and protection for the jobs they are in.
That brings us to the point which many Members have already discussed here today, that is, how best we ensure that those who are emigrating into the European Union are given the protection and opportunities to benefit from any economic growth or any social rights that are there.
This is not an immediate process.
This cannot happen all at once.
Demographic changes are taking place in the Union at the present time which require us to get people from elsewhere.
This idea of managed migration is an important response to the demographic and economic changes which are taking place.
It is only by our acting in cooperation and coordination with those third countries â and I am delighted that the rapporteur was able to take on board my amendment on this â that we can ensure there is no cherry-picking of the best individuals from those third countries, that there is not a brain drain and that there is also benefit to the European Union.
Despite what some Members may say in this Chamber here today, this is not an open door policy and should not be an open door policy.
We have seen that where there is a lack of controls and where there is a lack of decision-making within Member States, we have problems with regard to racism.
Most individuals fear change that occurs on a massive scale.
With regard to women's issues, particularly protection for women who are illegally trafficked, each of us has a responsibility to stamp this out wherever it takes place.
Wherever the illegal exploitation of immigrant workers takes place, it should be stamped out, highlighted and individuals should be named and shamed for the very negative impact it has.
My last point is that tonight we will be discussing the employment and service sector, which is linked to this issue of protecting individuals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as the son of immigrants, I, too, realise only too well that attention must be paid to the different facets of immigration: to the problems that have been highlighted, but also to the opportunities it presents.
On the whole, I can endorse the report by MrÂ Moraes.
I should, however, like to draw attention to the connection between the three vital issues that the rapporteur mentions in recitalÂ 1: the need for migration to the European Union, improved integration, and cooperation with countries of origin.
First of all, I do not see that migration to the European Union is needed as a result of the ageing of the population.
Whilst there are still labour reserves in the European Union, at all events, the recruitment of migrant workers cannot constitute a solution.
I should like to comment on the second issue, too.
It is true that we need improvements in integration.
In the Netherlands, the debate on this is in full swing.
However, as the rapporteur rightly says, integration is connected with a whole range of domestic factors.
Examples are the social context, education and command of the language.
Precisely because of this observation, a European policy cannot be effective, and labour migration and integration should be a national priority.
ParagraphÂ 28 calls for attention to the problems that can be an issue in the field of general and reproductive health.
I recognise the need for this.
I must emphasise, however, that the promotion of abortion is out of the question.
I should be pleased to hear what the rapporteur was aiming at with this section.
I am also of the opinion that extending the definition of âfamilyâ in this context would not be conducive to the promotion of integration.
This would increase the problem of integration instead of solving it.
These comments do not detract from the need for cooperation with countries of origin, however, or for consultations among the Member States of the European Union.
The need to improve the situation of immigrants and their place in the labour market is clear.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the report that we are now discussing catalogues Utopian views, which, like all Utopian views, will prove unworkable in practice.
To begin with, migratory flows are not an inescapable reality, as the rapporteur says.
Just because he and his political allies want it does not mean that immigration is an inescapable disaster.
On the contrary, until further notice, Member States still have the right to determine for themselves who enters the country, when and under what conditions.
Also, the fact that most governments are extremely lax in applying their own immigration and integration legislation does not mean that the population is in agreement.
For example, there is by no means a popular democratic majority in favour of foreign nationals having the right to vote or in favour of new waves of immigration, as the report argues.
In our opinion, as democrats, there can be no harm in stopping to think about this and taking it into consideration.
After all, what legitimacy does a European Union have that takes decisions that are diametrically opposed to the will of the people?
The discussion on rights without obligations that unfortunately also finds expression in this report, has had its day.
It has been superseded, and it is urgently in need of comprehensive evaluation.
In the Netherlands, for example, a commission of inquiry has been set up to look into the current integration policy, and two governing parties have already come to the conclusion that the policy of cosseting has been a failure.
The report does not say a single word about the socio-economic or social problems that currently exist.
In Flanders, for example, unemployment among people of North African origin is four to five times that of the indigenous population, in relative terms, so that the question arises as to who actually has an interest in a new form of immigration.
Also, what about the indigenous people who no longer feel at home in their own town, their own street, as it is?
What about the rise of Islam and the deliberate unwillingness to integrate?
None of this is mentioned, and therefore this report is, I fear, yet another waste of time and resources.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by congratulating both the European Commission and Mr Moraes.
It is time that Europe stopped focusing exclusively on ways to limit flows of refugees and started making positive noises for once.
Positive noises are necessary, because we already have a great many migrants in our countries.
The last speaker rightly pointed out the extremely high unemployment among migrants.
Looking at the EU figures for 2002, I see that the unemployment rate among citizens of the European Union is 7.1%, but is more than double that for non-EU citizens living in the EU: almostÂ 16%.
If I then look at my own country, the figure isÂ 33.5%.
That means that a third of immigrants are out of work.
Looking at the government of those countries â and here it is not my intention to enter into controversy, but I should just like to say it, because the other side frequently enters into controversy â I see that countries with a left-wing government are by no means doing any better than those with a right-wing government.
Incidentally, the same goes for the right to vote.
I am always dumbfounded by the ideology that some people propagate in this Parliament, whilst in their own country, where they hold administrative power, they are unable to translate that same ideology into policy.
The right to vote is not granted in any of those countries: you can put it in your memoranda or your documents as much as you want, but your governments do not want to grant the right to vote and nor do your parties.
It is very easy, therefore, to come here and advocate it, no strings attached.
I say this because I have tried, in a moderate way, to ensure that reference is made in the text to political rights without making a direct link with the right to vote.
That is evidently still not enough for a large number of people whose countries have left-wing governments, although they cannot push it through in their own countries.
Why am I now speaking specifically about employment?
I am doing so because work is the best means of integration.
All the rest follows from this.
I think that the European Union and our countries are paying too little attention to this.
Those with a job have an income, can seek better accommodation and usually obtain legal status.
They learn the language at work and can put their children through the education system in these countries in the normal way.
Work is thus one of the most important possibilities for integration.
Sadly, we note that the European Union is defaulting in that regard.
I support the solution that is being proposed for the future, that is to say, that we manage migration on the basis of the work we are able to offer.
That implies, of course, also giving the present migrants work and gearing this management not only towards future migrants.
Looking at the EU figures, much remains to be done in this respect.
I should also like to draw attention to another point.
When it comes to highly qualified migrants â and here I am not especially talking about migrants from African countries, but those from the United States, for example â we never ask that they speak our language, because they end up in companies where the language of communication is English.
That is so easy: it is assumed that highly trained people will know the language of the company.
We make a great many requirements of less-skilled workers â soon they will have to take exams, too â making things very difficult for them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by congratulating both the Commission and the rapporteur on a really excellent report on a very important subject.
Without doubt, there is a lot of xenophobia and racism in our societies or, in any case, a fear of that which comes from outside.
There is extensive mistrust.
It is believed that people from other countries will come and take our jobs when, in reality, the situation is quite the opposite.
Those who come from other countries have, to the greatest degree, contributed, and go on contributing, to the prosperity we enjoy.
I can speak from my own experience.
I was born after the war and grew up on a housing estate whose residents mainly came from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland.
Approximately half of my neighbours had arrived as immigrants from other countries.
They contributed to Swedish prosperity, just like everyone else.
We should not have had the prosperity we enjoy today if these people, together with the rest of us, had not contributed to it.
We are now in another position.
We have, firstly, a refugee policy and, secondly, an immigration policy.
We must develop the refugee policy together, and it must be based upon international conventions.
Europe must be a refuge for people being persecuted and in danger of being killed in other countries.
We must have a humane refugee policy for which we take joint responsibility.
Immigration policy is something else.
It concerns people who are not in danger of being killed in their own countries but who would like to come to Europe, both to obtain a better life for themselves and to contribute to our societies, as they, in actual fact, do.
It is something they do already, and there will be a greater need for them to do so in the future.
We know how demographic developments look, and we need growth, employment and prosperity in Europe.
