Until recently, that was prevented by the familiar three stumbling blocks, about each of which I shall say a few words.
The first is primary law, immunity and suchlike: fortunately, the resolutions finally cut this loose.
This part inevitably has to go its own way.
The Council has repeatedly stated its intention to cooperate on this, and we shall hold it to that.
The second is the retirement age.
It has emerged that, on average, MEPs retire at 62 in practice.
In the light of social developments, the age of 63 preferred by the Council is not unreasonable.
The third is national taxation.
Years ago, the then Belgian Presidency proposed a compromise enabling us to accommodate subsidiarity on this point.
One knot that we still have to cut concerns pay.
The present national figures include extremes of high and low.
As far as the lowest figures are concerned, I assume that, historically, these were not based on a full-time position.
In our view, a weighted average of the present 15Â figures would represent a sound system of remuneration according to work done.
The idea of expressing that as a percentage of the remuneration of a judge of the Court of Justice seems to be a good solution, including where index-linking is concerned.
The Italian Prime Minister yesterday expressed pride that last weekendâs summit took so many decisions with great energy.
As far as we are concerned, the Statute is the test.
If this Presidency can report that the Council approves the Statute, it can consider itself a success.
If not, it is over to the Irish Presidency.
A good start is half the battle.
The Irish have demonstrated their capacity for hard work, and therefore I sincerely hope that they will be able to give the green light to the Statute by 15Â January.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to state once more, on behalf of my colleagues in the Movement for France delegation in the European Parliament, that we are absolutely opposed to Members of the European Parliament being paid their main salary out of the Community budget.
Under the Treaty, MEPs are the representatives of their respective nations, and it is therefore by the latter that they must be paid.
In the same way, the shaky tax compromise at present under discussion is not acceptable.
A simple, clear principle is required: MEPs must be subject to the same tax as their fellow citizens.
If, by some misfortune, the statute now being discussed were to lead, as may be feared, to an increased parliamentary salary and to reduced income tax; if, moreover, the idea were created that MEPs were escaping the financial controls of their own countries and were becoming employees of Brussels; then I say to you loud and clear that our fellow citizens would not accept this, and the EUâs credibility would be dealt another terrible blow.
Governments therefore need now to resist pressure from the federalists who want to detach Members of the European Parliament from their respective countries on the pretext of a principle of equality between MEPs that exists nowhere in the Treaties and that is entirely invented.
In order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, we must, on the contrary, strengthen the link between MEPs and their nations.
To summarise, the main parliamentary salary must be paid by the country of origin represented by the MEP.
Income tax must be levied on a national basis.
Expenses must be reimbursed on the basis of actual costs.
Finally, and by way of a compromise, it could be accepted that daily allowances should be considered as a supplementary income paid by the European institutions and subject, therefore, to Community tax.
That is the very most we can accept.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an unending tale of woe ever since 1998, and I believe that the reason for this is the absence from any of the Councilâs statements over past years of any clear indication of its position.
All the letters to which reference has been made were in legalese and gave no clear indication of what the Council was prepared to accept; even today, we have heard nothing along these lines.
Having heard the Councilâs presentation this morning, I can, quite simply, come to no other conclusion.
Having said that, the Councilâs position, as it has crystallised over the past months, is dishonest and mendacious; I make no bones about saying that, and I do so with reference to one decisive point, namely the way in which the taxation issue has been handled.
The Council accuses this House of taking the Statute as an opportunity to interfere in issues primary legislation, but the Council itself evidently sees nothing problematic in the way it seeks, in this Statute, to deal with such primary law issues as taxes.
The question is, therefore: what do you actually want, and how, when you have it, is it meant to work?
We know from the information given us by all three legal services â Parliamentâs, the Councilâs and the Commissionâs â that what is actually proposed here is contrary to the law, yet this Parliament is nonetheless prepared to go along with it.
Here and now, though, I can tell you that, in the event of this resolution being passed and of some Member State or other availing itself of this option, the matter is certain to end up in court â eventually in the European Court of Justice, which will have to hand down a ruling.
With the draft resolution that has now been put on the table, I believe we have reached the limit; we can do no more.
Earlier on, Mr Karas was right to say that we too, in this House, have a dignity of our own.
I believe that the offer has now been made, and what we are now waiting for is a definite statement of the Councilâs position by 15Â January at the latest.
This is also about what can be expected of our future colleagues, whose nomination processes are currently underway in the Member States.
They, too, have to know under what conditions they will be working in future in this Parliament.
The deadline, then, is 15 January.
By then, we want to know for sure what the Council wants, and what it does not want, or else this statute will have run out of time in the life of this Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, let me start with a word of thanks to the Commission for the support we have always received from it, and also, many times over, to the Italian Presidency of the Council.
I found what it had to say clear and precise.
Let me say that the resolution we have produced, and the Italian Presidencyâs statements today, make it possible for us to come to an agreement, but please let us do so quickly, for we cannot allow this issue to overshadow the elections.
So what is this about?
After almost a quarter-century of direct elections to the European Parliament, we still have the structure of a parliamentary assembly, but we have to develop into a real parliament, and that is what this Statute is for.
Of course, it is only an initial step, which has, of course, to be followed by what has already been laid down in the 1965 Protocol.
Only then will we have a real statute for MEPs, and so I appeal to the governments to take this issue up and take it forward.
The second point I want to make is that we all know that the current position, with differing salary-related payments and this wretched system for reimbursing travelling expenses, is unsustainable, but let me remind you of a simple truth: these things can only be sorted out together.
There will be no Statute unless the way in which travel costs are reimbursed is reformed, but that will not be reformed without a Statute.
If you want to detach the one from the other, then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity.
This is where we need clarity and transparency; that is how we treat with respect those who elect us and by whose money we are paid.
I would like, at this point, to thank all the group chairmen for making it possible to submit a joint resolution, but there are three persons whom I would like to name, without whom we would not have got to where we are, namely the chairman of my group, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, and, of course, the President of the European Parliament, MrÂ Cox.
Following what I hope is the merely temporary collapse of the new constitution, let us, today, send out a very quiet message to the effect that there is perhaps such a thing as progress in Europe after all.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to be called to speak immediately following Mr Rothley, who has done so very much during the whole of this Parliament to bring the matter to the conclusion that we seem now to be at the point of reaching.
He has paid compliments to other colleagues, so let me pay a very warm compliment to him.
It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this matter.
It is something to be welcomed by us all that, provided the Council keeps its eye on the ball, we shall have a proper Members' Statute before the next elections.
It is absolutely critical to these elections.
I shall not be a candidate myself, so I speak without a personal interest in the matter.
Indeed, I will be 63 when I retire, but not on this pension scheme.
It is essential to have a proper expenses regime and to have a common salary.
I have been rapporteur several times on privileges and immunities under the existing protocol.
It must be said that it is an extremely labyrinthine and arcane system and not a satisfactory basis for the privileges and immunities of a House of this kind.
Therefore, although this matter is not going to be brought home at this stage, I would echo the proposition that we must work hard in the near future to get the whole issue of privileges and immunities put on a proper footing as well.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, as you can see from this Chamber, the feeling is unanimous: after 25 years, it is time for the European Parliament and the Members of this Parliament to have a single Statute or a single set of rules.
Furthermore, after 25 years, it may well also decide on our place of work.
Perhaps unlike my colleagues, however, I personally think that it is just fine.
There is a genuine problem: public opinion is focusing on us and this system is not working.
Of course, I find the word âStatuteâ a bit pompous.
The basic idea was to incorporate into the Statute a genuine charter for MEPs, which would also include the prerogatives of MEPs, a common package that would have given a meaning to the word âstatuteâ.
If we want the extremely important system of financial provisions for MEPs to progress, let us call it by its name.
We should, however, reserve the word âstatuteâ for a time when, like national parliamentarians, we have common rules for the other issues that had also been incorporatedÂ â and which today have to be removed, or we imagine they will have to be removed, for a whole series of reasonsÂ â but which remain fundamental.
Our statute will only be valid when we have provided for prerogatives and functions and for effective equal status with national Members of Parliament, as, for example, in Italy, where MPs can visit prisons whenever they wish.
This seems to me to be the correct meaning of the âMembersâ Statuteâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that when substantial problems exist, as in the case of the Statute, we simply need to be patient because, in the end reason will prevail, awareness will emerge and everyone will act responsibly for a moment.
Personally, I have to say that, in the course of my long political career, this is one of the few times when I really must express my satisfaction in plain, non-rhetorical terms.
I cannot refrain from doing so and I must thank you, Mr President; with this interinstitutional agreement and this Statute, you have, discreetly and without fuss, made a significant contribution to the cause of Parliament.
I believe that, if this unanimity we see really does bring results, this will be remembered as an important day.
Under your guidance, Mr Rothley and I have stubbornly â I would even say pig-headedly â insisted on discussing this issue and putting forward arguments that have prevailed in the end.
I believe that the Italian Presidency must take the credit, even though the Constitution has not seen the light of dayÂ âÂ if MrÂ Antonione will allow me to say so, for this point which really is the most relevant.
Ladies and gentlemen, we could have achieved a result even before 9 December, but this was not fully understood when I convened the committee, on 9/10 December, to force the Council to face up to its responsibilities.
We still have time, though, and I believe that, if we are to attribute a fundamental significance to the date of 15Â January, we must act now.
Personally, I see no problem, if you agree MrÂ President with convening the committee now for 12 January, in that it would be, Mr Antonione, a clear, transparent and specific act by Parliament.
This is the first time I have been in the European Parliament in this legislative period, but I have studied this issue throughout the long process.
The first part gives autonomy, guarantees, visibility, transparency and unanimity to the rules governing the Members of the European Parliament and to Parliament as a whole.
This deals with the amending of primary law.
The second part is the necessary organisational section, where we have achieved a balance by way of a compromise that I think does credit to Parliament.
It is true that small sacrifices have been made, but the issue now looks fairly clear and acceptable.
If, as Mr Rothley has said, the words of the Italian Presidency are now clear, if the Presidency has spoken on behalf of all Member States and all the governments, I think that, on 15Â January, after the prior meeting of the committee on 12Â January, this major problem can genuinely be resolved and Parliament will have taken a great leap forwards.
Â Â  Mr President, since I have sat with Willy Rothley for the last ten years, I have been a privileged witness of his determination to make progress on this issue.
I would like to congratulate him and recognise his efforts, since he really deserves it.
Furthermore, I would like to stress that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission and my colleague, MrÂ Lehne, have pointed out that respect for primary law includes a very important principle, that of the unity of Community fiscal legislation.
In our proposal there is a modification of the exceptional fiscal status, taken up in the so-called âBelgian compromiseâ, which only makes sense in so far as it is a delegation, a kind of opting out with regard to general law, but which cannot be interpreted as a general power before the States to establish taxation on the sums paid by the Community institutions.
With this exception, the proposal that the various political groups are now presenting in the European Parliament could effectively represent a step forward in the establishment of unitary status with regard to the European Union.
I do not believe that now is the time to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but quite the opposite: we are building a European Union which must be based on common institutions with a common operation, and this is what explains the proposal for European parliamentary statute and a statute for European political parties.
It is not a question of granting privileges of any type, but of establishing a situation of equality amongst all the Members of the European Parliament.
I hope that we can approve the text without any of the amendments presented.
Â Â  Mr President, the history of the package of terms and conditions of Members of this House is not a very glorious one and it does no particular credit to all those who have been involved with it, who seem somehow to be hexed by the subject matter.
I do not want to go over old ground.
The current version of the Members' Statute is not perfect â far from it.
But in the real world it is probably as good as one can hope to get.
From our point of view we British Conservatives have four cardinal principles: firstly salary should be comparable to our national MPs' salaries; secondly we should pay the same tax as our constituents; thirdly the expenses regime should be cleaned up; and finally there should be a clean break with the past.
The proposed salary is not the same as a UK MPs' salary, but the overall package is not dissimilar when all aspects are taken in the round.
We shall pay tax on the same basis as our constituents.
The expenses regime is going to be cleaned up and, while there is not an entirely clean break with the past, the anomalies are such that I do not assess them to be very great and they will of course waste away over time.
As a result, we shall vote for it.
I would like to conclude by saying to all those who are likely to be the important players in the end game: do not faff about.
Let us get the whole matter done and dusted in double quick time!
Â Â  Mr President, today we have a chance to remove the barriers which have held back meaningful discussion on the whole question of the Statute of Members.
If we can make progress on the Statute, then we can tackle the thorny question of our own expenses.
Because of the covert way in which we MEPs are paid expenses, we have left ourselves wide open to criticism.
The Statute and the reform of the expenses are inextricably linked; they go hand in hand, as Mr Rothley clearly pointed out.
Therefore, while we are asking the Council to make progress on the Statute, I am asking Parliament to make progress on reform of the expenses scheme because, if we bring in a system that is clear, unambiguous and fair as regards our expenses, then we can face the electorate with confidence again next June.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, it should be said that the contents of the compromise that appears to have taken shape lately cannot be said to be acceptable, just as various aspects of the original proposal were unacceptable.
We can certainly support the principle behind it: to give every MEP the same dignity and, above all, a constant reminder of a single point of reference for the exercise of their mandate, with the same common rights and responsibilities.
Many aspects of the proposed law run counter to this principle: the first concerns the time when this law would come into force.
In my opinion, rivers of words and of ink have already been spoken and written on the enlargement of the European Union, to support and comment positively on the many facets of the procedure; I do not intend, therefore, to add my positive thoughts on the matter.
Nevertheless, it has not been uncommon, especially recently, for the Community institutions to adopt legislative provisions and with many expressions of regret acknowledging the need to involve the future Member States only in the conciliation phase.
Since that is the case, it is difficult to understand why it is a matter of such urgency to adopt the aforementioned Statute, since this would be done without the contribution of MEPs from the future Member States.
I mean that we are being deliberately âforgetfulâ.
Furthermore, if the principle is one of equality, indeed material equality, it is difficult to understand why MEPs, from whatever State they may be, when carrying out their mandate, which is at least equal to, if not higher than, that of a national MP, may have fewer prerogatives than the latter.
In emphasising this point, I am, of course, referring to the national systems that provide the highest guarantees, because I find a system of rights that, in practice, tends to dumb down the guarantees provided for, is unacceptable.
There is, however, more and it concerns points that are, if you like, less noble, but that also call the concept of dignity into question.
Certainly, nobody would object to a single source being responsible for the payment of salaries, but there is no doubt that one of the major problems here is the size of the salaries, that is, the reference to the amount that should, in the future, be paid as against current remuneration, whether this be higher or lower.
In terms of ethics within their own country, I cannot see how one could justify a European Parliament Member suddenly receiving a higher, and in some cases much higher, salary, even from a source other than the current one.
Similarly I cannot imagine how other Members could contemplate receiving a lower salary than the one they receive today, especially in consideration of the higher salaries received by national MPs, if not, indeed, by regional advisors, in the same State.
If, for a moment, however, we examine the principle of equality and see it as a positive factor, the concern expressed about taxation would mean falling back again into the trap of extreme disparities.
Then the compromise on the age of retirement does not seem to be worthy either.
The overwhelming majority of the Member States currently set retirement in public organisations at the age of 65 or over.
Thus, either we have the courage to ignore the fact that, because the pension scheme for MEPs is practically self-financed, it falls outside the pension costs of each Member State and, for the sake of pure political consistency, we opt for a retirement age limit of 65; or we show similar courage in admitting that the fund is, in substance, of a private nature and that the only valid rules are those dictated by actuarial statistical calculation.
I think that, in the event that the two other institutions fail to address this, the first to place themselves in a position of subordination will not be Parliament so much as its own Members.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make three observations in relation to what we have heard here this morning.
The first observation relates to the difficulty raised by certain Members regarding the difference, in their scandalous judgment, between the pay of an MEP and that of certain political posts in candidate countries.
Mr President, I believe that this difficulty makes no sense, because, within the fifteen current Member States there are also differences in income, and we are not for that reason going to establish different pay for each of them.
And within each Member State there are regions with different levels of income and, as far as I know, national Members of Parliament are not paid differently according to the region they come from.
Therefore, Mr President, it is entirely logical that there should be a single statute and pay should be the same for all the Member States, and observations of this type seem to me to be offensive to the candidate countries.
The second observation relates to the idea that MEPs should be paid from the budgets of their respective States.
Mr President, this is absurd as well, because if our function is European, our pay should come from the European budget, or are Members of Parliament in the national states paid by their constituency within the State?
They are paid by the State as a whole.
The third observation, Mr President, relates to the idea we have heard about the homogeneity which must exist between the pay of the European Member of Parliament and the national Member of Parliament.
This is also absurd, Mr President, or is it the case that in the Member States a councillor of a small town is paid the same as a councillor of the large city, or a councillor the same as a senator?
Each post receives a salary in accordance with its level and its scope.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all the factors for resolving this problem are on the table; the ball is in your court.
Resolve them once and for all, because this problem has gone on too long.
Â Â  Mr President, many things have already been said and, in the minute at my disposal, I will not even be able to cover the most important aspects.
I believe that there is no doubt as to the need to adopt a statute, even from the point of view of the role and legitimacy of this Parliament.
Furthermore, everyone in my group, in particular Mr Rothley and MrÂ BarÃ³nÂ Crespo and the Italian delegation, have always declared themselves in favour of the Statute and have always supported the need for it, voting for it with conviction last June.
I believe, however, that we should not delude ourselves, Mr President.
What we are, in fact, discussing todayÂ â and, if it is necessary, let us do soÂ âÂ is not the Statute, but the adjustments of salaries.
I think that it is rather humiliating for Parliament, but that is all we are discussing.
Let us call a spade a spade.
If it is the only thing we can doÂ âÂ and this is the Councilâs responsibilityÂ â let us do it; but we must not call it a statute, because this is not a statute.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for the helpful statements they have made today, and all the speakers in the debate â in particular Mr Rothley and Mr Gargani for their exceptional contributions behind the scenes, over such a long period of time and, in particular, during the Italian Presidency.
I should like to stress to the Council that if we have the wisdom later today to produce a clear majority on this, then we need to deal with it as a matter of the utmost urgency.
If that should happen, we look forward to working with you on that urgent matter.
The debate is closed.(1)
The vote will be at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the role of the Union in conflict prevention in Africa, particularly in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of points on the issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, a matter which has been at the heart of the Italian Presidencyâs work regarding the African continent throughout these six months.
The most urgent task would, in actual fact, appear to be stabilising the continent, in other words preventing or eliminating armed conflict, where it is present.
Indeed, everyone agrees that only by creating conditions of peace and security across the board can we promote development.
Without these conditions, the eradication of poverty, the promotion of human rights, high-quality employment and environmental protection are empty dreams or short-lived achievements.
There is to be no bartering of development for peacekeeping operationsÂ âÂ we simply need to adopt an integrated approach.
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, made this quite clear when he said at the African Union Summit in Maputo that a comprehensive approach is needed which focuses in turn on peace and security, human rights and democracy, reconstruction and development.
The first people to become aware of this were the African Governments themselves, which, already in the programme document for the New Partnership for Africaâs Development, stated that war and underdevelopment are two aspects of the same problem and fuel each other.
On the basis of this hypothesis, they have set up the necessary bodies to prevent, manage and resolve their crises, in particular the Peace and Security Council and the joint committee of the largest African States.
The new political element which must be stressed is this new determination on the part of the Africans to shoulder their responsibilities in the field of peace and security too on the basis of the principle of ownership.
This is an attitude which the European Union has consistently encouraged and supported with measures seeking to strengthen African capacity, at both pan-African level and subregional level, through ECOWAS, IGAD and SADC.
In the face of this changing political situation, the Italian Presidency has worked actively to encourage a European response that would be able to meet the challenge.
To this end, we promoted, first and foremost, a theoretical reflection on conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, through a research seminar organised in Rome on 28 July.
We reinvigorated the EU-Africa dialogue, which had come to a halt after the postponement of the Lisbon Summit, through two troika meetings, the second of which was held on 10 November in Rome.
This reinvigoration focused principally on the issues of peace and security, on which substantial convergence with the Africans was recorded.
Lastly, we implemented ongoing measures to support the peace processes underway in CÃŽte dâIvoire, Liberia, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, North Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and so on. We sustained constant diplomatic activity, which took the form, not least, of a series of numerous EU Ministerial Troika missions to Africa.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resultsÂ âÂ the short-term results, at leastÂ âÂ are largely positive.
The real-time management of the Liberian crisis, both at political and diplomatic level and at financial level, contributed decisively to bringing the conflict to an end, to the conclusion of a peace agreement and to the establishment of the current transitional government.
In the same region, now that the recovery of Sierra Leone has been consolidated, it is CÃŽte dâIvoire which is facing the greatest trial.
CÃŽte dâIvoire is the real driving force of the regionâs economy and it is in this country that the most important battle is being fought out.
The progress made thus far is appreciable.
The creation of a national reconciliation government, the adoption of an amnesty law, the agreement of 4 July 2003 between the national armed forces and the rebels, are significant stages in a process which needs to be completed by the quartering and disarmament of the troops and the extension of the Stateâs administration to the whole territory until the presidential elections scheduled for 2005.
The European Union has done and is continuing to do everything in its power to ensure that a way out of the present is found, that reunification becomes irreversible and that the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements is completed.
The declarations of 22 September and 9 December, the mid-October visit of a European Ministerial Troika and the work of the European Union representative in the Monitoring Committee are evidence of this.
Thanks to the rapid intervention of the French armed forces and the ECOWAS troops, it was possible to avoid open conflict.
However, the need remains for a more substantial United Nations peacekeeping force, within which African troops can continue to operate.
This is the request made by ECOWAS at New York, and this request must be supported by the European Union.
These references to specific conflict situations make one appreciate the determination displayed by the Africans to manage their conflicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, the huge amount of work which needs to be done in order to strengthen operating capacities, particularly those for which subregional organisations are responsible.
In this sense, the EU-Africa partnership can only evolve into tripartite cooperation between the European Union, the United Nations and Africa, in which each component complements the others.
The Artemis operationÂ âÂ the first European-led military operation to take place outside the training groundÂ âÂ showed the effectiveness of a rapid intervention with trained, well-organised forces, which can stop a crisis situation of conflict and then allow a larger United Nations force with an appropriate mandate to address larger stabilisation tasks.
The forces of the subregional African organisations too can play this role of rapid intervention to resolve a crisis with a view to being replaced by the slower, better-organised United Nations machine.
This could be the case in Burundi, where the first wholly African peacekeeping force is currently operating, which could be replaced by the United Nations within a year from now.
Thus far, we have mentioned specific measures carried out by the European Union under pressure of crises and humanitarian emergencies.
The most remarkable innovation is, however, the creation of a Peace Facility â allocated EUR 250 million and financed by the EDFÂ âÂ decided by the Council of the European Union on 18Â November 2003.
In this way, the European Union is giving itself a dependable rapid-intervention instrument which ties in with the strategic partnership relationship linking the European Union to Africa and with the principle of African ownership.
The peace facility will make it possible, with all the guarantees provided by decision-making procedures, to fund a specified range of activities which are part of peacekeeping operations carried out by African forces.
The request for this submitted by the Maputo African Union Summit thus met with a response from the European Union which made good the commitments and promises so often reiterated.
For at least a decade, along with the United Nations, we have been urging Africa to take control of its future and, with the support of the international community, to break the vicious circle of conflict and poverty.
Now that the African leaders themselves have taken up the cry, as is shown by the new philosophy which underpins the creation of the African Union and Nepad, implementing the promises with appropriate decisions becomes a matter of political credibility.
If wisely implemented, the Peace Facility could prove to be one of the most important instruments for the future of relations between Europe and Africa.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that, in the field of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, substantial developments in planning and operation have been mapped out.
We are trying to establish these developments through the revision of the base document, on which the overall action of the European Union in the sector has been based thus far: I refer to the European Union Common Position concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa of 14 May 2001.
The operation we have launched, which is underway, calls on us to integrate the current common position, updating it, first and foremost, with a reference to combating terrorism and organised crime, which are fuelled by situations of conflict; therefore, with a firm reference to the role of civil society and, within civil society, the role of women; then, with particular focus on the economic dimension of the conflicts themselves and, in this regard, on the unlawful exploitation of natural assets; lastly, with a reference to the very serious situation of what are known as âfailed Statesâ, or territories with no control or public institutions which can exercise the necessary authority and provide basic services.
This is an ongoing operation, which we entrust to the future Irish Presidency and which will firmly establish the European Unionâs overall approach to the major issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the political situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Even if some progress has been made in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, the current deadlock has to be broken.
The new forces have been boycotting the Council of Ministers for two months and this boycott, as well as the mutual lack of trust, makes it impossible to launch the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration process which is a prerequisite for the reunification of the country.
There are still severe violations of human rights and the Commission is also very concerned about the humanitarian situation.
Since the outbreak of the conflict in September 2002 the Commission has provided EUR 7.24 million for emergency relief operations in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance in 2004 in the framework of the global plan for coastal West Africa.
The European Union is actively involved in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, both financially and politically.
Since the beginning of the crisis on 19 September 2002, it has issued nine declarations and has repeatedly urged all Ivorians to work in harmony for the reunification of the country and the preparation of peaceful democratic elections in 2005.
In Abidjan the Commission, as well as the EU presidency, is a member of the monitoring committee of the Marcoussis Agreement.
The 10 signatories of the agreement recommended the creation of its international committee in order to ensure its implementation.
The committee has been quite active.
Since its first meeting at the end of February it has met more than 50 times, but still its action has been criticised by all 10 political forces apart from President Gbagbo's party, the FPI.
Discussions should quickly take place between all members of the committee on how to improve its efficiency.
To restore its credibility the committee should undertake a thorough rethinking of its current role, not only to act as an arbitrator but also primarily to work in a more open manner in order to create more confidence as to how its work is viewed.
A kind of duty reporting to headquarters should be established, with minutes from the meetings to improve its transparency with regard to the institutions represented within this committee.
It has been too inward-looking in the way it has functioned and changes there could be productive.
But what is most important is to ensure that the political players in CÃŽte d'Ivoire really understand the need to create a spirit of coexistence and compromise.
They must make an effort to get along within one nation.
Without that attitude it will be very difficult to create real progress.
As far as the Union's capacity in conflict prevention, management and resolution is concerned, efforts are being undertaken to define a relevant common strategy.
The main aspects of this entail strengthening regional integration through support to ECOWAS, reinforcing coordination with the UN and enhancing national and regional political dialogue.
All this is something we are directly engaged in and we do what we can in all these relations.
The initiatives of the African Union on peace and security, as well as actions against the illicit exploitation of natural resources, will be taken into account as part of this process.
I find it quite correct that Parliament is looking at these aspects in this kind of situation.
Concerning Mrs McKenna's amendments to suspend the fisheries agreement with CÃŽte dâIvoire because of inconsistencies in EC policies and because it is not possible to control national waters, I would like to make the following point.
The Commission has suggested extending the fisheries agreement for one year, taking into consideration that, with this agreement, CÃŽte dâIvoire will continue to benefit from targeted actions for scientific research, control and surveillance.
The activities and the training of the Fisheries Ministry and investment in the CÃŽte dâIvoire economy, mainly through the three tuna factories, are guaranteed only if the agreement is extended.
Bankruptcy of the tuna canneries, currently generating 5Â 000 direct local jobs and more than 30 000 indirect jobs, would create a great deal of unemployment and could possibly lead to social unrest in Abidjan.
It would also mean that the port of Abidjan would be definitely doomed as a fish-landing port for probably several years to come.
There is no doubt that a failure to extend the agreement would have far-reaching negative consequences and could only deepen the current crisis in CÃŽte dâIvoire, so I would not recommend pulling this element into a situation which is already problematic enough.
Â Â  Mr President, unfortunately the crisis in Ivory Coast means that today we have once again to deal with this country â which was not very long ago a good example of political stability â its economic progress and the living conditions of its inhabitants.
Six political groups in this House are sponsoring a resolution, which we will certainly approve this very morning, in which we essentially call for the strict application of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement as the surest way of re-establishing the Rule of Law and the peaceful coexistence of all the parties in conflict.
I entirely agree with the Commissioner, Mr Nielson, who has just stated that all efforts will be doomed to failure if the conflicting parties do not show clear signs of goodwill to achieve those agreements and live in peace together.
I must say that this lack of vocation or capacity for agreement amongst them seems to me to be the most serious obstacle we are facing in terms of achieving peace in Ivory Coast.
A few months ago this Parliament visited the country and spoke with representatives of the whole of civil society, the authorities and the opposition.
What we saw was not in every case a good example of a will to resolve the crisis.
It is well known that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement was not accepted with satisfaction by significant sectors of Ivory Coast society.
When Mr Gbagbo returned to Abiyan, he was received with huge protests against the agreements which he himself had accepted â then he told us that he had not signed them, using a kind of double language which seemed to me to be unacceptable.
Within the government itself, some of the ministers representing what we could describe as the ârebel sectorâ gave a clear demonstration of what it means to be a rebel.
Their words were not at all friendly towards the other part of the government, to which Mr Gbagbo belonged.
Mr Gbagbo himself, who was very friendly and very pleasant and who, during a meal which we were invited to in the presidential palace itself, explained to us his view of the problem, he said things in the presence of many of us who were there â no less than 10 or 15 people â which I believe do not point in the right direction, such as, for example, that he had to strengthen his army and that he had plans to buy certain military materials in the countries of the East.
We believe that this is the completely wrong direction.
There are other examples, such as the ethnic issue, which, as we say in the resolution, is not at the root of the conflict and is probably not its only cause.
But I must say that this issue of ethnicity and Ivory Coast citizenship was brought up in all our conversations â several dozen of them â during which every one of our interlocutors spoke about the problems caused by the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people originating above all from Burkina Faso who create problems and who are victims â themselves, in many cases â of violence.
I therefore believe that we must continue to make every effort to ensure compliance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, establishing greater coordination between all the parties with the DAC, the United Nations and the European Union.
Having seen what we have seen, and in view of what I have summarised briefly, I cannot be very optimistic about the immediate future of that country which is so in need of peace.
Â Â  Mr President, since that mission to the CÃŽte d'Ivoire by ACP and European Parliament parliamentarians in May 2003 it has become increasingly clear that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement is a rather imperfect instrument.
There remains, as others have said, an extremely worrying reluctance on all sides to work together, to co-exist, to cooperate and to work for reconciliation.
That was absolutely clear when we were there and it remains the case.
There has to be an end to impunity and, as the Commissioner said, a much clearer determination is essential to achieve demilitarisation, demobilisation and then rehabilitation in that country.
Mr Prodi visited CÃŽte d'Ivoire in November and he made serious pledges on these issues.
This Parliament would like to see those pledges turned into real and immediate financial assistance as quickly as possible.
ECHO still needs more support in order to do its essential work of implementing the accords.
This is the key to bringing peace, as is the need to put in place humanitarian assistance, protection for civilians and so on.
In the context of African Union and our ACP obligations, Commissioner Nielson suggested an extremely welcome and innovative way in which we can support Africa's own efforts to manage conflict.
My understanding is â and I would like clarification on this because it was not clear from what the Council said â that certain Member States want to use the peace facility, which is well worked out, to fund directly sub-regional organisations, apparently without consulting the African Union, or even seeking the endorsement of the African Union.
For me this is an incredible proposal and one I would like to hear explained this morning.
Would the Council agree that the European Union must give sustainable long-term support to the continental peace efforts that have been made and give assistance to the architecture which has been put in place to build security on the continent by the African Union?
Does the Council believe that the Member States would agree to support the declared wish of all African Heads of State that finance be managed under the African Union's authority and in no other way?
I would appreciate some clarification as to where we are at the moment on the extremely important proposal for which Commissioner Nielson was responsible.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for a long time the future of CÃŽte dâIvoire looked bright.
It was one of the countries in Africa held up as an example of stability and economic growth.
Little by little, CÃŽte dâIvoire fell into a cycle of violence, chiefly since the introduction of , or Ivorian identity, a concept that is in fact comparable with apartheid.
It is absolutely clear that the ruling political class, the President included, is capable of anything in order to reinforce its power, and, and in so doing, does not even balk at taking the path of ethnic cleansing.
The parallels with the events of ten years ago on the eve of the genocide in Rwanda are alarmingly great.
There is of course no immediate alternative to the Marcoussis Agreements, but MrsÂ Kinnock is right in saying that these may well have to be evaluated and the necessary adjustments made.
At any event, the main problem is their enforceability.
The international community must no longer stop at lip service.
Commissioner, the European Union must consider all possible initiatives and instruments, including deferring aid to CÃŽte dâIvoireuntil the government is prepared to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements consistently and in their entirety.
Remaining silent and looking on passively today could very well be interpreted as passive complicity tomorrow.
Please let us avoid a repeat of Rwanda.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire continues to deteriorate.
We have condemned the concept of âivoirityâ, which has tainted the electoral legitimacy of Laurent Gbagbo, but we have also condemned the military rebellion, which is unacceptable in a democracy.
We were sceptical about the signing of the Marcoussis peace agreement, which showed every sign of having been dictated by the former colonial power.
As might have been expected, it was not viable and led to the resignation, in September, of the rebel ministers in the government of national reconciliation.
Although progress has been made in recent months, new confrontations over the last fortnight have weakened the chances of relaunching the peace process.
Now, the violence in the north, as well as in the cocoa belt, and the abuses by the so-called patriotic forces are leading to ever-increasing human rights violations.
We request that these cease without delay and that the government and the rebel forces stop exploiting demonstrations which, in reality, are not at all spontaneous.
We demand that investigation procedures be put in place to punish those responsible for the abuses.
We condemn just as vigorously the assassination of the French journalist Jean HÃ©lÃšne, and we ask that an international inquiry be set up in order to bring those responsible to justice.
We call for genuine negotiations to be resumed with a view to bringing the conflict to an end.
It is only by taking account of all the political forces in the country and of the balance between these forces that it will be possible to find a peaceful and democratic solution, leading to the relaunch of a peace process that must include the disarmament of the militias, together with free legislative and presidential general elections under international supervision.
If this is to be achieved, the European Unionâs policy of prevention must tackle the structural causes, that is to say poverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, the oppression of minorities and the disorganisation of the state.
Alongside this, the EU must adopt a coherent trade and development policy in order to guarantee aid to the African economies and, in particular, to the African population.
In this context, we call upon the Commission not to extend the fisheries agreement with CÃŽte d'Ivoire for as long as implementation of development cooperation within the framework of the Cotonou agreements remains suspended.
To conclude, we would signal our commitment to respect for minorities, which is an indispensable basis for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts in Africa.
Â Â  â Mr President, there can be no doubt that the role of the Union, together with the United Nations and the African Union, is very important in conflict prevention and peace-making on the continent of Africa, which continues to be torn apart by quarrel and armed conflict.
The situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire is a typical example of tension based on social and ethnic differences.
The murder of the French journalist Jean HÃ©lÃšne, the correspondent for Radio France Internationale, reveals the depth of the crisis and disdain for the Marcoussis agreement.
This agreement, together with the Cotonou agreement, offers a very good framework for crisis settlement and respect for human rights and the rules of democracy.
Nonetheless, generally when we talk of democracy and peaceful coexistence in an area in which violence is a daily reality, we need to take account of two serious factors.
First, traditional and local approaches to conflict settlement.
Viable solutions depend to a large degree on the ability of local society to build up a relationship of trust and cooperation between opposing groups.
Experience has shown that solutions based on local values and mediation techniques have far more potential to bring about lasting peace.
That is why we also need to incorporate local perceptions and practices into international mechanisms.
Secondly, serious account needs to be taken of the role of women in conflict settlement and the reconciliation process and I am grateful to Mr Antonione for mentioning this.
This issue has repeatedly preoccupied the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and we have processed relative positions on the role of women in peace processes.
Analyses have also been carried out by the UN and, within the framework of the Greek Presidency, there was a related report and conclusions by the European Council in Thessaloniki.
The Council and the European Commission therefore need to take account of this factor and to reinforce the initiatives of women in peace processes through the budget; EUR 250 million would be a respectable sum.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention that on 10Â December, which was International Human Rights Day, the ManÎ¿ River Womenâs Peace Network was awarded the UN prize for human rights for 2003.
This is an organisation, consisting of women from the three countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which played a crucial role in preventing hostilities between the three countries by forcing the political leaders to return to the negotiating table, thus earning the praise of the Secretary-General of the UN in April 2002.
I mention this in order to stress the importance of the role of women, which is often disregarded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during the night of 11 to 12 December, murderous new confrontations hit CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
These confrontations, between CÃŽte d'Ivoire soldiers and unidentified armed men, are again giving rise to fears that the peace process in CÃŽte d'Ivoire will be blocked.
These events are suddenly taking place at a time when the ex-rebellion forces had decided to announce their imminent return to the institutions of the government of national reconciliation.
Unfortunately, we observe how the proliferation of militias is a very dangerous consequence of the conflict.
Many witnessesâ accounts, collected by the Human Rights Watch organisation, report multiple abuses committed with total impunity by pro-government militias.
At a time when the country was preparing to take a decisive step towards peace, this new eruption of violence â and this in an extremely troubled context â is again preoccupying the defenders of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements.
These agreements, let us remember, were aimed at bringing the hostilities to an end, ensuring a return to peace and stability and preserving the territorial and ethnic integrity of CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
In the light of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements, the current priority is the need to pursue the process of disarmament and of rehabilitating the forces present in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
That is why the CÃŽte d'Ivoire Government and, above all, President Gbagbo, must ensure that peopleâs rights and freedoms are protected and bring the hostilities to an end without delay. Otherwise, we could be led to request the suspension of aid to CÃŽte d'Ivoire, aid that, as we are well aware, is indispensable to the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Indeed, we fear, Commissioner, that EU aid is unfortunately used in large part for purchasing arms.
Let us therefore be prudent, rather than naive or complicit in a further genocide.
Â Â  . â Mr President, let me start by reacting to the last contribution.
There is always the problem and risk of indirect consequences of supporting a government in a difficult situation like this.
But we are very cautiously doing the right thing by not turning our backs on the country, but instead finding areas where we can do something meaningful, also bearing in mind that there is a legitimate government in the country.
We have used the Cotonou system to organise dialogue and to establish benchmarks along the way leading back to normalisation, and we are linking and conditioning our support to the Marcoussis Agreement and the process there.
I have already addressed the specific aspect of fisheries.
Let me say a few words on the peace facility in response to Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Karamanou.
I very much welcomed the conclusions of the European Council last week relating to the peace facility.
It was clearly stated in these conclusions that the Council recognises the importance of this peace facility and it also makes the point quite clearly that the financing of these peace operations will create a noteworthy and important impulse in strengthening the capacity of the African people to create and preserve peace on the whole continent.
So there was no reference whatsoever to any ways of doing this other than what is implicitly referred to here as an all-African effort.
It is the case that we foresee, and the African Union and the Commission also expect that regional organisations should be used as implementing agents for handling individual cases.
However, it is clear from the whole architecture of the proposal that decision-making is supposed to be the responsibility of the African Union.
This is also the prevailing view in the discussions that are taking place inside the EU.
This is very important, because stability and African ownership of this process is the key to success.
We look forward to the next steps in the chain of implementation, to take place shortly.
I should like to say to Mrs Karamanou that the peace facility would not cover the cost of supporting women's organisations or other activities like that.
It is very important that this facility should only cover those actions relating directly to peacekeeping or peace-building activities which cannot be funded by other sources.
That is what is new in this and why we are moving into a new area of activity and a new method of funding and decision-making.
All this is new for good reasons, and we have to be very careful not to overlap with what can in fact be funded through other sources, otherwise the opportunity would be wasted.
My final remarks on the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and what we are trying to do: we are not in a situation where we have cut off or frozen spending.
We have not suspended the Cotonou working relationship, but we have to adapt to the situation.
We are gradually trying to move forward and link it to a process of reconciliation.
In fact, the country strategy paper and the national indicative programme, totalling EUR 298 million, were discussed by the EDF Committee on 20 November and we will try ensure that the implementation of this is linked to the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement.
We will include interventions such as promoting security of land tenure, and good governance will also be an important element, along with support for the 2005 presidential and parliamentary elections.
This is a very sad case, but we have to be stubbornly optimistic.
Â Â  To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the removal of the EU embargo on arms sales to China.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the embargo on the export of weapons to the People's Republic of China was adopted by the European Union in 1989 following the events in Tiananmen Square.
The embargo permitted only exports not associated with repressive activities or with activities violating Human Rights, to be examined on a case-by-case basis.
China believes that the embargo is now out of date and that the level of cooperation in all sectors between China and Europe, as well as the rapid changes underway in the People's Republic of China, are such as to justify it being lifted.
This fact is being more and more frequently and vehemently stressed on every possible occasion, both multilateral and bilateral, by our Chinese interlocutors, who have recently pinpointed the lifting of the embargo as a short- or medium-term priority in Chinaâs relations with the European Union.
From the point of view of the implications, were the embargo against China to be lifted, the European Code of Conduct would, in any case remain applicable, the result being that, in reality, weapons exportation would not vary substantially.
The matter of the possible lifting of the embargo has, in recent months, been discussed in the European Union but consensus has not been reached on whether this revision is appropriate.
The European Union acknowledges that, between 1989 and today, the political situation in China has evolved significantly and that important changes have taken place in the European Union's relations with China, including the quality of political dialogue.
Indeed, with the establishment of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights, an important vehicle has been created in which both sides can exchange opinions and develop projects aimed at fostering tangible improvements.
Furthermore, and the Chinese are placing particular emphasis on this, the Chinese Government underwent a complete change at the Party Congress held last year and today's leaders declare that they had nothing to do with the events of Tiananmen Square.
Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the European Union, whose public opinion still vividly recalls the events in Tiananmen Square, the issue is considered highly sensitive since serious problems relating to respect for human rights persist in China.
Indeed, economic liberalisation and the country's gradual integration into the international community are not being accompanied by similar political liberalisation and China still has a long way to go before reaching the human rights standards considered normal in our societies.
The Union's policy on the matter is under intense scrutiny and non-governmental organisations and public opinion expect tangible results.
Moreover, it should also be pointed out that Beijing has rejected the idea of making the lifting of the embargo dependent on tangible progress in human rights.
In any case, the necessary conditions for lifting the embargo are not yet in place in the European Union: this was clearly explained to our Chinese counterpart during the recent European Union-China Summit.
It is, moreover, clear that there are differing positions within the European Union on the subject and, in particular, on the stance to be taken in the face of repeated requests from the Chinese.
The matter will therefore have to be further discussed in depth in the future.
Decisive impetus has been supplied in this regard by the European Council of 12 December 2003, which called on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to review the question.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I fully share the presidency's views.
I would add some additional remarks even though it is obviously not an issue on which the Commission takes a lead, given the way in which the CFSP is operating.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China recently said during his meeting in Harvard in the US that China's reform and opening-up aims at promoting human rights.
The two are mutually dependent and reinforcing.
This is encouraging language showing that they present human rights in a context which is linked to their general orientation of where they want to go and they do it on their own initiative.
But we should not jump to conclusions and the reality on the ground is the real yardstick in measuring progress, also in an area like this.
We have seen some real change but also there is still good reason for keeping up a systematically organised dialogue with China on human rights.
We have been systematically doing this through the years.
The issue here of course is that a number of Member States are favourably disposed towards considering a lifting of the arms embargo and have also made that position public.
These Member States believe that there is no longer a technical need for the embargo as arms sales to China are already covered by the EUâs 1998 Code of Conduct, or that the issue should be considered in the overall context of our relations.
Other Member States believe that lifting the embargo is premature.
They underscore the need for further progress in human rights.
Last weekâs European Council referred the issue to the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under the Irish presidency.
The Commission fully supports an in-depth political discussion of this matter.
Developing a clear EU line on this question at the highest level is important.
Factually speaking, lifting the embargo would have few practical implications for European arms exports to China, since the 1998 EU Code of Conduct prohibits arms exports to countries which have not forgone using arms for internal repression or aggressively against another country.
It is in fact the Code of Conduct which applies in this issue.
That said, and given the high political and symbolic value of the whole matter, any consideration of this should include an updated political assessment of how far things have moved on the human rights front since 1989.
We are naturally interested in Parliament's views on that question so the Commission welcomes the discussion here today.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly rejects the latest attempts by the German Chancellor, Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, to lift the arms embargo on the Peopleâs Republic of China.
I am glad that the Council representative made it clear that the Council currently maintains the line that the arms embargo must be retained.
You described the situation, Commissioner, but I urge you to be cautious.
The 1989 European Council was right to impose the arms embargo after the peace demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were put down in such a bloody fashion.
Commissioner, we too believe that there have been improvements in the human rights situation in China since then, but they have not been sufficient.
Only recently, on 13 October, the Council reconsidered the situation in China and, just as Parliament had done in the same month, noted that the current human rights situation in China, as regards fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms did not meet even the international standards recognised by China.
That being so, although we want progress in China, we should wait before it is achieved, and so it would send completely the wrong message if the embargo were to be lifted at the present time.
On the contrary, we should be telling our Chinese friends that they need to make perceptible progress where human rights in China are concerned.
There is a second reason why we should do this.
You will be aware that presidential elections are to be held in Taiwan on 20 March next year, and the Peopleâs Republic of China has, over recent weeks, been adopting a positively hostile stance towards Taiwan.
As long ago as 23 October, this House stated its view that China should withdraw the rockets it had stationed in the coastal provinces opposite Taiwan and should commence peaceful dialogue across the Strait of Taiwan, which amounts to a flash point.
That is the second reason why lifting the arms embargo makes no sense whatever.
I therefore hope that we will not now send the wrong message, even if only by editing what we say, in the belief that we can lift the arms embargo because everything is laid down in the code of conduct.
On the contrary, I believe that the tensions and the human rights situation, which is still unsatisfactory, mean that we have to maintain it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my group opposes lifting the arms embargo, and thus we support the general line of not lifting the arms embargo on China now.
I should like to add a couple of things, however.
Everyone who has had the opportunity to visit China on several occasions over the past tenÂ years â as I myself have done â will know that a tremendous economic dynamic is discernible there, with substantial regional differences, and with what could almost be described as rigid capitalism at internal level, which gives rise to numerous major social problems.
A society developing in this way also needs a political system capable of handling this.
There is clearly an enormous tension between that economic freedom on the one hand, which leaves insufficient room for shaping at the social level by the social players such as the trade unions and others; and the political level on the other, which leaves no room for political democracy.
We are, of course, all watching that whole process with bated breath.
China is no small player.
It is large and powerful both in economic terms and in terms of population size.
When trying to look at that region from a geopolitical point of view, therefore, do not just look at it in relation to Taiwan.
Naturally, that is one point, but much broader factors affect that region.
China naturally wants to become a global player, little by little.
It is trying to launch a charm offensive: after all, it knows fine well that a great many people are intimidated by its enormous economic power, and it is trying, as it were, to be a positive player at global level.
In order to do so, it must effectively make more room for democracy and respect for human rights in its own country.
It is not yet managing to control that tension very well, and some do not even want to control it or are themselves engaging in something that we do not think possible, which is having freedom on the one hand and a lack of political freedom on the other.
Nevertheless, we, Europe, have an enormous amount to gain from helping China take on this new role.
Therefore, all fellow Members are rightly saying âno lifting of the arms embargoâ: that gives out the wrong signal.
At the same time, however, ladies and gentlemen, let us put it in a wider perspective and make clear that we genuinely desire that in-depth dialogue with China â that goes for the Council, too â and that we also want to help with that process.
It is fundamental that China assume a role in the world and that that role is compatible with the international legal order.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are countries in the world that do not take human rights very seriously, including China, the last great Communist dictatorship on the planet.
The lack of respect for human rights is, for me, the main reason why we should not here and now remove the European embargo on the sale of weapons to China.
Last weekend, the Council agreed that consideration should be given to whether the embargo should be removed.
We do not believe the time is ripe.
It is of course true that there has been progress in China since the massacre in Tianamen Square in 1989, and it is also a fact that the political dialogue between the EU and China has improved, but there is still cause for considerable concern about the Chinese lack of understanding of human rights and of the state governed by law.
We know that there are violations of fundamental freedoms, that torture and arbitrary imprisonments take place, that the Chinese authorities do not respect minorities and that many executions occur â more than in any other country in the world.
We also know that China has deployed rockets pointing over the straits towards democratic Taiwan and that there is now increased tension across the Straits of Taiwan.
Are we to close our eyes to the fact that a dictatorship â China â is threatening one of the foremost democracies in the Far East, namely Taiwan?
When it comes to human rights and democracy, Taiwan is exemplary, while China gives every cause for alarm.
Are we now to be involved in helping the Chinese to rearm?
That, we believe, would be a really bad idea.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from time to time, and only for a moment, Heads of State simply delude themselves, and I believe that one of their delusions is that they can simply say that they want the arms embargo on China removed.
The arms embargo is an instrument of political pressure, and what that means is that any response to the question as to what has changed in China must be political in nature.
China still has Tibet under military occupation; it is still threatening Taiwan; it is still failing to respect human rights.
There is no prospect of democracy there.
You can do business with China â so go on doing it!
Selling nuclear power stations to China makes no sense and is dangerous, but that is another issue, one that we will have to discuss with the German Federal Chancellor.
What I am getting at is that it would not only be wrong to express a desire to lift the arms embargo, but that it is also wrong to say at all that there is at present any question of doing so.
To do so would mean that we would simply be telling the Chinese, âYou are making a wonderful job of things.
Carry on arresting people for speaking their minds; it doesnât bother us a bit.
We are prepared to do any kind of business with you!â
There is, secondly, another point, namely President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der â two Heads of Government whom I do support in certain political situations, such as over the war in Iraq.
The terrible thought occurs to me: has a similar strategy been used to buy partnership with China?
It is inconceivable that we should think it possible to buy Putin by saying nothing about Chechnya, and the Chinese by supplying them with weapons, just in order to have a common position on the Security Council.
That would be terrible.
Let me say, in conclusion, that President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der have said that they want the constitution, that they want to be Europeans, that they want simply to strengthen the European Parliament.
But of course!
Only if Parliament agrees to it can the Council lift the arms embargo, and this is meant to be done by means of a jointly agreed code of conduct.
What this means is that the removal of the arms embargo is neither possible nor permissible without Parliamentâs consent, and I rejoice that, at present, none of the political groups want that done.
Terrific!
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, it would, indeed, be lovely and important to succeed in informing the millions of people who have taken to the streets of Europe to support Chancellor Schroeder and even Jacques Chirac as symbols of the Europe of peace, that precisely Chancellor Schroeder, one of these great symbols of European peace, is proposing today to lift the embargo on arms sales to China.
Those millions of people are not aware of this, and neither, I expect, are those who elected the Schroeder government.
It is a proposal which, indeed, should not even be on our agenda at all; I am glad to say that the decision does not have to be taken today, but it appears to be almost implied that it will have to be taken tomorrow or the day after.
Technical details and form aside, a decision such as this could only be taken by a Europe which has abandoned the promotion of democracy and the rule of law as points of reference in its international policyÂ âÂ and, therefore, in its security and defence policy â once and for all.
The promotion of democracy and the rule of law are not points of reference for this Europe, they are not points of reference, most importantly, for the Europe which sets itself up as the Europe of peace, the Europe of Chancellor Schroeder, the Europe of Jacques Chirac; it is the Europe of shame over China, Russia and Chechnya â this is the Europe that can debate this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, it is essential that the EU engages constructively with China as the most populated country on earth and â in terms of certain purchasing parity measures â as an economy that is due to overtake my country, the United Kingdom, and perhaps even Germany in the next two decades.
China is a vast country with a trained and productive workforce, but it is not a democracy and remains essentially an authoritarian, one-party, Communist State â although Marxism plays little part in its political or economic thinking at present.
However, I welcome China's cooperation in the fight against international terrorism and its rapprochement with India, whose territory it still occupies, having traditionally been an ally of Pakistan, whose atom bomb it helped to build.
China is also helping to put pressure on North Korea against that country's quest to build its own nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, I am critical of China's inhumane treatment of North Korean refugees, who are sent back to face torture or even execution.
Red China, however, remains a serious threat to Taiwan, which has been a model of democracy, prosperity and good governance.
There is an irrational fear on the part of China of Taiwan wishing to pursue a course of self-determination and independence, perhaps because the model of pluralism and democracy is what is most unwelcome to the Communist Party bosses.
However, given China's attitude towards Taiwan, Tibet and its own dissenters â ranging from the peaceful practitioners of Falun Gong to the pro-democracy activists who were imprisoned so brutally after Tiananmen Square â I support maintaining the EU arms embargo.
After all, the Taiwan Straits remain one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints and the USA is obliged to intervene to protect Taiwan militarily in the event of hostilities.
Therefore, we do not want to do anything to further escalate the tensions in this region.
Â Â  â Mr President, a debate on the removal of the arms embargo on China has a natural tendency to produce crudely-drawn arguments and discussions, and, as I believe that certain Members are over-simplifying matters, I will try to introduce a few nuances into the debate.
Right at the very start, I would like to say that I regard the removal of the arms embargo as neither advisable nor wise.
There is no doubt in my mind that I am opposed to it.
China, though, must be considered in a rather more subtle light than it has been from the standpoints we have adopted so far, and in this I am, for once, closer to Mr Tannock than to other Members who have spoken today.
China is a large and â let us be frank about this â capitalist economic system with a single-party state clamped over it.
It is trying to enable its people to have a share in the worldâs growing prosperity, and the greatest danger lies in whether China will manage to maintain the political structure of a common state and to meet peopleâs social needs.
The fact is that Chinaâs biggest problem has to do not with arms but with increasing hunger and poverty in sections of its population.
It certainly also has the major problem that it has in one country different cultures, languages and ethnic groups, and it has not so far succeeded â I might add that it is not alone in this â in giving these diverse cultures and ethnic groups the space that will alone make it possible to maintain the countryâs political unity.
So, although China does not need our weapons, it does need our sympathy and support in what is a difficult process of development.
I would not wish major responsibility in a problematic large state like China on anyone in this House.
That is, I think, another reason why the resolution rather misses the mark by considering the Taiwan issue in what are admittedly the right terms â of China becoming a threat â but to the exclusion of all others.
In one respect alone I am closer to President Bush than to Mr Cohn-Bendit, and that is in the belief that he is right to warn Taiwan, too, against taking ill-advised action.
I am not talking about whether or not such actions might be justified, morally or otherwise.
At times when crises are brewing, there are courses of action that may perhaps be justified from an objective and abstract point of view, but can nonetheless play a part in making hostilities or a crisis situation more likely.
It is not for this House to warn only one side against taking unilateral and perilous courses of action; rather, it should also urge the other side to be sensible and hold back, to endeavour to leave the way open to peaceful agreement.
That, I believe, is the one important message that is, lamentably, absent from this resolution.
Hence my conclusion that the answer to the removal of the arms embargo is ânoâ.
China needs all the help and support we can give, but not where armaments are concerned.
We should be urging both parties in this hotspot, China and Taiwan, to be cautious in the action they take, and reminding them that we live in times in which peaceful, rather than warlike solutions must be found.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the EU must be a peace organisation and not an arms dealer.
The EU should therefore not sell weapons at all, especially not to countries that are in danger of using them in wars.
Given that logic, we should not, in the first place, sell weapons to the United States, but not to China either.
My ânoâ to arms exports to China is not only directed against China, but is the expression of a general principle.
Everything that has been said in this House about China is true, but there are also positive things.
For example, a dialogue has been opened with representatives of the Dalai Lama, about which the Dalai Lama himself is very hopeful.
Such a small step is obviously not enough to change the general picture.
It would therefore be quite wrong to remove the arms embargo against China, but do not forget that there are also other countries to which we should not sell weapons.
Â Â  â Mr President, let me start by saying that my criticisms, coming as they do from a member of the German opposition, cannot be more trenchant than those uttered in this House ten minutes ago by a Member belonging to the same party as the German foreign minister, who stated that, on this issue at least, the German Federal Chancellor was suffering from delusions.
We are dealing here, unfortunately, with another Franco-German initiative, but not one that is intended to restore these two countries to their position as the engine of Europe in a positive sense; instead, where this issue â like others in the recent past â is concerned, it leads other Member States to suspect something that is more and more a Franco-German conspiracy rather than a Franco-German partnership.
The manner in which Germany and France collaborate on this issue or on the Stability Pact is not, in fact, one that I regard as desirable, and it is unfortunate that, in recent times, we increasingly see these two countries acting in what is a very egotistical fashion, even though they are actually meant to be taking seriously their responsibilities to Europe as a whole.
It has already been said â and this is where I agree with Mr Swoboda â that we have to take a very nuanced view of China.
I was back there again only recently, and when, on the one hand, you see the economic developments, which are very dynamic, and, on the other, the willingness â behind the closed doors of conferences at any rate, but also more openly â to discuss every issue with great frankness, then it becomes apparent that people in China are thinking.
The situation there is not set in stone; instead, particularly in the political sphere, the leadership is already endeavouring to give some thought to how, on the one hand, to maintain the countryâs stability â and that is a legitimate objective â and also, on the other, to how the dynamism that is present in the economic sphere can also find a political expression, for it is in politics that little progress has as yet been made.
Nor is the time yet ripe for anything to be removed, as what caused the arms embargo to be imposed has not yet gone away.
We have not forgotten Tiananmen Square, nor has there been any change in the political framework conditions that led to it.
It has also been said, on the other hand, that Taiwan is under threat â a country that is actually, from the point of view of the One China policy, itself Chinese territory.
How can one threaten oneâs own territory with rockets like these?
That is something to which China ought perhaps to give some thought.
In any case, it is not Taiwan that represents a threat to China; rather, the reverse is the case.
Both these considerations â human rights and the threat to Taiwan â should cause the Council to pause for a moment before even considering removing the arms embargo.
To do so would send completely the wrong message.
Â Â  â Mr President, if they are not to be in breach of the principles of our European community of values, those who seek to remove the arms embargo on China must first have clear evidence of a change in the human rights situation.
Chancellor SchrÃ¶der wanted to curry favour with the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
In the hope of improving the climate for exports, he rashly added his voice to those calling for an end to the embargo, thereby pressing amateurishly ahead without consulting with other states.
On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr Cohn-Bendit.
He is not so much Confucius as confused!
Back in 1989, the embargo was a response to the savagery with which the democracy movement was put down; today, it is among the most important instruments bringing political pressure to bear in favour of change in the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Those who think in merely economic terms are blind in one eye.
I can tell Mr Swoboda that Amnesty International is talking in terms of 1Â 500 executions carried out every year, with hundreds of thousands of people in jail, maltreated, tortured, and waiting in vain for a fair trial.
Conditions for the Tibetans, Mongols and other minorities remain intolerable and our keeping quiet about them will do nothing to improve matters.
Since 1999, I have been chairman of the European Parliamentâs Tibet Intergroup.
All those who have addressed us, and all those of our guests who know China well, leave us in no doubt that, where human rights are concerned, there has been hardly any progress.
I am also thinking of Taiwan.
For weeks, Peking has been threatening a military attack in the event of Taiwan deciding to hold a referendum on formal independence.
I welcome the initiative taken by the Commission in scrutinising the planned sale of a German nuclear power station to China.
The export of usable goods is subject to the European Unionâs approval; I am glad to see Mr Cohn-Bendit agreeing with me on this.
Two things are necessary: one is that the Member States should maintain their restrictions on arms sales, and the other is that we should get to grips with the actual facts about the Peopleâs Republic of China â at national level, at Community level and, it is to be hoped, eventually in early 2004, at the international level at the Human Rights Convention in Geneva.
Â Â  Mr President, I have not heard such unanimity across the Chamber on an issue in quite some time.
It seems that it is the French and German Governments that are the main supporters of lifting the arms embargo on China, as well as the controls on exports of dual-use nuclear technology.
Given their track record over the past year, there are grounds for suspicion of any foreign policy initiatives that originate from these governments.
I find it very worrying that in certain areas France and Germany seem to prefer the idea of a strategic partnership with countries such as China, rather than the United States.
I am thinking of proposals relating to the Galileo project which have military implications.
Why is it that the European Council has decided at this time that there is any reason to re-examine the EU's arms embargo against China?
What particular positive developments in China have prompted this action?
Of course we all want to see improved relations with China, but not at the expense of our own security.
China still has a long way to go in introducing democracy and respect for human rights and convincing us that it wishes to be a peaceable partner in the international community.
It is premature to consider any wholesale lifting of the arms embargo.
Â Â  To conclude the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order before the voting starts, I had occasion to speak on this very point last time.
The Vice-President at the time, Mr David Martin, undertook to inquire and refer the matter to you, but since you are now in the chair I shall ask you directly.
It is becoming increasingly the case that although a time is set for the vote, it is delayed day after day.
It seems unreasonable and incompetent to expect people to be here on time and then not to operate.
Although today it is only seven minutes over, we had no previous business to delay us!
Even if we have previous business, surely voting, which is so important in this House, should always take place punctually, with absolutely no leeway whatsoever.
Everything else should be subjugated to it.
I would ask you to look at this matter urgently.
Â Â  I hope that you appreciate that I too was here on time, ready to start.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(1)
Colleagues, I should like, on your behalf, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, and Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in helping us reach this moment.
The House has voted wisely and well.
It is now our duty to honour what we vote on â that and only that.
Together with the Council we shall take this issue forward.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 18 November this Parliament rejected by a very large majority the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel.
Pursuant to Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure, and after the Commission's refusal to withdraw its proposal, I am reporting back to you to say that on 2 December the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considered the matter again and reconfirmed its previous decision to reject the proposal.
Representing the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who is unable to be here today, I reiterate our belief that this harmonisation effort is not justified either from an environmental or from a competition point of view.
We call upon the Commission to submit a new proposal and withdraw the current one in order to have a text more in sympathy with the recently adopted energy tax directive.
An approach that eschews absolute harmonisation, for example with a rate band with an upper and lower limit, would be a more realistic option both in terms of chances of progress in the Council, and also in terms of allowing a degree of tax competition between Member States.
There is also a need to coordinate taxation of fuels with infrastructure charges in order to guarantee a level playing field.
For all these reasons, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs calls upon the plenary of the European Parliament to reconfirm its rejection of the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel.
Â Â  The Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thus proposes that Parliament adopt the legislative resolution to reject the proposal for a directive.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, in recent days, I have made one last attempt to achieve compromises, and I have offered a package deal to this end.
Unfortunately, that was not successful, despite every effort on the part of the shadow rapporteurs, and for this I should like to thank them nevertheless.
At all events, we can say that, whatever happens, today is a real âE-dayâ, an âenvironment dayâ, because now, for the first time in the history of the European Union, we are adopting legislation that gives us a legal basis for making polluters pay for the damage they cause.
I think that that is one point we have scored.
Â Â  . â In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a brief statement for the benefit of Members.
Today, we are voting on the compromise package on medicinal products legislation, a compromise influenced by a lot of different ideas from this House.
I therefore ask Members to support Blocks 1, 2 and 3, but not under any circumstances Block 4 or parts thereof.
If even only one amendment from Block 4 is adopted, we will have to go to conciliation, and it will not be possible to adopt the Common Position today; hence my appeal to you.
The package we have put together with the Council is a good one, so please support the compromise.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you for having given me the floor now because, in actual fact, the three reports on which we are to vote constitute a package.
With my fellow MEP, MrsÂ MÃŒller, we have managed to obtain very sound compromises, thanks to which we are making very significant progress where pharmaceutical legislation is concerned.
I should like to join MrsÂ MÃŒller in saying that it is vital for us to vote in favour of the compromises as presented and not to vote in favour of the amendments that were not the subjects of these compromises.
Any vote in favour of an amendment that is not a part of these compromises would bring into question the compromises at which we have arrived in conjunction with the Italian Presidency.
I should really like to make it clear to our fellow MEPs that they should vote in favour of the compromises and not in favour of the other amendments that do not form a part of these.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to reiterate that the Commission fully supports the compromise package presented by the two rapporteurs, Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte, and accepted by the Groups.
But following the debate last night, at the request of honourable Members, I would like to reiterate and clarify the Commission position on the amendments concerning homeopathic medicines.
The Commission agrees with the compromise package in this field too.
This means that we cannot accept amendments which introduce either non-defined technical concepts which aim at extending the registration procedure beyond requirements defining this simplified procedure, or which are contrary to the harmonisation sought.
Regarding Compromise Amendment No 20, which the Commission accepts, I would like to point out the following.
Originally the amendment tabled asked Member States to take due account of registrations delivered by others.
It became evident that the common position had already foreseen in Article 39 the fact that the Community regulation procedure has to be applied to these kinds of products, so the common position has already gone beyond the objective.
Compromise Amendment No 20 clarifies the legal situation establishing that the Community regulation procedure will apply to registered homeopathic medicines and that it should be accepted.
This compromise package would essentially improve the common position accepted by the Council.
That is the reason the Commission supports the proposals by Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to report to the House that, following the debate last night and discussions with the presidency, in the spirit of compromise reflecting our work on this portfolio, I am mandated by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to withdraw Amendments Nos 3 and 11.
On that basis, I understand that the Commission is in full support of all the amendments and the presidency has indicated its support.
Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for the rest.
Block No 1 will effectively subsume three other amendments.
(2)
(3)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again we have been giving our attention to the Membersâ Statute, at a time when Europe has been unable to resolve the issue of the constitution, at a time when, only a few weeks ago, the European Unionâs Stability Pact proved a failure, at a time when, facing economic problems in the European Union, we are trying to banish unemployment from Europe.
At a time like this, Parliament has once again deemed it proper to devote attention to itself.
The Membersâ Statute was back on this Houseâs agenda, and â quite apart from the question of whether we need rules that apply from Finland to Sicily â I think it a poor show for us to again attempt to resolve the issue before the Central and Eastern European States have joined the European Union, and before new Members of this House have been able to share in reaching a decision.
That is what I criticise, and for that reason I have voted ânoâ to the statute question in its present form.
Â Â  Mr President, I supported the Members' Statute because we need urgent reform of our travel expenses system in time for the new Parliament next July.
Now that we have this resolution, we can open negotiations with the Council on the Members' Statute.
I hope that when we look at the salary level we will look again at the report of independent experts, which gave an excellent way forward for looking at the salary issue.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group asked me to give an explanation on its behalf.
Simply and briefly it is a point which concerns paragraph 2(b).
As I said in the debate in the morning, we are very strongly in favour of reform of the Protocol concerning Privileges and Immunities.
The existing rules relating to privileges and immunities are unsatisfactory.
However, as we said in the debate leading up to the decision on 3 and 4 June, the text that was approved then is unduly extensive in the privileges and immunities it prescribes.
So we voted against paragraph 2(b), not because we oppose reform but because it is too generous a model for reform.
Â Â  â The reasons why I voted against the Statute are as follows.
Let me say straightaway that I think it important and right that our travel costs should be the real ones, but everyone here in this House knows that that has nothing, nothing whatever, to do with the Statute.
We could change the link between travelling expenses and real costs tomorrow; it has nothing, nothing whatever, to do with the Statute.
I do welcome, though, the prospect of our soon having rules on this.
As regards the Statute, I concede that what was decided on in the summer has been improved on, particularly as regards the pensionable age.
I still, however, cannot agree to it, as it highlights a social imbalance at a time when, right across Europe, really deep cuts are being made in social security budgets, and it is just not on for us, in this House, to again insist on a sort of Christmas present, so that German MEPs, for example, get 20% increases.
I regard that as unacceptable.
Nor do I think it right that we should base our calculations on the income of a judge, who, let me remind you, is permitted no other employment.
I would have thought it more proper if we had taken the average income of all MEPs as a basis, which I would have thought would be the more appropriate approach, and I still do not think it right that MEPs should be allowed to have other sources of income while judges are not.
I still do not think it right that we do not wait for the general standard of living to improve before doing something about that of MEPs.
Underlying my rejection of the Statute is my belief that increases of this kind result in a social imbalance; I would be getting much more in terms of salary-related payments than my counterparts in the , and that too I regard as an injustice.
I see this as Parliament giving itself a Christmas present rather than bringing itself into line with what is being talked about by the public.
Perhaps I may be permitted a final point, which is that I hope that further improvements will be possible in order yet to change the imbalance that has resulted from the Statute, especially its social dimension.
Â Â  I do not know what has gone wrong in the Verts/ALE Group, but the Rules of Procedure state very clearly that you are supposed to give notice of explanations of vote.
However, Mrs McKenna, I will take your explanation of vote.
Â Â  Mr President, there are big problems with the Members' Statute.
In the end I decided to support it, but I have major problems because the expenses issue is not separated from the salaries issue.
A lot of people in my own country will be very put out that technically a lot of Members voted to increase their salaries by a huge amount.
This will not go down well in the individual Member States.
Â Â  .â The European Parliament's retraction on the proposals for the Members' Statute blew out the possibility of a solution to the problem during the Italian Presidency.
Today's resolution endeavours to restore once again the possibility of resolving the problem, which is why I voted in favour of it.
The European Parliament is exposed to public opinion; it cannot act as public prosecutor to the other Community institutions when its own house is not in order.
With the system of travel expenses in particular, every effort must be made to improve this before the European elections.
Â Â  We would emphasise the importance of our finally getting closer to obtaining a Membersâ Statute that would mean the end of the system of covert compensation that has so far existed in Parliament.
We welcome a system through which actual travel expenses are reimbursed.
A system involving one salary â even if this is higher than many MEPsâ present salaries â is better because it is an open system which can be scrutinised and assessed by the electorate.
Despite this basic approach, we now wish to make it clear that we consider the salary level recommended by Parliamentâs report from June 2003 to be too high and that we shall continue to press our government to argue in the Council for a more sensible salary level.
Â Â  For the reasons of principle mentioned in my speech in the course of the debate, I voted against our Assemblyâs resolution which calls once again for a unified Membersâ Statute.
I should like to add that, the more progress that is made in negotiating this Statute, the greater the number of difficulties that appear, the greater the number of complexities that are invented to resolve these difficulties and the more the system proposed becomes untenable.
In particular, it is hard to imagine how, in the name of a principle â which does not exist â of equality between MEPs, profound and very real inequalities could be created in each country.
How, for example, could the MEP of a new Member State be paid a salary twenty times that of a member of his or her national parliament?
How, moreover, is such an inequality to be corrected?
Similar questions arise in connection with taxation: what is the rationale behind a rather well-paid Member of the European Parliament paying income tax at a rate far below that applied to his or her fellow citizens?
As I emphasised in the debate, the dogmatic obstinacy of certain federalist MEPs is in the process of creating a mess that will be very harmful, once again, to the image of the European Union.
Â Â  The June Movement has today chosen to vote neither in favour of, nor against, joint motion for a resolution no. RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Membersâ Statute.
The June Movement abstained from voting because Amendment No 1, which would have meant fully regulating the way in which travel expenses are reimbursed and have entailed far greater transparency, was voted down.
The present system, involving non-transparent and tax-free reimbursement of travel expenses, together with reimbursement of general expenses, is unacceptable.
The present draft Membersâ Statute does not, however, solve the problems satisfactorily.
It is not acceptable
- for Danish MEPsâ remuneration to be increased by more than 50%;
- for there still to be issued, alongside the reimbursement of actual travel expenses, a tax-free payment based on distance travelled and time spent on the journey;
- and for the reimbursement of general expenses (at present approximately DKKÂ 26Â 000 per month) still to be paid out tax-free without having to be accounted for.
Because of the very different national schemes for MEPs and the majorityâs unwillingness to draw a line under tax-free schemes, it would be most appropriate to leave it to each individual Member State or to the relevant parties/movements in each individual Member State to draw up proper rules for their Members of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Although the compromise that the European Parliament is proposing to the Council introduces some amendments to its proposal of 3 and 4Â June (on tax issues and on privileges and immunities, for example), it retains aspects with which we disagree, such as fixing a monthly parliamentary salary that is the same for all Members, regardless of the country they represent.
Whether or not to establish a statute for Members of the European Parliament is not the issue.
The issue is its content. As we have stated, the Members of this House are elected to represent national constituencies.
Consequently, they are, and must continue to be, bound to these constituencies.
This means that the salary of a Member of the EP must be based on the salary paid to the Members of the national parliaments of the country in which they were elected.
By the same token, we cannot ignore the existence of very different social realities in the countries of the EU.
Providing a parliamentary salary that is the same for all EP Members will create situations of profound inequality and disparity in various countries, such as Portugal, between the salaries earned by workers and those earned by political representatives and holders of public office.
This would be totally incomprehensible.
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  We have today voted neither in favour of, nor against, joint motion for a resolution no. RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Membersâ Statute.
The present system, involving non-transparent and tax-free reimbursement of travel expenses, together with reimbursement of general expenses, is unacceptable.
The present draft Membersâ Statute does not, however, solve the problems satisfactorily.
It is not acceptable
- for Danish and Swedish MEPsâ remuneration to be increased by more than 50%;
- for there still to be issued, alongside the reimbursement of actual travel expenses, a tax-free payment based on distance travelled and time spent on the journey;
- and for the reimbursement of general expenses (at present approximately DKKÂ 26Â 000 per month) still to be paid out tax-free without having to be accounted for.
Because of the very different national schemes for MEPs and the majorityâs unwillingness to draw a line under tax-free schemes, it would be most appropriate to leave it to each individual Member State or to the relevant parties/movements in each individual Member State to draw up proper rules for their Members of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . It was almost twenty-five years ago now that the Members of the European Parliament were, for the first time, directly elected by the people.
That was a milestone.
To this day, though, there is no Act on Membersâ Legal Status to regulate on one single basis the rights and duties of MEPs, and that is a disgrace, but not, admittedly, one of which this House should be ashamed.
If anyone should be ashamed, it is the Council.
I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994.
Since then, I have had, time and again, the experience of seeing how the Council, when it came to the issue of a Membersâ Statute, allowed us to run round in circles.
The second attempt at one that I have experienced was this summer, and when we had at last adopted a Statute full of concessions and willingness to compromise, I thought that we were out of the woods.
All that was needed was the Councilâs approval, but the Council adopts its customary stance of nose in the air and absolute immobility.
Shame on them!
I have voted against the resolution, because I cannot see why we should now throw away the Statute we have adopted and present the Council not with a law on the legal position of MEPs, but with mere pay scales, of which we cannot be other than ashamed and for which the public will laugh us to scorn.
Â Â  . I am convinced that the Membersâ Statute, demanded so vehemently by this House, is yet another indication of the failure of the Italian Presidency of the Council.
The chosen solution to the issue of the taxation of MEPsâ salaries is botched and temporary, but, above all, there are no rules on the legal status of MEPs.
Under no circumstances can I vote in its favour while the issue of immunity remains unresolved, nor can I accept the curtailment of rights that guarantee the exercise of an independent mandate, such as are accorded to our counterparts in the national and regional parliaments.
I therefore no longer have any confidence in the Councilâs will, at the present time, to bring about a single statute for MEPs, and, for that reason, I vote against the resolution RC B5-543-/2003.
Â Â  . I voted against the resolution, believing as I do that this is the worst conceivable time for us to resume a debate on the Members' Statute.
At present, the European Union has essential and fundamental tasks to deal with.
In the immediate aftermath of a failed summit, and facing all the problems of European integration, we in this House must limit ourselves to what is essential and necessary.
The importance of a common statute means that a solution must be sought together with the Council and without pressure of time.
Â Â  It is incredibly important quickly to bring about open, clear and unambiguous common rules.
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution, but not for those proposals that demand a reduced pensionable age.
We also believe that salaries should be more in line with those of members of the Swedish Parliament and that salaries should be taxed on a national basis.
Â Â  . â The introduction of astatute for the Membersof the European Parliament has been advocated for years now as a miracle cure for self-enrichment of MEPs.
Instead of enabling Members to increase their income substantially by means of excessive benefits that are not recorded by the national tax administrations, it would make a clear-cut distinction between income and the expenses actually incurred.
At the same time, it would bring to an end the equality of pay between MEPs and the members of national parliaments in their country.
I actually agree with that equality of pay, although it does lead to extreme differences in income among MEPs in practice and is therefore seen as encouraging fraud.
The lowest-paid make up for their deficiency, and the highest-paid willingly cash in too.
Consequently, I have always supported the endeavours to bring about such a statute.
However, earlier votes revealed that no majority support for this could be obtained without tax cuts and enormous salary increases for MEPs from a large number of Member States, including my own country, the Netherlands.
The current proposal is based on the resolution of 3Â JuneÂ 2003, which I voted against for that reason.
It does make some concessions to the Councilâs objections, especially on national taxation, but these do not improve the proposal sufficiently to enable a âyesâ vote at present.
Â Â  .The EPLP has voted today for the removal of barriers preventing a Members' Statute.
It has also voted today for negotiations to commence on the appropriate level of remuneration for MEPs with Council.
The basis for this should be the study carried out by the Wise Persons Group.
Another aspect which we support is national taxation.
All along we have supported the concept that MEPs should be treated no differently in the area of taxation from other residents in their Member States.
Importantly we are also finishing today the reform of the whole issue of expenses.
For too long the expenses issue has dogged the Parliament, and we now have the opportunity to put this to rest.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the proposal because if we want a change to the present system this is it, or there will not be one.
I voted for this proposal on the assumption that the travel expenses system will be reformed in such a way that travel expenses will be paid on the basis of actual costs incurred.
Â Â  Today, the European Parliament agreed upon a resolution that may bring to an end this yearâs debate concerning MEPsâ salary, pension and travel conditions.
With this agreement, the European Parliament has gone so far towards accommodating the Council that there is now finally the prospect of a Membersâ Statute.
I am very pleased about this outcome which means, for example, that MEPs will be obliged to account for their travel expenses.
Parliamentâs compliance is based on an agreement that all Members of the European Parliament should receive the same wages.
The amount is a weighted average of the remuneration received by MEPs in the four largest countries.
It corresponds to EURÂ 8Â 600, from which MEPs themselves will have to contribute to their pensions.
In addition, it will be possible for the Member States to opt for their MEPsâ paying tax to the Member State.
Finally, the pensionable age for Members of the European Parliament is to be raised from 60 to 63 years.
This is a sensible compromise for which everyone has had to go right to the pain barrier.
I think that the salary has been set too high, but this was the price of our having been able to bring about a compromise at all.
Â Â  . We supported rejecting the Commission proposal which, in the name of combating distortions of competition in the internal market and in environmental protection and, on the basis of the âpolluter-paysâ principle, seeks to achieve the gradual upwards harmonisation of excise duties on fuel for commercial purposes, and to separate the systems of duties on such fuel from those on fuel for private purposes.
This proposal for a directive, which had already been rejected by the European Parliament, forms part of the strategy put forward in the White Paper âEuropean Transport Policy for 2010: time to decideâ, whose stated intention is to seek to redistribute the tax burden between âusersâ and âtaxpayersâ and to pass on the ârealâ costs of transport to âusersâ.
The Commission proposed âintroducing a graduated tax on transport infrastructure use and making the tax system more consistentâ and creating within ten years, a European-level tax system that includes registration and road taxes, an âintelligentâ system for levying duties on infrastructures and harmonizing fuel taxation.
It also set minimum rates of special duty on unleaded fuel and a central rate for fuel for commercial purposes.
Given our disagreement, however, with the majority of these proposals, we supported the positions put forward to reject the Commission proposal, which is what has happened once again.
Â Â  Legislating on environmental liability is like opening a Pandoraâs box, so badly is environmental damage defined and so imprecise is the scope of the legislation, particularly on the issue of biodiversity, which is already governed by two major international conventions, those of Berne and of Bonn.
Compensation should be limited solely to the Natura 2000 areas and exclude non-profit-making activities, such as leisure pastimes, from professional activities.
The directive does not, however, draw a distinction between these two types of activity.
If liability is to be applied, it must be based upon objective and quantifiable criteria: the nature of the damage and its impact, the state of the environment at the time of the damage and, above all, local circumstances.
The permit to pollute and the notion of the âstate of scientific and technical knowledgeâ must be maintained if the âpolluter paysâ principle is to be effectively applied and not replaced by the âtaxpayer paysâ principle.
Liability must also exist in relation to GMOs and hydrocarbons, sensitive subjects that are excluded from the area of competence.
More generally, what is the point of recognising the European Commissionâs competence in this area when penalising environmental crime depends upon judicial cooperation and when other legal instruments such as the Council of Europeâs Lugano Convention could be used?
Â Â  . We are in the process of drafting the proposal for a directive, presented in January 2002, on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, which is particularly important for ensuring better environmental protection and for combating all types of pollution, setting out new principles and proposing new obligations, specifically for companies.
This is proving to be a far from straightforward process, however, particularly in the European Parliament, where the pressure exerted by the various economic interests has made itself felt, and this is why it was the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and not the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that negotiated this directive.
The Council common position rejected some of the European Parliamentâs proposals, only some of which have now been accepted at second reading.
The results of the vote reveal some contradictions and weaknesses in Parliamentâs final position, which rejected most of my groupâs proposals, although most of the negative proposals from the Commission were also rejected.
We will see what the final outcome is, but everything suggests that it will fall short of what is needed.
Â Â  . â The âpolluter paysâ principle is currently widely accepted.
Does that imply, however, that those with a great deal of money are allowed to cause a great deal of pollution?
Furthermore, what happens if the culprit is unable to pay, or if the perpetrator is not found, or if everything is carried out according to the rules on authorisation?
For such time as the economy continues to be considered more important than the environment, mitigating circumstances and exceptions will always be sought.
More must be done to render disasters involving oil tankers at sea and involving nuclear power stations practically impossible, but if such disasters occur nevertheless, the damage is vast.
In the current situation, compulsory insurance for all economic activities is the most important weapon for preventing such disasters.
The insurance companies, which do not like paying out large sums, will force the companies insured with them to become safer.
It emerged from the preliminary debate that it is not just a case of an undisputed technical regime.
Disasters involving oil and those involving nuclear power are exempted owing to insufficient international regimes.
The right wing is saying that compulsory insurance is not customary practice, will become prohibitively expensive, and gives rise to excessive bureaucracy.
The alternative would be that no one would pay for cleaning up and restoration in the event of environmental disasters, or that this would be paid for out of taxes.
I support all attempts to tighten up this Directive.
Â Â  . I welcome the work that has been undertaken in an area that is of increasing concern to European citizens; namely, environmental protection and the liability of economic operators for damage done to the environment.
I therefore believe that making operators adopt the necessary measures to prevent imminent threats of environmental damage and to establish compensation mechanisms for damage caused is justified, necessary and useful.
Furthermore, I agree with the distinction that is made between some high-risk commercial activities on the one hand, for which all environmental damage is covered and to which objective liability applies and, on the other, commercial activities other than those referred to, in which only damage caused to protected species and natural habitats will be covered in the event of proven intent or negligence on the part of the operator.
The balanced and realistic solutions that we are able to provide in this field will help to attain the objective of preventing and remedying environmental damage and protect the economic and competitive interests of the companies in question, and also constitute the right way of attaining the objectives declared by the Community to achieve sustainable growth and development.
Â Â  The European Parliament has today voted on a proposal for a directive aimed at standardising the rules that apply to environmental liability in the EU.
The overarching principle must be that âthe polluter paysâ.
The idea is that companies and other actors throughout the EU must be subject to the same legislation when it comes to their obligations to prevent, attend to and pay for the environmental damage for which they are responsible.
I have chosen to follow a more environmentally friendly line than the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and have therefore voted, for example, for stricter requirements regarding nuclear pollution (Amendment No 42) and the issue of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs (Amendments Nos 43 and 44).
In spite of Amendments Nos 42 and 44 having won a majority of votes, the required 314 votes were not achieved and the amendments were thus rejected.
Â Â  .On amendments which were submitted by the Green Party, I would like to make the following explanation for my vote against.
Where amendments proposed incorporating GMO and nuclear issues inside the scope of the directive, I voted against. This is because nuclear liability covered by the Vienna and Paris Conventions is currently being reviewed.
Any attempt here would be presumptuous as to that review's outcome.
On GMOs it is clear that liability still has to be worked out, as legislation dealing with GMOs has only just come on to the statute books.
Let us see how that works first. All else undermines conventions or existing law.
Â Â  .â The recommendation on a code for medicinal products is extremely important in an area to which European citizens are highly sensitive but which is ruled by the profiteering interests of the large companies.
On this basis, I voted in favour of all the amendments which aim to:
- supervise the market independently of the pharmaceutical industry;
- protect the public from medicinal products which have expired;
- reduce the period of commercial secrecy demanded by the large pharmaceutical companies, the result of which is to prevent cheaper drugs from being marketed;
- limit advertising of medicinal products;
- set up databases independently of the pharmaceutical companies.
Â Â  The GrossetÃªte report on the introduction of a Community code relating to medicinal products for human use is basically intended to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry.
It is disgusting that it is the big pharmaceutical trustsâ hunger for profit that has the last word in an area in which priority should be given to public health, because protection of the monopoly on patents, which ensures this industryâs profits while sending the prices of medicines soaring, has the drastic effect of denying hundreds of thousands of human beings access to those medicines.
Although we have supported the amendments in favour of better labelling or informing the public about the effects of medicines, we have, on the other hand, voted against the amendments protecting the monopoly of pharmaceutical laboratories.
In our view, public health and the interests of patients are much more important than freedom of trade and shareholdersâ profits.
Â Â  . The agreement that has just been reached in Parliament was based on a misguided Commission proposal, which viewed the matter in exclusively commercial terms and which sought to review the process of legislating on medicines, with the basic aim of increasing the short-tern competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry.
This position was immediately contested by various social, consumer, family and mutual organisations from various countries, all fighting for a responsible policy that will serve public health and consumer protection.
Consequently, at first reading, Parliament was able to make substantial changes to the Commission proposals, which the Council only accepted in part.
At second reading, some of the original proposals were accepted and whilst the compromise that has been voted on today in the European Parliament does not accept all the proposals that we put forward, it significantly improves the Council position, specifically as regards defining generic medicines, as regards the request for a distinction to be made between advertising and information and as regards the invitation to the Commission to undertake a study of current practices in the field of information, with the aim of improving quality.
Â Â  . â The compromise is a step forward for the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, the knowledge-based economy and the availability of medicinal products in the EU.
Dossier protection for pharmaceutical products in the EU varies from six to ten years. The result is that the supply and price of medicinal products varies considerably among the Member States.
The â8Â +Â 2Â +Â 1â compromise involves eight yearsâ dossier protection, plus two years for generic medicinal products, to put the dossier in order, followed by market access, and then one yearâs extra protection for the innovative industry if a medicinal product also has a therapeutic effect for other illnesses; and results in greater price competition, an improved supply of medicinal products and a boost to the knowledge-based economy.
The Council has failed by omitting to include homeopathic medicinal products in the compromise package.
As a result, these medicinal products remain a legal grey area, and homeopathic medicinal products will continue to circulate illegally on the market.
I therefore call on the European Commission to present a proposal as quickly as possible regulating the registration of homeopathic medicinal products at European level; only then will the European market in medicinal products be complete.
Homeopathic medicinal products represent an important alternative for many people. I, too, rank among those who have a great deal of confidence in the therapeutic effects of these medicinal products.
Â Â  . The highest degree of public health protection in the Union is a concept enshrined in the current ArticleÂ 152 of the EC Treaty.
I welcome the efforts made by all institutional and private operators to improve the content of the Community code relating to medicinal products forÂ human use.
The amendments mainly concern the definition of medicinal products, generic medicinal products and organic medicinal products which, in my view, is aimed at meeting the ever-greater demands of the European citizens and the need to provide a more reliable framework for conditions for marketing medicinal products for human use.
Lastly, as I said about the other report by MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, we must consider reasonable protection (in the form of a set period of time) for the rights of pharmaceutical products, specifically those that have new therapeutic indications, which provide patients with substantial clinical benefits compared to existing therapeutic indications, in order to achieve the balance suggested by the rapporteur (although not optimistic, she is at least realistic) between competitiveness, research, health system needs and the development of generic medicines.
The overall compromise that was reached with the Council under the Italian Presidency, including on the Agency covered by the MÃŒller report, is extremely important.
Â Â  We have just expressed our opinion on the revision of pharmaceutical legislation.
The modified directive will allow a greater degree of harmonisation between the Member States when it comes to the rules governing medicines.
It may increase the effectiveness with which the centralised and decentralised procedures operate.
We want the Member States to ensure, however, that preference is given to homeopathic medicines manufactured and marketed in the Community.
We have voted in favour of the amendments that could resolve a number of problems caused by the legal vacuum in which certain homeopathic medicines still exist.
Not only do these medicines, used by more than a hundred million Europeans, not have side effects, but they also enable the health services to make savings.
We are definitely keen to preserve those homeopathic medicines that meet the demand from our countriesâ citizens.
We have also come out in favour of developing Europeâs generic pharmaceutical industry, for, if we want to preserve our social protection, we have to make savings, and generic medicines help us do that.
Â Â  .I commend the rapporteur for her tremendous work on this vital subject.
The common position as drafted presents a major problem for my Member State, Ireland, regarding ArticleÂ 67 on prescription-only medicines for veterinary purposes.
This is why I retabled the relevant amendment from first reading, which we overwhelmingly adopted first time round.
It is essential that subsidiarity prevail and that each Member State be free to decide which medicines will require prescriptions.
This is the current situation and has proved reliable in terms of protecting public health.
My amendment would allow Member States this discretion, while carefully supervising the authorisation of appropriate dispensers of the medicines.
It would mean that the merchant-based system of licensing and control in Ireland would be allowed to continue.
This system delivers the highest standards of food safety and traceability. But it avoids unnecessary cost and bureaucracy for farmers and animal owners.
Â Â  . I welcome the efforts that have been made to establish a Community code for veterinary medicines.
Guaranteeing a high level of public health protection in the European Union necessarily requires general provisions to be adopted on placing these veterinary medicines on the market.
There is unfortunately no shortage of reasons for greater vigilance to be required for products made available to healthcare professionals.
Care over the precision and reliability of information on medicinal products is becoming increasingly important, due to greater consumer awareness.
I therefore believe we would do very well to insist on a clearer separation between âinformation on medicinal productsâ and the âadvertising of medicinal productsâ.
Lastly, I agree with the idea that reasonable timescales must be set for protecting the rights of pharmaceutical products, because this alone â on a reasonable basis, of course, which I believe has been achieved as a result of the European Parliamentâs action â will ensure the ongoing interest of the sectorâs industries in pursuing and even stepping up their study and technological research efforts to find new and improved products.
Â Â  I have voted in favour of Amendments NosÂ 20-23, which were, however, rejected.
I did so because there is an obvious risk of what are at present counted as food supplements being redefined in future as medicines.
This would make them less accessible in a situation in which many people supplement their food intake with food supplements in order to feel better and keep healthy.
The directive could therefore have a serious effect on prices in the event of food supplements being redefined as medicines.
Higher costs for the individual consumer might make food supplements too expensive to buy.
The result would be higher sickness rates and increasing costs to society.
Â Â  .I thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this important matter.
Traditional herbal medicines have been used in our societies from the earliest times.
In more recent years, production and sale of these products have become more structured and commercialised.
There has been an increasing awareness that modern medicines do not always provide relief for all possible conditions and many people have found herbal medicines to be an important element of their health regime.
I believe that we as legislators have a duty first and foremost to ensure the highest standards of public health protection.
The provision of medicines, herbal or otherwise, cannot take place in an unregulated environment.
This would be irresponsible.
However, we must pay due regard to long-established practices in an industry that has been largely self-regulating in many countries.
There are many products available through health food stores which have been categorised as foods or food supplements and not medicines, even though they may have therapeutic qualities.
But we must remember that all foods which form part of a balanced diet can have a positive health effect.
What we must avoid is imposing restrictive legislation that will hamper free trade and competition and cause damage to a thriving health store sector.
The operation of this sector can be carefully monitored through appropriate national legislation.
Â Â  . I supported this recommendation for second reading which, by retabling those Parliamentary amendments that were adopted at previous reading and by improving the text of the common position adopted by the Council, better serves the aim of harmonising national legislation in the field of measuring instruments.
The increasing complexity of todayâs economies and the need to ensure fair trade require a minimum level of accuracy that must be guaranteed by means of legislative requirements.
This demand is, in the context of a common market such as the European Unionâs, more than justified.
This view is damaged by the Council common positionâs containing an âoptionality clauseâ, which would allow Member States to decide what instruments must be subject to regulation, thereby encouraging the retention of a dual system consisting of a regulated part and an unregulated part.
I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that âif intra-Community trade considerations are taken into account, then national legislation should notbe incompatible with each other, nor with EC legislationâ.
Consequently, as the rapporteur points out, only by making this clause meet certain general requirements and by introducing a transitional period in which Member States can phase out this clause will we be able to achieve the harmonisation we wish to see.
Â Â  . I know that road safety is a high-priority task for the European Union, I recognise that this report represents a step towards achieving this Community objective and consequently voted in favour of the report currently before us.
I therefore agree with adopting most of the measures that were proposed and with applying them to minibuses, buses and coaches and to light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles.
I agree with the rapporteurâs view, however, that banning side-facing seats in certain vehicles is excessive.
The fundamental issue is that these seats have not been proven to be unsafe in all the vehicle types in question.
It is true that the Commission submitted a study, but this study does not justify a ban of this nature, because it was confined to examining accidents that occurred in only one category of vehicles â minibuses â and was based on parameters that only apply to this type of vehicle.
Furthermore, the data on M3-category coaches which belong to the classes III or B, do not suggest any specific risk that would justify a total ban.
I therefore feel that the European Commissionâs conclusions are, in this last regard, over-hasty.
Â Â  . Wearing a safety belt has advantages, mainly that of preventing people from being thrown from vehicles.
Various road accident studies conclude, incidentally, that many passengers die precisely as a result of being projected from the vehicle whereas those who remain inside the vehicle generally survive.
We could, therefore, legitimately consider the use of seatbelts to be socially beneficial, because this contributes significantly to reducing the number of deaths and injuries in the event of an accident.
It is also important to remember that this report adopts a Commission proposal that should be seen in the context of amendments to 1974, 1976 and 1977 Council directives on enhancing road safety.
We can reasonably predict that the Commission proposals contained in this set of measures will bring about positive results.
At a time, however, when the road mortality rate remains high, safety measures for all vehicles must be stepped up â not only for light vehicles (category M1), but also for minibuses and coaches (categories M2 and M3) and light and heavy trucks (categories N1, N2 and N3).
Road safety must be a priority.
For all of these reasons, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . Greater transport safety, in light of the very high number of fatalities every year, has been one of the European Unionâs priorities, and has led to various European Parliament reports and to a White Paper.
I believe that by extending the obligatory use of seatbelts, the Commission proposal, which the rapporteur also endorses, contributes to greater passenger safety and I therefore supported this report.
We are talking, in particular, about minibuses, coaches and light, medium and heavy-duty trucks.
This measure does nothing more than minimise the effects of road accidents, however, and I recommend that investment be made in other, genuinely preventive, measures, as a more effective way of reducing the mortality rate on roads, by reducing the number of accidents.
I propose, for example, that we give a powerful commitment to school and civic education, to promoting a culture of responsibility and respect, to improving roads and motorways, which are becoming increasingly congested, and to technological improvements to cars and to all vehicles.
Another suggestion, which I have advocated for a long time, is to invest in developing the rail sector, which is an undoubtedly safer form of transport than road transport and which could provide a truly sustainable alternative to a road sector which is increasingly saturated.
Â Â  .I abstained because I am chairman of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art in the UK.
Â Â  . Although I am aware of the problems inherent in this issue, not least in terms of international coordination and of proving ownership, I believe that this is a positive proposal because it will ensure the full return, wherever possible, of looted cultural goods.
In this regard, there clearly exists legal uncertainty, which is abused today by people who appropriate these goods and traffic illegally in them, leaving their legitimate owners without legal protection.
A typical situation involves countless items plundered during World WarÂ II, many of which have still not been recovered by their owners or the ownersâ successors.
In this difficult balancing act between various interests, account must also be taken of rights acquired by third parties who have purchased items in good faith.
I therefore share the rapporteurâs position on the need to address the complexity of the underlying moral and ethical issue and on the need for a legal and institutional framework that is fairer to those asking for goods to be returned, to the current owners, to state bodies and to not-for-profit organisations.
Coordination has clear advantages over the haphazard approach that has prevailed to date, and I welcome in particular the idea of establishing a common cataloguing system, creating a centralised database and opening up public and private archives to investigation, which will facilitate greater transparency and more effective monitoring of the movements of such goods.
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  .â The resolution on the Commissionâs work programme for 2004 has very severe things to say about the Eurostat affair and its consequences, and these I entirely endorse, but the fact is that nobody is explaining why there was no response from the Commission for such a long period of time.
Not only is it necessary to lance the boil of Eurostat; it will also be necessary, in future, to make OLAF more independent and more capable of functioning, to improve the transmission of internal information, to treat as a matter of urgency the reform of the Commissionâs accounting system, and to put an end to both the culture of secrecy and the negligent attitude to financial control.
These requirements are made all the more urgent by the constant revelations of other frauds, for example, the price-fixing by insiders in agricultural management committees, or, more recently, the âBlue Dragon 2000â affair in relation to the use of Community funds in Catalonia.
Aberrations of this sort are not unconnected with the Commissionâs generally arrogant attitude towards the Member States.
One single cause underlies all this behaviour, namely, the Commissionâs belief in itself as the sole possessor of a superior truth.
It is regrettable that the draft European constitution encourages it in this belief, whereas it ought to have been made into a subordinate body.
Â Â  .â This is a resolution that not only fails to question any of the European Unionâs fundamental pillars and policies â its neoliberal capitalist policies, federalism, its increasing militarism â and fails to condemn the harmful consequences of these for the workers and communities in the various countries it actually confirms these guidelines and priorities, and masks their true nature by introducing some social concerns.
One example is the resolutionâs insistence on the need for the so-called âEuropean constitutionâ.
It is reluctant to enter into the debate on the forthcoming financial perspectives (from 2006 onwards) â and this is simply astounding - on the grounds that the European elections are due to be held soon.
It welcomes the militarisation of the EU.
It does not question the policies of liberalisation â it simply refers to more careful consideration of their âpossible consequencesâ.
It rejects the proposal for an amendment that proposed a re-evaluation of the Commissionâs mandate for the WTO.
In short, it gives the Commission yet another role.
There is no analysis of the worsening economic and social situation in the various EU countries or any criticism of the policies that have caused this situation.
If the truth be told, we could expect nothing else from the political forces that decide, in the EP, in the Commission and in the various governments, on EU policies.
Â Â  Mr President, on CÃŽte d'Ivoire, we tabled an amendment today.
It is deplorable that this Parliament did not support that amendment.
It is completely unacceptable that, in relation to fisheries agreements, EU fishing vessels take priority over the rights of people in other countries.
This is a war-torn country.
We believe that the agreement should be suspended until the conflict is solved.
It is completely unacceptable to let EU vessels continue fishing undisturbed regardless of the fact that there is a conflict there.
Â Â  .â The role of foreign forces is particularly evident in the military conflicts which are tearing the CÃŽte d'Ivoire apart, with tens of thousands of innocent victims.
At the same time, the European Union has turned this country into an experimental laboratory to test its âcrisis managementâ policy which, in essence, is a policy of imposing its imperialist intentions.
The European Union has no business in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
The French troops should withdraw immediately and the problem should be dealt with within the framework of the UN and the African Union.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution, not only because it fails to name the guilty parties, but also because it welcomes the interventionist role of the EU.
These positions turn any positive elements which the resolution contains into nothing more than a wish list.
Â Â  . â Even though it is impossible to disagree with the condemnation of the concept of ââ and of the political murders committed in its name, we have not voted to approve this report.
On the one hand, it glosses over the culpability of successive French governments, which, following a long period of colonial oppression, supported HouphouÃ«t-Boignyâs dictatorship and then the authoritarian regime of his successor BÃ©diÃ©, who, in the course of his struggle for power with his rivals, devised the rabble-rousing concept of â.
Even today, the French army maintains a presence in CÃŽte dâIvoire to protect, not the people, but French capitalist interests.
In any case, what is meant by âthe restoration of the stateâs authorityâ if no means are provided to put a stop to âpoverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, violations of human rights, and the oppression of minoritiesâŠâ,which the report itself sees as destabilising influences and as having been factors in bringing about the present conflicts?
As for what are claimed to be peacekeeping forces, for example those of ECOWAS, previous experience in SierraÂ Leone and Liberia has demonstrated that, in general, they did nothing other than add one more armed gang to those that are already preying on the population.
Using our votes to endorse such a hypocritical document would have served only to enable Members of the European Parliament to appease their consciences.
Â Â  . â From the very outset, the joint resolution adopts a paternalistic tone in its assessment that the conflict in CÃŽte d'Ivoire âcannot be attributed solely to the ethnic factorâÂ â which, in any case, attaches value to the factor in question.
Is it not, though, the neo-liberalisation of the Ivorian economy, the reduced prices for raw materials and the consequent impoverishment of the people, the way in which multinational companies openly set Ivorian neo-colonial factions against each other, that have enabled speeches about ââ to find an audience, and facilitated ?
The joint resolution has nothing to say about the need to withdraw the French peacekeeping troops; the historic links between the army, French businesses, and the political class in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and the neighbouring states mean that the French army and foreign office cannot be regarded as neutral, so the involvement of other actors needs to be encouraged.
This at once weakens many of the points in the Linas-Marcoussis agreement.
The best policy for preventing conflicts is to eradicate their causes, and, in this instance, those who started the fires are no good at putting them out.
There is a need to get away from the profoundly anti-democratic, neo-colonialist way of thinking in order to move towards another form of cooperation between Europe and Africa.
I therefore abstained from voting on a resolution that does not get to grips with these problems.
Â Â  . â Once again, this House has responded to the disastrous situation in Cote dâIvoire by adopting a mediocre resolution which does not distinguish between the prime cause of the situation and factors of secondary importance.
The prime cause is a combination of ethnically-based forces, openly racist (whether their racism be intertribal, anti-white, or anti-French), engaged in dismantling the stability and prosperity that they inherited.
The armed robberies committed a fortnight ago in Abidjan, by militiamen calling themselves âpatriotsâ, the victims being representatives of humanitarian NGOs that are doing remarkable work, especially for the benefit of children, and diplomatic representatives, are made all the more shocking and unacceptable by their being carried out with utter impunity and under the complacent eyes of the forces of order.
The double game that the government is playing must be denounced in unequivocal terms: there was nothing spontaneous about these events, which were surreptitiously organised by cronies of President Gbagbo or by the President himself, whose mastery of doubletalk is unsurpassed.
These âyoung patriotsâ are armed, funded and used by a government which, although lawful, is failing to perform its functions.
In view of the scale of robberies such as these, France and the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, start to talk tough and establish a clear link between aid and respect for rights, or else they will give an impression of indifference or complicity.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(4)
Â Â  â Mr President, over the weekend of 6-7 December 2003, the number of innocent victims of the criminal invasion of Afghanistan by the American armed forces was increased by a further fifteen children, murdered during bombings by the occupying forces.
Since the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan, thousands of children and civilians have lost their lives, the pretext being to oust the Taliban but the real objective being to occupy Afghanistan.
We also have a similar but even worse situation as a result of the illegal and barbaric invasion of Iraq by American and British forces.
Nonetheless, while the European Parliament has shown particular sensitivity about the deaths among the invaders, observing one minute's silence in their memory, it is indifferent to the countless victims they have caused.
Mr President, I should like to ask the Bureau to invite the House, during the next plenary, to observe one minute's silence in memory of the children and the thousands of other civilians who lost their lives during the above invasions.
Â Â  The Presidency has taken note of your proposal and will communicate it to the competent authorities for their consideration.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0435/2003) by Mrs Sommer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the widespread introduction and interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the Community [COM(2003) 132 â C5-0190/2003 â 2003/0081(COD)].
Â Â  . â Let me start by warmly thanking my fellow-Members of this House for their very constructive cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, to whom many thanks.
The proposal that the Commission put before us was indeed a very ambitious one, with much promised by a forward-looking new technology based on satellite navigation and mobile communications.
By 2012 at the latest, according to the proposal, the Member States were to be required to use this technology for the charging of tolls, which would have meant the abolition of all the other technical systems currently in existence, which are based on short-range microwave technology.
This was meant to achieve technical interoperability, which was the actual object of the legislation.
It is also the right one.
In a common internal market, it is not acceptable for technical barriers to put the brakes on the flow of traffic and hence on the transport of goods.
Incompatibility between national toll systems could have no other result; it creates problems for international road traffic and interferes with the smooth functioning of the internal market.
The legislative proposal also aims at contractual interoperability; one contract for each user, and valid throughout Europe, would certainly be a good thing.
I might mention that this is also an ambitious goal in view of the continuing need for a great deal of harmonisation within the EU, whether in the fiscal, administrative or legal spheres.
I was unable, however, as this Houseâs rapporteur, to go along with the Commission proposal as it relates to technical interoperability.
Why is this so?
The problem we face is that the new toll technology that the Commission favours, and which is currently being developed only in Germany, does not yet work.
Technology that does not work does not exist in real terms, so can legislators prescribe as mandatory something that does not exist?
Is it, in any case, any legislatorâs task to prescribe one technology or another?
No, I do not believe that it is.
As the majority of my fellow-Members share my view that it is for the market to decide what specific technologies should be used, we have agreed not to follow the Commission on this point.
We want to take a more technology-neutral approach.
We take the view that the actual objective â the technical interoperability of the various systems â has to be achieved.
We have been told by the users â the operating companies in the various Member States in which electronic toll-charging systems are in use â that this can be done.
By the present proposal, as now amended, we insist on this; technical interoperability must be achieved, and what this ultimately means is that the technology currently in use must be changed only as and when it cannot be enabled to communicate with other systems of technology.
We also see it as important that subsidiarity should be safeguarded.
The basic decision on whether or not to charge a toll, on what vehicles and what stretches or types of road, must remain a matter for the Member States.
I also think it is important that I should take this opportunity to point out that data protection must be treated as a matter of the highest priority.
We do not want drivers to end up having everything known about them.
Let me add that, in all our debates, I repeatedly stressed my view that satellite technology is extraordinarily important.
I am convinced that we are doing the right thing in developing Galileo, the European satellite system.
In order to put this conviction on record, I have now, at first reading, tabled an amendment drafted in stronger terms.
I would emphasise that it was my esteemed colleague Mrs Langenhagen who originally tabled this amendment in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, where it struck me as too rigorous to be able to command a majority.
As regards tomorrowâs vote in the plenary, though, I am working on the assumption that this House will endorse this unequivocal vote in favour of Europe having its own satellite navigation system, one that will make us Europeans independent of others.
This, again, I ask you to support.
Let me conclude by asking you to believe me when I say that for me, as a German rapporteur, it has not â heaven knows â been an easy matter to propose this course of action to you.
The original draft from the Commission would eventually have given German industry an enormous opportunity; it could have marketed the new and innovative toll-charging technology the length and breadth of Europe.
This new technology is fantastic.
Not only â I am convinced â is it the only technical solution that can be regarded as suitable to German conditions, but it also has many other potential uses over and beyond simply collecting tolls.
Let me reiterate, though, that a technology that does not exist in real terms cannot be made mandatory by law.
It is a source of bitter anguish to me that the amateurish approach adopted by the German Federal Government, particularly when negotiating the contracts to introduce toll-charging technology, has resulted in such a debacle, one that leaves us, at European level, no solution other than the one I have now proposed to you.
Â Â  . â The message of the statistics is plain, especially where freight traffic across the Alps is concerned.
In Switzerland, 66% of freight is transported by rail and 30% by road; in the EU, the proportions are reversed and the difference even more starkly pronounced.
What this means is that, politically speaking, the Swiss are doing something that we in Europe, in the European Union, cannot manage to do.
They fix the heavy traffic levy at such a level that all external costs are completely internalised, so that the costs of road surfaces, accidents and environmental damage by noise and air pollution are all covered.
Of this revenue, 80% is spent on the alternative; on building base tunnels, on measures for protection from railway noise and on improvements to rail services.
In technological matters, too, the Swiss, in little Switzerland, are years ahead of the EU.
The Swiss have a system, one that works well, with microwave technology, to be combined in future with digital tachographs.
The question is: why can we not manage that in the EU?
The proposal for the Eurovignette again lays down a maximum, one that is so low that nobody can seriously believe that it offers any proper incentive to use rail rather than road; nor, indeed, are the Member States allowed to spend most of this money on the alternative.
What this means is that this is a half-hearted policy, and we see its results when we consider the statistics on climate change, accidents and so on.
In much the same way as the German transport ministry, the Commission has allowed itself to be pressed into the service of two big players and wants to force upon us satellite technology that is not yet fully developed.
I think that we who sit on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as on the other, would be doing well to bring the Commission back a bit nearer to earthbound reality and to demand neutrality in matters of technology.
By way of conclusion, I want to say something about the effect that distorted competition between road and rail has on society.
After this House had adopted, after only one reading, Mr Markovâs directive on driving hours and rest periods, Mr Berlusconi and his government did not even think it necessary to put it on the Councilâs agenda.
That, I think, is quite simply a scandal.
How can we in Europe make progress on the social and environmental fronts when such significant directives are not allowed to make progress at Council level?
Â Â  I thank the honourable Member.
The President is tolerant towards rapporteurs, but you have exceeded your speaking time by fifty percent and your fellow Members will complain.
I would be grateful if you would conform to the specified time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for your support for our initiative on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems, which is an essential element in the European policy on charging for infrastructures and on the management of transport demand.
This Directive appears amongst the proposals in the White Paper on transport policy and, clearly, it is a preliminary step to establishing the new Eurovignette system and to facilitating the payment by users of the costs of the use of road infrastructures.
The Directive has the following three objectives: firstly, the interoperability of electronic road toll systems; secondly, the establishment of a European electronic road toll system; and, thirdly, the introduction of satellite technology.
The principle of interoperability allows us to remove the obstacles standing in the way of creating the internal market in electronic tolls and therefore to prevent barriers; it allows us to extend electronic tolls more widely and restrict congestion at payment points.
The European electronic road toll service we are proposing, like the interoperability of systems, responds to genuine need for users, in particular lorry drivers, who want an electronic means of payment as soon as possible, a single one for the whole of the network.
The service we are proposing, based on the principle of a single contract, offers both users and operators the protection of a clear legal document which can be used in the event of a dispute.
It is a question of implementing in this field what already exists, for example, in the fields of mobile telephones and bank card systems.
With regard to the migration of the current electronic toll systems, based on microwave systems, to satellite technology, I will say that this is the only solution for the future which allows us to respond to the various needs of the European Unionâs charging policy and which will furthermore allow us to considerably improve the quality of road transport, thanks to the establishment of new telematic services and new possibilities, particularly security systems, such as speed restrictors, anti-collision devices, the monitoring of the traffic in dangerous goods, information for travellers â in accordance with their position â on the situation on the different roads and on the fluidity of traffic at different points etc.
Mr President, the lack of a firm commitment in favour of satellite technology would not be coherent with the decisive policy being maintained by this Commission and this Parliament in particular, as well as the Council and the European Union as a whole, in favour of the Galileo system.
I would like to say that numerous Member States â with the notable exceptions of Germany and Italy â wish to continue using microwave systems in parallel with satellite systems.
This desire, which is understandable in view of the investments already made, can be dealt with by integrating a firm recommendation on the solution for the satellites â rather than obtaining the full and closed commitment â which allows this to become a reality in the medium term.
This is also accepted by the Council.
I am going to listen to the rest of the debate, but I hope that, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, and the co-rapporteur, Mr Turmes, and thanks to the work of the Council, we can adopt it at first reading â which I would insist is extremely important â in order the facilitate the use of toll systems on roads in the future.
Mr President, today we were not going to talk about the âEurovignette Directiveâ, but I would like to say to MrÂ Turmes that the working group on transport has already met on several occasions with a view to making progress on the debate on this complex Directive, and we are trying to achieve as successful a result as the one I expect with the âElectronic Toll Directiveâ, in other words that, at first reading â before the end, therefore, of Parliament's current mandate â Parliament and the Council can adopt it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Renate Sommer, on the work which she carried out on her report.
Of course, her work is so good that I believe that there will be agreement with the Council right from the first reading, which makes today's debate less interesting.
But, in all events, this does not mean that we should not recall that Mrs Sommer worked in a very good and systematic manner and managed to make the Commission's initial proposal acceptable to almost all the members of our committee.
At the same time, she agreed with the Council that we would proceed very quickly on what was necessary, in other words the interoperability of toll systems at European level.
We agree with the Commission proposal in principle, because it makes life easier for users, that is, drivers, who will have fewer difficulties in cross-border transport with this approach.
We simply have a few objections â and I am glad that both the Commission and the Council understand them â which focus on two points.
First, when will this new toll concept start to be applied?
We propose that the timetable be postponed from 2005 to 2007 for buses and lorries, because we consider that two years are needed so that everyone who has to adapt can adapt and the system can start operating.
Secondly, will the new satellite positioning system be applied exclusively or not?
This system caused a great many problems when it started to be applied in Germany.
I think that it does the rapporteur credit that she demonstrates a truly European perception of this specific issue; in other words, she does not want to impose the German system exclusively and she proposes, with all her fellow Members, that this decision be taken in agreement with the relevant sector, the Member States and the other agencies involved, so that we really can be sure that the systems will be interoperable and efficient for everyone.
Â Â  Commissioner, Mr President, first of all I should like to pay my deepest respects to Mrs Sommer, for the quality of the work that we were able to carry out together â thanks to her willingness to listen and also her flexibility on all those occasions where we may have had differences of opinion â which I hope has resulted in our having a very good text even at first reading, a text which I hope will be final.
I believe that in the final analysis this directive is very important, on the one hand because its purpose is to make life easier for all those road-transport operators who of course pass through toll stations and who often need to change the system or method of payment, but also because it is a directive which is very much open to the prospects of future technology, in particular as regards the implementation of the Galileo system.
We in the PSE Group believe that this directive was initially a little inflexible and very restricting for the motorway-transport sector.
In effect, it required that sector to ensure, very rapidly, the interoperability of current microwave systems, in other words to invest very heavily, only to switch very quickly to another system two years later.
No doubt it was unacceptable to demand such a double effort from the sector, and I welcome the fact that we were able to agree on Amendment No 48, by MrsÂ Sommer, which strongly recommends Galileo and advocates waiting for an intermediate report by the Commission in order to determine the conditions under which we shall implement the switch.
Nevertheless, we are very keen on the satellite positioning system and we believe that that is where the future lies, not only for tolls, but for a multitude of other services.
Secondly, we believe that we have given preference to the interoperability of systems, in other words most of the amendments that we have tabled, whether it is Amendment No 11 submitted by us or Amendment No 46 submitted by Mrs Sommer, are essentially aimed, not necessarily at having a unified system, but at making systems interoperable, and we believe that in the short term that is what should be required.
In other words, we also have to ensure that certain microwave systems can be interoperable with GPM/GPRS technology.
We have also reviewed the timetable.
I think that the timetable proposed by the Commission was quite simply unrealistic, because it did not take into account the time needed for the legislative work and the fact that we were unable to require that the European electronic toll system be brought into line so rapidly, that is, by 1 January 2005.
Finally, as far as the PSE Group is concerned, we have proposed, at the request of the City of London â which does not seem to be particularly Socialist â which is following this debate closely, to restrict the scope slightly and to make provision for a transitional phase for local toll systems.
London, in fact, has just implemented its own system.
