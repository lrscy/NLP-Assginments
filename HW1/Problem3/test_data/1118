Graham Watson put it very well yesterday when he used an aviation metaphor and said that when we look into the cockpit we do not want to see that there is no pilot, or that the pilot is confused, weak or disoriented.
We are looking to you, we have heard you request this House's endorsement and we have every confidence that this pilot will have a firm hand on the controls.
You told us that you want an independent Commission.
That is the kind of partner this Parliament needs.
You told us that you want a Europe based on solidarity.
Those of us who subscribe to the European project know that is a sine qua non.
There is no future for the European project if we cannot strengthen its identity as a common project, without emphasising the sense of ownership and without a clear and effective policy of economic and social cohesion.
You told us that you want a Europe that is more than an internal market, one that is a Europe of citizens.
That is the same Europe that we want to help to build, a Europe that is not limited to its economic dimension, but a Europe of citizens â a people's Europe.
We appreciated what you said in your address yesterday about unemployment and job creation, about combating inequality and about security.
I know you and can bear witness to your humanist approach and to your support for the values of the rule of law, but it is important to emphasise that we live in uncertain times, in times when there are quite rightly calls for increased security.
Nevertheless, we must avoid exaggeration or fanaticism when it comes to security.
Yes, we want greater security, but we cannot accept that it should suffocate freedom.
When security stops being an instrument for defending and maintaining our freedom, it turns into tyranny.
When it comes to implementing SIS II â the second generation of the Schengen Information System â as regards border controls and in the areas of asylum and migration, but also as regards judicial and police cooperation, a great deal still remains to be done despite the enormous progress made over the last five years in creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
MrÂ President-designate, I was pleased to hear you calling for a close positive relationship with this House.
The history of our Community records that progress was always made when this relationship was at its most focused.
It is a fact that in the history of Portuguese democracy you have been the Prime Minister who has made the most important contribution to parliamentary debate.
I would also like to see you become the President of the Commission closest to the European Parliament, Europe's democratic assembly, in the history of our institutions.
Let me say one last word about the recent elections: the increasingly low turnout is a symptom of a distance between the public in general and the European project, a distance that we must fight.
There is also a great deal to be done in this respect in terms of combining the forces of the Commission and Parliament.
There is an urgent need to change the way we communicate, inform and educate.
I was pleased to hear you saying yesterday that Portugal may be on the edge of Europe geographically speaking, but that it is nevertheless at the heart of Europe.
It will therefore be for us to ensure that our citizens take Europe and this common project to heart.
Â Â  â MrÂ President-designate, I should like to put two issues to you, to which I would be grateful for a reply, or a less vague reply at least.
The first concerns information.
As you know, the Constitutional Treaty, which is to be signed in Rome on 29Â October, clearly states the value of pluralism of information.
In addition, on 22Â April this year, the European Parliament adopted an important resolution on the risks of violating freedom of expression and information in the European Union.
ParagraphÂ 77 of this resolution calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive to safeguard pluralism and the media in Europe, and paragraphÂ 78 invites the Commission to submit proposals to ensure that members of national governments cannot use their own holdings in broadcasting companies for political ends.
I would be very grateful if, in your reply, you could specify first of all whether you agree with the content of this resolution and, if you do, how soon you intend to make a start on the measures requested by this Parliament.
The second issue concerns Iraq, a country that I have known well since the Gulf War in 1991.
I would like to point out that the split in Europe over the Iraqi question was a serious weakness for the supporters of multilateralism and peace, two words that you used in your speech yesterday.
I believe great energy and determination are needed once more from all the European institutions so that this weakness can be overcome as quickly as possible.
Since this matter was not dealt with clearly enough in your address, I should like you to explain what concrete initiatives you intend to adopt in order to achieve a common European position in favour of peace and to ensure that Europe plays an important role and maintains an active presence in the process of reconstructing civil society and democracy in Iraq.
I came back from Iraq two weeks ago and I can tell you that the Iraqis have just one message to give: we want Europe more and we do not want to be left alone just with the Americans.
Â Â  Madam President, firstly, I should like to wish MrÂ Barroso good luck in the forthcoming vote and with the work on creating an agenda for the reform of Europe.
I believe it may be said that we now have a better Europe than ever, thanks to the European Union.
That development towards freedom, democracy and states governed by the rule of law that we have been able to see in so many countries in recent decades could not have happened without the European Union.
I think it important to say that today, because there are many who have maintained the opposite when it comes to Europeâs ability to contribute to freedom and peace.
The challenge now is also to make the European Union better.
It is about creating a momentum for competition and growth and creating a clear political will.
One of the first and most important tasks for the President of the Commission is to ensure that no one experiences the economic growth in the new Member States as a threat to the old Member States.
On the contrary, the development of the former is an asset for us all and will help bring vitality to the European economy.
This emphasises both the need for, and the possibility of, an agenda of reform in which, I believe, the President of the Commission, together with other political leaders, must be courageous enough to dare to confront the political, economic and structural problems we have in Europe.
The task is not to prevent change through regulations but to create an openness to the new that will give us new strength and new ideas in Europe.
In that respect, it is important for the Lisbon process to enter a new phase because, not having led to the required changes, it has not worked.
Both the Member States and the European Union must now do something that will take Europe forwards.
I want to address another matter: that of the Middle East and the European Unionâs foreign policy.
If the EU cannot contribute to freedom and democracy in the dictatorships of the Arab world, then we are also undermining the chances for freedom and peace of both Palestinians and Israelis.
The Palestinian Authorityâs collapse into terrorism, lawlessness and corruption, which we have been able to follow in recent days, is an expression of the fact that the surrounding world has not been sufficiently vocal in asserting the Palestinian peopleâs right to representatives who respect the rules of democracy and of societies based on law, â rules relating, for example, to the lives and worth of other people.
This must be an important task for the European Union.
Finally, I want to state that we are today seeing genocide taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan.
A crucial test for the European Union will be that of creating sufficient political capability and will to do something about this.
Too many times have we said that such things must not happen again.
Now, they are, in fact, happening again.
Let us now make sure we acquire the power to arrest this trend.
Â Â  â Mr Barroso, you have not convinced us.
On Iraq, for example, you say that you want to turn the page and look to the future.
That is easy to say; in that case, why have you not withdrawn your troops from Iraq?
Why is it that we do not, today, have a clear plan put forward by you?
We know perfectly well that it was your commitment to this war and your close links across the Atlantic that gave you the edge over other centrist candidates such as Mr Verhofstadt, for example.
How are you going to change your image?
Mr Poettering supported you by telling us, yesterday: âMr Barroso does not change; he was the same when he was leader of the opposition, the same when he was a ministerâ.
So, no doubt, you will not change if you become President of the Commission, and that is what frightens us.
You are a clever man who can rise to an occasion, but you are not âunfortunately â a man of convictions, although it is convictions, along with actions, that are needed if the citizens of Europe are to regain trust in Europe and in its institutions.
Today, your actions do not speak in your favour.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, allow me to highlight three matters: respect for national cultural treasures, gender equality and the fight against poverty.
IÂ am absolutely delighted that you have pointed out the importance of the multifaceted and rich national, regional, cultural, linguistic and political traditions of the Member States.
The democratic structure of the new Europe requires the trust of its citizens and respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
We all know that the citizens of the Member States currently view with apprehension the European project as aÂ process of centralisation being driven by the Community institutions.
IÂ call upon you, Mr President-designate, to work for the decentralisation of these institutions.
A declaration of the Slovak parliament, adopted as early as January 2002, emphasises in this respect the sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union in cultural and ethical matters.
One thing that has so far failed to become established in the European structure is gender equality.
IÂ note with pride that women are performing important jobs in aÂ responsible manner and are bringing to life an inter-generational network of solidarity.
When women are fully able to utilise their abilities, they will be able to influence in aÂ positive way both the organisation and the understanding of a society of all citizens.
Women give priority to the basic values of the actual human being â truth, justice, love and freedom.
They must be encouraged to promote these irreplaceable values in their family and professional lives.
IÂ should also mention the role of women in childcare, in looking after people with disabilities and the elderly, and women refugees, who, despite their own suffering and problems in hopeless situations, get involved in helping people who are suffering even more than they are.
Protecting women from every new form of poverty is an essential condition for the real accomplishment of gender equality.
Mr Barroso, even though you did not mention it in your address, you are surely aware of the importance of the fight against poverty, which is a key problem for the Member States.
Poverty is aÂ violation of human rights and destroys families.
IÂ call upon you to take part actively in celebrating the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October.
The slogan of this international day, âWhere people are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violatedâ, has often been quoted in the European Parliament.
So joining forces in order to ensure that these rights are respected is our sacred duty.
Mr President-designate, you have proposed aÂ positive alliance between the Commission and Parliament, so please come and meet those Members who are members of the âComitÃ© Quart Monde EuropÃ©enâ, the oldest cross-party group in the European Parliament and one which has given voice to the hopes of the poorest families in Europe since 1979.
Mr Barroso, on behalf of the Members from the Slovak Republic IÂ wish you every success in your work at the head of the European Commission.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr Barroso, our group chairman, Mr Schulz, stated here yesterday that we have asked a few questions in the group, that we have received a response from you to some, but that a whole host of questions remain unanswered.
One of those questions is certainly that in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact.
What do you intend to do to achieve more growth in Europe?
We are lagging behind in terms of growth, and if there is no growth, then there are also insufficient jobs.
We do, of course, have the Stability Pact, which is an important instrument for the Unionâs economic policy, but this Stability Pact should also become a real growth pact, and must be complemented by one.
It is not simply by telling us that you will interpret this Stability Pact with the future in mind that we can develop towards a real growth pact.
Are you thus prepared, in the assessment of the Member Statesâ expenditure, to give specific consideration to expenses in the areas of growth and employment promotion ?
Â Â  â Madam President, MrÂ President-designate of the Commission, it was a joy to listen to your inaugural speech: we could hardly have found a more expert and competent candidate.
MrsÂ De Keyser observed that you are a skilful exploiter of situations.
That is just the sort of President of the Commission we need: someone who can take advantage of any situation and exploit windows of opportunity when they are open.
We need an independent, autonomous and dynamic President of the Commission. I believe that you are just that person.
I am pleased that you come from a small Member State.
I would like to reassure my fellow Members that in Mr Barroso we will have a strong President of the Commission, someone who will also be capable of listening to Parliament.
There has already been evidence of that, during last weekâs hearings, when you assured us that you would be a President for all Europeans.
It is important that the result of the European elections is reflected in the choice of President of the Commission, just as we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have called for.
Ours are not just empty words: we talk openly about our aims, and we realise them, as we have now also done in this case.
I am convinced that the Councilâs unanimously chosen candidate has excellent potential for playing a strong role as President of the Commission.
The independently-made choices of Commissioners are a good start in that respect.
I also believe that during your term of office you will develop transatlantic relations further, which are so important for us Europeans.
Another of Europeâs major challenges is the speedy ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States.
This must be the joint top priority for all of us Europeans who love Europe and our own countries.
We must increase our competitiveness, in order to increase employment and improve the economic situation. Without that, we cannot ensure a prosperous and secure Europe for all its citizens.
A viable and effective Internal Market plays a key part in this.
Since 1993, thanks to the liberalisation of the Internal Market, we have created more than 2.5 million jobs and more than EUR 800 billion in extra reserves for the people of Europe.
There is no alternative to the liberalisation of the Internal Market.
For example, the Financial Services Action Plan has created a European financial internal market, which will boost the efficiency of the market and create more growth.
There has been much talk about a citizensâ Europe, and that is certainly something worth aspiring to.
How might we achieve that?
The credibility of Europe depends on how its citizens feel about the activities of the Union.
Let us make decisions at European level only in those matters where decisions at European level have clear added value for European citizens.
Our citizens now appreciate the single European currency and the notion of freedom of movement, both of which provide justification for the whole Union.
In future, we could even operate on a principle of less regulation and more effort in the implementation and monitoring of action.
The Commission, which controls this implementation, can of course help the Member States in distinguishing the wood from the trees.
The Commission needs to use its increased personnel resources to improve the implementation process and bring the recalcitrant Member States into line.
We have faith in you, President of the Commission.
Â Â  â Madam President, MrÂ President-designate of the Commission, the policies you have pursued in Portugal have startled many of us. There are various reasons for that; from the Iraq war to the collapse of the social security system.
Now, however, you have stated here that you are committed to a very different kind of policy, and it is as a result of this that there is a credibility problem.
We want a social Europe, otherwise the people will not trust us or follow us.
Do you want to compete with the United States of America and China, using the methods that operate there, with America using its competitiveness for weapons, sometimes even for wars, and often forgetting its poor, and with Chinaâs competitiveness partly relying on human rights violations?
MrÂ Barroso, my question to you today is: do you wish to dissociate yourself from such methods, and base your approach on a European social market economy, which is our aim and purpose?
Our problem in the next vote will be whether credibility can be preserved.
If you create a new Europe employing a different sort of policy from that pursued in your country, then you might succeed, but if not, then we will often come into conflict with each other here.
Â Â  Mr President, analysis of Mr Barroso's suitability has focused on three particular issues.
The main criticisms levelled against you, Mr Barroso, relate to your attitude to the war in Iraq, the fact that you are a compromise candidate and, as far as your policies are concerned, references to your being on the right although you say that you are in the centre.
You are being put through this procedure as though you are presumed guilty, not innocent.
There is a lot of prejudice over the policies you put forward in Portugal and because of your political convictions.
If we have to vote for a President, we have to vote on certain principles.
We would like to see four things: respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law; the ability to make Europe a global player while at the same time respecting the different identities of the nations; the ability to create wealth; and the ability to distribute this wealth socially.
We have to decide on the basis of these points whether or not you are the right candidate.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in my one-minute contribution, I should like to concentrate on just one aspect, namely social cohesion in the enlarged Europe.
The elections for the European Parliament in the new Member States and the decidedly low turnout indicated that considerable scepticism prevails in that part of Europe towards the European Union, and often indeed towards the European concept itself.
This scepticism is born of a certain feeling of inequality, a feeling of second-class membership, which is seen in the long transitional periods towards the free movement of people and agricultural subsidies.
Mr Barroso, I should like to hear you give a clear reassurance that, when you become President of the European Commission, you will advocate the principle of equal treatment between old and new Member States and you will fight for the gradual removal of all inequalities, including social inequalities, in the enlarged Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to make an appeal to you and as I am the last speaker, I hope that you will remember it.
On 1 May this year, ten new Member States joined the European Union.
Our people voted for Europe in the referenda first and foremost because they want security and a better life within a common European framework.
They expect us to use our collective powers to do away with inequalities in development inherited from the past.
These differences, both economic and social, are manifest.
Just look at the problem of unemployment and social exclusion.
Differences in the rate of development cannot, of course, be eliminated overnight.
However, they could be resolved with your firm determination to maintain an active policy of solidarity and social commitment.
If you get support for your Commission today, I expect it to give priority to this task.
The issue of new and better jobs is fundamental for the whole of Europe and particularly for the new Member States.
Rest assured that you will have my support for any measure that goes in this direction.
However, if you are indifferent to this problem which concerns a significant section of the European Union, you will not be able to count on my support.
All the same, I wish you every success if you are elected.
Â Â  I would like to thank you for all the questions you have put to me and I shall try to answer all of them, and I in fact answered some of them yesterday.
I would firstly like to address the honourable Members from Greece, who played a very active part in the debate.
In a spirit of fair play, I wish to congratulate them on their victory in the European Football Championship hosted by Portugal.
I know that organising a championship on that scale is a major task, and I would therefore like to wish our Greek friends every success in hosting the forthcoming Olympic Games.
I would like to assure those who will not be voting for me that I shall display the same sense of fair play that I have shown about Greece's victory in Euro 2004.
Turning to your specific questions, I have arranged my replies in clusters, something I am very much in favour of in such cases.
First then, international issues, on which I shall reply in particular to the questions by MrÂ Watson, MrsÂ DeÂ Sarnez, MrÂ Schultz, MrÂ Ortuondo Larrea and MrÂ Kristovskis about a strong European presence on the world stage.
I am in favour of Europe continuing to take the lead on environmental issues, especially climate change issues relating to Kyoto.
I am in favour of Europe continuing to be in the vanguard on free and fair trade in the context of the Doha negotiations and of Europe promoting a multilateral approach both to political issues and to trade issues.
I am in favour of Europe playing an active part in development, and in particular combating world poverty.
Africa is, of course, a priority here.
But we must also fight epidemics like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
I believe that in this area Europe has a social duty that it cannot abdicate.
That is also why we need resources in the new Financial Perspectives to match our ambitions, and we must also endeavour to meet our commitments in relation to the United Nations Millennium Declaration, together with our Monterrey commitments on development aid.
Turning more specifically to foreign policy, and to security and defence policy, I wish to respond to a number of questions, in particular those from MrÂ Pinheiro and MrÂ Wiersma, by saying that I believe that we should develop a European defence identity.
The new Constitution â the new Constitutional Treaty â will help us to consolidate that security and defence identity.
I also believe that we can work with the High Representative, the future Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union.
As a matter of fact, I am already preparing this work with Javier Solana, because I believe that there is work to be done here.
I would now like to move on to the question of Iraq, which I also addressed yesterday, but where I have something to add.
The fact is that Iraq demonstrated that there is not yet a common European policy.
It was not my country that caused the breakdown in European unity.
Various EU Member States, including some that are members of the United Nations Security Council, adopted differing positions.
That is the reality.
It is not the Commission that has to define the foreign policy of the European Union.
Under the current system that is still an intergovernmental matter.
What I can tell you is that as President of the Commission, I shall try to work, particularly with the new EU Minister for Foreign Affairs provided for in the new treaty, towards progressively achieving a coherent EU policy and ensuring that the European Union speaks with a single voice.
At present, the truth of the matter is that Iraq has demonstrated that this is not the case yet, and that is why I do not think it is helpful today to discuss who was in the right here.
We now need to find ways of bringing our positions closer together, and the most recent resolution unanimously approved by the UN Security Council provides some of the ingredients for such a convergence of views.
It is in our interest to work together on Iraq, and to attempt to reach a common vision, particularly on stabilising Iraq and the surrounding region, a vision of an independent and sovereign Iraq, an Iraq at peace with itself and with its neighbours.
I shall accordingly try to respond to the questions put to me by MrÂ Wurtz, Mr Swoboda, MrÂ AntÃ³nio Costa, Mrs Napoletano, MrÂ Wiersma, Mrs Frassoni, MrsÂ Gruber, MrÂ Paasilina, and all the others, by saying that in future, as President of the Commission â if I receive your endorsement â I shall attempt, as far as I possibly can, and working together with the Member States, to ensure that there is a common vision, something of which there has not been any sign amongst the Member States nor even, if we are honest, within our respective political families.
This has been a painful issue and one that we need to move on from now.
But as regards Iraq, and also our relations with the United States in particular, I wish to repeat what I said yesterday.
I am very proud to be a European.
If you confirm me as President of the Commission, it will fall to me to defend Europe's general interests and common good, and not country A or country B's foreign policy stance.
I will not be bound by the foreign policy of one government or another, but I shall be engaged in seeking a common foreign policy for the European Union as a whole.
As regards relations with the United States, a question raised by various honourable Members, including MrÂ Swoboda, Mrs Mussolini, MrÂ Schultz and MrÂ Evans, I believe that it is important that the European Union should not define itself in terms of its opposition to any given country or region.
We have our own identity.
We do not need to define ourselves as being in opposition to the United States, to China, to Russia or to any other global power.
I believe that it is in our interest to ensure that the United States is constructively engaged in major global issues such as the environment, the battle against underdevelopment and the major epidemics.
That is what I shall try to achieve if I am elected President of the Commission.
Another issue mentioned here was Turkey, one of the most difficult issues we face.
MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, Mrs DeÂ Sarnez, MrÂ Martinez, Mr Mulder and MrÂ Belder in particular referred to Turkey.
This will be a key decision for the European Union.
Before any decision is taken in December, both the Commission and the Council should listen to Parliament's opinion on this issue.
It is not possible for me at this stage to assume or presume what the final outcome of this process will be.
Nor do I know yet what the Commission's position will be on the report still being prepared by the Prodi Commission, but I can tell you that I agree with you when you say that this is an important issue for debate, and that any decision that may be taken must be made known in the clearest terms to everyone, starting with the Members of this House.
Nor is this a decision that can be made on religious grounds: referring to the comments made by certain honourable Members, I would say that it is my conviction that our Union, our Community, is based on law and on human rights; it can never be a Union based on any form of religious bias.
That is vital as far as I am concerned.
I also wish to say, regardless of the Turkish issue, that we need to have a special policy towards our neighbours, that is to say our neighbours to the east, in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region.
That is why I spoke about this as being a priority yesterday.
It is my belief that the European Union's foreign policy cannot do everything at the same time â not everything can be a priority.
If you simultaneously treat everything as a priority, then you end up with nothing being a priority.
What we need is a constructive policy in order to spread prosperity and stability to our immediate neighbours, to the east, in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean region, in addition to our active contribution through multilateral world organisations, and above all through the United Nations.
We must therefore strengthen our relations with our immediate neighbours, because our own security and stability also depend to a large extent on our doing so.
Turning to the institutional issues you addressed, and in particular the process of my own nomination, that question was raised by MrÂ Schultz, MrÂ Swoboda, MrÂ Martin, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, MrÂ Ortuondo Larrea, and also by MrÂ Dehaene.
I understand the reservations that exist about the present method for choosing the President of the Commission, but the Treaties have been complied with.
In any case, in order to demonstrate my own concerns about this, I made myself available to appear before all the political groups in the European Parliament, so that I went well beyond my obligations under the Treaty to show my respect for Parliament.
The new European Constitution, the new Constitutional Treaty, adds a political dimension to the selection of the President of the Commission.
It is now largely up to you, the European Parliament, in conjunction with the Council, to find a more concrete way for the Council to justify its choice or the political criteria it applies in selecting the President of the Commission in the future, or to be precise in 2009.
Let me make myself clear and say that I do not just wish to be the Council's candidate, although I am of course very honoured to have received the unanimous support of the Council, but if I am elected I will be the candidate elected by the Council and by this House.
That is why I am here presenting my views and replying to your questions, and that is what I shall do.
I would like to reiterate that if I am elected, I shall defend Europe's common interest by endeavouring, if necessary, to stand up to the vested interests of the Member States, by seeking to strike a balance between all the Member States, large, medium-sized and small alike, as they are all important.
Their dignity is exactly the same, regardless of their size.
With regard to the question put to me by MrÂ Swoboda, that is the issue of my having submitted my resignation as Prime Minister, that decision was a sign of respect for this Parliament.
It would not be correct under our system, under the Portuguese system that is, where the President of the Republic has certain powers, for Portugal to have spent a month waiting to know if its Prime Minister had or had not been elected President of the Commission.
That is why I do not stand before you here today as a Head of Government: I am simply a Member of the Portuguese Parliament.
I stand before you as one of you, presenting my ideas and submitting myself to your approval.
I regard that as a sign of respect for this House.
Another question put to me by many honourable Members, notably MrÂ deÂ Villiers, MrsÂ Bonino and MrÂ Carlos Coelho, was the issue of relations between the Commission and Parliament, and I would like to use the expression that I used in my address, âa close positive relationshipâ.
The European Union makes progress when these two institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament, work hand in hand, respecting each other's powers of course, so that the Commission does not try to usurp Parliament, nor, of course, does Parliament trespass on the Commission's territory.
But when these two institutions work hand in hand, Europe moves forward, and that is the way I want to go.
As regards the debate about the future of Europe and about ratification â an issue raised by MrÂ Schultz, Mrs GrossetÃªte and MrÂ Dehaene in particular â I would like to say that this is a debate that we have to win at national level, and all politicians, be they Members of the European Parliament, members of national parliaments or others, can take part in this debate.
As an institution, it falls to the Commission to provide credible and serious information about what is happening.
For that reason, the job of communication will be a vital one, but I think that this task is one that requires us to have the political courage to combat the apathy that I mentioned to MrsÂ Bonino and other Members of this House.
I personally will make myself available to participate in this debate, wherever and whenever you want me to, but I repeat that it is a debate that has to be won at national level.
Another question also put to me related to the selection of Commissioners, and in particular as to whether or not there should be super-Commissioners.
This question was put to me by several honourable Members, notably by MrsÂ Ludford.
I do not want to have just one super-Commissioner in my Commission â I would like to have 24 super-Commissioners, because I believe that there is a vital principle at stake here: the principle of collegiality.
The Commission needs to maintain that principle.
I have not yet taken a final decision â I can only take it once I have received your endorsement â about the structure of the Commission, but this is one of the responsibilities of the President of the Commission, it is not the responsibility of the European Council, and I shall therefore exercise my responsibility as regards allocating the various Commission portfolios.
The principle of collegiality also applies here; we will not trespass on the territory of other institutions, but equally the Council may not trespass on that of the Commission.
It is my responsibility and I shall exercise that responsibility.
The issue of transparency and openness was raised with me by a number of Members, including MrÂ Evans, MrÂ Bonde, MrÂ Lundgren and MrsÂ Martens.
I am committed to the Commission being open, effective and accountable.
I believe that the European Parliament has a very important role to play in monitoring the work of the Commission.
In order carry out this monitoring role, the Members of the European Parliament need information, and I am prepared to give you that information.
Furthermore, the positive work already initiated by President Prodi in this area must be acknowledged.
MrÂ Bonde asked me a number of specific questions and I would like to reply to them.
I already know that you have informally been provided with information on the whole list of groups of experts and working groups.
I hope that the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with full information on these groups of experts and working groups on a regular basis.
I know that the Commission has been working with the Court of Auditors so as to provide this institution with everything it needs.
I am willing to work with you, and particularly with the Committee on Budgetary Control, as regards financial control of the Commission.
I have already said that I have not yet taken a final decision as to the structure of the Commission, but there is one decision that I have taken, and that is that the Commissioner responsible for the budget will not be the same as the Commissioner responsible for audit and control.
As I see it, that is the best guarantee of the control function.
As regards your wider questions about documentation and information, I am willing to provide Parliament with that information.
I would like to consider with you how we can improve on the current situation.
As to the issue of âwhistleblowersâ, the Commission has already reviewed its staff regulations, and Commission staff are accordingly now clearly responsible for reporting all irregularities, and the Commission is obliged to protect the rights of officials who report such irregularities.
Turning to the issue of gender and to the number of women Commissioners, a question raised yesterday by MrÂ Maaten and again today by MrsÂ Ludford, Mrs SegelstrÃ¶m and MrsÂ ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, as well as by a number of other Members of both sexes.
I am in favour of equal opportunities.
I am in favour of equal rights for men and women.
I regard that as axiomatic in our culture, and I believe it to be a human rights issue where there is no room for compromise.
Yesterday I said that I am determined to have a greater proportion of women Commissioners than has been the case up to now, but a number of women Members have asked me today exactly what my objective is.
I shall tell you what my objective is, but I cannot assume sole responsibility for it, because it also depends on national governments.
That is where you can help me with some of your governments, particularly those that have not yet taken a decision about the name of the Commissioner they wish to propose to me.
My objective is that one third of the Commissioners working with me should be women.
That is my objective, and I shall fight to achieve it, I shall do my utmost to realise it.
I cannot guarantee that I shall succeed, but I can assure you that I am committed to achieving that outcome.
Some of the most frequently asked questions were about economic and social issues, and in particular the issue of social cohesion and the Lisbon agenda.
Members who asked me questions on these issues included MrÂ Schultz, MrÂ Poignon, MrÂ AntÃ³nio Costa, MrÂ ItÃ€lÃ€, MrsÂ Figueiredo, MrÂ Titley, MrÂ Rasmussen, MrÂ Rosati, MrÂ Paasilina and MrÂ HÃ¶kmark.
Let me repeat, ladies and gentlemen, that you should not believe the caricatures of my political profile that you sometimes come across.
I believe that it is possible to combine a social vision with a reforming agenda in relation to markets that would make Europe one of the most competitive areas in the world, if not the most competitive.
I do not deny that it is very difficult, but we need to work in that direction.
We cannot cast aside the European social model for the sake of competitiveness.
That is why I see the Lisbon agenda as an economic agenda, an agenda for competitiveness, but also a social agenda and an agenda for environmental protection.
We need to do more to increase competition and the internal market, and to make a technological leap forward and increase productivity, we need to invest in education and human resources and to seek clean technologies.
Yet at the same time we have to choose one priority and that priority must be growth and employment.
That must clearly be our priority and we will have an opportunity to define it in the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda that is being prepared by former Prime Minister Wim Kok.
I hope that we will try to make growth and job creation our priorities, because those are the factors that can genuinely guarantee the social agenda.
But we can only create jobs if we have economic growth, that is the issue, and we therefore need to step up Europe's productivity and competitiveness in order to create jobs, because that is what our fellow citizens are most concerned about.
That is also why, when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact, an issue already raised with me today by MrÂ Rasmussen, MrÂ Rossati, MrsÂ DeÂ Vits and many others, I said and can repeat this: it does not seem sensible to me to consider revising the Treaty that created the Stability and Growth Pact, we really are not going to do that.
What we can do, and there are already some ideas floating around about this, is to look for flexible interpretations without undermining the essential principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, so that it does not interfere with our assumptions about growth.
That is the direction I wish to go in.
As regards the Financial Perspectives, particularly in relation to the new Member States, I would like to reply to the questions asked by Members including MrsÂ Vaidere, MrsÂ KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, MrÂ RouÄek and MrÂ Pahor.
Especially for the new Member States, I regard this as a priority, as the new Member States need the cohesion and solidarity of the European Union just as some of us, including my own country, have benefited from that solidarity.
It is not a zero sum game, a game in which what some gain others lose.
The help we can give to the new Member States is good for Europe, and what is good for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Baltic states, for Slovakia or Slovenia is good for Europe as a whole.
I am convinced that growth in these countries will make an important contribution to the overall growth of the European Union and for that reason I intend to advocate ambitious Financial Perspectives.
Building on the foundations laid by the Prodi Commission, I will advocate such Financial Perspectives, and this is another area where I need your help in winning over those members of the Council who have not yet been convinced of the importance of the solidarity and cohesion policy.
Turning to the question of media pluralism, an issue which MrsÂ Napoletano raised yesterday and MrsÂ Gruber today, this is a very important subject which goes to the heart of our democracy and the issue of Europe's cultural diversity.
The Commission has already considered this subject, notably in its Green Paper in the mid-nineties.
Media pluralism is a principle that is clearly recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and which is now enshrined in the Constitution itself.
Your questions relate to a Commission initiative.
We need to be sure that there is an EU legal basis for the Commission to legislate in this area.
There are questions that still need to be clarified.
We should not underestimate the difficulties associated with this subject, although I would like to make it absolutely clear that I personally am in favour of respect across the board for the principles of pluralism of information.
I also understand the sensitivity and concerns surrounding the subject of GMOs â genetically modified organisms.
Precisely because this is such a sensitive subject, the Union has established a comprehensive regulatory framework for GMOs so as to ensure a scientifically based system suitable for dealing with all these issues.
I am convinced that this system should now be applied with firmness and determination, because our credibility is at stake here.
The time has come to demonstrate to Europe's citizens and to our trading partners that the European authorisation system is working as it was intended to.
The truth is that this system is the most advanced in the world, and we cannot therefore afford to sacrifice our credibility here.
I of course want this system to be implemented and I wish to assure this House that if I am at its helm, the Commission will attach the greatest importance to this matter, which warrants the efforts being made in connection with it.
In conclusion, I would like to deal with the questions about the very concept of the European Union that so many Members have put to me.
I cannot of course support those who would like to abolish the Commission and to do away with the European Union altogether.
But I would ask for the support of all those who wish to carry the European project forward, and I shall take the liberty at this point of taking issue with those Members who said that as my views fall into one particular part of the political spectrum and theirs into another, they intend to vote against me.
Frankly, I do not consider that to be reasonable, because if you behave that way there would never be a stable majority in this House, and it would always be impossible to choose a President of the Commission.
By the same token, I cannot agree with those Members who say they are not voting against me personally, but against me as the Council's candidate.
Fine, then you might as well say that there would never be a President of the Commission under the current rules.
We are a Union of states and of citizens.
I do not regard the two as incompatible, and this is my reply to MrsÂ Ludford and also to the honourable Member who spoke just now about my convictions: there is no incompatibility between having a grand vision and strong convictions on the one hand, and on the other hand acting pragmatically as to how they should be implemented, and that is my position.
I have strong non-negotiable convictions, particularly when it comes to freedom and the rule of law.
I believe that the war against terrorism should be waged without infringing our fundamental freedoms.
Security yes, but not an obsession with security.
I am in favour of freedom, which I see as essential.
I have clearly stated my values: freedom, respect for human rights, the rule of law, equal opportunities and solidarity.
I regard those values as non-negotiable and my position is absolutely unambiguous.
But as President of the Commission, I shall certainly seek compromises, because I am not here just as a representative of one political family, and I am convinced that the President of the Commission should work with the PPE family, with the Liberals and Democrats, with the Socialists and with other Members in various groups who essentially agree on making progress with the European project.
Without compromise, Europe will not move forward, ladies and gentlemen.
This does not betoken a lack of conviction, it means that I am convinced of the virtues of pluralism, of compromise and of the Community method.
We have a grand vision for Europe, let there be no doubt.
We have deeply-rooted convictions but we intend to realise them in a pragmatic way.
That is why, returning to the image MrÂ Watson used yesterday, and which I have already used myself, the image of an aircraft with no one in the cockpit, I believe that the European Union cannot function on automatic pilot.
There is no modern aviation system that holds the secret to doing that.
In order to function, the European Union needs political leadership.
It functions on the basis of political courage and I can promise you that I shall endeavour to exercise that political leadership not in a party political way, but by seeking a dynamic consensus, because I believe that the Commission can indeed be the pilot of the European Union, which is in a decisive phase of its history with the conclusion of the enlargement of the EU, thus demonstrating our solidarity and looking forward to peace, prosperity, security and solidarity, not just within our own continent but also beyond it.
To conclude, that is why I am asking you for your support, because if I receive your endorsement I shall, as President of the Commission, be seeking to unite all of Europe, from the Mediterranean to the Baltic, from the founding members of the European Union to those who have just joined, from the richest countries to the poorest, from the largest countries to the smallest, and I shall try not just to be the honest broker that is needed between the institutions, but also to be a unifying force to advance our European project.
I know that many people are pessimistic about Europe, but, ladies and gentlemen, we need to have a sense of time.
What was Europe like 50 years ago?
What has it become today?
What was Europe like just a few years ago when it was divided by the Berlin Wall and the Baltic countries were occupied by another power, when freedom did not exist across a large part of our continent, and what is it like now?
We are better placed today than we were 50 years ago.
My desire is that in another 50 years' time we will be in a far better position than we are today.
That is what I propose to achieve, with your help and your solidarity.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
The sitting is suspended so that the political groups can meet.
Â Â  . â The unanimous nomination of the conservative prime minister of Portugal, Mr Barroso, both by the conservative and the 'socialist' leaders of the Member States of the European Union, for the office of President of the European Commission, did not come out of nowhere, nor did it surprise the Communist Party of Greece.
It marks:
reconciliation between the EU and the US, the closure of any differences which they had about the spoils from the intervention in Iraq, the restoration in the eyes of the people of the dirty imperialist war and more intensive participation of the part of the EU in the plans and interventions required by the 'new order';
the speedier application of the anti-grass roots measures ordered by the unifying monopolies (sweeping privatisations, the destruction of any remaining pay, pension, health, education, welfare, employment rights and so on); and
the imposition on the peoples of the ÎU of the misleadingly named European Constitution, which will also safeguard the militaristic, autocratic and anti-labour character of the ÎU institutionally.
The Communist Party of Greece will throw all its weight behind the struggles of both the Greek and the other peoples of the ÎU, in order to overturn the anti-grass roots policies which the election of the new President of the European Commission marks.
Thousands of workers in Greece are being made redundant with the go-ahead of the ÎU and the governments which support it.
That is why the Communist Party of Greece voted against Mr JosÃ© Manuel Barroso.

Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to table a motion on a point of order.
The European Parliament has a Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
A well-known Italian daily and the British newspapers today are reporting a statement by our fellow Member Godfrey Bloom according to which we women can cook but we do not clean behind the refrigerator.
I must point out that there are women who fight and are killed for their rights, women who are hidden under burkas, and women in the European Union who still do not get equal treatment in the economy.
I know the British have a sense of humour about themselves, but I am from Naples and I can say that we women do know how to cook and clean the refrigerator and even be politicians, while perhaps Godfrey Bloom does not know either how to clean the refrigerator or how to be a politician.
Â Â  I thank Mrs Mussolini for her defence of womenâs rights, but I would like to point out that that was not a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a short statement.
My comments have been misrepresented in the press.
I would particularly like to say that it is my first visit here and it is disgraceful that something so undemocratic can take place: somebody has misquoted from the press with no prior engagement with me and no prior notice.
Mrs Mussolini has not even had the courtesy to come to see me about what was purportedly written in the English press.
Â Â  The next item is the vote on the Conference of Presidentsâ proposals â Appointments to committees.
The Conference of Presidentsâ proposals are approved.
Â Â  My remarks do not relate to the Rules of Procedure as such, but to the situation that arose yesterday evening.
I have been asked by the leader of the Czech delegation within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE/DE) to point out that three members of this group, including two women, my colleagues in the Czech delegation, were not appointed to any committees.
The three people concerned are: Mrs Jana HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡, Mrs Nina Å kottovÃ¡ and Mr Rihards Piks.
I find the whole matter scandalous and I should like to ask the leaders of all factions to rectify this situation as quickly as possible, so that we do not have to wait until September or even longer.
Â Â  All Members have the right to join a committee.
This right must be strictly respected.
It falls to the political groups to make proposals to guarantee this right.
If the situation is as you describe and there are Members of this Parliament who have not been included in any committee, I would ask the leaders of the political groups â and in particular the President of the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to which these Members belong â to produce a proposal as soon as possible to re-allocate posts guaranteeing that all Members can join a committee.
We shall resolve this problem as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the great responsibility of deciding who is to be the President of the European Commission.
Our group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, welcomes the unanimous proposal by the Council that JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso be appointed President of the European Commission.
Our group also welcomes the Councilâs decision, also unanimous, to re-appoint Javier Solana to the position of High Representative, in which position he has done good work, and, in two and a half years, by which time it is to be hoped that the Constitution will have entered into force, to make him the European Unionâs Minister for Foreign Affairs.
He will then need our support and our trust, and we welcome this decision too.
Those of us who have had the privilege of working with JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso in the past â and I am one of them â can say unequivocally that he possesses the qualifications for the task of President of the European Commission.
Even if you have not yet come to this conclusion, I have to tell you for my own part that that way he presented himself to the groups â all of them â yesterday and this morning here in the European Parliament, very definitely convinced me that Mr Barroso is the right person and suited to the office of President of the European Commission.
Nor have I ever heard anyone in this Chamber question his suitability as a person.
He knows what he is talking about, he is competent, and he can also communicate his convictions, something that is important to the European Union.
I have also been impressed by his desire for close cooperation with Parliament, and what our expression of confidence in him today signifies is that, once he has taken up office we will follow him critically â but, of course, in a positive way â but we in this House will exercise control over the Commission.
The candidate has presented himself as a bridge-builder and as an honest broker, thus demonstrating his desire to help achieve consensus.
This European continent is so complex that neither one side nor the other can take decisions alone, rule alone, or cause its will to prevail.
Europe has a future only if we, together, take the road of consensus and compromise.
That is what JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso is willing to do, and that is another reason why we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of one mind in believing that we should entrust him with the task and the responsibility that go with the office of President of the European Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to preface my remarks by saying this to Mr Barroso: we have had extensive discussions with you and have come to know you as someone whose personal integrity is beyond question.
I am here to present a decision, and it is one with which we have had difficulty.
Our group has listened to you; yesterday and this morning we have put to you further questions in which we have set out our thinking about Europeâs future and the President of the Commissionâs role in it.
We listened to your answers and have discussed them, and the answers you gave today, in our group meeting this morning.
In the hearings, in my speech yesterday, and this morning too, we have put four crucial questions, to which we expect answers. Now we have to provide our own answers to them.
Is JosÃ© DurÃ£o Barroso the candidate who will strengthen the Commission, as an institution, in its relations with the Council, with the Heads of State or Government, with the other institutions?
Secondly, is he the candidate to pursue a sustainable environmental policy, a sustainable economic policy, on the basis of fairness in world trade?
Is he â and this was the third question â the candidate for whom we Social Democrats will be able to vote, because he, as President of the Commission, will contend for social cohesion as primary need for our society, something that is a crucial element in Socialist policy in Europe?
We have asked ourselves these three questions, and I will say something about the fourth at the end of my speech.
To these three questions, our group has answered, âNoâ.
The fourth question was...
... whether JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso is a candidate who can cause Europeâs values, first of all the values of multilateralism, in the face of a unilateralism motivated by self-interest.
Mr Barroso, what I want to say to you on a personal level is this: if I had heard from your lips, even if only as an indication: âIf the information I possess today had been available to me a year ago, I would perhaps have taken a different decision with regard to the war in Iraq.â
Even if you had only alluded to this ...
... and only once, my decision would have been easier, but on this point you have been intransigent.
So, we return to the question of whether you are the man to, for example, make the EU the equal of other great powers, whether they be economic or political, and you have yet to provide us with evidence that you are.
For most of us, you are still one of those who organised the Azores summit.
Today, a number of Members belonging to my group will, for the most diverse reasons, express their confidence in you.
Let me make it quite clear, Mr Barroso, that the way in which these people have politicised your election has done you more harm than good.
Those members of our group who will express their confidence in you enjoy the groupâs solidarity and respect, but the Socialist Group in the European Parliament cannot, today, give you a vote of confidence.
I am sorry to have to say that but, should you win, you may well gain our confidence in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, as our new House has taken on a Teutonic style, I will offer a few words in the language of Goethe.
Let me put a question.
For Godâs sake, Mr Poettering, what have you done now?
The European Peopleâs Party members have cast their votes for Mr Borrell, and now the Social Democrats are voting against your candidate for the Commission.
Unreliable partner!
You know, Hans-Gert, it would not have been so bad while Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo was there.
The trouble is that, in those days of lovely warm weather after 13 June, when Enrique went down to the beach he found Martin Schulz's towel on his deck chair!
If my group votes for Mr Barroso today, it is not to bail you out of your misery.
You have made your bed â now you have to lie in it.
When my group decides â whether for Mr Geremek or for Mr Barroso â we vote for Europe.
Mr President-designate of the Commission, in today's vote for your nomination as next President of the Commission you will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of Liberals and Democrats in this House. Your performance in yesterday's debate was assured.
You heard this House out. You stood there.
You answered our questions. I believe that you understand that, as President of the Commission, your most important partner will be the European Parliament and I cannot understate the importance of your continued respect for our prerogatives, your candour in the face of our questions, and your presence on the floor of this House.
You have started, I trust, as you intend to go on.
Liberals and Democrats asked for clear assurances in three areas: super-Commissioners, gender balance and transparency.
Yesterday you delivered these.
Should you be given the opportunity today to assemble a Commission, we will be standing ready to hold you to those commitments in November and throughout your term.
I say that not as a threat, but as a challenge.
You have chosen an ambitious path and the right path.
Hold to it and you will have our backing.
Having earned our support you can now expect a critical friend in the alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
You have won our backing with your vision for an ambitious and independent European executive.
You understand that the Union is not a club of nation states with a few curious federal habits, but a genuine political union and that the Commission's role is to speak for that Union.
A strong and independent Commission needs a strong mandate and a strong and productive relationship with the European Parliament.
By giving you our support constructively and clearly today, Liberals and Democrats are sending a clear signal that this is the Europe we want.
Â Â  â Today, Mr Barroso, let me adopt a different tone to yesterdayâs.
The past we share, the time â thirty years ago â that we sang together, oblige me to be frank and perfectly straightforward with you.
In this Parliament, the Left has a problem: it is characterised by ideological decay, a problem as acute among the Greens as it is among the rest.
The Right has a problem: it is characterised by authoritarianism, a moralistic approach, and neo-liberalism.
At the end of the day, life is complicated and love means telling the truth.
I love you.
Mr Barroso, you declare yourself to be a man of the centre and a reformist.
Now the problem with the centre is that they are opportunists.
That, Mr Barroso, is why my group cannot have any confidence in your appointment.
The fact is that, when you are with some, you are in favour of sustainable development, with others, you are in favour of the market, with others still, you favour the social dimension; when you meet God, you are in favour of God, and when you meet with secularists, you are against God being mentioned in the European Constitution.
Mr Barroso, I am sure you are capable of being a good President of the Commission.
The problem is precisely as described by Mr Schulz, who was, for once, speaking with great clarity.
If, for one moment during all your speeches, you had found it in you to show us some small change of heart; if you had said: âYes, it is true that I took that decision, but it was a difficult one.
In view of what is going on in Iraq, I feel rather ashamed, two years further on, of having been in the Azores, arm in arm with George Bushâ; if, at any time, you had told us that, in view of what is currently going on in your own countryâs society following your reforms, you were questioning the way in which you had carried out those reforms; and if, at any time, we had been able to feel that you could see what our problems were, we would have been able to say: âHe knows how to communicate and how to change; we have to give him a chanceâ.
As, however, you have at no time been capable of such doubt, which is itself the most intelligent form of European philosophy, Mr Barroso, the Group of the Greens, acting in a frank, honest and clear manner, will not be voting for you today.
If you are elected, I will cheer you, and if you are not, I will advise you to make Socrates your holiday reading.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may strike a more serious note, I simply want to confirm that my group, that of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, will not be voting for Mr Barroso as a candidate.
We are not opposing any one person, but political tendencies, not only MrÂ Barrosoâs and the Councilâs, but also those of the Commission and of the majority in this House.
This is a protest vote by the Left, aimed at the liberal model and also, in our present situation, at what I shall describe as the âAzores modelâ.
It strikes us as healthy, and indeed vital, that such objections should be openly expressed, which does not exclude the possibility of mutual respect or even, if need be, the expression of convergent views over and above political divisions.
In any case, this is what we will be doing during this Parliament, as we did during that which preceded it.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to be able to speak this morning on behalf of this new Independence and Democracy Group, the fastest growing group in the European Parliament, which I believe reflects public opinion across the European continent.
Let us remember what we are talking about here.
We are talking about a European Commission and a President of the European Commission.
I would suggest that the super-bureaucrat, Jean Monnet, is resting very easily in his grave because the Commission model that he wanted is here. If we have the Constitution, it is here to stay.
You see, Mr Monnet hated parliamentary democracy; he found it inconvenient; it got in the way of an administrator's plan for the next five, ten or fifteen years and he wanted to have a strong European Commission.
What we have today is a European Union that is effectively ruled by unelected bureaucrats based in Brussels, issuing directives and regulations with which this House can do nothing other than tamper.
Just look at the Commission!
It has become a rest home for failed domestic politicians.
When people have to resign from cabinet or if, like Chris Patten, they lose their seat in an election, they are packed off for five or ten years at the European Commission â a Commission that has proved itself to be unreformable.
Do you remember that they all resigned in disgrace in 1999?
We were told that it was all going to change, it was all going to be made better.
Mr Prodi took over for five years, with Mr Kinnock at his side, and what did we see?
We saw the Eurostat scandal.
Have we really seen an increase in transparency?
The answer is 'no', and so bureaucratic and bad is it that now we have over 3Â 000 working groups and committees within this bureaucratic monster.
Mr Barroso came to meet our group â which was quite brave of him in many ways.
He is politically skilled, he is a good operator and a good communicator.
He is certainly much better at all of those things than Mr Prodi was.
Mark you, that would not be very difficult, would it?
But he believes in a political Europe.
He supports the European Constitution: a constitution that is bad for democracy; a constitution that establishes this place as a new legal entity; a constitution whose withdrawal terms are so unacceptable as to make the EU a prison of nations.
My group will overwhelmingly vote against Mr Barroso and we urge anybody in this House that wants to stop the European Constitution to use this opportunity today to send a message.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to join in this debate on the candidature of the President-designate, Mr Barroso.
When I listen to the speeches in this House I am always amazed at the differences in ideologies and backgrounds.
However, it is at critical times like these that I recognise how hung up we all are with ideology and sentiments more suited to the 19th and early 20th centuries, rather than the 21st century.
We have the great privilege in this House to be the representatives of the people of Europe.
We have a duty to take real decisions on their behalf, not on the altar of any ideology but according to what we believe is in the best interests of the people of Europe.
We have a duty to ensure that we cooperate and coordinate with other representatives of the peoples of Europe.
The closest we can get to that are governments.
The 25 sovereign governments in their wisdom have given their support to Mr Barroso and, if for no other reason, that is enough for me to give him my support.
On top of that, there is the fact that Mr Barroso came to us as the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe to put his case in each of our groups.
Whilst Members may criticise his political skills or his unwillingness to give them the answers to the questions they wanted, at least give him recognition for the courtesy of coming to us.
He set out a political stall where he could; he did not answer questions he was unable to answer.
I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as: will this person get this Commission post?
He replied that he could not discuss that because he was not yet the President and he did not know who the other nominees were going to be.
I admire a man who is willing to say that he may have made mistakes in the past but now we are moving forward.
In his submissions and hearings with our group he spoke about his role as an honest broker.
We need an honest broker to operate within the European Union because, despite what the ideologists may think, the European Union is not the model of something else.
Its institutions are not imitations: they are unique institutions reflecting unique arrangements of Member States, intergovernmentalism, cooperation, coordination and â despite what some colleagues may say â democracy.
I would love to have somebody at the head of that Union who is and was a politician, who was part of different ideologies, who recognised the errors of his ways in his youth, who came forward and changed those ways to reflect what was most needed.
It is not a left or right divide, it is not that the left is wrong and the right is correct or vice versa, it is about taking what is best from all ideologies to ensure we can deliver for all the people.
It is not Boston versus Berlin, it is ensuring that we do what is right for all the people in Europe in the 21st century.
We stand today at a new frontier, the dawn of a new era, when the old visions of Europe have been broken down, when countries that were denied the opportunities to have democracy and representation are being given that opportunity now.
It does not bode well that we take the opportunity to play politics at this juncture.
My group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and I will be giving our full support to Mr Barroso's nomination and we hope other Members will do so well.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the non-attached Members who are on the European Right, let me say that I do not reproach you for the revolutionary past that you share with Mr Cohn-Bendit, for his example shows that one can have a revolutionary past of this sort and nonetheless be, today, an outstanding supporter of the system.
I will limit myself to considering whether you are the right person, in the right place, at the right moment.
As the European system gives it considerable power to initiate legislation and implement policies, the Commission in Brussels has acquired, by means of the Treaties, the right to govern an ever greater part of the lives of 400 million Europeans, and it is to this development that we object.
The problem we have is that of knowing whether you should be a means by which we express that objection.
Your actions as Prime Minister, and hence also as a member of the EUâs Council, have also shown us that, in economic and monetary matters, you have been so convinced a European that you kept very strictly to the Stability Pact and its principles.
I might add that you also praised it at a time when Mr Prodi himself â and that is saying something â admitted that it was stupid.
In the answers you gave just now, you were very evasive on the question of whether we should have a position independent of the United States of America, and we well recall the disastrous initiative you took in organising the notorious Azores summit on the eve of the war of aggression against Iraq.
Finally, although you have been very careful and diplomatic in taking the precaution of not saying anything on the subject, you are a forthright advocate of the early commencement of negotiations on the accession of Turkey, which is an honourable country, but not a European one, whether in a geographical, cultural or historical sense.
All this ought to prompt us to vote against you as a candidate.
Being aware, though, of what a courteous and highly cultured man you are and of the well-known presumption of innocence, which is applicable even to the worst of criminals â and you are not one of those yet â some of us prefer to abstain.
If you want me to go further than that, I will make use of the words of your great poet Fernando Pessoa:
"The day after tomorrow, yes, but only the day after tomorrowâŠ I will get up tomorrow and think about the day after tomorrow, and then it will be possible; but today, noâŠ No, nothing today; today I cannot do anything."
Â Â  Before communicating the result of the election of the President-designate of the Commission, we will wait a few minutes for Mr Barroso to arrive.
Â Â  â Mr President, we all know that Mr Barroso has long been familiar with the institutions and their rules.
We also know that he is not arrogant.
It follows that there must be a certain degree of trust here.
As there cannot be a lack of courtesy at work here, there must be a misunderstanding.
Even though I think we can still have confidence in him, it strikes me as impossible that we cannot find out within three minutes where he is in order to dispel the misunderstanding.
That is all.
Â Â  The results of the vote are as follows:
711 votes expressed, 3 void papers, 44 abstentions and blank votes, 664 votes cast, 413 votes in favour and 251 against.
In view of these results, the European Parliament has elected the candidate for President of the Commission proposed by the Council.
I congratulate Mr Barroso and, in accordance with Rule 98(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I shall inform the Council and invite it to propose the candidates for the various posts and members of the Commission in joint agreement with its President-elect.
Â Â  I know that the majority of the Portuguese are very proud today that the next President of the Commission is to be Portuguese.
I would like to say to all my compatriots that I certainly take great pride in being Portuguese.
Mr President, I would like to tell you that I am very honoured to be able now to serve the European Union as President of the Commission.
I am delighted, honoured and proud that the European Parliament has confirmed my appointment.
As I have told you, I see myself as someone who can build bridges.
Left and right is only one dimension in politics. There are others.
On the left and the right there are those who are modernisers and those who are less so. On the left and the right there are pro-Europeans and those who are against the European Union.
We should build a dynamic coalition for Europe.
I will work with all of you.
I am especially grateful to those of you who supported me from the beginning, but I will try to build bridges with all those who did not vote for me this time.
We need this kind of dynamic coalition to push forward our European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to express to you again my profound European convictions.
I am particularly honoured by your support.
I undertake to work for Europe, to respect our heritage and build Europe upon the ideas of prosperity, solidarity and security.
I hope that, both in the Commission and in Parliament, we will be able to maintain the kind of relationship I have called a close, positive relationship â which is important for Europe â while respecting our differences and endeavouring to set above all else our shared vision for Europe.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.(1)
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 22 July 2004.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I have the immensely sad duty â a duty my predecessors have had to carry out on previous occasions â to open our September session by mentioning the terrorist attacks suffered by the world.
Tomorrow, at noon, this Parliament will hold a minuteâs silence as a tribute to the child victims of the horror in Beslan.
In order to give this symbolic gesture a collective dimension, I have, moreover, asked the 25 Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Union to involve all the schools of Europe in our act of commemoration of these victims.
I can inform you that I have already been notified by several governments that they will do so.
Furthermore, at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning when I speak briefly to introduce our work for this term of office, I wish to analyse the scourge of terrorism from a political standpoint, pointing out the insecurity it causes amongst our fellow citizens and how we should respond to it.
We cannot, however, begin our work on 13 September without paying tribute, through the minuteâs silence we will hold tomorrow, to all the victims of all the terrorist attacks that have brought bloodshed to many parts of the world, as well as to all the victims of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid, to name just the most recent and spectacular cases.
In Iraq, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Indonesia and in Afghanistan, many human beings have fallen victim to the insanity of those people who wish to impose their vision of the world through terror.
I have responded to each of these events on your behalf, ladies and gentlemen, expressing our solidarity with the victims and their families.
I cannot end without once again calling on the kidnappers of the two NGO workers kidnapped in Iraq, two Italian women who as a result of their humanitarian commitment, working to care for Iraqi children, have fallen victim to a kidnap, as have the two French journalists who were working to carry out their duty, which is to inform all of us of what is happening there.
Finally, to add to this sad list of painful events, I would like us, moreover, also to commemorate somebody who has been the victim not of a terrorist attack, but of a tragic accident: the Orthodox Patriarch Petros VII who, as you are aware, has been killed along with 16 other people in a tragic helicopter accident.
Our thoughts and our tributes are also for him.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, while the House will very much agree with the words you have just spoken and while we are all utterly appalled at the events which took place in Beslan, I must draw the attention of the House to another matter.
Last month the regime in Iran hanged a 16-year-old girl.
Â Â  Mr Stevenson, you will have the opportunity to speak at the appropriate time, when you are given the floor, during the appropriate debate, when all Members may speak for one minute.
Now is not the moment to do so.(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I must now touch upon an issue which affects thousands of Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Hungarians and citizens of the other new Member States who have recently worked legally in NorthernÂ Ireland.
Whereas on the one hand they have met with the hospitality of the citizens of that country, on the other they have experienced ruthless exploitation by the large German and international retail chain Lidl.
This company has deliberately not paid its employees the money owing to them, either in full â I have statements that this has occurred â or in part.
The payment of wages to these foreign workers has frequently been delayed, and there have been problems with cashing cheques issued by the company.
The retail chain Lidl does this deliberately, as these people, who are mainly young, have to return to their own countries after the holidays, and will not be in a position to claim the money owing to them.
This smacks of nineteenth century capitalism.
I therefore ask you, Mr President, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to take action in this matter to ensure that this company does not become another example of the division of Europe into a superior West and an inferior East, and to ensure that Europe does not become associated with exploitation.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to what I term a silent invasion of Europe by an alien species, , otherwise known as the American grey squirrel.
In the UK and Ireland this little creature has been responsible for devastating woodlands as well as driving out the indigenous European red squirrel â â from many areas.
This is not just an Irish or a British problem: the grey squirrel has established a firm foothold in Italy and is spreading rapidly northwards across our continent towards France, Germany and Austria, and it is bringing devastation in its wake.
I jest not.
I know in the major scheme of things this might seem like a detail, but we have a responsibility.
The red squirrel â our European native squirrel â is now under threat through competition from a larger, more robust rival and through the destruction of its natural habitat, our deciduous woodland environment.
In spite of the rapid advance of the grey squirrel, our Commission has not carried out comprehensive research to map or to control the spread of this species.
The Commission is meant to be putting together a policy on invasive alien species, but so far we have seen no sign of it.
When can we in Parliament expect to receive its draft proposals for a legislative framework?
Immediate concerted action at a European level is needed to reclaim our natural woodlands for the red squirrel before it is too late.
Â Â  â Mr President, following the perfectly successful organisation of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, my country, Greece, will host the greatest sporting event in the world for people with disabilities, the Paralympic Games, from 17 to 28 September, to be attended by 145 countries, 4Â 000 athletes, 2Â 000 assistants and 3Â 000 members of the press are to attend.
For the first time in history, we have the same organising committee for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games, resulting in accurate planning and savings.
Similarly, for the first time in the history of the Paralympic Games, the Greek Government decided some time ago to contribute the sum of EUR 55.8Â million, thereby exempting every country, rich and poor alike, from the need to pay the fee required in order for their athletes to participate.
Even before the first Paralympic Games were held in 1960, they were distinguished ...
Â Â  I am sorry, Mrs Tzampazi, but I must restrict your speaking time despite your interesting comments.
Â Â  â Mr President, I certainly do not often speak on behalf of farmers, but my region in the northeast of England has suffered the worst weather and the worst harvest in 40 years.
At a meeting there last week, farmers merely asked that the arable area payments that they are entitled to be made somewhat earlier.
Contrary to some popular conception in the UK, farmers in Yorkshire are certainly not whingers.
They just want a reasonable payment, made more quickly and on a regional basis.
It is a restrained request.
I hope that this Parliament will push the Commission to be sympathetic when the British Government requests it in due course.
Â Â  â Mr President, when you took up the role of President of this Parliament in July, you named an open and visible European Parliament as one of your key issues, and the Dutch Labour Party delegation wholeheartedly supports you in this.
In fact, we have a practical suggestion to make as to how this first step may be taken.
For a number of years now, members of the European public have not been able to simply stroll into the meetings that are public.
Since security measures have been stepped up, understandably so, Parliament is no longer freely accessible.
This has, of course, meant that the gap between the public and the politicians has become problematic and wider.
One of the solutions would be to transmit the meetings via Parliamentâs website.
This already happens with the plenary meetings, and this could simply be extended to include the meetings of the different parliamentary committees.
It would enable the citizens in all Member States to follow our work in the committees in an effective, inexpensive and democratic manner.
Today, our delegation will be submitting a proposal to you for making this openness a priority for your Presidential term.
Mrs Corbey, in particular, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has passed you something you can pick up and run with; today, we, on behalf of all our fellow MEPs, are counting on your support for this proposal, and that is how, via the website, we can bring the European citizen closer to our work in the committees.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the situation in the Caribbean and Florida with regard to the terrible destruction being wrought by Hurricane Ivan and indeed by the two previous hurricanes, Charlie and Francis.
Firstly I want us to express our condolences to and solidarity with all those who have suffered bereavement, injury and loss.
As MEP for London, I am conscious that many of my constituents originating from places like Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands have families there who have been affected.
Secondly, I want to urge a generous response from the EU and Member States for humanitarian aid to the countries and communities that have been devastated.
I hope that the rapid response mechanism of ECHO can be invoked.
Lastly, conscious that we next have on the agenda a Commission statement on recent environmental disasters in southern Europe, I want to insist on the likely connection between this terrible season for Caribbean hurricanes, typhoons in the South China Sea and indeed the wettest summer in Britain for 40 years, and the effects of climate change and global warming.
One could also mention the devastating floods in Bangladesh in July.
We must all make this a top priority, including the new US Administration.
We in the West must curb our profligate use of energy because it is the poor in the south and east and even hard-pressed European farmers who suffer if we do not.
Â Â  Mr President, on the Northern Ireland Peace II agreement, as you are probably aware, the Council has asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for an extension of this programme for a further two years from 2004 to 2006.
This has been one of the most important EU supports for the peace process in Northern Ireland.
It has had to bed down the peace process and make it worthwhile for people to abandon their support for paramilitary organisations and to engage in constructive and proactive work, both north and south, across the border and in border areas.
I would ask you to urge the Commission to come forward as a matter of urgency with those proposals because they need to be brought forward before the end of this year.
I do this also at a time when a renegotiation process of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement gets under way this week in Britain, sponsored by the Irish and British Governments, which involves all of the parties there in an attempt to get this process back on its feet.
As you know, the Assembly has been shut down for some time, so it is even more important that a clear signal is given that this programme will continue.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like us to take this opportunity in plenary to express our deepest regret and mourning at the loss of Petros, Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa who, together with the seventeen members of his mission and the crew, died in a tragic aviation accident last Saturday, the accident which you too referred to, for which I thank you.
We should mention that the late Patriarch was indeed a young and inspired Patriarch and his loss will be keenly felt.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to flag up a serious threat to civil liberties, the environment and animal welfare in the United Kingdom.
Next Wednesday the British Government proposes to introduce a new law on hunting which will aim to criminalise some of the most decent, law-abiding and responsible people in the UK.
In order to pass its law, the Government will be forced to use a constitutional sledgehammer called the Parliament Act, which was not designed for this sort of purpose and, in the view of many constitutional lawyers, will be improperly used in this way.
We in this House respect human rights and cultural diversity.
The proposed new law is a serious assault on both.
All who value civil liberties, rural values and animal welfare should speak out against this unjust and oppressive measure.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to the points with which the sitting opened.
The Italian delegation of the Union for the Europe of Nations Group suggests that the Members of this Parliament make a one-off contribution corresponding to a dayâs allowance as a donation to the International Red Cross, symbolically set aside for reconstruction of the school in Beslan.
I also think it right that this Parliament, sitting in plenary session, in addition to the resolute condemnation of all terrorist acts and the words spoken at the start of the sitting, send a message of solidarity and fellow-feeling to the families of the civilian hostages held in Iraq, in particular the two French journalists and the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, in the hope that all those taken hostage can return home safe and sound.
Â Â  â I should like, at this point, to bring to the attention of the Members of this House and to your attention, Mr President, the reality of relocations by multinationals.
Last year, following the relocation of the multinational C[amp]J Clark, in Portugal, which had laid off hundreds and hundreds of workers in Castelo de Paiva and previously in Arouca, Parliament passed a resolution on companies that received financial support, as in this case, and then relocated.
They and the Commission are thus responsible for a range of measures that must be taken to put an end to this practice and defend the rights of the workers and regions affected.
Moreover, where companies fail to meet their obligations they can be asked to return any Community funds awarded.
What is, in fact, happening is that right now the very same multinational, C[amp]J Clark, a British firm, is relocating its last factory in Portugal â , in Vila Nova de Gaia â laying off several hundred more workers.
I should like to ask you, Mr President, to urge the Commission to comply with Parliamentâs resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to return to the issue of hostages taken in Iraq.
Needless to say, I join in the condemnations that you expressed, but is there nothing else we could do?
More than 300 people in this House have signed a petition for the release, which is indeed a very good thing, and this international pressure, including this petition â for there have, of course, been other initiatives â has already resulted in an internal debate among the radical movements in Iraq.
This is, in actual fact, an unexpected result and quite something.
There are now guilty innocents and innocent innocents.
I should like to go one step further: it goes without saying that hostage taking as a method should simply be done away with.
Could this Parliament not send a letter to all national parliaments of our 25 Member States and urge them to submit a similar petition, a similar appeal as democratically elected bodies, symbols of respect for the individual, to call for the immediate release of all hostages in Iraq?
Â Â  â Mr President, at the start of today's sitting, the European Parliament adopted your proposal that plenary observe one minute's silence tomorrow for the victims of Beslan.
The fact that we have not heard a word about the children of Palestine or the children of Iraq is truly surprising.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the same time, the government of Arial Sharon is stepping up its murderous assaults, with the Israeli army making incursions into the Gaza Strip on land and from the air, killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians.
They are destroying homes and infrastructure.
The expressions by the international community in response to these murderous attacks by the Israeli army are hypocritical and are completely futile, in that they are not accompanied by measures to make Israel stop the genocide of the Palestinian people and tear down the wall of shame.
On the contrary, likening the perpetrator to the victims and calling murder the right of defence both exonerates and encourages the Israeli Government.
We consider that practical political and other measures should be taken immediately in order to force the Israeli Government to stop the slaughter of the Palestinians and create the preconditions to an independent Palestine.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Toussas, you may rest assured that when we hold a minuteâs silence tomorrow we will be thinking of all the child victims of terrorism from anywhere in the world.
Â Â  â Mr President, last month in the city of Neka in Iran a 16Â year-old girl accused of offences against chastity was publicly hanged from a crane.
After sentencing her to death, the judge said that she had undressed in the court because she took her veil off.
He insisted upon placing the rope around her neck himself.
There are three more children aged 16 currently under sentence of death in Iran.
The regime is waiting until they are 18 to carry out public executions.
This is the utmost act of barbarism by a mullah regime that is taking the cultured and civilised people of Iran back to the stone ages.
It has executed 120 000 people since it came to power.
I hope that on behalf of all the Members of this House, Mr President, you will express our outrage to the Iranian ambassador to the EU.
The execution of children, and indeed the death penalty, is something that we will not tolerate.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday and the day before yesterday, around a thousand illegal immigrants landed on the isle of Lampedusa, in just two nights.
Mr President, thinking also of the hygiene and health situation and the humanitarian conditions of these journeys, I ask you if it would not be appropriate for a European Parliament delegation â perhaps even with your own distinguished presence â to visit Lampedusa to see this situation, which is now a distressing emergency from a humanitarian point of view as well.
Italy is taking action which is producing some initial results, but the European Union must put great pressure on the countries of origin and transit, because Europe cannot tolerate this depraved traffic in human beings.
I ask that the European Parliament be present at an international colloquium to be held by a non-governmental organisation in Lampedusa.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the disturbing news coming from the southeast border of the European Union, from the region of Serbia commonly known as Vojvodina.
In recent weeks and months this summer, there has been news of growing ethnic tensions and attacks on and harassment of Hungarian nationals, including attacks on cemeteries, anti-Hungarian inscriptions and the burning of the Hungarian national flag.
I would like to draw the attention of this House to how important it is to stabilize the situation in the Balkans.
Europe has been doing a great deal to stop violence and ethnic cleansing in this region.
The Serbian authorities are not reacting quickly enough to this situation and showing themselves to be ignorant or negligent in many ways.
It is the responsibility of all democrats who care about the security of our common Europe, and also those who care about minority rights and human rights, to bring pressure to bear on the Serbian authorities in regard to this very important and highly dangerous situation.
Â Â  â Mr President, of course everything we have heard is extremely important.
The events which took place a few days ago as the curtain came down on the Olympic Games in Athens are also important, events which were crowned with huge success.
Today I revert to a matter which concerns all of us, the matter of doping, that scourge of athleticism which, of course, concerns young people the world over.
That is why I would propose that a resolution against doping be passed on the basis of the amendment we intend to table, setting out the measures which the European Union and all of us need to take in order to combat this scourge.
Â Â  Mr President, shortly before the summer break the Supreme Court of Indonesia finally acquitted all those military officers indicted for the unlawful killing of civilians in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor during the run-up to Timorese independence when there were attempts to derail the UN-led independence process.
I deeply regret this and, as this House followed East Timor's independence struggle closely, many will join me in protest at the fact that nobody is going to be punished for these massacres.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to respond to the first speaker, who indicated that he had difficulties in respect of the exploitation of young seasonal workers in Northern Ireland, the constituency that I represent.
I very much regret that and I have already assured him that I will use my offices to try to resolve that difficulty.
I now want to congratulate the Greek authorities on the excellent Olympic Games and to express my disgust at the suggestion of the outgoing President of the Commission that in future games the European Union flag should be flown alongside the national flag.
I do not think it is at all anti-European to make the point that the Olympic Games give great national pride to the nation states that participate in them.
This suggestion is an indication of the obsession of the europhile leaders of Europe, an obsession that knows no bounds.
Even now they want to garner for themselves the glory that flows to each nation state from the medals won there.
I suggest it is a step too far and one that nation states should rightly resist.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on leaving Milan airport I unfortunately lost my spectacles for the hundredth time, so I cannot see things close up but I can see things clearly from a distance and, looking from a distance, I see perils for our Parliament.
I would therefore ask you for greater security in the European Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and Brussels.
I feel that the Members of the European Parliament would be a choice morsel for terrorist sharks and, if you ask me, I will be able to tell you what, in my opinion, is lacking in terms of security for us Members.
I do not think that it is appropriate to state my concerns publicly on such an important matter.
Â Â  The debate on matters of political importance is closed.
I would like to thank all the honourable Members for your cooperation.
Mr Evans has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have a point of order with regard to the agenda.
A number of Members have tabled questions in good time for this week â in particular to the Council â but received rather confusing e-mails to the effect that the questions could not be translated and would be held over until the next part-session.
Can you clarify the position with regard to Council Question Time this week and say what Members with genuine questions for the Council should do?
Â Â  As I will explain tomorrow in more depth, we still have unresolved problems in relation to translations, and not all the questions put will be able to be translated into all the languages.
Nevertheless, the Secretariat-General informs me that they appear on the list of questions to be put to the Commission, although it has not been possible to translate them into all the languages, but they do appear on the list of questions to be put to the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put the following proposal to you.
The European Parliament should honour the victims of the Second World War, which broke out 65 years ago, on 1 September 1939.
It began when Nazi Germany attacked Poland, with the Soviet Union providing its support on 17 September 1939, thus fulfilling the terms of the GermanâSoviet Pact, known as the RibbentropÂ âMolotov Pact.
The memory of this, the most tragic and bloody of wars, in which more civilians than soldiers were killed, should never be allowed to die.
I suggest Parliament supports this proposal by commemorating the victims of that war with a minuteâs silence.
Mr President, I ask for a minuteâs silence to be observed today to commemorate the victims of German Nazism.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement on recent environmental disasters (fires in southern Europe).
Â Â  . Mr President, we are seeing an increasing frequency in natural disasters here in Europe and around the world.
As we have seen recently, floods and forest fires wreak havoc, causing human and economic problems and also serious damage to our environment.
Of course we are trying to combat these problems.
With regard to forest fires, a series of common measures in the field of prevention, protection and restoration have now been put in place.
Our rural development programmes provide support for a wide range of forest activities, providing funds for prevention of fires and restoration of forests damaged by fires, according to priorities decided by the Member States.
In Portugal approximately EUR 149 m from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund is available for prevention and restoration for 2000-2006.
In Spain the total budget allocated for forestry measures for the same period amounts to EUR 820 million.
The recently created EU Solidarity Fund was established to respond to major disasters which caused direct damage of more than EUR 3 bn or exceeded 0.6% of the affected country's gross national income.
Only in very exceptional circumstances can the Solidarity Fund be mobilised for disasters that remain below this high threshold.
It has already been mobilised following the huge fires last year in Portugal and Spain and, at their request, it provided EUR 48.5 m for Portugal and EURÂ 1.3 m for Spain.
The Commission has not yet received any requests for 2004.
As you know, the Forest Focus regulation is our most recent instrument to monitor and to implement prevention measures in the field of forest fires, as well as to detect the reasons for their frequency.
The financial framework for the implementation of the Forest Focus scheme for 2003-2006 is fixed at EUR 65 m, of which EUR 9 m can be used for fire prevention measures.
Our civil protection assistance mechanism is also proving its worth.
In 2003 and 2004 Portugal sent requests for assistance to the EU Monitoring and Information Centre, which then coordinated support offers from other participating countries.
Thanks to the mechanism, it was possible to ensure the rapid despatch of aerial forest fire-fighting means to Portugal.
In 2003 Portugal accepted the assistance of two aircraft from Italy and three aircraft from Germany.
In 2004 Spain supplied three aircraft, France two, Germany two, Greece two and Italy one.
Additional assistance was offered by the UK and Norway but was not taken up by Portugal.
Four years ago I expressed my concerns about the increasing number of forest fires and the damage they cause, stating that the risk for forest fires and the vulnerability of our forests have now reached a level beyond which further fires would seriously endanger the ecosystems and their sustainable management.
Sadly we saw this happen during last year's heatwave, which hit southern Europe in particular and which culminated in the destruction of large parts of the Portuguese Natura areas.
I wish to conclude by saying that the Commission has taken your resolution of 4 September 2003 on the effects of the summer heatwave into account, and it serves as a very useful compendium for actions and measures on which to base future initiatives.
Â Â  Mr President, I must agree with the Commissionerâs view that the problem of fires in the European Union is having dramatic effects from an environmental point of view.
There are 45 000 fires per year in the European Union and they are going to become increasingly frequent, because drought, a structural problem in the European Union, is going to cause increasingly serious environmental problems, and not just in the south of Europe, but in the north as well.
Furthermore, the United Nationsâ experts tell us that, as a result of climate change, this problem is going to continue to worsen, and we are faced with a situation in which we have no genuine common policy for combating fires aimed at tackling these 45 000 fires per year in the European Union.
We lack measures, resources and money.
I would remind you of Regulation 2158/92, the expiry of which led the European Commission to show that it wanted to put an end to the lines of aid for fighting fires.
When this Parliament debated Forest Focus, it managed to obtain the ridiculous figure of EUR 9Â million until 2006 from the European Commission.
On the other hand, we have the forestry chapter of the Rural Development Regulation.
That Regulation has not worked.
I agree with the Commissioner when she talks about EUR 820 million, but this sum is under-utilised.
It is badly used because there is no coordination at either inter-regional or inter-State level.
The Member States act as they wish and improvise.
It is true that the French have sent two aircraft to help fight the fire in Portugal, but in no way was it done in a coordinated fashion.
And neither is there any inter-regional coordination.
An example of this is what has happened this year in Spain.
There is a region in the north of Spain â Galicia â which contains the greatest area of forest.
Ninety-nine per cent of the fires that break out in that autonomous region are brought under control within 24 hours.
Forest fires are fought effectively in Galicia, and progress is being made through forest activation plans which are increasing all the time.
Its rate of fires is five times less than the average for the Spanish State.
Nevertheless, in Andalusia we have seen 42 131 hectares burn because the resources available have not been used.
This is a dramatic situation and this should be a good opportunity to put it right.
How?
By applying a bit of common sense to all this, because, since the European Commission has to present the European forest strategy over the coming months, this must be the opportunity to consider this problem in depth and to implement a forestry policy in the European Union that takes measures for protecting forests from fire seriously and, above all, that helps to coordinate administrations so that, as a minimum and if resources are not increased, the scant instruments available at the moment are used properly and so that the experiences of the Junta de Andalusia and the European Union as a whole this summer never happen again.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that we in this Parliament are once again debating fires demonstrates that there is something we are not doing entirely right.
The figure relating to the area burnt suggests a genuine ecological disaster.
In my region alone â as has already been pointed out â in Andalusia, so far this year more than 40Â 000 hectares of forest have burnt down in a total of 753 fires.
In view of the consequences of this summerâs fires, we should ask ourselves frankly whether the Commissionâs opposition to increasing the budgetary contributions stemming from the Forest Focus Regulation was justified.
The Commission should also ask itself seriously whether it was right to shift the burden of fire prevention to regional and rural development funds without establishing suitable control mechanisms to ensure that they are actually used for prevention, reforestation and the regeneration of these areas.
The reality at the moment is that there is an urgent need for help in our countries.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission to clarify whether it is studying the possibility of allocating any additional funds in order to restore the funds in question.
The Union should not take a single step backwards in terms of its policy on climate change.
The question is very clear: does the Commission believe that the European Union is acting appropriately to protect its forest heritage?
Does the Commission believe it would be possible to allocate extraordinary funds from the Solidarity Fund or employ some other much quicker mechanism to alleviate the effects of these fires, which are destroying a natural heritage that the whole of Europe benefits from?
Â Â  Mr President, we Greens are very worried about the fact that there is no pre-emptive war against fires.
We Greens call for a pre-emptive war against fires.
The current abandonment of rural areas, depopulation, demographic movement away from the countryside, is having horrendous results.
The European funds do not reach the people responsible for managing the forests.
The people who have lived from forest resources such as cork, or holm oak acorns, for example, in Andalusia, have lost their source of income.
This is no accident, but the obvious result of a policy that puts the rural areas last, which does not provide the resources and which is aimed at planting species such as eucalyptus and pine â something which some Members of this House are now criticising but previously advocated â leaving behind a legacy of ignorance which then leads to fires.
This situation requires investment in civil and rural society, both in programmes like Leader, the abandonment of which is now being considered, and in other rural programmes, which reflect some of the social fabric of Europe.
Â Â  We are once again discussing here the issue of forest fires, just as we did last year, when, at our instigation, we discussed the consequences of the devastating summer fires, which, in Portugal alone, were responsible for the deaths of over 20 people and for burning 400Â 000 hectares of forest, covering almost 5% of Portuguese territory and causing more than EURÂ 100 million worth of damage.
Sadly, little has been learnt and this year forest fires have tragically hit my country again, with more than 100Â 000 hectares of forest burnt.
Worst hit has been the Serra Algarvia region, where many families, whose incomes depended on forest products, have been plunged into serious poverty.
Given the importance of preserving forest heritage, due to its environmental, economic, social and cultural importance, and given the extent of this disaster, what is essential is not only European solidarity and assistance, but also significant investment, Community investment, in reforestation, in research, in coordination, in the area of civil protection, and in funding aerial means of combating forest fires.
We therefore urge, once again, that our proposals and Parliamentâs proposals be complied with, thereby strengthening the element of fire prevention and the relevant funding within the scope of the âForest Focusâ programme, in accordance with the previous Regulation 2158/92.
We are aware, however, that if we are to solve this problem, we must change the common agricultural policy in order to combat human and economic abandonment of rural areas, since it is the main cause of an agriculture and forestry policy that encourages people to abandon the countryside and prevents these forest areas from surviving economically.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I am grateful for the statement you have made to Parliament.
Whilst it is true that this yearâs fires were not as devastating as last yearâs, they ought still to be a concern for everyone.
In my country, Portugal, this is partly because last year, around 11% of Portuguese forest territory was destroyed.
In other words, what is already burnt cannot be burnt again.
The emergency aid approved by Parliament last year, which helped to bolster the resources made available by the government, made a difference.
It was a genuine expression of European solidarity with Portugal at a time of suffering for so many Portuguese people.
A significant part of Europeâs forest heritage cannot be destroyed year upon year with total impunity.
Quite apart from its relevance for the whole of Europe, the Mediterranean forest is essential to the regional and local economy, to job creation, to the safeguarding of a territory and to the quality of life.
We are aware that there are environmental reasons, related to climate change and to global warming.
It is a fact that average temperatures are rising and that the number of days with high temperatures and low humidity is also on the increase.
We are also aware that criminal acts are often the cause of these disasters.
In many cases, however, the disasters are the result of a lack of prevention and an absence of adequate resources to fight the flames.
As has already been mentioned by, among others, MrsÂ Herranz Garcia, Parliament set an example when it debated âForest Focusâ, which laid down the need to provide the resources to prevent forest fires.
Better resources are required, both in prevention and in European civil protection assistance and cooperation in the use of major resources, to which you so aptly referred in your speech, Commissioner.
Lastly, Mr President, I should like to mention something to which we alluded last year and to which we shall probably always allude whenever such circumstances arise: the dedication of the fire-fighters, the dedication of the people who, through their acts of courage, generosity and even heroism, proved what we already know â that in times of tragedy that demonstrate the worst in human nature, there are also many people who demonstrate the best in human nature.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your speech and for the solidarity that you have shown.
This summerâs fires, in the case of Portugal, devastated more than 100Â 000 hectares, in addition to last yearâs disaster.
The Algarve was the worst hit area, with 40% of its total area burnt.
What we are witnessing is a veritable environmental, economic and human tragedy that has become a public catastrophe.
It is therefore a matter of urgency that we hold a debate on fire prevention measures, backed by real investment.
Otherwise, in a few generationsâ time, there may be no forests.
The Mediterranean forest is part of the common heritage of the people of Europe and must therefore be preserved.
Some of the cork trees burnt were over two hundred years old and most were between one hundred and two hundred years old.
Some EUR 80 million of damage was caused and replacing these trees would take approximately one hundred years.
The tendency these days is to channel more funds into addressing the consequences of natural disasters than into preventing them.
We do not have an unlimited capacity to repair damage and prevention requires political courage and coherent regional development.
I ask the Commission to show that courage in the face of this tragedy and to table here a restructuring and reorganisation of the Structural Funds, so that these people can see on the horizon at least the possibility of rebuilding their livelihoods to pass on to their grandchildren.
Â Â  Mr President, I am well aware that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m knows she has given us a political reply with data and statistics, and she is perfectly aware that, today, European Union aid in the field of forest fires simply consists of money allocated in an arbitrary manner.
There is no complex strategy, though it is a complex interdisciplinary problem requiring cooperation amongst institutions.
It is the job, moreover, of us politicians to solve complex and difficult problems.
To this end, I believe we must create a model for the management of risks, for management and cooperation, because we are faced with issues ranging from judicial procedures, because there is a lot of terrorism, to the issues of policing, the civil population and the local authorities.
We must create models, as was done for Agenda 21.
The European Union is capable of doing this.
Above all, I am concerned, however, about the need for shared effective technological development, because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European Commission must do what the countries or the regions cannot do.
The problem of technological development is extremely important, in terms, for example, of the transfer of military technology, the development of the GIS and many other things that are being applied in some regions very successfully and which require technology shared amongst the 25 countries, amongst all the regions and amongst all the local authorities, because it is clear that, without that technological progress, all we can hope for is human effort and a lot of good will, but little success.
Â Â  Mr President, there is no question that the people mainly responsible for forest fires are the people who cause them.
In 96% of cases, the causes are attributable to man, and that is why the Spanish Government has announced a series of measures, including stiffer penalties for this crime and a ban on building in the areas in question.
Neither must we forget other causes, as has already been pointed out.
The change in the socio-economic structures of rural areas seems to be the most fundamental one, but also the lack of success of European forest and rural development policy.
The majority of fires start in forests which are uncared-for, as a result of the abandonment of traditional agricultural activity, the ageing of the population and the demographic crisis.
The EAGGF funds or the rural development policy cannot, however, carry the whole burden of this serious problem, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The serious environmental consequences of forest fires make European action necessary.
The difficulties you are aware of in the application of the Solidarity Fund should be alleviated through the creation of a specific rapid intervention mechanism in the event of these disasters of a smaller scale and involving lesser sums than those provided for by the Solidarity Fund.
Furthermore, and at the same time, European forest policy should be reoriented, recognising the special nature of southern forests and creating a specific plan for their protection and for the complete environmental recovery of the burnt areas.
I will end by saying something â and I hope it is not taken the wrong way: I believe that party politics should be left out of this debate and that we should seek consensus amongst all of us.
Otherwise â in Galicia it rains and in Andalusia it does not â certain Members should perhaps start to ask themselves what the EUR 820 million Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has mentioned has been spent on.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, every year around this time, as we have just seen, another debate is held on the subject of forest fires.
Fortunately, and even though the effects of fires continue to be too serious and disastrous, the fires which have affected, in particular, the southern Member States of the EU this year have been less fierce, and there has been no summer heatwave causing thousands of deaths.
In 2002, the European Union set up a Solidarity Fund intended to deal with natural disasters of this kind and their consequences for our peoples.
Last year, this Fund helped to deal with the aftermath of the fires in southern Europe.
In late 2003, the Forest Focus Regulation was adopted, but it was allocated only EUR 9 million of funding for the 2003-2006 period, which is not enough to prevent fires.
In the long run, there are plans for cofinancing via the common agricultural policy and the rural development fund, which means a partial withdrawal from the EUâs forestry policy.
What image of solidarity do we wish to present to our fellow citizens, especially those from the South?
A further problem facing us is the role of forests in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
Not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive CO2 emissions, they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the Unionâs carbon sink capacities.
We continue, and rightly so, to express our dismay at the fires and other natural disasters which have affected all of Europe over the past few years.
We cannot, however, show our solidarity with words alone.
Words are never enough.
Action is necessary and must be taken to greatly reduce the scale of forest fires and of other natural disasters.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a matter of urgency: we must reduce these disasters and show our solidarity.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate has illustrated the complexity of this issue, which affects us at all levels.
We know that climate change will probably increase these types of extreme weather events and it is quite probable that we will see more of these problems occurring, as the International Panel of Climate Change has told us.
That underlines the responsibility that is shared between the different levels.
The European Union, the Commission and the institutions will have to act in a coordinated way to ensure that we have the necessary capacity.
Member States will also have to be sure that they have done everything for prevention and that we have a higher level of preparedness to deal with these forest fires, extreme weather events and catastrophes.
It is a matter of resources â such as fire brigades â and being able to mobilise them quickly.
It is also a matter of having resources for prevention activities.
So there is a whole spectrum of activities and responsibilities.
We are addressing that.
You know as well as the Commission does that Member States in general are very reluctant to engage in a debate on a common forest policy for Europe, so we are also touching upon very sensitive political issues and responsibilities.
Even if we set aside more money, it is not always true that this would help immediately, unless there is better coordination of activities, unless there is better planning for prevention and preparedness on the part also of Member States.
I just want to underline that as welcome as more money is, it is not always a matter of only having more money; there also has to be better planning and coordination in Member States.
Thank you for this valuable debate on an issue that we risk having to raise again in the near future.
I appreciate the interest you show in finding common solutions to prevent forest fires, to fight them and also to mitigate the damage they cause â because the funding has often been a matter of mitigating and trying to come in after the damage has been done â as well as to help Member States restore their potential for forestry production.
I have noted several suggestions that I will also take into due consideration after this plenary part-session and there will be a follow-up.
I believe we could further increase transparency concerning the application of existing instruments.
We will also examine the need for additional prevention measures when implementing the Forest Focus regulation as we will do when considering the proposal for the Council's Rural Development regulation.
As a first modest step, next November the Commission will hold a conference entitled 'Citizen participation from restoration to prevention â good governance for the restoration campaign to follow forest fires in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and Cyprus'.
So it will also take into account the experience that we have gathered. It will focus on restoration and involvement of civil society because, as you said, the causes can be anything from climate change to the human factor.
We must seek to identify the lessons learned from last year's events, raise awareness among citizens and local and regional authorities, and collect suggestions for the future.
So there is also work to do to improve our activities in this field.
I am happy that we have found today a common view on possible actions that we should focus on for the future.
I once again thank you for this debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the next item on the agenda and take the oral question on the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, put this oral question to the Commission and the Council, which I hope can in some way consider it, arises from a fundamental concern.
During these years of attempts to reduce air pollution and its effects on climate change, the greenhouse effect and the effects mentioned a few minutes ago, the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been one of the bodies involved in drafting a policy to combat aircraft pollution.
This policy also laid down the use of economic instruments â the so-called market instruments â and voluntary measures, as well as the possibility of emissions trading and of introducing taxes and fiscal instruments to reduce that kind of pollution.
Unfortunately, it seems that recently the policy of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been leaning towards a different position.
Decisions taken some time ago basically assigned to this Organisation a task very similar to that of implementing the Kyoto agreements, which involved drafting Organisation guidelines aimed at ensuring that the various countries or organisations such as the European Union could then implement the same standards.
Now, however, we are faced with the possibility that at the Organisationâs next meeting, which will take place between 28 September and 8 October in Montreal, an amendment will be tabled which would remove the option to use market instruments to combat pollution from aircraft engines, thus making the whole policy take a step backwards.
This is already serious in itself.
While we debate, while we are ever more convinced of the problems we face, while evidence mounts for the link between aircraft emissions and the effects on air quality, this step backwards would be particularly serious.
In spite of the progress made in drawing up the Organisationâs guidelines, aimed at allowing countries to adopt, operate or create an emissions trading market and possibly to use fiscal instruments, we are confronted with an amendment, backed by the United States as well as other countries, which would not only put an end to this policy of the Organisation, but even prevent the European Union, for example, from taking steps in this direction as well.
I therefore ask the Commission and the Council if they are aware of this danger, if they share this concern and, consequently, what they intend to do so that we do not take this step backwards.
Secondly, I ask them what measures they intend to take to maintain the European Unionâs right to apply measures of this type, to create an emissions trading market or to be able to introduce fiscal measures aimed at discouraging the use of highly polluting fuels within the European Union or elsewhere.
In summary, I ask what they think they can do so that the International Civil Aviation Organisation may continue its policy or, at least, so that the European Union may have the right to be able to follow it through to the end.
Â Â  . Mr President, for many years the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been looking at market-based options designed to limit aviation emissions and introduce the aircraft and operating practices that are best environmentally.
The ICAO has been looking at three options: taxes on fuel or emissions, emission charges and emissions trading.
Unfortunately, under pressure from the United States, the Council has decided to propose a resolution which recommends that the ICAO only pursue emissions trading and, therefore, disregard the other options.
This is clearly contrary to our objectives.
The Commission shares the view that the European Union must make the most appropriate use of all economic instruments for achieving sustainability in the aviation sector, as it does in other sectors.
This means pressing to keep all options â taxation, emissions charging and emissions trading â open.
This view was unanimously supported by all Member States in the Council, in COREPER, when it was discussed in July.
It is important that we keep all options open, not favouring any particular option at this stage, so that Europe can decide on the best way forward, after further analysis, on the basis of realistic policy alternatives.
Since there is no certainty at present that any one measure will suffice, disregarding any option that might help limit the impact of aviation on climate change at this stage is not desirable.
Therefore, even though this will be difficult, the Commission will work during the Assembly to try to achieve a resolution that keeps options open.
Support from third countries is likely to be limited.
The situation once again illustrates the isolation of the European Union's position because it is not a full member of the ICAO and does not have the capability to influence the ICAO process from an early stage.
It also calls for the closest possible cooperation between EU Member States during the Assembly if an acceptable outcome is to be achieved.
Ultimately, it may be necessary to maintain a European reserve, in order not to be politically committed to implementing such a resolution if it is unsatisfactory.
This would not be unprecedented; it has been done in the past, notably for the Hushkit Dossier.
The European position will, at times, be coordinated following normal procedures involving COREPER.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that the oral question put by the Group of the Greens and the debate on the forthcoming meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation are neither timely nor relevant in content, for the question presupposes that the USA will be presenting the ICAO with a resolution when it meets on 28 September.
That itself is doubtful, to say the least.
That the debate on emissions trading and state subsidies to the worldâs civil aviation industry is happening at all is attributable to a proposal from the ICAO Council.
Moreover, the debate is taking place at the worst possible time, as neither the Committee on Transport and Tourism nor the plenary are in a position to consider in detail the ICAOâs position paper.
The internal discussions within the Commission, and, in particular, among the competent Member States, have not yet been concluded either.
Not only that, but the issue of emissions trading and state subsidies to the air transport sector is far too complicated for this House to be able to comment on it without careful preparation.
It is also in the passengersâ interests that European airlines should answer questions about the possible effects on air transport and on how they compete with the airlines of third countries â all the more so in view of the extremely heavy economic burdens already placed on European airlines by the consequences of what happened on 11 September 2001 and by the increase in the price of oil.
There is no disputing the European Unionâs right to come to its own autonomous decisions in these matters, and so, for the reasons I have stated, we regard the motions for a resolution tabled by the other groups as ill-considered and premature and will vote against them accordingly.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think that the time before the ICAO meeting at the end of September is the perfect moment for the European Parliament to speak its mind on the subject and for us â my dear Mr Schmitt â to discuss it.
That the issue of air travel and the environment is a sensitive one is something we have noticed from the reactions of some airlines, but what is it all about?
We know that air travel and global warming are connected; there is no argument about that.
We are now talking in terms of the possibility of emissions trading, and the studies carried out to date have got us no further.
That makes it absolutely necessary to keep all the options open when it comes to reducing emissions, and to do so using instruments that are both environmental and based on the market.
What matters, then, is that neither the USA nor anyone else, at the meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal at the end of this month, should slam any doors shut.
After all, we are not talking about introducing emissions trading today or in the next couple of weeks, but about the future possibility of the EU opting to facilitate this in air transport, using market-based emissions trading instruments; it is this position that the EU should keep open for itself.
That, Commissioner, is why most of us in this House wholeheartedly support the Commissionâs view that, as you have said, the EU should present as united a front as possible within the framework of the ICAO.
I see it as both right and necessary that this House should underline this once again, so that no doors are slammed shut in the ICAO at the end of this month.
The USA, too, must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to say that I am disappointed not to see any Council representatives, for naturally, the Council will also have an important input in this chapter, and it will be the members of the Council who will be voting at the ICAO Meeting.
I therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will report to the Council representatives on what has been discussed here in this House, because it is, of course, also on them that we will be leaning, for we know that we cannot lean on the Commission.
We also know that the Commission is not a member of the ICAO, even though we have asked them on many occasions to become a member, not only for aviation, but also for shipping, so that at those international meetings, we as a Union can finally speak with one voice and not only with the voices of the Member States.
We are not debating a Commission proposal, but the fact that the Commission should keep its hands free to be able to put forward a proposal if it sees the need to do so.
Essentially, then, we should not be looking for a solution at this precise moment.
We only need to ensure that our hands are not tied before we can start the debate.
In fact, we encountered the same problem when the subject of shipping was being discussed.
Is it the International Maritime Organisation that decides on its own or can decisions also be taken regionally within the Union?
We are now facing the same problem.
Why could we not do the same for the environment as we did in shipping when, for example, the issue of double-hulled tankers came up?
With regard to aviation, can the Union not take the lead as regards measures to make aviation more sustainable?
There is absolutely no doubt that we should maintain a sense of balance in this, but as Mr Piecyk stated, neither we, nor the Commissioner for that matter, want our hands to be tied beforehand at global level.
You have stated, Commissioner, that the Council agreed unanimously with the Commissionâs opinion.
What I would like to know from you is whether this will still be the case at the meeting at the end of the month.
Are you certain that all 25 members of the Council will be adopting a common position and will thus settle for a reserve, if necessary?
Secondly, you stated that our position is receiving very little support from third countries.
It appears that most of those third countries are following the line of the United States.
Why is that so?
Is there anything else the European Union can do to ensure that we receive support for our position and that, consequently, we can bring about better sustainability?
I understand MrÂ Schmittâs concerns, but sustainability means that a balance must be maintained socially, ecologically and economically.
Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not want to overlook the economic aspect in aviation, but it must be possible for us as a Union to adopt a policy without anybody tying our hands beforehand.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for pointing out that every instrument is needed in order to guarantee climate protection, and for describing the ICAO goals as contrary to all the goals that we in the EU have set.
Let me thank you again for that.
I see this debate as happening at the right time and in the right place, for we must do everything possible to prevent the resolution that the United States of America and other countries are strenuously backing from gaining majority support at the conference in Montreal.
Let me make three points in relation to this.
In the first place, this is about the EUâs autonomy in matters concerning Europe.
What Europe does is Europeâs business, and the European Union, the Commission and the Council, have to decide what that is and determine what this continentâs future requires.
That is not something that other states out there may do; the decision, then, is for us to take, and, as regards your decision, I wish you the great success for which you have been striving.
I also hope that you will win the day.
My second point is that the EU has always attached a very high value to climate protection and seen it as very important.
It is for that reason that the European Union signed the Kyoto Protocol.
That, as you know, was an ambitious thing to do, and we must do all we can to fulfil it.
That being so, it is quite intolerable that the air transport industry, a threat to the climate and to climate protection, should be exempted from the measures; that really is making a gamekeeper out of a poacher, and we want none of it.
We know that air travel is a danger, just as we know that railways are a relatively environmentally-friendly system of transport.
We cannot have rail transport laden down with taxes, including levies on emissions, while air transport, of all things, is not, and hence we want the same law for both.
Priority must be given to the mode of transport that does not harm the environment, rather than to the one that does.
Â Â  Mr President, it looks like the 35th ICAO Meeting will be a memorable one.
Twenty-one delegations have tabled proposals that are likely to do aviation no good as regards emission levels.
They are proposing the abolition of the individual initiative of countries or regions to take measures to restrict emissions and its replacement by a more legislative initiative from the ICAO.
This is a contradiction in terms, because we will never manage to agree on issues such as these in the ICAO.
The Community is striving towards sustainable development both ecologically and economically, something of which I have for years been wholeheartedly in favour.
In that light, we should have the courage to face up to reality.
Aviation and the environment are not compatible.
In this House, we are making every effort to change this on all kinds of fronts, and we must, above all, continue to do this, in principle with our partners in other parts of the world, but if this proves impossible, without them.
At present, aviation enjoys improper benefits compared to other transport modes, and this should change.
Maintaining tax benefits and leaving certain social costs uncovered does nothing to help our cause.
However, we must make sure that we do not act against our own interests.
Our measures should not result in European companies having to give up the fight.
Rules are fine, provided that they apply to all players.
This is, however, not a licence for stagnation.
That is why I am also of the opinion that the proposed changes to ICAO resolution A33-7 must be taken off the agenda.
Sustainable policy requires courage and foresight, and these proposals are lacking in both.
It is up to the European Community to demonstrate that transport and the environment are less incompatible than the amendments would suggest.
Â Â  Mr President, needless to say, as climate spokesperson for the Socialist Group, I gladly support all my fellow Members who have expressed their concern about the present ICAO resolution.
This would really be a step back, and we need to move forward.
Our group advocates a very vigorous climate policy and we will not be avoiding difficult decisions in the process â certainly not when a sector is already enjoying tax exemptions and preferential treatment in this way.
It is aviation itself, then, that we need to tackle.
We think that the international emission trade for airline companies can be an extra incentive for the development of new and efficient aircraft, thus moving towards sustainable aviation.
I would urge all my fellow Members, particularly those belonging to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to support the resolution that is before this House, and thus send a clear signal to the United States.
I would also call on the Commission and the Dutch Presidency, when they next put in an appearance, on no account to support an American proposal for a resolution on this subject during the ICAO Meeting.
Instead, the European Union, with its partners, should focus on the ICAO making a constructive contribution to the forthcoming conference of the parties in Buenos Aires on the subject of the Kyoto Protocol.
Â Â  . The emissions from aviation are increasingly significant.
According to the sector's own analysis, the world passenger aircraft fleet could double by 2020.
That means an increase from 12 000 aircraft to roughly 25 000 aircraft by 2020.
This has a significant impact and, therefore, what we do is important.
The Commission was aware of these problems months ago.
There have been discussions with Coreper since July and there is definitely a common position between all 25 Member States and the Commission to keep all options open.
We believe that this is the only way forward.
The next discussion in Coreper on the future strategy will take place next Friday.
The Commission and Member States, with the UK taking the lead, are now working on alternative texts, as it is important to do the practical work.
The Commission will also study the technical feasibility of introducing aviation emissions trading schemes into a general scheme and will look at different solutions in this area.
The conclusions are expected in nine months, on the basis of which the Commission intends to propose measures.
Our position is clearly to keep all options open in order to be effective.
We are grateful for the support of the European Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The corresponding vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the next item on the agenda: the debate on the Commission Statement on the consequences of the shipwreck, off the Turkish coast, of a ship containing toxic ash.
Â Â  . Mr President, according to the information currently available to us, the ship that sank recently in Turkey had originally sailed from Spain in the year 2000 with a cargo of ash from a coal power plant in Spain.
In May 2000 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish Ministry of the Environment that they had received 2 200 tonnes of ash that had been exported without authorisation.
The Turkish authorities classified the waste as hazardous due to its chromium content.
The Secretariat of the Basel Convention was also informed.
According to the Spanish authorities, they immediately began to investigate the case.
The information from the port of AvilÃ©s showed that the documents that the ship was carrying were forged, hiding the fact that the waste was originally destined for Algeria but had been rejected there because it was wet and therefore unusable.
The company exporting the cargo stated that it had not intended to send the waste to Turkey, but to Algeria, and that the captain of the ship had acted without its consent.
The Spanish authorities took action against the company and required it to take the waste back to Spain for treatment.
The company appealed against the decision and administrative proceedings went on until the end of 2002.
In 2003 and 2004 discussions continued as to how to return the ash to Spain.
In July 2004 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish authorities that they could proceed with a plan drawn up by the company to transfer the ash to another vessel and return it to Spain.
However, before this could be done, the vessel sank on 6Â September.
We have strict rules in place that regulate the movement of waste within and outside the European Union.
Exports of waste for disposal are prohibited.
Exports of hazardous waste for recovery to OECD countries, including Turkey, have to be notified to the competent authority in the country of export and need the consent of the authorities concerned.
If an EU Member State discovers that a shipment has taken place without notification, it has to ensure either that the waste is taken back within 30 days or that it is taken care of in an environmentally sound manner.
According to the information available, Spain was willing to take back the waste and fulfil its legal obligations.
Unfortunately, legal and administrative problems delayed a solution until it was too late.
This problem should have been prevented at source.
Therefore it is one of our priorities to work further towards improving implementation of Community legislation.
We are holding regular meetings with national authorities to discuss problems of implementation and possible solutions.
A key issue in this respect is increased cooperation between port authorities in order to tackle, among other things, the problem of port hopping.
Furthermore, may I remind you that the role of non-EU countries in cases such as this is defined in the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for your statement, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
We are dealing with another accident at sea, this time in the Mediterranean, which demonstrates the current fragility of the common network we are creating with a view to guaranteeing the greatest possible level of safety at sea.
The and accidents in Community waters taught us a hard lesson about the European Unionâs urgent needs in terms of legislation and maritime traffic control, and the result of this painful process has been a range of very advanced legislative measures whose transposition, entry into force and rigorous application are helping us to make progress towards increasing maritime safety and preventing marine pollution within the Union.
The case of the ' accident, in the port of , Alexandretta, in Turkey, demonstrates needs of other kinds.
On the one hand, the need for coordination between the authorities of a Member State of the Union, which at all times has complied with international and Community legislation, and the authorities of an associated State which aspires to membership of the Union and should therefore be making every effort, as it already does in other areas, to comply with what we call the Community acquis in the field of environmental protection.
On the other, we need to deal with the contradiction between the two factors which come into play in this type of accident: urgent practical decisions and measures for dealing with the environmental emergency which has taken place and the much more time-consuming issue of the legal requirements relating to disputes, together with the problems of identifying the people ultimately responsible, resulting from the tangle of interests in the field of maritime traffic, something which this House has repeatedly condemned.
In this case, we can affirm that from the outset the Spanish authorities have fulfilled the requirements of the Basel Convention, opening proceedings against the company and obliging it to return the ash and also ensuring all the necessary coordination with the Turkish authorities and providing all the help and technical assistance necessary for the ash to be returned to Spain.
Unfortunately, the time periods, particularly those stemming from the embargo imposed on the ship by the Turkish authorities, have meant that, recently, since 7Â July, the Turkish authorities have finally had free access to the ship.
On that date, the embargo was finally lifted and therefore the company, owing to pressure from the Spanish authorities, acknowledged the need and their obligation to return the ashes.
It is too short a time period and the ship, which was already in a pretty horrendous condition, as demonstrated by the number of occasions it has been detained in the past, has finally sunk in circumstances which have yet to be clarified.
I must point out that, from the outset, the Spanish authorities have considered that assistance to be necessary, that there is now a technical assistance mission heading for Turkey and that, in relation to this case, we will once again have to consider whether the players operating in this tangle of legislation and maritime traffic have or have not met their obligations: the company, the authorities, the captain, etc.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe we are looking at the tip of the iceberg.
This is not a chance happening, it is not an isolated case, we are talking about the number-one company in the construction materials sector: .
We are talking about its Spanish subsidiary , which has been fined 18 times for not declaring the content of its waste.
We are talking about a time period of four years, when the time limit for returning the waste should be 30 days.
What has happened over these three and a half years or more?
What has the European Commission done?
We are asking the Commission for a policy of zero tolerance.
As I speak, I am sure there are dozens and dozens of ships in the same situation.
What is that company doing exporting vast quantities of the same material to Algeria, having been fined 18 times, without any public transfer and without the Commission finding out?
We believe that the European Commission should step in through the adoption of clear penalties in the event of infringements.
Infringement proceedings should be opened to ascertain the causes and the people responsible for the disaster.
We cannot wait around for fine words in relation to this disaster; we cannot accept a quarrel which goes on and on forever.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissioner has recounted a scandalous story to us.
For four years, a ghost ship with forged documents has been breaking every rule, every directive, every international convention, and there is no way of applying legislation and the law.
It is driven out of Algeria and goes to Turkey.
Turkey does not want it, but no one can impose what, for the rest, we all want to vote through.
We face a huge ecological disaster and a huge failure on the part of the European Commission to practise what it quite rightly preaches.
