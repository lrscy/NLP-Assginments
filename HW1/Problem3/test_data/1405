This point was discussed during the March plenary and it was already clear then that attitudes towards the methodologies and towards the influence of this participation too vary from North to South, so to speak.
Indeed, the northern countries have a different attitude towards this type of involvement, towards the idea of this type of participation from the countries of central and southern Europe.
The rapporteur, clearly inspired by the way things work in her country, which is possibly democratically more developed, more advanced than others - proposes participation that is too peremptory, too authoritarian, participation that could ultimately slow down, if not block or paralyse certain decision-making processes, upon which there will never be total convergence between the direct democratic base and what is known as the authority, that is the administration appointed to deal with these issues.
There you are: this authority must also take into clear consideration all the demands and comments of those who have to build, sell and create tourist, sporting and cultural concerns - in short, daily activities - in the environment.
Considering that this second debate contains points and issues which involve legality and access to levels of justice, including in the event of appeals, the roles and responsibilities must be quite clearly, fairly and unambiguously defined in terms of who the actors should be and how much influence they should have.
The Aarhus Convention has been cited: that is all very well - we support it - but it must not be taken as Gospel. It too must allow for a healthy subsidiarity, for customs, for habits, and for the level of directly democratic involvement possible in the various countries.
In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur, who has put in an enormous amount of work, but I feel that there should be some adaptation, as I said at the beginning, to the different attitudes.
Mr President, may I begin by saying that this proposal deals with the second pillar of this convention involving public participation in environmental decision-taking.
In addition to this proposal on access to environmental information, there are other pieces of Community legislation which already incorporate the principle of the Aarhus Convention.
The Commission will ensure that the Aarhus elements are built into all future proposals.
Public participation has to become a fully integrated part of environmental decision-taking.
To reach that objective, our proposals have to be easy to put into practice, so that they may be smoothly implemented in the different administrative systems of the Member States.
The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the "public concerned" is a key point, and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken.
In accordance with the Aarhus Convention, the Commission proposes to ensure that the public at large is fully informed about planned developments which might affect them, whilst giving the right to participate in the decision-taking process to those having an interest in or likely to be affected by the developments, that is, the "public concerned."
Some of the proposed amendments, and indeed what has been said by some Members just now, seems to imply that by using the definition, "the public concerned", both the convention and the Commission are deliberately restricting the rights of citizens, but may I be permitted to point out that is certainly not the case.
It is not correct.
This proposal is aimed at extending the rights of citizens.
There is no question of restricting those rights.
By defining the "public concerned", we are focusing the attention of the competent authorities on the need to take account of those citizens most directly affected.
The definition will confirm both the right to express a view and the right to be heard.
The definition of "public concerned" is sufficiently detailed to ensure that there is no doubt who should be involved.
Therefore members of the public could argue that they had been unjustifiably excluded.
That would be difficult with a more general definition of the public.
The inclusion of NGOs within the definition of the "public concerned" will ensure that a more general public view may be taken into account.
On a more practical level, the definition of "public concerned" has been used without major problems in existing legislation - for example the environmental impact assessment directive - for a number years.
There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition - at least no major problems.
In short, this approach will give those affected by new developments the right to influence decisions which will not just affect their environment but which may also affect their economic and social conditions.
For those reasons, the Commission, regrettably, cannot support the amendments seeking to replace the concept of the "public concerned".
Amendment No 26 seeks to extend considerably the scope of Article 1, so as to cover plans and programmes not only in the environmental field but also in other sectors.
The Commission's view is that this would make the scope of the proposal less well-defined and also that the measures proposed would lead to legal confusion.
There would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing, but in an inconsistent manner.
In particular, for plans and programmes in other sectors that may have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42 on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance.
The directive provides for environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in many integration sectors and envisages public participation fully in line with the Aarhus requirements.
Amendments Nos 6 and 12 aim to give effect to a best endeavour clause under the Aarhus Convention and are formulated in a non-binding way.
Amendment No 9 introduces public participation concerning policies in its heading, but the text does not contain operational provisions in this respect.
In formulating the proposal, the Commission's objective has been to incorporate the binding provisions of the Aarhus Convention.
The Commission's view is that there would be no added value in taking up its soft-law provisions.
Not only the Community but all Member States have signed the Aarhus Convention and so already have to take into account the soft-law provisions.
The Commission, regrettably, cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 and 11 which provide for access to justice concerning public participation in plans and programmes.
The Aarhus Convention does not explicitly require this, neither does the directive on strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes provide for access to justice.
The Commission is however considering possible further legislative proposals in relation to the third Aarhus pillar on access to justice.
In conclusion, may I now confirm the Commission's position on the amendments.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15, 18, 25, 28 and 29.
In addition, Amendments Nos 9, 13, 14, 23 and 27 can be accepted in part and Amendments Nos 4, 5, 10 and 17 in principle.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 16, 20, 21 and 22.
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizen after all, to have this proposal enter into force swiftly.
Only once the frameworks are established can public participation in decision-making become a fully integrated administrative practice.
The English interpretation was not able to follow my speech and thus all the other languages based on that interpretation were incomplete.
I regret this.
It has happened many times so I urge you to see that the quality of interpretation is improved as soon as possible.
Thank you, Mrs Korhola, we have taken note.
We know that our relay interpreting system causes problems now and again.
We have taken very good note and this should not happen again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0324/2001) by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending:
I. Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses [7551/1/2001 - C5-0296/2001 - 1998/0243(COD)]
II. Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) [7550/1/2001 - C5-0295/2001 - 1998/0242(COD)]
Mr President, let this be the end of twelve years' debate of the 'UCITS Directive' !
In February of last year, we had the first reading.
One and a half years' later, in July, the common position was finally adopted, and now it is our turn.
As you know, the first proposal concerns the UCITS itself and what investments it may engage in.
The second updates and extends the rules relating to the actual management of the funds.
Both proposals were broadly supported by Parliament at first reading.
A total of 37 amendments were adopted for the two proposals.
Of these, 30 have been accepted in full or in part by the Council.
As for UCITS-1, the Council wholly or partially approved 20 of Parliament' s 24 amendments.
Moreover, it has made a number of changes of its own.
The most important concerns OTC derivatives, the use of which the Commission opposed from the start.
However, Parliament considered that OTC derivatives could be employed more broadly, but according to stringent criteria.
The Council adopted the same policy.
In several cases, the Council adopted a still more prudent approach than Parliament on the issue of OTC derivatives and considered that investments in these had to fulfil more stringent qualitative criteria.
Where comitology is concerned, the common position does include comitology provisions in the field of financial services.
I nonetheless want to stress that there is no obvious link to the subsequent proposals made by the group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy.
The 1985 directive created the so-called UCITS Contact Committee which was set up to advise the Commission.
The extension of the Contact Committee' s powers to include new powers was foreseen in the original proposal.
Parliament accepts parts of the proposal, but not the part concerning the adjustment of limit values, as adopted by the Council.
In the same way, both the Commission and the Council accepted Parliament' s request to limit the scope of the delegation to the Committee.
In my view, Parliament has thus agreed to the use of comitology and, moreover, successfully amended the scope of its powers.
I do not therefore see any reason to re-open this issue at this juncture.
There is nonetheless an amendment from Mr Goebbels, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Herzog.
Should it be adopted, I am afraid that we should be facing conciliation and not knowing where it might end.
The Lamfalussy agreement is in danger of being delayed and the UCITS directive of being halted in its tracks.
That is something that no one can want to see happen.
I hope that Mr Goebbels is able to share my view.
Turning to UCITS-2, the Council has, for the most part, accepted the concerns expressed by Parliament at first reading.
Ten out of Parliament' s 13 amendments have been incorporated in part or in full.
The most contentious issue was that of the capital requirement for management companies.
The compromise finally reached by the Council is, broadly speaking, in line with Parliament' s stance.
Given how complicated these two directives are and how quickly the market is developing, the committee proposes a review of the rules within the next three years. There are two reasons for this.
First of all, the compromise reached in Council is a very fragile one, and it would not serve anybody' s interests to open the Pandora' s box of detailed, technical or politically sensitive amendments.
A conciliation would delay this review, for which there is already a need, and it might also stop the legislation from ever seeing the light of day.
Secondly, the two common positions strike a good balance between investor protection and investment freedom.
As I say, the majority of those changes we proposed last time have been introduced.
There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues.
In my opinion, these are better tackled in a wider context.
The committee was kind enough to follow my recommendations.
There is therefore only one amendment to UCITS-1, setting out some guidelines for a future review process.
A 'grandfather' clause is also proposed, whereby existing funds should not have to comply with the new legislation for a transitional period.
There is also an amendment to UCITS-2, seeking to align the review period for the capital requirement with the general review.
Following the committee' s reading, I have been in contact with the Council, as recently as a few hours ago, and also with the Commission.
Together with Mr Goebbels, I am therefore tabling a new amendment to reduce the transitional period.
In this way, it will be possible to introduce the UCITS directive into the Member States by 2005, that is to say the year in which the financial action plan is to be implemented.
The purpose of this is to avoid conciliation.
The work on renewing the regulations governing UCITS has been going on for as long as twelve years and is a clear example of why decision-making within this area needs to be reformed.
If Europe is to have a chance of competing with, for example, the American economy, it will have to be possible for changes of a more technical nature to take place significantly more simply and quickly.
There is now a good balance between a well-functioning market and reasonably secure protection for consumers.
Parliament has been proactive and shown an ability to act quickly and to compromise when it really counts.
May we continue along that route!
Well thought-out, prompt and effective legislation - that is what Europe needs.
I want to end by thanking everyone involved: the Commissioner, his efficient and friendly colleagues and my fellow MEPs who have all really shown willing during this difficult period.
I hope that, tomorrow, we can thus draw a line under twelve years' work for the benefit of Europe' s consumers and investors.
Mr President, to tie in with the rapporteur' s closing words, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and especially the Commission staff for their help.
The issue of concern to us, however technical it is, is of extraordinary political and social importance because it is widely known that undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), including pension funds, are currently the preferred form of saving for the majority of European citizens.
The first problem we came up against was that there were two directives: one called a 'product' directive, which allowed these bodies to invest in products from which they were hitherto denied access, and another, which proposed substantially increasing capital requirements.
Both the Commission and Parliament were tempted to immediately adopt the so-called 'product' directive and delay the adoption of the so-called 'management' directive.
This Parliament warned that it was dangerous to allow these undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities - which, I repeat monopolise the market in public savings - to move into deeper waters without any guarantee that their ships were prepared for what would be a more daring day' s sailing than they had hitherto embarked on.
As the rapporteur indicated, the purpose of the first discussion - and I am limiting myself here to the product directive - was to decide what they could invest in.
He referred to non-standardised derivatives, index funds, the cascade effect, etc., which are technical issues that I will not go into now.
What I do want to say is that, in my group' s opinion, a balance has been achieved between giving greater opportunities to management bodies and, therefore, greater opportunities to investors and the protection, the caution, that must be present in any discussion of such delicate matters.
Parliament wanted to send a message to the Commission.
As on previous occasions, Parliament wants to be flexible on the adoption of the directives of the financial services action plan.
We want this directive to be adopted rapidly and we do not, therefore, want to have to go to conciliation.
We have therefore, limited our amendments to one - which I personally am not in favour of, although I will be voting for it - which consists of creating a 'grandfather' clause, in other words, creating a transitional period so that currently existing bodies have additional time in which to raise their capital.
Mention has been made of another amendment by Mr Goebbels, which he is going to withdraw, but I think it is extraordinarily intelligent and is the second message that Parliament is sending to the Commission.
The first, I repeat, is not tabling amendments that cannot be accepted by the Council and the Commission.
The second, even though we are not involved in a Lamfalussy procedure, is to warn that we will always have to be flexible.
We will always show willingness to be flexible on the legislative procedure, but we are not prepared to concede the codecision powers that Parliament has taken such a long time to gain.
Mr President, I will try to make up for the time which Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo has used. I would simply like, on behalf of my group, to express our support for the proposals of Mr Olle Schmidt, and I congratulate him on his arduous work as rapporteur for the European Parliament.
We support the two amendments he has tabled.
I have personally, along with some other fellow Members, tabled another amendment.
We are, in all likelihood, going to withdraw that agreement, depending on the replies which Commissioner Bolkestein is soon to give us.
We believe - and there are many of us; I believe I can speak for Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo and others - that the balance between the Council and the European Parliament as co-legislators was upset at Stockholm.
The Commission must re-establish that balance.
We await concrete proposals from the Commissioner.
I just wish to say on behalf of the Liberal Group that I very much hope Mr Goebbels and his colleagues will withdraw their amendment.
We do not believe that the amendment insisting on call-back is appropriate to this particular piece of legislation, which my colleague Olle Schmidt has described as being very carefully balanced after the common position of the Council.
Nor is it appropriate in the context of the ongoing discussions over Lamfalussy.
Indeed, I would go as far to say that by insisting on call-back, which was not a phrase which appeared in Parliament's second resolution on this subject after the Stockholm Council, we risk calling into question our bona fides in the lengthy negotiations which some of us have undertaken with Mr Bolkestein.
I very much hope, therefore, that the people who have put forward this amendment will withdraw it, and that discussions will take place in an appropriate place.
We should not try to call into question this piece of legislation.
I believe it should be put through as is.
I too very much hope that Mr Goebbels is going to withdraw Amendment No 4.
You want call-back, Mr Goebbels, I want call-back and so does Mr Bolkestein.
The fact remains that it is not feasible to have a legal call-back within the terms of the Treaty.
Therefore, it is up to us to find a political agreement and a form of words which will do until 2004 when we can review this whole issue.
Indeed I believe the Commission is committed to such a review.
It is vitally important that we come to this agreement.
On Mr Schmidt's report, it is excellent to see the modernisation of the framework for UCITS by the inclusion of derivatives and OTC derivatives.
Parliament is leading the way on this, and Mr Schmidt has played a particularly successful role in updating the directives in this way and very much led the way on the derivatives issue.
I am sorry to see the capital requirements in the form that they are.
I believe that UCITS managers should be subject to capital requirements, but I do not believe those contained in the directive are sufficiently risk-sensitive.
I do not believe that they are consistent with the general framework that we hope to implement.
I do not think that assessing capital according to risk under management actually reflects the risk undertaken.
I am also concerned that this formulation of the directive will produce an uneven market opening, leaving the market closed in one Member State and open in the other 14.
But I have been persuaded by the rapporteur and our esteemed shadow rapporteur not to table amendments on these defects because we are very keen to get these two directives on the statute book to modernise the framework for a unit trust and UCITS in the European Union.
I commend the directive to the House.
Mr President, I refer to the common position on Directive 1998/242 and the capital requirements that it will impose on investment management firms.
In Scotland, there is a long tradition of investment management going back to the opening of the American west in the 19th century.
These investment managers were usually law firms, private partnerships, which managed the assets of their clients very successfully.
To this day, there are investment firms of this type, private partnerships, sole proprietorships and other structures with limited capital.
The interests of clients are fully safeguarded as their assets are held by independent and fully capitalised and regulated depositories.
It is largely irrelevant to set capital requirements on the investment management firms themselves.
I am relieved that the Council has reduced slightly the capital requirements set by this Parliament at first reading and has set a top limit of EUR 10 million.
But this is still substantial for private partnerships and sole proprietorships.
Incidentally, the largest and most successful firms in America and in the world - Fidelity is a good example - are exactly of this type.
The requirements of this type will be a hurdle for new enterprising entrants into an industry which requires a regular injection of new blood.
At the very least, it should provide for this capital to be available by means of guarantees from banks or by insurance policies to cover professional and operational risk.
But the common position, for some not very apparent reason, restricts such cover to only 50% of the requirement.
Why?
The common position provides for the Commission to report on this matter within five years of entry into force of the directive.
I should like to put on record now the request that such a report should specifically consider whether any capital requirement at all is necessary for investment management companies, and certainly that it should be greatly reduced.
Mr President, while, in many areas, the European legislation which we produce here is often openly criticised - quite rightly - we should recognise that the 1985 directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities was, for once, a masterpiece.
The success it has had in the investment fund sector and with the clients of these funds bears witness to this.
It has also become an example for legislation on a world scale.
Since it entered into force in 1989, not only have the assets of the UCITSs increased dramatically, but also cross-border trade has developed very strongly.
It has therefore achieved the objectives it was intended for.
However, if, after ten years, this directive needs a 'facelift' in order to adapt to the evolution of the markets, to the increasingly sophisticated financial products available, I remain concerned about the fate of the older funds, which do not meet the new demands.
That is why I had advocated a clause for these funds, a so-called 'grandfather' clause, which would be unrestricted.
Also in this field there are acquired rights, which it would be unfair to modify in a backdated fashion.
If there is no such clause, there will be a significant risk of market insecurity, which would have disastrous effects on the performance of the funds, prejudicing not only the industry but also the investors.
And above all, the weaker consumers, who do not keep so up-to-date with financial matters and who therefore react more slowly to them, will be the most affected.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has finally expressed its preference for a clause which is restricted in time.
This is the lesser evil, even if this clause may have negative effects, in terms of competition, for the older UCITSs, all of which will probably not be able to adapt to the new provisions of the directive in the best operational and financial conditions.
Mr President, I therefore hope that the House will vote in favour of this restricted clause.
Please allow me to point out that I am also opposed to the amendment by Mr Goebbels, which would have the effect of delaying, indeed sacrificing, the modified directive, which we are able to live with, despite its shortcomings - but it would appear to be a lost cause from the outset.
Mr Goebbels would do well, I believe, to withdraw his amendment.
He can put it in cold storage until there is a better occasion to table it once again.
I should like to begin by saying that the Commission would firstly like to thank very much the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt.
On behalf of my staff - about whom Mr Schmidt had some extremely kind words to say - I thank the rapporteur, and the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their extremely constructive approach on these important files.
The common positions are crucial elements for delivering the FSAP - the financial services action plan - on time, in other words, by the year 2003 for an integrated European Union for securities markets and 2005 overall.
These proposals, taken as a whole, represent a highly delicate and complex compromise which the Commission fully supports, as does European industry.
That is an important fact to bear in mind.
Given the capitalisation of the UCITS market - nearly EUR 4 trillion - the expected benefits to be had are large.
Firstly, the proposals will widen the set of financial instruments eligible to be used in UCITS portfolios while enhancing risk management requirements.
Thus they will provide greater financial diversity while keeping the original concept, namely risk diversification with the highest standards of investor protection.
Secondly, the management companies which generally run these savings schemes will enjoy a European passport and will be allowed to provide additional services to customers who request, for example, individual management of their assets.
But they will have to comply with a comprehensive set of requirements and rules.
Thirdly, investor information will be strongly improved by detailed disclosure of risk profiles, along with a fully harmonised, simplified prospectus to play the role of a single, investor-friendly pan-European marketing tool.
Now I come to the amendments tabled.
I should like to stress that the provisions contained in the first three amendments, namely the twin review clauses and the grandfathering clause, pose some difficulties for us - not because of the substance, but with the timetables proposed in each case.
We would much prefer a single deadline for both, that is, 2005 - the date of the conclusion of the financial services action plan, which we think would be more logical.
However, in a spirit of compromise and because we must now lay this matter to rest after twelve years of discussion, and in recognition of the efforts this Parliament has undertaken, also considering the last amendment of the rapporteur with would shorten the grandfathering period foreseen in Amendment No 1, the Commission will, in the end, support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
I now turn to Amendment No 4, which would introduce a so-called "call-back" clause regarding the UCITS Contact Committee.
I should like to be clear that this is not acceptable to the Commission.
We believe that it would not be acceptable for the Council either.
It is not acceptable to the Commission because firstly, the clause which has been tabled is not compatible with Article 202 of the Treaty, as Mr Goebbels knows full well.
It is also in contradiction with existing comitology rules.
Of that, Mr Goebbels is also aware.
(Interruption from Mr Goebbels) Not before 2004, Mr Goebbels, as I have explained on behalf of the Commission many, many times.
The second reason why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission is that the UCITS Contact Committee's mandate was discussed by Parliament at first reading.
Parliament then gave its full support to the mandate of the UCITS Contact Committee.
Indeed, the first common position fully incorporated what this Parliament wanted.
So I suggest that Mr Goebbels does not back-track on what Parliament has previously agreed.
The third reason why that amendment is unacceptable to the Commission is that accepting it would lead to an institutional dispute in conciliation and seriously put at risk the adoption of both directives.
That is the last thing the Commission and - I assume - this Parliament would want.
So let us agree on Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
In particular, I would address the following words to Mr Purvis, who referred to the United States' system, which is different from the European system.
Depositing is fundamental for the European system.
We are going to consider updating, following the Ecofin Council of December that the European form of UCITS need capital because they cannot assume debts in order to provide themselves with working capital.
That is possible in the United States.
Therefore the need to provide such undertakings in the United States with capital is less than in Europe.
Once again, the European undertakings cannot use debts for their working capital and therefore must provide themselves with capital.
I believe the vote will be taken tomorrow and I hope we can now agree to Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 and to the proposals as such.
This would allow us to move ahead constructively for the sake of European investors, European industry and the European economy.
I hope that after twelve years of discussions these proposals can now find their way to the statute book.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
International monetary system
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0302/2001) by Mr Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the international monetary system.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to the International Monetary Fund, the world experienced 120 monetary crises between 1975 and 2000.
A monetary crisis is defined as the depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in one year.
It was always the real economy that paid the price for this financial instability.
Less growth, less employment and more misery accompany financial crises.
We should therefore view the need for financial stability as being in the public good.
Public authorities are called upon to prevent, or otherwise to manage as best they can, any crisis.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has commissioned me to produce this own-initiative report.
I have experienced some difficulties with the rules laid down by the Bureau of our Parliament.
My report was too long, as if it was possible to deal with the complexity of international monetary relations in five pages.
The Meltzer report, in the American Congress, was some one hundred pages long.
The Meltzer committee, made up of congressmen, scientists, bankers and trade unionists inspired a lively international debate.
My humble report, and the motion for a resolution, will certainly not inspire a similar debate.
In order to carry more weight, our Parliament should have followed a procedure similar to that of the American Congress, that is, by means of a collective report, with detailed proposals.
The motion for a resolution is restricted to certain essential issues.
My report hinges on the notions of transparency and accountability, regulation and solidarity.
In 2000, the private sector transferred about twenty times more resources to the developing countries than the World Bank and the other multilateral banks.
Open financial markets will lead to significant increases in efficiency for world exchanges so long as they are provided with a better framework.
The international financial institutions must become truly universal.
The monetary fund must become more democratic.
The super majority of 95% must be abolished for all important decisions.
It gives a right of veto to the United States and to the Union, if it is also able to unite within the International Monetary Fund.
A regular rise in quotas and the issuing of special drawing rights is needed, in accordance with the growth of the world economy.
Common rules and standards should be applied on an international level.
We need a legal and judicial framework allowing for the rapid resolution of insolvency crises.
The private sector should be involved in the management of crises, in particular by means of the general application of collective action clauses.
This involvement should extend to the freezing of debt service payments.
This will allow a reduction in moral uncertainties and in the cost of restructuring programmes.
Better prevention of crises requires increased supervision of off-balance sheet operations.
In particular, we must toughen the prudential requirements imposed on banks when they serve to offset hedge funds.
Europe must become more active in international bodies.
In this respect, the ECB must be more involved.
The European system of central banks must be designed as a body for coordinating the Union' s supervision and control authorities.
One of the conclusions of my report is that the Tobin tax will not work.
In fact it would have terrible economic consequences.
Why penalise transactions between strong currencies, which make up more than 95% of international currency transactions, on the basis of a desire to prevent speculation against the currencies of developing countries.
The Chilean encaja would achieve better results.
Nevertheless, I welcome the decision of the ECOFIN Council to invite the Commission to prepare a report on this issue which I hope will make the decision much more objective.
My report puts great stress on the need to settle the problem of third-world debt as soon as possible.
This debt should be partly cancelled and partly rescheduled, so as to allow the developing countries to repay the amounts up to a limit of 5% of their annual exports.
The London Agreement of 1953 laid down such provisions in favour of Germany.
This was the basis of the German post-war economic miracle.
This could also be the basis for a new economic partnership between all nations, the beginning of a true globalisation.
Settling the problem of third-world debt would allow the internal development of these countries and would cement the victory against poverty and ignorance and therefore against intolerance and terrorism.
Mr President, one could, with reference to Mr Goebbels' report, say that it was worth it in the end.
It is an own-initiative report dating back as far as 1999, when it was prompted by the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil.
In the meantime, there has been a succession of further small crises, and we have got on with our work.
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group wholeheartedly agreed with the basic line taken by the rapporteur, not least because you, Mr Goebbels, took up a clear position on the Tobin tax.
The international monetary system is undergoing transformation, as is clear from your report.
We want to bring proposals into this process of transformation, but we can also see that the euro has firmly established itself since 1999 and has fully proved itself as an anchor giving stability to the global economy.
That in itself is an important contribution by Europe to stabilising the international monetary system.
Mr Goebbels has done a sound job of work, something I want to emphasise here today.
For that reason, we are in substantial agreement with his proposals: the improved supervision of banking, surveillance of international financial activities, greater powers for international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank to really get to grips with crisis situations.
As you have just said, the IMF must become more democratic.
Above all else, it must fit into the overall scheme of things so that it does not become the bogeyman of crisis management.
Of course, the states must work together in this, for financial means alone will not overcome crises.
We agree with closer collaboration at international level between national supervisory and regulatory authorities, a stronger coordinating role for the European Central Bank, something that has still not been resolved, and which we would remind you is overdue - the establishment of an observatory for systemic risks at the Bank for International Cooperation, and continued efforts at reform of the international monetary system.
We share Mr Goebbels' view - contested in their proposals by our Green colleagues - that the Tobin tax does not belong in this report.
Looking through the proposals, I noted that the Group of the Party of European Socialists also, according to Amendment No 10, wants this to be checked up on, even though it does refer to an ECOFIN Council resolution.
On that point we take a completely different view.
We agree with your basic approach and we will be asking for a separate vote on this subject.
Introducing such a tax, whose technical problems cannot in any case be resolved, would imperil the transfer of capital and thus also put at risk the advantages of global division of labour, investment and employment.
That is why we are opposed to it, but will vote for your report without a Tobin tax, and against it with one.
Mr President, thank you for your willingness to allow us this pleasure late in the evening.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
We support this report because it gives the right solutions to the issues of the new financial architecture which must be created, of reform as a whole and of crisis management - solutions which also deal practically with the needs of regions hit by crises, the requirements of international financial markets and the very important need of all societies for stability in financial markets.
I would like to emphasise again that I believe stability in financial markets to be a public good to which all citizens are entitled.
Taking a look at the situation we are in, I cannot resist making an observation.
International financial activity on the currency markets has, in fact, decreased to around USD 1 200 billion a day, and that is due to the creation of the monetary union, which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable.
At the same time, though, we must note that during the course of the nineties we were dealing with a twenty-five-fold turnover increase in derivative trading such as swaps, options and so on. We know that, now, not even 3% of the transactions have to do with the real market in goods and services.
I believe it to be important that we should look at the flow of capital under the influence of globalisation in terms both, on the one hand, of the yield accruing to institutional investors and of the economic and social situation, and on the other, from the point of view of the capital-importing countries.
In this connection, we have to bear in mind that 75% of the capital invested flows into only twelve states, and that only 1% of the capital invested flows to black Africa.
The rapporteur is right to demand that we now move to a consolidation, and that can only be done if we write off debt more comprehensively than we have done before.
Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous.
Presupposing stable development, they contribute to growth and employment.
Despite that, there are still economic and social deficits and a lack of regulation and supervision.
The report points that out.
Concern about speculative commitments to the detriment of the real economy and the excessive volatility of the market brought about by an enormous increase in transaction volume for certain financial products are factors which make a reform of the international financial architecture more necessary than ever.
We have lived through 120 currency crises, and they cannot be abolished.
We have not yet succeeded in developing a working system of early warning indicators, in making information transparent and in drawing up a code of conduct that works for everyone, and we have not yet solved the problem of moral hazard.
So I consider it very important that this report's demands should influence the EU's negotiations, and the EU, too, must speak with one voice at the international level.
It is not just about us having a monetary zone, but we must also speak with one voice internationally on financial market policy and on issues of the world's financial architecture.
The introduction of the euro is a contribution to financial stability, and our financial system is better protected against external shocks, but we must move on, for the monetary union is only one contribution to stability in Europe and the world.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
We, in the Liberal Group, welcome the thrust of the report, because it grapples with the real issues and it avoids the sort of populist solutions which, I am afraid, are on offer in many of the amendments before this House.
I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax.
It is, of course, the case that nobody, particularly liberals in favour of free inquiry, could object to the Commission's study on this subject.
But I frankly believe that this is a false promise which really offers very little practical benefit to the countries that we are all, I hope, trying to help.
Instead, the report quite correctly identifies as a potential model, the Chilean deposit system, which introduces an incentive for investors to invest long-term in an emerging market rather than going for short term paper because that involves a longer-term investment for depositors.
That is the right way to go, and therefore I very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for all the energy and intellect he has invested in his report.
We regret that the motion for a resolution presented to us does not in the end meet the expectations of the explanatory statement which he had drawn up, and that is why we have thought it appropriate to introduce certain amendments aimed at reinforcing the political message of the report.
The first category of amendments relates to the 'organisational' aspect of the International Monetary Fund, which we believe to be currently in an unacceptable situation.
That is why we are taking up an idea put forward by Jacques Delors, in this case that of an economic and social security council within the United Nations.
We would like the Commission and the Council to express their views on this issue at the Council to be held next spring in Barcelona.
Furthermore, we believe that the decision-making procedures and the composition of the governing body of the International Monetary Fund should be substantially reviewed.
The second great area on which we would like to express our view is the need to combat terrorism, which has an extremely important financial dimension.
This is why we feel there is an additional reason to make the recommendations of the FATF binding and to increase its mandate, as also requested by the European Council in Ghent.
I believe that this would supplement the report.
Finally, with regard to capital flows - in particular exchange operations - I will say no more, personally, about the Tobin tax, but I will nevertheless continue to demand an in-depth debate on taxes which could discourage speculative assaults on the currencies of a number of countries.
In this respect, I believe there are some interesting proposals that deserve to be supported.
Mr President, despite the flashy title of this report - 'How the international monetary system can be made to work better' - these insipid formulae are certainly not going to prevent future crises.
The only purpose of this report is to justify an economic system which is irrational, anarchic and socially unjust.
You, the defenders of capitalism, are totally incapable of regulating this economy which is based on the quest for profit and competition.
Because it cannot be regulated.
The only imaginable regulation is that which the most powerful impose on others, but they do so to their own benefit.
The desire to democratise the IMF, which is controlled by the United States, is also ridiculous.
The rapporteur recognises that the risk of financial instability is inherent to the operation of the economy.
This is undoubtedly the case for your capitalist economy, but the seizure of social wealth and the means of production by a limited number of financial and industrial groups, their rivalry and their speculation, will come to an end.
For future generations, the immense wastage and patent stupidity of your economy will serve as a demonstration that, in relation to the control of its collective life, humanity had not yet moved beyond barbarism.
Mr President, the rapporteur deserves support in his endeavours to achieve greater financial stability.
He is right to call for tighter supervision, although that does not rule out a crisis.
Interestingly, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund has shifted towards more focused support.
This role of catalyst in stages of growth can preclude negative effects of the policy, such as an increase in the burden of debt for up-and-coming countries.
The rapporteur' s request to coordinate a number of matters at European level is understandable.
If these do not follow naturally on from global policies, Europe' s own policy would undermine the strength of the system as a whole.
Finally, I cannot see a role for the European Central Bank in global crisis prevention.
Only a few months ago, the ECB was asked to absorb the slow-down in growth, although there was no reason to reduce interest rates within Europe.
Striking a compromise between European policy and global requirements does not seem to be benefiting international stability.
Mr President, the large number of monetary crises and the negative consequences they have for the global economy as a whole require joint action.
There are many who believe that the introduction of a tax on global financial transactions could prevent future financial crises.
Personally, I am glad that this opinion is not held by many in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I do not believe that introduction of the Tobin tax could prevent financial crises.
Let capital make its way to where it is of the greatest use, in other words, let it be invested in new markets, developing countries and so on. By that means, growth can be produced.
If we now make the transfer of capital expensive and limit and regulate it, the effect would only be counter-productive.
Introducing it would also make sense only if it could be done internationally and without loopholes.
This seems impossible, so that this tax will result only in additional burdens, bureaucracy and so forth, without the actual objective - the limitation of financial crises - being able to be achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the rapporteur.
That has already been said.
There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly.
First, we want to make the international monetary system more stable, because financial stability is, among other things, a public good and a basic economic precondition for growth, employment and social justice - that is to say, a moral duty.
Second, we demand not simply a reform of the IMF, we require of the public authorities the moral obligation to create optimum balance between the free play of markets and the need for them to be regulated in accordance with the fundamental principle of the eco-social market economy, and to guarantee a balance between the public and private sectors in public rescue measures in times of crisis.
We demand of the Member States economic policies geared to growth and employment, and we demand the cancellation of debt, subject to appropriate economic and political conditions.
Third, we begin at home.
The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world.
The response of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after 11 September was one of stability in the face of the crisis.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response.
The Commission and the European Parliament have, by a majority, expressed their opposition to the Tobin tax, and the LiÃšge resolutions include measures as correctives to globalisation.
Fourth, we oppose measures to slow down economic development and ideologically motivated attempts to undo the Stability and Growth Pact or introduce the Tobin tax on its own, which create insecurity among those who work in the market.
So I also regret that the Social Democrats' Amendment No 10 reinterprets the actual LiÃšge resolution by inserting the Tobin tax.
Remove this reinterpretation; in LiÃšge we find ourselves.
Mr President, I was astonished to read the briefing by Parliament' s Information Office, which presented the Goebbels report as follows: 'In a resolution on the operation of the International Monetary System, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is critical of the introduction of a Tobin tax on financial speculations' .
This appears to be the headline which is supposed to attract the press, and this still appears to be the subject around which the debates here revolve.
In my opinion, this does not at all do justice to the balanced and excellent report by Mr Goebbels.
To start with, the resolution does not in any way speak in favour of, or against, the Tobin tax.
The extensive explanatory statement does contain a few observations, but what is more important is that it also contains many other alternatives in order to achieve the two objectives pursued by those in favour of the Tobin tax.
Capital movements and foreign exchange markets must be founded more on actual economic reality and must be directed towards long-term investments and financial stability by taking a number of measures, but also by adopting a more flexible stance with regard to developing countries.
Their debts should be cancelled and they must be granted an appropriate way of refinancing in order to be given a new lease of life.
Actually, one could say that, in fact, this report fits in perfectly with the Tobin tax action points. It would be unfortunate if the report were seen as an opposing force, for I believe that it complements the Tobin tax well.
In an amendment tabled by my group, a proposal has been formulated in an entirely neutral way that was also formulated in the ECOFIN Council.
This amendment warmly welcomes the proposal by the ECOFIN Council to carry out such a study and further analysis.
That seems to be far more fruitful than another instance of polarisation concerning the method: yes or no to the Tobin tax.
In this way, those in favour of the Tobin tax can again endorse the objectives which are now actually on the agenda, and those against can be pleased about the fact that research can be carried out in a neutral way and that the objectives, namely, better management of capital movements and more opportunities for developing countries, can be achieved.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Goebbels on his report.
This is an interesting report that goes into considerable depth in an attempt to explore the various issues it raises and its resolution is informed and balanced.
In our opinion, the report makes a constructive contribution to a debate of fundamental political importance and, furthermore, is very timely.
The debate on how to create a better-working international monetary and financial system lies at the heart of our task of responding to globalisation.
Private capital flows - and the report also takes this view - are the main source of growth, prosperity and productivity.
If our objective is to ensure that countries, both developed and developing, are able to take full advantage of the benefits of globalisation, the best option that I can picture is for financial markets and their operations to merge.
Broad-based, deep-rooted and fluid financial markets will make funding investment easier, which will, in turn, enable economic operators to spread their risks more effectively.
This situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors, which will be of benefit not only to developing countries, but also to small and medium-sized businesses in our own countries.
The economic benefits generated by the globalisation of finance are the result of the links between markets and operators having become stronger.
Because of the nature of these links, the upsets passed on within a modern economy as a consequence of this process of globalisation are more rapid, for the very reason that borders that existed twenty years ago have disappeared.
It is true that amongst the risks we will have to face, there will be financial markets with excessively volatile exchange rates and share prices.
A 'contagious' effect can occur between one country and others and it is possible that capital flows will fluctuate.
Within the Economic and Monetary Union we have stimulated stability and growth by means of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which are fundamental factors for strengthening our economy and for preventing - or rather, fighting against - these financial upsets.
Economic and Monetary Union, therefore, contributes to improving the stability of the international situation in our region.
It is also true, however, that various alternatives have been put forward across the world.
I agree with the thesis of Mr Goebbels' s report.
There are no panaceas that will help us confront the challenge of consolidating the global financial system.
The report makes this point very clear and I hope that its resolution will be read not only by those for whom this document is officially intended and who have a professional interest in these matters. I hope that it is also read by the people who are - legitimately - concerned at the direction in which the process of international economic and financial integration is heading.
The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context, which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the LiÃšge Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation, which we are intending to present next February.
What has been happening in recent years?
I would say that since the crises in Asia, we have made substantial progress.
Efforts have been made to improve macroeconomic conditions, economies are today more resistant to external shocks and the number of countries choosing to abide by internationally agreed codes and standards in order to make their economies more transparent is continually increasing.
The G7 ministers and the Monetary Fund have made progress in a few key areas, such as, for example, the international financial institutions, which clearly act with greater transparency these days.
There is also the International Monetary Fund itself, which has increased its capacity and is fine-tuning its instruments so that they will enable it to analyse, assess and oversee the stability of the financial system more efficiently.
I would also say that coordination between the various national supervisory authorities has improved substantially.
Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels as a result of these improvements.
Much still remains to be done and, in its report, Parliament shows the correct way forward.
The Commission is quite happy to accept your view that we must ensure full participation by the private sector in solving and managing financial crises.
Not only in order to ensure that responsibilities in times of crisis are shared in an equitable way, but also that the private sector is appropriately and systematically involved, which is crucial to effective crisis prevention, thereby preventing dangerous and, ultimately, unsustainable, risk situations from arising.
I do, therefore, take note of the call for the Commission to consider the viability of introducing clauses for collective action on financial instruments such as securities.
You all know as well as I do that the Member States do not fully agree with this position but it is a point of view that the Commission takes seriously, as we do all references to the fight against the funding of terrorism.
The 11 September attacks have brought to the fore the abuses of the financial system by terrorists and the Commission has already adopted certain measures in this field.
You have also made an effective contribution by finalising the codecision procedure on the second directive on money laundering.
Nevertheless, we must keep making progress in this area.
We are now in the early days of a process which will be long and we must continue working in this direction over the coming months.
It is important that we make rapid progress on each of the proposals that provide valuable instruments for combating the funding of terrorism.
I wish to make a brief comment on one point that is still a source of some frustration to us, and that is the external representation of the European Union.
The explanatory statement of the motion for a resolution refers to Europe' s conspicuous absence from the debate on a new financial architecture.
You criticise the fact that the isolated initiatives of some Member States do not form a European policy.
The Commission can only agree with this analysis.
So how do we respond?
What can we do?
How can we improve the situation?
I would say that it is not simply a matter of improving coordination and of speaking with one voice.
Economic and Monetary Union has undoubtedly transformed the blueprint of worldwide financial and monetary relations, but the way in which we continue to address these issues in the main organisations and forums, including the Monetary Fund and the G7, is still based, to a large extent, on a purely national concept.
I can, therefore, only agree on the need to make progress.
I think we will find it very difficult to formulate a meaningful policy in this area unless we clearly state our European positions as such at world level.
This will require a more appropriate and clearly defined external representation of our interests.
I am aware, however, that it will be very difficult to make progress in this direction unless we first make progress on the substance.
Focusing the battle solely on our representation abroad is not as important as defining our own positions and producing coordinated policies on external matters.
These two steps must be made in the same direction and at the same time.
And on these points, Parliament can be sure that the Commission will continue to make progress.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 8.47 p.m.)
I have taken note of what you have said.
The President will, of course, be duly informed.
Decision on urgent procedure
Mr President, I recommend that urgent procedure be applied to this document because it would also make it easier for China to take part in the forthcoming meeting in Doha.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the separate customs territory of Chinese Taipei (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu) to the World Trade Organisation
[COM(2001) 518 - C5-0488/01 - 2001/0216(CNS)]
Mr President, the same argument in favour of urgent procedure applies in this case as applied to the previous matter, namely, that Taiwan too should be able to take part in the meeting in Doha.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Community incentive measures in the field of employment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0319/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment [8432/1/2001 - C5-0294/2001 - 2000/0195(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Jensen).
Madam Commissioner, the EU' s employment policy is one of open cooperation in which the Member States set common goals, exchange experiences and evaluate each other' s results and employment policies. It is an open process in which the individual country itself chooses which funds it will use in order to achieve the common goals.
We, in Parliament, should also like to see the process become more open by involving and engaging the general public more. The report we are debating today is about the implementation of Article 129 of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning employment policy incentives.
It is about appropriations to the work on employment policy over the next five years and about money for analyses, statistics, conferences and reports etc.
Employment policy is to be evaluated in 2003. It will be the first open coordination to be evaluated, and the money for employment policy is also to be used for this evaluation.
At Parliament' s first reading, we adopted 17 amendments to the Commission' s proposal, covering the following themes.
We should like to see the social partners and local and regional authorities more involved in the process, and we should like to see greater focus placed upon the ways in which information and employment policy affects a broader public.
We should like to see more focus on the equal treatment of women in employment policy; we should like to receive some further proposals concerning Parliament' s involvement; and we should like to look at the connection with other Community activities.
Last but not least, we should like to see pilot projects to increase information about employment policy at local and regional levels and help develop relevant strategies. As a result, Parliament proposed an increase in the budget.
The Council thereupon accepted a number of Parliament' s amendments, including those aimed at involving the local and regional levels and at involving the social partners more.
Some of the proposals concerning greater focus on equality have also been accepted, but the Council did not want to accept some very central proposals from Parliament.
Against that background, there was a great deal of support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for Parliament' s re-tabling those proposals from the first reading that the Council did not accept.
A majority of Parliament has campaigned for a long time for local and regional efforts to be incorporated into employment policy, and we have pointed out that the exchange of experiences and methods with those operating at local level and working in a voluntary capacity could be financed via Article 129.
That is because it is clearly characteristic of unemployment in the EU to be focused in regions and local areas and in pockets of poverty where there are islands of unemployment. Local efforts are central when it comes to getting people into work.
That is why it makes good sense to talk about local action plans and about the exchange of experiences and information from this work.
I am quite convinced that greater focus on local efforts will make all of us much wiser about the new avenues that might be explored in employment policy.
We have supported local employment initiatives by means of preparatory action, for which there has been a budget line called B5-503, and it is Parliament' s desire that this initiative should be followed up and continued via pilot projects under Article 129.
Perhaps the expression 'projects' is misleading, for we want, of course, to see a development of the methodical work carried out, that is to say analyses and studies and the development of statistics and methods.
We do not wish, under Article 129, to finance projects with the project-oriented and experimental character of projects financed under Article 6 of the Social Fund.
There is therefore no question of our wanting to duplicate things that are already happening under the aegis of the Social Fund.
On the contrary. There are many of us who are happy about the open coordination method of employment policy, for it enables the Member States to improve their results in employment policy, learn from each other' s experiences and actually compete to obtain better results.
There will not, however, be very much of that healthy competition as long as employment policy and the 'Luxembourg process' are as unfamiliar to people as they are at present.
In many countries' national parliaments, there is no debate on national employment plans. Nor are there any other activities that might make the process and the results better known and create more grassroots support.
Is political coordination based on analyses and statistics debated by the same politicians, officials and experts at conferences around the EU really binding enough?
No, let us obtain a much greater awareness of results and objectives, so that governments encounter much greater commitment and a desire for everyone to achieve the results obtained in those countries which have most success in employment policy.
Mr President, after first congratulating and thanking Mrs Jensen for her good work, I would like to start my speech with reference to the fact that last Sunday, in Galicia - my country - a former Member of this European Parliament, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, founder of the Spanish Popular Party, obtained, for the fourth time running, an absolute majority in the elections to the Galician Parliament.
I mention this because, during its twelve years in power, the Fraga government has been constantly concerned about the issues and problems arising from the lack of employment in Galicia, and for this reason, during the latest election campaign, it made a commitment to providing jobs for the young unemployed under the age of 30 consisting of a one-year contract for those who have been out of work or unemployed for six consecutive years.
This concern about employment, as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty and which takes the form of a European Community action for promoting the coordination of employment policies in Member States, confirmed by the special European Councils on employment in Luxembourg and Lisbon, which resolutely advocate a global employment strategy, implies and demands a systematic mobilisation of all Community employment policies, whether these be framework policies or support policies.
If we want to become a knowledge-based economy that is both competitive and dynamic, able to grow economically in a sustainable fashion, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion, so that we can once again meet the conditions necessary for full employment, we should encourage the coordination of employment policies between Member States, upholding, of course, the right to make decisions that correspond to the particular circumstances of each Member State, the exchange of good practices, including the aforementioned forms of participation for social partners and also local and regional authorities, without forgetting the need for the coordination of policies directed towards the creation of employment.
I therefore think that the commitment made by Mr Fraga Iribarne is good practice that could be exported or exchanged with others.
It will provide Galician youth with the chance to become integrated into the labour market, make it easier for them to gain the necessary training and experience, both in their quest for a first job as well as subsequently being able to keep that job or to move on to other jobs.
I think that this is good practice, in the same way that the practice for the conciliation of family life with professional life was also good, another initiative of the Galician government.
Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mrs Jensen for a brilliant report.
It is a good day today, for today' s vote should show that we are now all endorsing the fact that employment policy is not just something made behind desks at meetings of the Council of Ministers, but is something that must be rolled out among the people.
Information must be provided about it, and the local authorities that are to help set these things in motion must also be involved.
That is what we are voting on today.
There are many good things in Mrs Jensen' s report.
I would emphasise what we have agreed concerning the local dimension of employment policy.
Gradually, we have got the Commission and the Council to realise that local and regional authorities, the social partners and non-profit organisations are important in the context of employment initiatives.
Practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally.
That is why room must be made for local players.
However, support for local initiatives is required, for example, in the form of better information about what the common European employment policy is and what the objectives are.
That is why it is important for us to put incentive measures in place and for us to appropriate some money to enable us to learn from each other' s methods and experiences. That, moreover, is what we are trying to do here today.
That is why it is also disappointing that it has been difficult to get the Commission to agree to increasing the budget so that we might appropriate this money, and that is why we, in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have naturally endorsed the need to increase the amount to EUR 55 million, and not EUR 50 million.
I hope that we obtain broad support today and that the Commission and the Council are alert to the signal from Parliament today.
Mr Pronk, after the Commissioner' s speech, we will see whether your pessimism is justified.
Mr President, we support Mrs Jensen's report because it is based on concepts and policies which we fully endorse.
To start with, we need to make sure the citizens of the Union know what the European Employment Strategy is.
That is the only way they can perceive our common objectives and add their ideas to the Luxembourg process and it is the only way to ensure the relevant national, regional and local authorities benefit from the best practices which have proven to be efficient in other areas of the Union, such as those which the honourable Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez has just mentioned.
Mrs Jensen's other proposal concerns the role of local society in both planning and implementing employment policies.
We must make ensure that all the Member States understand that it is crucial for the social partners and civil society to be involved if this effort to increase employment is to be effective.
And the Member States must change their structures and implement measures to create institutions and resources which will allow local employment pacts to be applied. On the other hand, the European Union also needs to back these structures with its policies, advice and resources.
We already have experience of numerous countries, including Greece, in which local employment pacts have failed to work.
In some cases, they were policies applied by the central administration to encourage a few additional measures in areas with problems; they did not mobilise local society and they did not have the required results.
I am sure other areas in the Union have had similar bad experiences, which is why we believe that the measures proposed by the honourable Member and other policies in this sector of the European Union should be coordinated and dealt with at European and national level in order to give new impetus to employment planning and implementation at local level.
Mr President, I will try, as you request, to transform Mr Pronk's pessimism to optimism!
This programme gives effect to Article 129 of the Treaty which provides that incentive measures may be adopted in order to encourage cooperation between Member States and support their action in the field of employment.
Here I very much agree with what Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has already said: it is not a matter of employment or a matter of Council meetings, it is a matter of real cooperation between the Member States.
The programme underpins the European Employment Strategy and provides for activities to ensure its continuing effectiveness.
It is important that it is going to be adopted in the near future and I am hopeful that outstanding concerns expressed in the 14 amendments submitted can be resolved satisfactorily.
In its amended proposal the Commission, after the first reading, accepted in full or in part 12 of the 17 amendments tabled by Parliament.
The common position which you have been considering, while significantly different in format and presentation from the amended proposal, contains resonances of the ten amendments.
In relation to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept nine of them in full or in part.
Those are Amendments Nos 1-8 and 14.
I should like to specify exactly what I accept.
Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full.
In Amendment No 4, I very much welcome the reference to special attention to groups subject to multiple discrimination in their access to the labour market and I share your concerns that we should be able to understand, monitor and analyse developments in mainstreaming by establishing indicators.
I do not consider it appropriate, however, to enter into details on specific studies to be carried out and cannot accept this part of the amendment.
On Amendment No 5, I am very pleased with the emphasis you introduce with regard to the importance of promoting public knowledge of the European Employment Strategy and further encouraging individuals and organisations at all levels to contribute to enhancing its impact and effectiveness.
This programme should and will assist in the realisation of those objectives.
However, assigning funding for the 'projects' in this context is not appropriate, and I have to reject that part of Amendment No 5.
Our diverging views on Amendment No 5 may lie more in the wording used than in any disagreement on its intent.
Local projects involving local actors are funded through Article 6 and the European Social Fund regulation, as well as through another budget line - B5-503.
The latter is available exclusively for the funding of local development projects.
The analysis, research and evaluation work which it incorporates will include measures, informed by the outcomes of the projects delivered under other budget lines, to assess how knowledge of the European Employment Strategy, and local level involvement in its delivery, might be further improved.
I hope that this approach will meet your concerns.
With regard to Amendment No 8, I again fully subscribe to the principle of consistency and accept this part but I cannot agree to specify each linked programme.
Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are taken on board in spirit by the inclusion of Amendment No 1, and Amendment No 14, I can fully support.
Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 9-13.
I will briefly explain why: Amendments Nos 9 and 10 concern the committee.
While I am grateful for your support for the Commission's role and the re-institution of an advisory committee, this is a lost fight with the Council.
Looking at the legal framework and recent precedents, a mixed committee is a fair compromise.
We could look at the mandate in future discussions to see if this could be adopted to meet your concerns as part of a global compromise.
On the annual plans in Amendment No 11, this is an internal Commission question which has no place in a Parliament and Council decision.
Amendment No 12 also has to be rejected on institutional grounds and more specifically with reference to the framework agreement on interinstitutional relationships.
Finally, regarding Amendment No 13, we maintain the EUR 55 million initially proposed.
We have made a thorough analysis and this is an adequate figure for the activities envisaged.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 14; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 8; it rejects Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
It is clear that some issues have to be resolved; some of them are more sensitive than others.
I have, however, taken the most positive approach possible to the amendments which you have tabled.
Accordingly, I am hopeful that, with your cooperation and that of the Council, we can soon identify a compromise which is acceptable to all.
I once again reiterate the urgency of this matter and the Commission's resolve to help find workable compromises.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Informing and consulting employees
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0325/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on a common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community
[9919/1/2001 - C5-0388/2001 - 1998/0315(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Ghilardotti).
Mr President, the information, consultation and participation of employees assumed primary importance in the European debate as far back as 1974, when the first social action programme was adopted by the Council.
Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance.
Almost all the Member States have a legislative or contractual legal framework in place intended to guarantee the information and consultation of employees.
This directive proposes the introduction of minimum information and consultation standards which would be implemented throughout Union territory: after the European Company Statute, the European Works Council Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the directive before us today completes the existing Community and national frameworks, thus contributing to the ultimate purpose of the law in question which is to ensure that adequate preparations are made for the change, that restructuring takes place under acceptable conditions and that due importance is given to the employment objective in the current situation.
The Commission presented its proposal - a sound proposal - in November 1998, and the European Parliament concluded its first reading in April 1999, adopting a series of amendments to improve it.
Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position.
In general terms, the common position reflects the position adopted by the Commission following Parliament' s first reading but, if we compare the first reading of the European Parliament with the common position, we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by Parliament were not actually accepted.
As rapporteur, I called upon the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not to repropose all the amendments adopted at first reading but concentrate on the most important points in order to improve the common position.
My colleagues - whom I would like to thank for their cooperation - put forward 15 amendments to my proposal, almost all of which serve to reinforce it.
After an in-depth debate, we came up with the text on which the House is to vote today.
There are 16 amendments and they concern: the procedures for consulting employees, and these are in line with the common position but more specific in identifying problems; the definition of economic and financial information; the exact definition of 'social partners' , in order to avoid ambiguities; the protection of employees' representatives, which needs to be better defined in terms of protection against disadvantage with regard to career, wage and training; suspension of decisions which could result in substantial negative consequences for employees, so that the taking of a final decision can be deferred for a suitable period at the request of employees' representatives in order to allow time for further negotiation and for a solution acceptable to all parties to be found.
Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point.
We do not feel that specific transitional periods are necessary. Precisely because this directive introduces minimum standard rights, it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously.
The question of penalties is the most sensitive point. It has provoked a deluge of lobbies from all sides of the House.
We have decided not to include our initial suggestion of a European penalty with legal effect in our proposal, but we have reinforced the common position, stipulating that it should be the Member States that, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, introduce more stringent penalties for serious violations which impact upon employees.
This is an interpretation of the common position, which states that the Member States must lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency.

Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, firstly because she showed a great deal of flexibility in meetings of the Committee, including taking on board a series of proposals by the European People's Party, and secondly because this has meant that her very good report on the Common Position on the framework directive for minimum standards in national employee information and consultation points in the right direction.
As with the directive on European works councils, the issue is not codetermination, but information and consultation on important economic, financial and employment policy developments in business.
Restructuring cannot and should not be hindered, but it must no longer take place in the form of a commando raid, as so often happens - witness Renault's shock at Vilvoorde - but only following prior notification of the employees concerned.
There are, though, many parallels with the works councils directive in other respects.
The regulations on European works councils apply only to mergers of businesses across national boundaries, but restructuring often takes place at a national level.
The European People's Party favours flexibility.
For example, management and labour in a business can, through agreements, arrive at a special made-to-measure arrangement on information and consultation for that business.
That is subsidiarity.
The Common Position says rightly that agreements should be able to be more, or even less, favourable than the minimum standard.
Yet, the rights of local works councils may not be jeopardised under national law.
Article 1 prescribes that the procedure should be carried on in a spirit of cooperation.
This means partnership. Partnership aims on the one hand at the clear representation of interests, and on the other hand at their conciliation in shared dialogue through information and consultation.
There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous.
Inadequate information results in insecurity, mistrust, and finally only fear, ending in blockade.
Timely information means transparency that creates trust and avoids businesses making friction losses.
Both workers and employers are winners, and in the same way.
Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti has already indicated how difficult it has been to present this issue for second reading.
My group' s first priority, therefore, is to bring this issue to an end at long last and to have it published in the Official Journal.
We thus hope that agreement with the Council will be reached in the near future.
This is also evident from the stance adopted by our group, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated.
We dropped a huge number of amendments from first reading and concentrated in the committee on a number of compromise texts, on which it must be possible to reach agreement, in our view.
For example, we deleted the precious point on Tendenzschutz, which we would have liked to have seen scrapped.
Neither will we be backing the Group of the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group on this matter in the framework of reaching a compromise.
However, we hope that the PPE-DE will continue to support the compromise proposals we reached in committee.
The differences of opinion with the Council mainly revolve around two key points: the provisions on sanctions and the unnecessarily long transitional periods.
I should like to note that these are not points which we have added but, rather, points which the Council has added to the Commission position.
Parliament is not asking for points to be added.
In this case, it is the Council which is departing from the Commission proposal.
I will briefly comment on those two points.
With regard to the sanction provisions, Mr Menrad has also already communicated their importance in order for the directive to be taken really seriously.
In this connection, I would like to refer to the experience in my own country.
In the Netherlands, this kind of sanction exists in legislation pertaining to works councils.
Precisely those provisions have an extremely preventative effect.
It is not often that legal steps are required, but the very fact that it is possible to take these steps means that very intense consultations are often held.
With regard to closures and transfers which need to take place, a very broad support structure is created and sound consultations are held.
That is very important for industrial relations, in my opinion.
The second point concerns transitional periods.
I already stated last week, at a meeting which Mr Bushill-Matthews had organised with an English association of people who, in fact, propagate the idea of employee participation, that it strikes me as bizarre that they call for a much longer transitional period.
If one considers - as they did - that information and consultation are very important, not only to employees but also to employers and to the company' s performance, then one must ensure that this measure is introduced very promptly.
One should not ask for longer transitional periods, for that gives British industry entirely the wrong signal.
I would therefore ask you to reconsider this and to support these conventional transitional periods, as proposed by the Commission, after all.
Come what may, based on the experience which we have gathered in the Netherlands with an act that has been in force for more than 50 years, it appears that industrial relations have improved as a result.
Mr President, I, too, wish to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the sound and skilful work she has done on this report. I also wish, in particular, to thank her for her understanding of the minority views that may be adopted by a Danish MEP in this situation, for we have a special system of consultation and cooperation in the labour market which creates problems for us from time to time.
We all agree, of course, that information and consultation and a good social dialogue are important.
It has become a part of modern management to attach importance to these things, to involve employees and to talk about learning organisations, so enabling companies to develop better.
I believe it is important that, when we talk about these matters, we do not only view information and consultation as part and parcel of restructuring and the reduction of the labour force, but as also being a part of day-to-day work in which it takes a long time to build up mutual confidence and that reciprocal dialogue that can be of value both to employees and companies in a crisis situation and which may also perhaps play a part in preventing crises from breaking out within companies.
We have had a long period in which it was difficult getting everyone to understand the need for revising this directive, and revision has been blocked by a majority of the Council.
Denmark has been a part of that blocking majority, not because we are nervous about having rules on information and consultation - we have in actual fact had stringent rules on these matters from as far back as 1960 - but because we are afraid that common rules might create problems for the system we think works well in practice.
It would, of course, be an irony of fate if common rules were to be destructive in an area in which matters are operating well.
Flexibility is a key word when it comes to drawing up the common rules, but there must not of course be so much flexibility that the required information and consultation does not occur in those places in which these things have not been emphasised.
I must say, therefore, that, on the whole, my group is able to support Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals.
We have some problems where the sanctions are concerned, and I must say that the Council' s solution is an extremely fine balance that it is very difficult not to upset.
There is therefore a single point in regard to which we cannot completely endorse the strict rules indicated in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report but in regard to which we prefer to endorse the Council' s solution.
On the other hand, I want to say, on the subject of interim arrangements, that it is a question of putting these in place.
Let us now get these matters implemented and not just continue to talk about them.
Information and consultation are not a punishment for business. On the contrary, they are things that promote good business and competitiveness.
Mr President, my group supports the recommendation for second reading, which, moreover, received the very broad approval of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In addition, we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission, perceiving the breakdown in social dialogue, made very timely use of its right of initiative.
This is three years too many, which have been punctuated by social catastrophes, with rapid liquidation of businesses and loss of jobs due to bankruptcy and genuine distortions in Community social law on information and consultation of workers.
While we must not expect miracles from this directive, because it will only apply, at best, to businesses with more than 50 employees and will not single-handedly resolve the fundamental problem, namely that competition law is dominant, this directive may represent a significant step towards harmonising the rights of European Union employees, subject, of course, to it not being stripped of its content and reduced to the smallest common denominator.
This is why it is so important that the Council take into consideration the recommendations proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, particularly Amendment Nos 2 and 12 on sanctions for disregard of the directive.
Although the Council is opposed to European sanctions, the least it can do, in my view, is to accept this compromise position.
We also support amendments which clarify and widen the scope of the information that must be provided to employees' representatives, and the amendment proposing the latter may request a decision' s application be suspended, pending the outcome of new negotiations, where this decision has serious effects on jobs.
If our citizens are to find this directive credible, it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union.
That is why our group asks the Council to support the position submitted to us, and make it impossible for some Member States to evade having to enforce the application of the directive for several more years.
Our group proposes to supplement the draft recommendation by adopting amendments that rule out the possibility of withholding information that the company considers sensitive to its business from employees' representatives, because we are convinced that there are no grounds, that it even constitutes discrimination to introduce an element of suspicion with regard to employees who, by definition, have no less company spirit than the management or shareholders.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, despite the fact that it has welcomed some of the positions adopted by the European Parliament, I find it deplorable that the Council persists in maintaining a proposal for a directive that fails to meet the expectations of workers in the European Union.
When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House.
Examples of these are:
the reference to the planning stage in the definition of consultation, its extension to cover economic and financial developments in the company and the obligation to seek agreement on all issues subject to the information and consultation of workers.
extending consultation in particularly serious cases; extending the concept of a serious breach of the obligations to inform and consult; the implementation of the directive on public administration.
the abolition of the employer' s right to retain particularly sensitive information and the obligation for Member States to promote social dialogue within SMEs.
These are our reasons for supporting Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals, which once again take up the positions adopted at first reading, with particular emphasis on the amendments that seek to step up sanctions and specific legal proceedings in cases where the directive is breached, on suspending decisions at the request of workers' representatives when their implementation has serious consequences for workers, with a view to eliminating or minimising these harmful consequences, on eliminating the transitional periods for the directive' s implementation in Member States that do not have a system of worker consultation and on reducing the period of transposition into national law to two years as well as its implementation in the public sector.
These are positive proposals which, as I said, we support.
I can only regret the fact, however, that the rapporteur has dropped her two proposals on eliminating the option the Council wishes to give employers to, in certain cases, neither inform nor consult their workers, although the rapporteur' s proposals envisage sanctions against employers that fail to act promptly.
The Council' s position, however, opens up loopholes that could prove dangerous for workers and it is, therefore, important to eliminate this possibility.
This is the basic justification for the two amendments that we have tabled in conjunction with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
We hope that a majority in Parliament votes in favour of these and that the Council takes account of the positions that have been put forward here in one of the most sensitive areas of the protection of workers' rights.
Mr President, the subject addressed so well by Mrs Ghilardotti' s report is, as we all know, not a new one, but on past occasions when it was discussed it has never been set out so clearly.
I refer, in particular, to the legislation on European works councils, which has not been transposed by all the Member States and, where it has been transposed, has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners, as has been shown by recent events which, moreover, have been debated in this very House.
Yet Parliament, which has, in the past, been attentive to the issue of employment and openly involved in establishing and guaranteeing the dignity and even the quality of work, and which, moreover, has not hesitated to propose sanctions for the cases I have mentioned which even involved requirements governing the use of European funds for maintaining employment levels, has shown varying degrees of indecision in the debate on this report.
The different attitudes are certainly understandable, given the sensitive nature of some issues such as the enforcement of sanctions, for sanctions do have to be enforced if one wants a requirement to be respected, or the confidentiality granting exemption from the consultation procedure to be removed, even though it is no longer observed, or a transitional period to be granted for the transposal of the directive which is, moreover, unnecessary, given the time frame for its implementation.
The fact is that, both in terms of the continuous implementation of Community law, the continuing hope of ever-increasing cohesion and, lastly, the forthcoming practical introduction of a European Company which would provide greater protection of employees as regards participation than other forms of legal entity, the issue had to be closed, with the identification of major, related questions ranging from the contents of the information to the termination clause, from the time frame for initiating the procedure to the parties involved and to the sectors where it is to be applied, and all this in respect, on the one hand, for the fair trade requirement, which, also in this case, would be guaranteed by the different behaviour of the Member States, and, on the other hand, for the reasoning of the open coordination method, which has, at last, started to be applied practically in social policy.

Clearly, the issue in question lends itself to being addressed within the context of the principle of subsidiarity, even though that concept still remains to be clearly defined today, despite the fact that it is one of the founding principles of the Union itself.
However, it must be said that the definition and application of the principle does not and cannot serve the single purpose of calling for competence for certain subjects to be given to the Member States alone, for there is also a conflicting, appropriate need to provide the Union, in the face of great national differences and oversights, with a basic definition of these subjects wherever they have any significant implications for the Community as a whole.
Mr President, allow me to begin by stating that I think it very important that minimum standards be set for informing and consulting employees, but that it is just as important that it be done in a way that does not disrupt existing national arrangements that are operating well.
It has unfortunately proved that not all Member States have been in a position to draft national guidelines for informing and consulting employees.
That would otherwise have been the best solution when it comes to companies in the individual countries, for it is, of course, there, that the real problems arise.
Political unity has now been achieved in the Council concerning the revised proposal from the Swedish Presidency and the graduated transitional arrangement, as proposed by the Commission.
In Denmark, we have no direct laws about informing and consulting employees.
That does not, however, mean that employees are not consulted and informed in Denmark. This is specifically regulated via cooperation agreements between the social partners in accordance with the Danish tradition of greater freedom between the social partners.
Only when it is strictly necessary does the government get involved.
The Danish government has therefore stated in the Council that it assumes that the current cooperation agreements in the Danish labour market comply with the directive' s requirements. The Danish government will also issue a statement in the Council to the effect that implementation of the directive will not affect existing agreements in this area in Denmark and that these will be fully respected when implementation takes place, but that it will of course be necessary to enact legislation for those companies not covered by the existing cooperation agreements.
I should like to ask the Commission whether it is of the same view as the Danish government.
In other words, is the Commission able to ensure that the social partners themselves are given the freedom to enter into, and maintain, the existing agreements and procedures about informing and consulting employees, just as Denmark was given a similar assurance in connection with the compromise reached by the Council in July?
I should also like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for having agreed that sanctions must be established nationally.
It is very important that the Member States themselves should devise appropriate sanctions, that this is done by means of agreements between the social partners and that we take account of the Member States' different systems.
If Parliament had maintained its hard line, the proposal could have been rejected by the Council, and that would have been a major defeat for the unions which, for years, have been campaigning for the right of employees to be informed and consulted.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, the view that it is, in general, appropriate and also necessary to ensure an adequate flow of information between a company and all its stakeholders, especially the employees involved in the life of the company, is, I believe, widely held, including by myself.
However, I am not in favour of imposing on the States, the individual Member States, solutions which involve employees in management decisions, on the basis, in some cases, of joint management models which are foreign to the legal and economic traditions of many European countries, as has just been said.
I therefore feel that, in line with both the Commission' s initial proposal and the Council' s common position, the directive before us needs to leave the Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre to identify the best way of adhering to the principle of the need to keep employees informed.
However, many of the amendments adopted by the Commission and included in the common position which we are about to put to the vote conflict with this, particularly Amendments Nos 2 and 12, which seek to grant employees' representatives a sort of de facto - and I repeat, de facto - right of veto on decisions taken by companies.
I therefore call upon Parliament not to adopt the amendments and to stay with the Council' s common position.
I would like to make one last point: Article 3 (2) lays down specific provisions applying to political associations, trade associations and religious organisations etc. Does this mean that political parties, trade unions and churches can carry out restructuring without informing their employees, while normal companies are obliged to do so?
This is my question.
Mr President, we are dealing with a long history and a relatively complex directive.
Fortunately, the Council' s common position is very useful and provides a sound basis for our further debate.
In fact, a number of people, including a large number of socialist ministers, are of the opinion that we should not have anything other than the common position.
I am not certain whether they truly believe this or whether they think that they will then be able to put the whole thing behind them.
In any event, that is the state of play.
Although the stance adopted by our group has been expressed very eloquently by Mr Winfried Menrad, he very much takes the common position into account, as well as the amendments adopted at first reading, a number of which - I have to say - we were unable to support.
We voted against a number of amendments, but as they are not included in the present package, that is not such a big issue.
There is now a sound compromise proposal before us by Parliament, also accommodating the Council.
We make no bones about the fact that our group is struggling with a number of amendments.
There are also a number of amendments which some delegations in our group find it difficult to come to terms with.
But on the whole, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur warmly on her work.
I also believe that if we have voted on this matter by lunchtime today, we will have made a significant contribution to informing and consulting employees in Europe.
We must not forget that an incredible number of problems have arisen.
Over the years, we have discussed many resolutions dealing with the lack of consultation.
If this is now rectified properly, we will have made huge progress, in my opinion.
Mr President, I do not speak for my Group on this matter, but I want to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for her hard work in making this directive a reality.
We hope this directive will develop into a new partnership between workers and management and strengthen dialogue. That, in turn, will improve flexibility and productivity.
We have a directive which is essentially a two-way street.
It must make sense for workers in retail, service and manufacturing industries not to learn about their future through the media, but to work within a positive consultation mechanism making them aware of what will happen to them and their families.
The question is whether existing laws work well.
There is plenty of evidence that they do not.
Workers in my own country at Rover/BMW, Marks & Spencers, in Longbridge, at Corus and Vauxhall - the list is endless - would all benefit from this directive.
The directive is essentially about the future of work, not the past.
When closure is inevitable for companies with more than 50 workers, we want to see information and consultation, so that workers are informed, leading to a better level of trust within companies.
We need realistic thresholds to allow the directive to work well.
In discussions with trade unions and business, it is clear that companies need to be made aware of their responsibilities.
The responsibilities work both ways.
Colleagues, information and consultation has been a very difficult directive.
There have been a number of compromise amendments.
We are very happy with the way in which those discussions have progressed.
It is clear that some Member States will continue to have problems with certain aspects of this directive.
We must work together to ensure that in conciliation we reach the stage where information and consultation are embraced by both sides of business and industry.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report.
I am one of the Members who has spoken in this House previously regretting the fact that we did not have the kind of legislation that we are discussing today.
I know that myself, along with several other colleagues, have been in the very unfortunate position of representing constituents who have suffered the very worst examples of the lack of consultation and the lack of information. Workers who have learned of job losses in the press and media when there has been speculation and uncertainty in the workplace.
I only have to mention what happened with Corus in Wales earlier this year for you to see why I attach such importance to this particular piece of legislation.
I am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this proposal which will change things.
It will mean that employees will be involved in discussions when there really is still an opportunity to influence the debate and the outcome, not when the decision is more or less a fait accompli.
Employees would have to be given all the relevant facts.
While certain measures are needed to protect a company's commercial interests, my group believes that these are adequately covered.
The ability to impose sanctions is one of the most important aspects of this report, including the suspension of decisions which lead to job losses if the consultation guidelines have not been followed.
Voluntary agreements are not enough.
We often hear about good examples of voluntary agreements.
I applaud those companies that follow good practice, but many do not.
We have seen that time and time again especially in Wales and Britain where we have had no legislation on information and consultation to date.
I am very pleased that there has at last been progress on this crucial matter.
I believe, as others have said, that we cannot wait too long for this to come into effect which is why I support the shorter transition period.
This proposal, of course, would not prevent job losses, but it would allow enough time to ensure that plans for rescaling and retraining of workforces could be well advanced before closures or redundancies take place.
This is an issue of the effectiveness of companies and businesses.
It should be a part of the everyday work of companies and businesses.
It is also about dignity in the workplace.
Employees are an integral part of the partnership with management and must be kept informed on decisions which affect not only their lives, but those of their families and whole communities.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ghilardotti' s report on the directive on information and consultation of workers is very topical indeed.
Many Member States of the European Union have, unfortunately, been faced with a wave of mergers, restructurings and numerous redundancies, such as at Danone, Marks and Spencer and Moulinex, to name but a few.
Until now, the directive has not enabled employees to take any effective action and to have a real bearing on their future, and that of the business.
In many other cases, the directive has not been applied.
That is why I support the proposals made in the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, because the directive strengthens provisions and provides the means to apply these provisions.
The Council included Parliament' s amendments in its common position; the reference to the most favourable provisions for employees, the obligation to respect minimum requirements, and the non-regression clause.
Although this is a step forward, we must go further, as proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report.
Some important amendments have again been proposed, which improve the report.
For example, employees shall be consulted and informed at the planning stage, before decisions are taken.
For example, if the decision has an adverse effect on employees, such as collective redundancies or closure, the final decision must be postponed so that consultations can continue with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences.
This directive will enable us to begin to encourage an approach to economic and social issues, which includes improving working conditions and economic efficiency.
This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally.
That is why we are proposing two amendments, which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business.
To demand discretion is one thing. To enable the company' s management, once again, to take unilateral decisions on the nature of the information is quite another.
Obviously, we must be determined to ensure this directive is observed, and I hope that, this time, the Council will heed Parliament' s will.
Mr President, the company is clearly an example of plurality.
According to Max Weber, a company is an organisation that, in controlling goods and services, aims to produce goods and services for a particular market.
It is also clear that those who lend their services to a company cannot always relate to their employer directly or on a personal level, above all when the number of employees in that company exceeds a certain level.
There therefore needs to be the implementation of some kind of permanent and flexible mechanism which would facilitate this relationship, functioning in a way that is simple yet effective and which can deal with the multitude of issues that arise in a company every day.
The everyday life of a company, in this day and age, takes place within a global world - globalisation is the key word - a globalisation which does not exclusively affect large or very large companies, but also those of a small or medium size, because they are also having to function within this environment.
So, what exactly is the problem?
Well, we need to regulate rights to information and consultation with true content within the specific framework in which we operate, that is to say that it is not a simple case of paying lip service to these declarations, but neither do we want to go too far, depriving the management of its powers.
I think that this is what Mrs Ghilardotti set out to achieve in her arduous and efficient work: I think that she was seeking this point of equilibrium, and, yes, it is difficult - I would say practically impossible - for some delegations, such as the Spanish, to vote for the content of Amendment No 12, and for the rest, we have to underline the work she has undertaken and congratulate her on her effort.
Evidently, a company' s own capacity to adapt, more necessary today than ever before, is going to be strengthened if we are able to convey its needs, concerns and prospects to all its workers.
More than just an exhaustive regulation, we are talking about an advanced communication culture within the company.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are all well aware, I believe that we are about to take a decisive step along the path to adopting a general framework on the information and consultation rights of workers.
We can only welcome this and we must congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti, the rapporteur, who has spared no effort in ensuring that today we have reached a position that we are defending.
It has been almost three years since the draft directive was published, and during this time, we in this House have had to condemn many situations.
There have been site closures, redundancies and relocations, without any prior information being given by the companies to the employees concerned.
Of course, this directive is far from ideal - it does not provide a ban on redundancies - but it illustrates the determination to make up for these shortcomings, firstly, in national legislation, but also to correct the occasionally fragmented aspects of Community law that we have already passed, which it also supplements.
These three years of debate have resulted in a text that is now balanced and realistic.
This report is not intransigent, nor is it extremist, and I believe that we should mention the efforts on the part of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the various groups, in negotiating with the Council, to iron out specific differences of opinion.
The European Parliament and the Council are co-legislators and we do not have to blindly support any directive, Mr Pronk. We have to support positions, namely those of Parliament.
I have three points to make; the first relates to confidentiality of specific information.
We have returned to the common position of the Council to acknowledge that there actually are objective situations and contradictions with stock market law, for example, which must be considered and that this confidentiality, in some well-defined cases, can be upheld.
My second point relates to sanctions. There is no law without sanctions, and I believe that what is laid down - I am about to finish, Mr President - where there has been a serious breach is an absolute minimum.
As for transition periods, well, fundamental social rights must simply be applied.
Yet, we can no longer defer the enforcement of these rights.
(Applause from the Left)
Mr President, Commissioner, informing and consulting employees is a basic right.
It is inherent in our European social model and distinguishes us from other social models.
I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the sound work and also the Council which, in any case, managed to pull the debate back on track in Nice.
This was timely and also necessary.
If we examine such a framework directive and compare it with the take-over directive which was discussed in this House recently, and subsequently rejected, we can see that this did not fit into a framework directive.
The statute of the European company does fit in, which means that a framework directive is needed for that.
That framework directive is also needed - as has been indicated by various people - if we consider what happened to Renault-Vilvoorde, Michelin, Chorus and other companies.
For example, in the case of Chorus, there is a pronounced difference in the level of information and consultation provided in the Netherlands, for example, compared to England.
Consequently, this directive relies wholly on the quality of information and consultation.
In my opinion, these should be assessed in the fullness of time, but this is a first step.
It is absolutely vital to tackle it this way.
One of the things I am struggling with is the exemption from this directive when a company is said to be at risk.
We have positive experiences in countries where works councils exist, and that applies to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.
Problems do not arise.
There is already a duty of confidentiality, and I should like to urge you to adopt the amendment which we tabled in this connection.
Mr President, the right of employees to be consulted and informed has been enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but what use are frameworks set up at national or EU level, when employees are too often presented with faits accomplis, learning of restructuring processes only after the event or from the media?
I support Mrs Ghilardotti's Amendment No 5, which requires them to be consulted as early as the planning phase, so that they can have some degree of influence.
There was long debate on Amendment No 7, which laid down what information supplied by the employer must include.
This includes the economic situation - developments in the market, the structure of the organisation, the company's strategy - but also turnover and production figures to show the financial position.
This is about in-house information and not in any way about investment control by stealth.
More and more employees have a financial share in their business, now, and so they are well positioned to think entrepreneurially in local and global terms.
They are ready and willing to share responsibility for significant strategies that make their firms more competitive.
Dialogue between informed social partners is a major challenge, and so we also need training and development for qualified employees.
People with in-depth knowledge add to productivity.
These employees are willing to share responsibility even for crucial decisions.
All this adds up to another element in the structure of a modern organisation.
It is in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that dialogue between employer and employee is particularly important.
Mr President, you are right to emphatically put the case for them as well.
This dialogue is to be set in motion in the Member States, in accordance with their current national regulations.
The pressure of competition and the challenges posed by globalisation mean that there is no alternative to cooperation within businesses, provided that it is founded on fairness, openness and timely information.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Mrs Ghilardotti, as well as the Council and the Commission for having finally secured progress on this dossier.
As with the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company a few weeks ago, and the annex on participation, we have been making more progress in the last few months than we had for years.
I think that this gives us an excellent opportunity to send a clear signal to the public that, at European level, we have a concept of the company that encompasses all those that work within it, which, it must also be said, is not only a democratic right of workers, but, also, these principles of information and consultation set the right path for companies to become more efficient, more effective, non-authoritarian and participatory.
In these times of globalisation, lifelong learning and the incorporation of workers into the dynamics of a company are crucial.
We hope, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, that, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated very clearly in her amendments, that this is a genuine regulation.
This will require two obvious and fundamental elements: firstly, that the participation of workers should take place before decisions are made, for if this is not the case, they will carry on finding things out through the papers and they will really be under the impression that the work that has been carried out here in Parliament, in Council and in the Commission is a joke. They have to be involved before decisions are made, because the press is there for everyone else.
Secondly, their participation must also be a legal requirement.
The exact difference between the regulation and the recommendation is that, when the regulation is violated, there can be a sanction.
If there is no sanction, what we do remains purely symbolic and has no legal foundation.
Representatives of the Council, we are at second reading.
I would like to finish by saying that I hope that on this occasion we do not experience what has taken place on so many others, that you forget that Parliament has legislative faculties on a par with your own.
I hope, therefore, that you will take good notice of Mrs Ghilardotti' s report, which is not only for her own good, but for the good of millions of citizens and workers in Europe.
Like my colleagues in the UK Conservative Delegation, I have consistently supported the principle and the practice of employee information and consultation.
In my previous job as managing director of a large UK food manufacturing company, I was very proud to lead the first such company in the whole of the West Midlands Region to achievement of the coveted Investors People Award.
As has already been mentioned, earlier this month I hosted a lunch debate in Brussels with the Involvement and Participation Association for my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to share with them UK best practice and the benefits of flexibility, because that is the issue.
The common position as it stands is fine, which is why I personally did not put forward any amendments to that, but the committee amendments propose yet another one-size fits-all straitjacket which would be highly damaging to managers' ability to manage and in particular to their ability to manage rapid change.
If companies are held back from taking the key decisions necessary perhaps for the very survival of those businesses, their problems will get worse, which means that more employees could suffer.
The UK government has asked all UK MEPs from all political parties to vote down all these amendments and to support the common position.
Conservative MEPs will do exactly that, so I now call upon UK Labour MEPs to reverse the position they all took in committee when they supported these amendments and to vote with us in the interests of employment and in the interests of the nation.
Mr President, first I would like to apologise: in my introduction I did not mention Mrs Jensen, and I would really like to congratulate her on an excellent job.
As far as Mrs Ghilardotti is concerned, we all know what a difficult job she had and she has.
She had to strike a balance between completely different political, national, social and economic views, and I would like to congratulate her and to thank all the Members of Parliament who have participated in the debate and supported the Commission's proposal through this process.
This is an important proposal and, once adopted, it will add an indispensable element to workers' rights.
Recent events, with mass lay-offs across Europe, have only underlined the urgent need for different kinds of instruments and this proposal - this directive - information and consultation is a very important instrument.
Once adopted, the directive will ensure better anticipation of crises and will contribute to developing a positive attitude towards change by both management and workers.
Let me tell you that I fully understand all your requests.
Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within all the institutions.
The text before us strikes a delicate balance between different points of view and divergent interests on the sensitive issues at stake.
While I understand your desire to improve the text, it would be unwise, in my view, to depart now from that balance and jeopardise the actual adoption of the proposal.
I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 and 19.
Therefore, the Commission is not prepared to accept those amendments.
However, a number of the proposed amendments are acceptable, in full or in part, to the Commission, as they will improve the text.
These are Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 13 and 14.
The Commission will, therefore, actively support these amendments and will do its utmost to facilitate consensus on them between Parliament and the Council.
Allow me, before moving to the two most important issues - sanctions and transitional periods - to respond to Mrs SandbÃŠk, as far as the Danish model is concerned.
I would like to underline the fact that the current text strikes a balance between the necessary protection of workers and the autonomy of the social partners, as contracting partners.
They can freely conclude agreements which are not fully in line with the provisions of Article 4, but they have to take into account the principles which are established in Article 1 and in national law.
Now, we know that the most difficult and controversial issues are the two which I have already referred to: sanctions and transitional periods.
With regard to the first of these issues, Amendment No 2 and especially Amendment No 12 propose reinforced sanctions, including judicial suspension procedures in cases of serious breach of information and consultation obligations.
This amendment, while reinforcing the common position, offers a compromise with the Commission's original proposal.
It is, therefore, undeniable that Parliament is making a step in the direction of the Council, in a serious search for a final compromise.
I would like to thank you for your support of the Commission's stance on this very important element of the directive.
Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivity of the issue in the Council, the best basis for a final compromise on this issue would be to limit the request to the first sentence of the proposed amendment.
Under these circumstances, the Commission can accept Amendment No 2 and the first paragraph of Amendment No 12.
We can accept Amendment No 2 with a minor change.
Finally Amendment No 15 which seeks to delete Article 10 - on transitional periods - is equally a major issue.
In the past, the Commission has always opposed this kind of provision which tends to grant different treatment to different Member States.
This time, we can see some justification in it.
Some Member States will clearly have to introduce major changes to their industrial relations systems.
Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that Article 10 of the common position constitutes a fair compromise and it cannot accept this amendment.
To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 3 and 8; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 2, 6, 12, 13 and 14.
It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18 and 19.
I know that you fully appreciate the challenges ahead of us: we need to do everything possible to find an acceptable compromise between the co-legislators.
I think that our big challenge is to strike the balance between what we think is desirable and what is achievable or possible.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Employment guidelines for 2002/Joint employment report 2001
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, employment policy in the EU was successful last year even though not all our ambitious objectives have been achieved.
But the points have been set.
In few other fields do we have to think in the long term as much as in employment policy.
My impression is that the Member States have not only grasped that, but that they are also acting accordingly.
My report takes the same line as that of the Committee, which has kept to it over the past few years.
We have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism.
I have therefore concentrated this year on some new key points.
The first of these is the new theme of work quality, on which we in Parliament agree with the initiative of the Commission and the Belgian Presidency, which have also made the quality of work a pre-eminent item on the agenda.
We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming.
The second key point is gender equality in the employment market.
Here, too, according to the Commission's figures, we have achieved an improvement.
The proportion of women in employment has increased by 2% in any case, which is of course not enough for us, but it is the right way to go, and also shows the change in the Member States' thinking.
This reorientation also means - and even that was not so simple - that a change of consciousness has taken place, at least in some Member States such as Germany, Greece and Ireland.
A third point is very important to me - the integration and incorporation of disadvantaged groups into the employment market.
This has for some years been an important topic for this Parliament.
In my report, I put forward the argument that employment policy measures should include immigrants as well.
I believe this to be an important area for the future, precisely because we will otherwise be creating new social flashpoints.
I would like finally to mention the area of continuing education.
We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action.
I believe that, now, of all times, when we are already finding that bottlenecks in certain trades result from too little training and development in the past, such a national right to continuing education would represent the dictates of the hour.
I am, moreover, convinced that we will have achieved it within four or five years.
Why, then, should Parliament not be the trailblazer for once?
National and European targets need to be set if these policy objectives are to be achieved.
There is, I believe, an additional need for more intensive cooperation between enterprises and institutions of higher education than hitherto, in order to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and more speedily initiate entrepreneurial innovation than has previously been the case.
I appeal also to the Member States, to the Council and to the Belgian Presidency to have the courage to initiate a public debate on employment policy in Europe.
The fact is that we have observed that there is in the national parliaments - with the possible exception of Denmark - and in the regional parliaments and assemblies, still, little or no, discussion of European employment policy.
Even employers' organisations and trade unions, at regional level, do not know of the significance of our debates and resolutions in the European Parliament.
Of course, effective employment policies and coordinated and farsighted economic and financial policies belong together.
I cannot draw a veil over this Parliament's present dissatisfaction with the Council's objectives in this area and with its debates on the subject.
I cannot help thinking that we could do with a bit more courage on the part of the finance ministers on the Ecofin Council, in order to guarantee here, too, the appropriate and proportionate goal for a rational European employment policy, for only then can an offensive for growth and employment in Europe be realised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, in our view, the Member States which have the primary task of creating the appropriate framework for more employment.
It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it.
I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here.
On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment - and, in particular, youth unemployment - on a frightening scale.
I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others.
We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others.
We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs?
It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench.
It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs.
If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important.
It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them.
We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones.
The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance.
Mr President, equality is a prerequisite for economic growth.
Twenty-five million fewer women than men participate in the European labour market.
That is a huge unexploited resource which needs to be made use of if Lisbon' s employment objectives are to be achieved and if economic growth is to be guaranteed.
At the same time, the birth rate is falling dramatically.
Demographic experts predict that Europe' s labour force will consist of considerably fewer people in the future, when more women will therefore have to be in gainful employment and, at the same time, give birth to more children.
How are we to balance the equation?
A basic prerequisite is an equality perspective in all four pillars of the employment policy guidelines, and I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Weiler has been so attentive to the proposals tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
The most important thing is perhaps to ensure that European women and men can combine professional life with having a family and children.
The Member States must make child care available and offer parental leave.
The women of Europe must not be forced to choose between professional life and having a family.
The Commission' s focus on better jobs is very encouraging, for better jobs and better working conditions for women are among the prerequisites for having more women in paid employment.
Precarious and low-paid jobs which require little in the way of qualifications and in which women are over-represented at present are hardly going to attract women.
Quality, which is the recurring theme in the guidelines for the year 2000, must also apply to work done by women.
Overcoming gender discrimination at work and in the social insurance systems is a huge challenge.
Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only unproductive, it also ruins the opportunities for individual women, for women as a group and for society as a whole.
Quite simply, growth and human development require us to put an end to gender discrimination.
Equality is an investment.
Mr President, when the experiment of the Luxembourg procedure was set in motion in 1997 and guidelines for Member States' employment policies adopted, it was in the conviction that a favourable climate of economic growth might not alone be sufficient to ensure automatic positive results in employment.
Today, we are confirming this strategy, these undertakings and guidelines in an economic climate which we all know to be much less favourable, or, rather, full of risks, and we are therefore doing so, first and foremost, by duly recognising the need, already established at the Lisbon Summit, to bring the economic policy guidelines adopted at Community level and by the Member States into line with employment policy recommendations and guidelines.
This does not diminish the specific role of the Luxembourg procedure and the economic policy guidelines in the context of what has been defined a coordination process, an open coordination process.
We are aware that these alone are not enough; however, they are, or can be, decisive for maximising the effects or reducing the risks for employment, which are also linked to the economic trend.
All this must be subject to certain conditions, focused on in both the Commission' s proposals, which we judged to be positive, and Parliament' s position.
I will mention them very briefly: we feel that this is a process which warrants careful attention, controls and monitoring.
It is not enough just to state the objectives which are then included under the principle of subsidiarity in national employment plans.
There must also be consistency in terms of effectiveness and implementation: that is why we call for the adoption of auditable, reliable common indicators at Member State as well as Community level, in order to achieve national objectives without whose achievement it would subsequently be difficult to reach our common European and Community objectives.
There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility, social dialogue, protection, rights and safety, but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training, integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers.
Lastly, and most importantly, there must be equal opportunities policies and active employment policies.
If these conditions are met, the contribution of the Luxembourg procedure will not be the only factor but it will certainly be decisive.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report and to thank the Commission for its sustained commitment to the European employment strategy.
No one will now deny that the European employment policy, since it first started in 1997, has led to a certain level of convergence stress in the Member States and has brought with it increasing unanimity as to what an active labour market policy in Europe could be.
That is apparent from the continued refinement of the employment guidelines, although I would add that this is rather unilaterally evident from the first pillar, namely employability, and that the results in the field of adaptability of undertakings still leave something to be desired.
Yet, the moment of truth is now upon us, in my opinion.
In this economic slow-down, Member States must prove that the Lisbon objectives, being sustainable growth, full employment and quality of jobs, were not simply prescribed for periods of boom, but must also remain applicable now.
That means that the Member States will need to lend a hand, for at the same time, I have noticed that a number of cracks are starting to show in the employment strategy.
First of all, I have noticed that people have cold feet about laying down specific, let alone European, objectives and benchmarks.
For example, I think it is great that the Council has recognised that equal opportunities for men and women is a question of social justice as well as economic efficiency.
However, I should also like to see the Council go the extra mile by formulating clear, quantitative and specific objectives in terms of reducing the wage gap and setting up a number of child care centres.
Commissioner, I hope that you will be monitoring this closely.
Secondly, with regard to the mix of policy measures, the method of open coordination is an interesting policy instrument in areas where Europe previously had nothing to say, and I very much applaud the fact that the Belgian Presidency has included the aspect of quality of employment.
Commissioner, it seems obvious to me, however, that collective agreements as well as social legislation will be needed in different areas where the social dialogue has failed.
That is why it is of the utmost importance for my group, for example, to know whether the European Commission will, after the failure of social consultation, produce a draft directive on temporary employment.
Indeed, temporary employment can create new opportunities.
However, for temporary employment to be quality employment which offers social rights, trade union rights, right to training and, at the same time, guarantees for permanent staff in the firms making use of their services, a European directive must be compiled which offers a number of warranties, warranties which have, inter alia, been presented in the joint declaration recently concluded by Euro-CIETT and UNI-EUROPA and that include, for example, equal treatment at temporary employment agencies and at firms making use of their services.
Commissioner, following on from this debate, I should like to know when you will be presenting this draft directive to Parliament and in what way these essential basic conditions will be met.
Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report.
I very much agree with her remark about the significance of training and the importance of making a special effort on behalf of older people in the labour market.
I do not agree that we, in the EU, should have a directive granting any rights, but I well understand that many in this House want to see special emphasis and importance given to actually ensuring a right to training.
However, this is something which the individual countries must take care of.
The employment guidelines provide, of course, both some political priorities and some political objectives, and they also provide a framework for deciding which funds are to be used in order to achieve the objectives.
The funds are allocated to four pillars.
The unemployed must be made better qualified to obtain jobs. They must be given more incentives to get into employment.
That is the first pillar. Secondly, entrepreneurship must be promoted so that we see more companies and jobs created, partly through the removal of constricting regulations and bureaucratic arrangements.
Thirdly, adaptability and flexibility must be promoted so that companies become more competitive. And fourthly, more opportunities must be provided for combining working life and family life so that there is a real opportunity for women to achieve equality in the labour market, leading to an improvement in the employment situation where women are concerned.
Many points have been registered under the four pillars, and I believe we are coming to a point at which it is worth considering whether we are pinning too much on this process, for the more objectives we add to the process, the more we are also in danger of watering down the cooperation and perhaps losing sight of the real goals, namely those of creating more jobs and getting the unemployed into work.
That being said, I am very pleased that, this time, we have obtained an innovation in the guidelines for the year 2000, whereby local and regional efforts are to be involved and local and regional employment strategies developed. I also believe this underlines the fact that the Commission will need resources for carrying out analyses and studies within this area.
Several days ago, a leading French newspaper ran a headline story on the efforts bring made to combat rising unemployment and it described the wave of near-panic sweeping through the announcements of poor unemployment figures.
At times like these, when a recession may be looming, we find it even more regrettable that employment is not the main priority of the economic and monetary guidelines.
I would like to reiterate that the Group of the Greens believes that employment policy cannot only have the function of monitoring or softening the peaks and troughs of the globalised economy by creating safety nets, by helping those who are out of work to find their way back into the job market. This is all the Luxembourg process has achieved, it is also, evidently, all that the guidelines proposed by the Commission for 2002 are likely to achieve, and is also all that the Weiler report, which is part of this approach, can achieve.
Whilst expressing regret that the Member States did little in response to their invitation to set objectives for unemployment levels, the Commission and the Council have quite rightly placed the emphasis on verifying the qualitative impact of the policies implemented.
In order to clarify this approach, we are proposing two amendments. The first proposes to draw up comparable statistics on the various types of employment, in other words, including underemployment, partial unemployment, and to assess the consequences of so-called employment incentive measures in terms of enhanced social inclusion or exclusion.
Our second amendment proposes to strengthen the action of employment monitoring services in order to prevent flexible short-term contracts being abused.
We must, as a matter of urgency, curb the development of poverty, lack of job security, and unpleasant working conditions.
We still need to introduce a policy to create businesses and jobs.
Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports, we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion, and decide on, for example, the necessary large-scale investments, including public investment, draw up a European job creation policy, and not simply a work placement policy.
Mr President, I, too, want to thank Mrs Weiler for a good report.
The Commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year, because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year.
We do not, therefore, wish to start making changes at the present stage.
Naturally, this state of affairs has also had a marked influence upon the current report, which concerns what we have discussed in previous years.
I think that the rapporteur has added some important aspects: quality at work, training, professional education, life long learning, equality etc. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs submitted a number of proposals for the report, of which a number were adopted and introduced into the report.
These amendments worry me because some of them place such heavy emphasis upon price stability policy, budget restriction policy and such like. They worry me because we are heading for an economy which is no longer as strong.
The Luxembourg procedure has been very focused upon improving the supply of labour, but this presupposes that there are job opportunities and that current economic policy is creating job opportunities and countering the trend towards economic recession.
I therefore believe that, in the current situation, the amendments in question militate against a European employment strategy.
I should also like to say a few words about the future.
A number of evaluations are now under way.
I have been in contact with people working on a number of the ongoing research projects, and I believe that one of the things that will be emphasised is the fact that the Member States are failing to implement the policy properly.
There is relatively broad agreement between those pursuing labour market policy in the Member States but, in spite of that, no such policy is being implemented in the Member States themselves.
The labour market administrations really do not have much to do with the procedure itself.
They are pursuing their own policy.
The parliaments have no influence at all, but it is nonetheless they who must fund the national efforts we are demanding.
It is therefore incredibly important that more attention be paid to the parliaments in particular, but also to the entire political process in the Member States, if the result is to be effective.
I believe that this will be the major task in the forthcoming evaluation.
It is not enough simply to emphasise indicators and such like.
The bodies that supply the finance and then administer the measures must also play an active role in the process.
Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Mrs Weiler's report.
She has identified unemployment as one of the most serious economic and social problems faced by the European Union.
This was true prior to 11 September.
It has now become an even more stark reality in the aftermath and against the background of continuing economic uncertainty which results from war.
One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today.
This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us.
Indeed, unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States.
Solving the problem of unemployment requires active labour market measures.
Labour markets do not always function efficiently, and Member States must be prepared to take up their responsibilities when the need arises.
The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies.
In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events, but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties.
Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs.
Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease.
In the case of the Irish national airline, Aer Lingus, 40% of their business and 60% of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes.
Ireland's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration.
The collapse of Aer Lingus simply cannot be permitted.
The economic and social consequences would be unparalleled in any other Member State in the Union, and the knock-on effects to related industries would be enormous.
The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this.
The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably.
Mr President, I do not wish to make any profession of political faith in the many detailed proposals to be found in the report and in the Commission' s proposal for a Council decision.
By far the majority of these are to be welcomed and are politically correct, and many are in response to urgent needs, especially the conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, which Mrs Theorin has reported on. However, I have some general remarks on employment policy and the EU' s labour market policy which have, of course, been an overriding theme of a number of reports and proposals here this afternoon.
First of all, I have a remark to make about the reality as it is perceived.
