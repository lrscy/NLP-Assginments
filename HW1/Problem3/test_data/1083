It is of interest that, as with most influenza pandemics, the 1918 flu pandemic only lasted for about one year and gradually disappeared in the subsequent period.
This happened without the use of antiviral agents, vaccines or radical measures having been taken in poultry farming, but thanks to the most effective means of disease defence called natural resistance.
This should perhaps cause us to carefully consider how drastic our precautionary measures should be.
This is why I agree with both the Commissioner and the rapporteur that a balanced approach is the most rational to take.
I feel that any measures we take should be in accordance with natureâs defence mechanisms and not in opposition to them.
It is therefore my view that close scientific monitoring of the epidemiology and molecular biology of the avian flu virus is essential.
I believe that massive culling of LPAI-infected holdings is not strictly necessary â let us remind ourselves that we have been eating scrapie-infected sheep and goats for over 200Â years and no human has yet died from scrapie infections.
I am also of the opinion that vaccinations of flocks are costly, cumbersome and perhaps of dubious significance â rather, we should aim at researching and promoting the breeding of naturally-resistant birds.
In addition, assistance should be given to developing countries to improve primitive holdings conditions and poultry food hygiene, which is very important.
Lastly, the panic-stocking of antiviral drugs of doubtful effectiveness and without proper scrutiny of their sometimes lethal side-effects is not wise.
It deprives much-needed resources from healthcare systems and mainly helps further to enrich pharmaceutical companies.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal put forward by the Commissioner is a good one, and, as he said in his speech, what we are dealing with here is an animal disease.
Although a link has now been established with the possibility of its onward transmission, we must not allow ourselves to be panicked, and must not lose sight of the need for coordination between the veterinary and human spheres.
We are dealing, after all, in the first instance with an animal disease, and so I find your manifest calm perfectly understandable, for the alternative is to run the risk of being swamped by day-to-day panic measures.
The good thing about the proposal is that it answers the question âto inoculate or not to inoculate?â
As you know â and I know all the more, having been in this House for longer â this has been the subject of debate over many years, the issue always being whether vaccination should be ongoing or, alternatively, prophylactic and in response to a specific occurrence of disease.
Here in this House, we have always favoured the latter option, which is the one you are now proposing, but it has always been mentioned in the same breath with this fundamental question.
The merit of your proposal, though, is that it separates the two.
It is for this reason that we endorse your proposal.
There is no place either in this debate for such terms as âexterminateâ and âdestroyâ; we are dealing here with animals or with food, since it is animals that find their way into food products.
The images presented to us over the past years â ranging from BSE to the diseases of poultry and swine via the cullings for foot-and-mouth disease â did Europeâs cultural credibility in the worldâs eyes no good at all.
This is what leads me to believe that we are on the right track.
The recommendation I would like to give you is that we should join with the Commission in discussing the issue of susceptibility, in relation to which we need to draw a distinction between the new breeds, which are intended for technical treatment and intensive rearing, and the regionally adapted breeds, that is to say those that live in the wild, some of which do indeed carry the virus without becoming clinically ill.
The way they coexist needs to be organised, and so we must not fall into the trap of conducting the wrong debate, asking ourselves whether we should now do away with nature and have purely artificial and technical animal husbandry from now on.
What is instead needed here is an exchange of views, not only with reference to the European situation, but also carried over into Asia.
It is there that we must provide technical aid and around the world that precautions must be taken if animals are to be kept healthy and people such as ourselves protected from the possibility of viruses altering and mutating to our own peril.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the new directive is necessary so that measures can be take to protect public health and poultry stocks from avian influenza and to prevent the virus from mutating from a low to a high pathogenic virus and the risk of its spreading to humans.
The measures proposed in the directive are the right measures.
At the same time, however, provision is made for derogations and this is where caution is needed, because this will adulterate the severity of the measures.
It will allow large poultry industries attacked by low pathogenic influenza to use the derogations to channel poultry and products to the market which have been attacked instead of destroying them, thereby transferring the disease to importing countries.
If certain countries want to use the derogations, the derogations should be allowed for their area only and they must be responsible for them.
The other countries, however, must have the facility to refuse to allow products subject to the derogation to be traded on their territory, because low pathogenic influenza and vaccinated birds may be considered to be of negligible risk to public health, but the low pathogenic virus could mutate into a high pathogenic virus at any moment and, although harmless now, could create dangerous situations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to join my colleagues not only in thanking not just the rapporteur for his work but also the Commissioner for the action he has taken so far with regard to this perceived threat.
I say âperceivedâ threat because some of the headlines in the media over the last six to seven months suggest that the end of the world is imminent and there is no escape from the dangers and the risks presented by the spread of avian flu.
However, when you look more closely at the scientific and empirical data available on bird flu, you see certain trends emerging.
First, it does not seem to have as great or as damaging an impact on wild birds as it does on domesticated or commercial flocks.
Second, the only cases of human transmission of bird flu have been where people were in close contact with commercial flocks.
Third, and most important, there is still no known case of transmission from human being to human being.
As important as it may be for us to be prudent, prepared and aware of any dangers or risks that may present themselves, it is equally wrong of us to be scaremongering as regards any immediate threat and the dangers it presents.
To put this into context, more people will die in the European Union from the effects of a strain of TB that is drug-resistant than will be affected by avian flu.
On a global scale, more people â especially children â die every day from the effects of malaria than have been killed so far by avian influenza.
We must look at these figures and put them into context, and it is important for our response to be reasoned and proportionate to the risks and dangers that actually exist.
It is wonderful that the scientific committees on public health and animal health are meeting on a regular basis to update one other and exchange information on the outbreaks that have occurred close to the European Unionâs borders.
In addition to cooperating with the World Health Organisation, we can put in place preparatory plans for dealing with any potential outbreaks.
As we have seen with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and other animal diseases, a policy aimed at slaughtering animals is the only sure way of killing off the disease.
Horrific as that may seem in a world where so many millions of people are starving because of a lack of food, in the longer term it would appear to be a better and more proportionate response. This is because, although there has been talk of vaccines and preparations for vaccines, we do not know which vaccine will work.
We do not know what the exact result of a vaccine will be on the human body when trying to prevent the spread of avian flu, and will not know until such time as we allow our scientific experts to act and entrust this matter to people who know what they are talking about.
I know some of my colleagues here have doubts or worries concerning the credibility or sincerity of some of the people involved in the pharmaceutical industry.
However, at every stage in human health development when there has been a need or a desire to respond to a risk to human health, they have come up with solutions and answers, and we should listen to what they have to say.
Finally, the guidance and leadership that the Commissioner has given on this issue, and the clear thinking and cool logic which has been shown, is a model that other Commissioners would do well to follow when dealing with other public service issues.
Â Â  I welcome the discussion about this report in European Parliament.
Its aim is to strengthen the prevention of pandemic of bird-origin influenza, reduce health risks, and prevent the potential loss of life.
To date, the death toll from bird flu virus is 68 persons who demonstrably caught the infection from birds.
However, the entire mankind would be in jeopardy if the virus mutates and acquires the ability to spread among humans.
This is where cooperation and coordination among the countries is vital.
We know that the disease does not know and respect borders, and this is particularly worrying in case of this deadly disease to which people have no antibodies.
However, cooperation is required not only at the international level, but also within individual countries between different sectors.
All of them, be it agriculture, healthcare, education, or defence, must fulfil their respective tasks in case of pandemic.
I must, however, emphasise the importance of behaviour of the population.
During the first phase of the breakout, people generally lack adequate information.
This is when, instead of rational conduct, people are seized with panic and chaos sets in.
And these are the worst enemies in similar situations.
Behaviour of people is the most effective when they have information and negative past experience â which they already have in connection with a pandemic.
The Spanish flu pandemic of 1917 that killed 40 million should give all of us sufficient warning.
In a recent discussion here in European Parliament Commissioner Kyprianou made a misleading statement when he said that he had 25 national action plans on the table.
It is not important for us whether you have 25 programmes on the table.
What matters is that you have one common and good quality plan to fight the pandemic.
The recent verification of the worst possible scenario of the European 25+2 revealed shortcomings exactly in the area of communication between individual national programmes.
On the one hand, many politicians downplay the danger by stating that these are only the tricks played by pharmaceuticals companies, but, on the other hand, the population gains access to information that the state authorities are already identifying sites for mass graves.
All of us, healthcare workers, are aware of the shortage of financial resources in the healthcare system of every country.
This is why many countries restrict the number of surgeries and create waiting lists.
I am afraid that these financially fragile systems will not have sufficient resources to deal with a pandemic.
I therefore think that the population should be informed so as to be able to assume a certain portion of the costs.
Â Â  I completely agree with the honourable Members who have spoken before me, that although we cannot talk about a pandemic yet, we must take the threat seriously.
However, the threat posed by hysteria about a so far nonexistent virus is at least of the same magnitude.
According to expert estimates, poultry consumption in Hungary has fallen by at least 40%, to an extent that may actually bankrupt this sector.
This has occurred in spite of the fact that Hungarian scientists had prepared and successfully tested the vaccine against the current H5N1 virus.
In order to avoid hysteria and panic, our most important tasks are to introduce prevention measures effective at Member State level, to make comprehensive and cautious plans, and to act in a determined, considered and coordinated manner in the event of an epidemic.
In the spirit of a responsible attitude towards European citizens, the European Union must assume a high degree of solidarity.
The coordination of vaccine production capacities and the consolidation of vaccine distribution principles would give citizens of countries with no vaccine production capacity equal opportunities for obtaining the vaccine.
Let us not forget that among the 10 new Member States, Hungary is the only country with a vaccine production facility.
Therefore it is important that all assistance is given to the country where the first outbreak of the epidemic occurs, even if this country is outside of the European Union, and that action is not hindered by short-sighted national priorities.
There is a saying in my country â a friend in need is a friend indeed.
I hope we will succeed in avoiding the need, but if we do not, my wish is that the concept of âfriendship and cooperation between nationsâ, one of the basic ideals of the European Union, may prove viable when put to test.
I would like to express my gratitude to both rapporteurs for tabling this important issue that does not affect the citizens of Europe only.
Â Â  Mr President, my group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety endorses the approach of our draftsman MrÂ Sturdy, not least in his encomia for the general rapporteur Mr Parish, and for the Commissioner and his emphasis throughout on studied vigilance rather than either hysteria or complacency.
We salute him for that.
The six questions that the Commissioner sent to the Community health ministers seem to me to be the right ones, but the question remains as to whether he gets the right answers from them in terms of the way we can mobilise our stocks of anti-virals prior to the development of a vaccine.
I would just say in passing to Dr Matsakis, whom I greatly esteem, that I do not share his relative happiness with the outcome of the events of 1918.
In 1918, death was the firewall that put an end to it; the virus ran out of victims.
We cannot be in a situation where we allow that to happen again, and I therefore salute the measures the Commissioner has taken.
I have just got time for one question: if low pathogen avian flu is also infectious and can mutate, how can we be certain that the import of infected wildfowl and domestic poultry is really under control?
In my own country we have had examples of both the former and now today the latter.
Large stocks of illegally imported Chinese chicken meat have been uncovered in the UK over the past few days.
We know that epidemics run through channels of illegality and deceit â epidemics, not pandemics.
Epidemics start that way, so it was with foot and mouth disease.
We do not want to see it again and so I hope the Commissioner will be able to say in his summing-up exactly what the measures of preventive scrutiny will be.
Â Â  Mr President, caution is the right approach; there is no room either in rational politics or in the taking of appropriate precautions for the kind of panic mongering and hysteria we have heard many times today.
The attribution of guilt to one party is just as wrong-headed as, for example, making wild birds responsible for the spread of this disease, for which science has shown and demonstrated other causes.
This has, so far, been more of a media event than a medical one in the true sense of the word, if one compares it with many other developments and worse diseases.
It does nevertheless need to be prevented, and the Commission cannot be often enough praised for its rational and balanced response.
We do indeed need to carry on keeping a watchful eye on how things develop, and I hope that all those affected will be involved in the monitoring process.
It is a matter of absolute necessity that this should include those who live and work on the ground, including, for example, those engaged in hunting, who have the requisite knowledge and are the first to come into contact with wild birds.
With this in mind, I hope that the report by Mr Parish, who has done a good job, will be adopted tomorrow, and would like once again to congratulate the Commission on its level-headed attitude.
Â Â  Mr President, in order to control bird flu, the EU must, obviously, remove the taboos that surround vaccination.
The EU should also focus much more on the source in South-East Asia.
A number of Member States have set up sound bilateral projects over there, and the FAO has played a coordinating role in this.
The Commission should build on this by financially supporting initiatives of the EU Member States in South-East Asia and by leaving the coordination to the FAO.
That would be the most efficient way of going about things.
Many thousands of people in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and other countries have been in contact with the virus and obviously, many of them have developed antibodies.
There is no data available on this.
The Commission could, and indeed should, help fund a study into this very area.
More can be done within the EU too.
Water birds are not nearly monitored enough, which is essential, after all, because the low-pathogenic virus is spread much more widely than imagined.
That is not new or unusual, but accurate monitoring is essential.
In short, I urge you to support bilateral initiatives of the Member States in South-East Asia, fund research, support the FAOâs coordination and organise more monitoring at European level.
Finally, the European Parliament must set up an interim committee for avian influenza, as it did during the BSE crisis.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House had the opportunity to discuss this issue in the plenary on 25Â October, and the debate on that occasion was a very matter-of-fact one, at which you, Commissioner, announced all the things that you intended to do.
You have also done them, making use of the opportunities for dialogue with other organisations and mounting crisis exercises in Europe, the outcomes of which we shall probably learn about shortly.
It is only natural â as has already been said â that debate should focus on the health of poultry and the need for that to be protected.
I was recently in China, where, as we know, there are 20 billion head of poultry.
The Chinese are absolutely terrified of the possibility that bird flu might spread, and they are also doing something about it, but the question arises of whether we Europeans, both in the past and now, have given states like China, Indonesia and Vietnam good enough advice to enable them to take action in the event of any bird flu epidemic.
The Chinese have now tried to develop anti-bird flu vaccines and they are also working on something for human beings.
I think it is splendid that they are now abandoning the old non-immunisation policy and pursuing one of well-ordered immunisation in specific regions or in the vicinity of hotspots.
I, in my capacity as a veterinarian, have very frequently been called in, in Lower Saxony and elsewhere, to deal with outbreaks of animal diseases, and I know that the right way to go about a vaccination policy is with marker vaccines â I emphasise that they have to be marker vaccines if at all possible â and this is also, I believe, an approach that is in line with what the enthusiasts for animal welfare would have us do.
For my final point, let me reiterate what I said as my final point on 25 October, which was that a pandemic is on the way in any case; the scientists do not know when.
We should, of course, do everything possible to prevent panic breaking out, while also taking every possible step to prevent the virus being transmitted, mutating and infecting humans.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for their kind words and support.
In light of the challenges we are facing, the support of Parliament has been a great encouragement and a great help.
I would like to touch on a few issues.
Firstly, with regard to the issue of research, we are already carrying out and financing research.
There is, however, still a lot to be done and that is why my colleague, Mr PotoÄnik, will soon ask for proposals for further research into the vaccine.
We are currently doing this and I agree with Members that we have to develop a better vaccine, which is easier to use, more effective and does not hide the disease and infection.
At the same time, there is still much to be learned about the involvement and effect of migratory and other wild birds in spreading the disease.
We have to work on the assumption â as this is what the evidence shows, contrary to what we thought in the past â that the disease is spread by migratory birds.
However, it also exists in other species such as sparrows and pigeons in south-east Asia.
There is still therefore a lot to be learned.
With regard to surveillance, we are using hunters and have asked other groups to also support us in this effort.
In addition, we need to know a lot about the virus itself.
We therefore not only finance the surveillance programmes and the study of wild and migratory birds, but we will also support the actual research into the virus itself and how it behaves â it is a tricky virus and it changes continuously.
Thankfully it has not mutated into a human strain yet, but it behaves in a different way in different birds in different regions.
Acquiring as much information as soon as possible is therefore very important.
On the issue of vaccination, it is correct that the new legislation changes the approach.
We do not discourage vaccination.
It can be used if certain precautions are taken.
These precautions are necessary as mistakes could lead to serious consequences.
Without such precautious, the worst case would be that the vaccine would hide the infection and allow the disease to spread despite the birds having been vaccinated.
We have had support in the past with Italy.
We supported a project and gained important experience, especially with a system that allows vaccinated birds to be distinguished from infected birds.
There is flexibility in this legislation.
It takes into account the current limits of the vaccination.
The file has to be properly applied and monitored.
This is very important.
Nevertheless, we will support research in this field so as to have a more effective and easy-to-use vaccine.
On the issue of the plans, I will not say much about the human health aspects, because we discussed this at length a few weeks ago.
I can, however, confirm that all Member States have national plans.
Only two days ago we adopted both a Community plan for dealing with a pandemic of influenza and a more generic plan.
At the same time, this exercise has proved that there is inter-operability between the plans; we do not have 25 or 27Â separate actions.
We have synergies and coordination.
There is clearly always room for improvement.
This is why we had the exercise: to identify the weaknesses.
The systems worked and that is good.
The exchange of information and the communication also worked.
In addition, the early warning response system of the Community worked very well.
On the topic of vaccines and anti-virals, it is indeed true that there are concerns.
Not all Member States have reached the same level of preparedness.
The industry is not, at this point, in a position to supply the quantities required by the Member States and by the rest of the world.
That is why I have been having meetings with the industry and I will report to the Council on 9Â December and see how we can improve and enhance the production capacity.
I now turn to the issue of the low pathogenic form.
As mentioned earlier, I know there are some views â I see Mr Parish is smiling â that would also support a stamping-out policy for the low pathogenic form.
The Commission takes a different approach.
The legislation does not encourage it, this is true, but does not prohibit it either.
It therefore gives the Member Stats the option to apply it if they feel that this is the appropriate policy for that specific area, for their own region.
We have taken into account the advice of EFSA and ethical concerns as regards mass culls.
This is the reason why we reached such a conclusion.
Finally, I would like to say that we take into account the issues of animal welfare and the breeding aspects of animals and birds.
You will see this in our animal welfare strategy which will be adopted soon â by the end of the year, hopefully, or early next year.
I have to point out, however, that the disease has spread to farms in south-east Asia where animals are bred in a natural way.
This has not protected them from the virus.
I would like to conclude by stressing the unpredictable nature of the virus, which behaves in strange ways.
This is why the greatest emphasis is to be placed on research, so as to enable us to gather as much information as possible.
I should like to thank Members for this interesting debate.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Adopting a common strategy to face a possible crisis is extremely important for European industries and consumers.
The more the European Union takes on board the urgency of the situation, the more its citizens will sense that our interference in their daily lives is not merely bureaucratic, but tangible and effective.
It is therefore necessary to attain the maximum level of joint financing possible, that is to say 50% for the slaughter of animals infected with the virus and 50% for other expenses in the veterinary sector.
This sector in Italy produces a very high quality output and employs 80Â 000 workers.
Italy is one of the countries that have not only helped to develop the new vaccine against the H7N1 virus, but are equipping themselves best to face the risk of an epidemic: our Ministry has already provided for complete vaccination coverage if necessary, expanding the veterinary sector and putting in place a labelling system to show the provenance of each product.
These measures, which both protect consumers and ensure that consumption recovers, should be given proper recognition at a European level.
The Commission cannot take any action against a country protecting its own citizens: health must never come second to the laws of the market.

Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by MrÂ VanÂ Hecke, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems (COM(2004)0737 C6-0168/2004 2004/0258(COD)) (A6-0242/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Van Hecke, the rapporteur, for the hard work he has put into this dossier.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the members of all the committees involved.
They have also made a major contribution to the work of Parliament on this file.
The proposal from the Commission aims to implement at EU level the WTO General Council Decision of 30Â August 2003, allowing copies of patented medicines to be produced for export to countries in need.
This decision represents a waiver from the normal rules of patent law, particularly those set out in the WTO TRIPs Agreement.
It has to be seen within the wider context of existing national and international frameworks for patent protection.
The discussions in the WTO leading up to the decision of 30Â August were long and complex.
The decision itself represents a delicate balance between the need to ensure access now to medicines for countries with public health problems, and the need to encourage development in the future of new medicines, through investment in research and innovation protected under the patent system.
We have sought to reflect that balance in the Commissionâs proposal.
As many of you will know, the decision itself is a temporary measure.
It will remain in force until a permanent amendment is made to the TRIPs Agreement.
The negotiations on such an amendment have not yet been successful, despite several deadlines having passed.
The compulsory licensing issue thus remains on the agenda of the WTO.
However, that is no reason for us to delay: bringing our regulation into force as early as possible will allow countries in need and EU producers of pharmaceuticals to use the mechanism we are putting in place.
Indeed, all three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have supported the principle of early agreement on the regulation, and intensive informal discussions have been taking place with that in mind.
While these discussions have not always been easy, they took place in a spirit of good cooperation, and I must congratulate Mr Van Hecke again on the results which show how well the institutions can work together.
I am very pleased that these discussions have resulted in a compromise package.
I should say now that the Commission could support such a package of amendments if it is voted through in its entirety and without any additions or subtractions.
What is the Commissionâs proposal aiming to do?
It sets out a mechanism in line with the WTO decision so that companies in the EU can apply for a licence to manufacture, without the authorisation of the patent holder, pharmaceutical products for export to countries in need of medicines and facing public health concerns.
We have tried to produce an instrument that will allow the compulsory licensing procedure of the WTO decision to fit within the context of Member Statesâ existing national patent law and the compulsory licensing procedures they already have under that law.
An instrument at EU level implementing the WTO decision has great symbolic value as an external demonstration of the EUâs commitment to the decision.
At the same time, we have to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and so avoid regulating specific details which can better be dealt with under national law or by the competent authority which is processing the licensing application.
Parliamentâs work has resulted in some helpful clarification, particularly as regards an explanation of the involvement of non-governmental and international organisations.
We have always envisaged such organisations as being potentially involved in any purchasing procedures, and able to make requests on behalf of an importing country with that countryâs approval.
Of course it is unlikely that such organisations will themselves be manufacturing pharmaceuticals, but if they were they could simply apply for a licence under the regulation like any other manufacturer.
Another useful clarification has been improvement of the text relating to the possibility of using the EUâs scientific opinion procedure, or equivalent national procedures, to certify the safety and efficacy of medicines for export.
This is not something regulated in the WTO decision, indeed it lies outside that framework.
But in order to assist importing countries we felt it was a necessary complement to the licensing mechanism.
Let me now turn to the overall scope of the regulation.
The WTO decision provides for export of medicines to WTO members who are least-developed countries or who are developing countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity of their own.
There is no specific restriction on the pharmaceutical products covered, although there is acknowledgement that they are required to address public health problems, since that is in the context of the decision.
The Commission originally took the view that we should reflect faithfully the scope of the decision as regards the countries eligible to receive exported medicines.
That position was based on our assessment of the WTO decision, which specifically covers WTO members as beneficiary countries.
I am pleased to say that since then we have accepted humanitarian arguments that all least-developed countries and certain low-income developing countries should be eligible, regardless of whether they are currently WTO members.
At the same time, to help ensure that the right medicines get to the right patients, non-WTO members are also expected to make similar commitments to those required from WTO members.
This means they should notify what medicines are required and commit to preventing trade diversion if they are to receive products under the EU mechanism.
Another important issue is the question of remuneration for patent holders.
I do not think there is any disagreement that patent holders should receive some remuneration for the licences granted without their authorisation.
This is a normal principle of law.
In the interests of a certain transparency for industry investing in the production of medicines, and as part of the overall compromise package, we could support the proposed formula for remuneration which still leaves some leeway for determination on a case-by-case basis.
Let me conclude at this point by reiterating that the Commission remains very much in favour of the early adoption of this regulation, while respecting the overall objective of introducing a workable, transparent system which companies are able to use for the export of medicines to countries in need.
I would call on Parliament to support the compromise package which is on the table.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner said, my report seeks to implement the WTO General Council Decision of 30Â August 2003.
This Decision gives the WTO members, in application of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPs, the option of granting compulsory licences for the production and sale of patented pharmaceutical products to countries with an acute public health problem and insufficient, or no, production capacity.
It is just about the only agreement that the WTO members managed to reach in CancÃºn.
My report aims to ensure that this WTO Decision is applied, by means of a European regulation, in a uniform manner in all EU Member States.
In our Committee on International Trade, there was a large majority in favour of making considerable adjustments to the Commissionâs original proposal.
This consensus gave us a particularly strong negotiating position during the informal trialogue that was started without delay.
Particularly the British Presidency, with the WTO ministerial conference on the horizon â which I think gives them an excuse for not being here this evening â insisted on an agreement at first reading.
Nearly all the proposals by the Committee on International Trade were eventually accepted thanks to the excellent cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs of the other political parties who have upheld Parliamentâs viewpoints with much expertise and force, for which I am very grateful to them.
The key improvement to the Commission proposal is without a doubt the extension of the scope to include non-WTO members.
From now on, all developing countries will, if necessary, be able to make use of the system.
Moreover, NGOs and international organisations, such as the UN, will be entitled to submit their own applications for the import of medicines.
It is, after all, often those organisations that distribute medicines in developing countries.
Furthermore, an accelerated and simplified procedure will be introduced to deal with demand for additional quantities, and I would thank Mr Arif who has played a key role in this.
Additional applications will become possible if it transpires that the quantity of medicines initially allocated in the compulsory licence is insufficient to relieve the suffering.
Another important change is the scrapping of the requirement of prior negotiations with the patent holder in the case of a significant emergency situation arising or other situations of non-commercial or public use.
As far as these prior negotiations are concerned, the Committee on International Trade has insisted on the period being specified more clearly as being a maximum of 30 days.
This was eventually accepted by the Council, just as the concrete fleshing out of the notion of suitable remuneration that must be paid to the rightful claimants who will simply keep 4% of the total value of the product in question in the event of an emergency situation.
In other cases, the economic value will be taken into consideration, but 4% will remain the benchmark.
The compromise entails a number of changes over against the original Commission proposal, and these were incorporated into amendments tabled both by me and by the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups.
I hope that they will be adopted and that the agreement reached with the Council and Commission can be ratified.
We will at any rate be able to say in Hong Kong that Europe has translated this important WTO Decision into a uniform regulation for the whole of the Union.
This can only benefit our credibility in respect of the many needy in the developing countries and in the regions hit by natural disasters.
It is in that spirit that I would like to urge my fellow Members to approve the amendments and thus to ratify the agreement that has been reached.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has just been pointed out, our debate today concerns the regulation to put in place a mechanism for countries that are unable to produce the medicines that are essential for the public health of their citizens.
The fact that we are dealing with this question on the eve of World Aids Day should encourage us to send a loud and clear message to those countries so tragically affected.
UN Aids again reminded us very recently of the sad reality that the world has never before had so many people who are carriers of HIV.
The number of persons infected passed the 40 million mark this year and Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected with two thirds of the worldâs sufferers and three quarters of the worldâs infected women.
It has been clear from the outset that Parliament has one priority, namely the rapid implementation of the regulation in question, so that countries in need can benefit from the flexibility offered by the WTOâs 30 August 2003 solution as soon as possible.
This is a first step in the European Unionâs compliance with the spirit of the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health.
I would like to thank my colleague Mr Van Hecke warmly for the work he has done in consultation and collaboration with the counter rapporteurs.
He appears before us today with a compromise that manages to take account of Membersâ positions: it is a responsible stance.
Several of our demands appear in the final text, in particular the widening of the scope to the least developed countries and certain developing countries that are not members of the WTO.
In view of the vital role that NGOs and certain international organisations play in the supply of health services and treatments, I am glad that they will be allowed to deal with patent holders directly in order to buy and distribute generic medicines.
I am also pleased to see that my proposal for a simplified procedure for additional quantities has been adopted.
There are many positive points.
I do have a number of regrets, however, especially regarding the appropriate remuneration to be paid to patent holders.
I would have liked the rapporteurâs proposed 4% ceiling to be mandatory in all situations and not only in emergencies.
We have nevertheless succeeded in getting the fact that the compulsory licence is issued for humanitarian and not for commercial reasons taken into account when that remuneration is calculated.
I also hope that this regulation will be evaluated quickly and its viability assessed.
In view of the complexity of the mechanism it seeks to deploy, I shall remain vigilant to see that this solution is permanently included in the WTO intellectual property rules.
Indeed, only such an evaluation will enable us to draw adequate conclusions for effectively revising and adapting our response to the public health problems encountered by the countries of the South.
Meeting the challenge of access to medicines requires a more global approach and the regulation we are discussing today is only one stage in that.
Within the WTO, Europe must commit itself to ensuring that all the Doha Agreementâs public health advances are translated into reality.
This means in particular ensuring that no bilateral or regional trade agreements include additional conditions on intellectual property that would undo the gains of the Doha Declaration.
Moreover, if application of that declaration leaves something to be desired in practice, the EU must also try to find new ways to give the developing countries easier access to medicines.
Even now, we are faced with the need for second-line treatments, for which no generics are yet available and the price of which is prohibitive, requiring renewed action on our part.
The fight against Aids and, I must stress, many other diseases afflicting mainly the poorest populations is far from being won.
The forthcoming WTO conference in Hong Kong gives us an ideal opportunity to bring the question of access to medicines back to the centre of the debate.
Adopting this regulation today offers us a first definite solution for thousands of sick people who are waiting for treatment, but let us not forget, when tomorrow comes, to seek lasting solutions equal to the scale of the challenge that faces us.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing is something that at first sight appears simple and logical, but which, on closer examination, results in significant problems, up to and including the protection afforded by patents being undermined or rendered ineffective.
I am today speaking on behalf of my colleague Mrs Weisgerber, who is unable to be here for personal reasons.
This House goes beyond the Commission proposal in demanding the extension of compulsory licensing not only to needy WTO members, but also to over 40 other states equally in need of help.
While there is agreement across group boundaries that the group of eligible countries should be expanded as a political indication of willingness to help countries that are not members of the WTO, it is equally possible to find this objectionable.
Even though we have gone to a great deal of trouble to seek â and, it is to be hoped, to find â a fair balance between the claims of the poorer countries on this planet and the licence-holdersâ justifiable interest in protecting their patents, there is still a great deal of uncertainty.
Who, in the final analysis, is in a position to monitor the re-labelling or repackaging of medicines and to prevent their being reimported into the European Union â the Member States at national level, the Commission, the importing countries, the industry or the drugs business?
Are we not, by doing this, giving people a licence to create considerable problems for us at a later date?
With the situation that we can currently observe, with people making great profits from the illegal trade in medicines across every border and by every route â ranging from the Internet to across the traditional shop counter â I have to say that I have misgivings.
I will be taking the liberty of asking the Council and the Commission, at regular intervals, how the figures stand and how many compulsory licences have been applied for, and I look forward to receiving accurate data in response.
I understand that the British Presidency of the Council wants to notch this up as a success for itself.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the proposal on generic medicines for developing countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, many of the people who die every day in developing countries could have been saved with medicines that are available to us all, but are too expensive for them.
Developing medicines costs money.
The average cost involved in bringing a medicine onto the market varies from around EUR 600 to EURÂ 900 million.
Businesses are compensated for this via patent rights, and rightly so, but the effect is to make medicines expensive.
The directive we are currently debating intends to ensure that people in the poorest countries can access the necessary medicines, namely that poor countries can, in special cases and under certain conditions, produce medicines at affordable prices, which is a good thing.
We must, however, prevent a situation in which it becomes unattractive for industries to develop medicines.
That is why we must make every effort to ensure that the regulation cannot be abused, for example via re-imports to the EU.
The regulation is aimed at promoting health and not trade.
That is why we think that precise descriptions must be given of reasons underlying applications for the compulsory licence, of the patents in question, that the medicines in question should have a different appearance, colour and packaging, where possible, and that the level of production must be logged.
The TRIPs regulation on patents has been in place for some time.
Whilst it has, to our knowledge, never been used, it is still important.
It can help patent holders to find solutions for emergency situations in developing countries quickly and under excellent conditions.
Needless to say, this regulation cannot totally eliminate all the problems surrounding medicines in developing countries.
They also need a road network, refrigerated transport, sufficient medical staff, and suchlike. It does, however, represent a considerable addition to the aid in special emergency cases.
This compromise makes it possible to transpose into EU law the WTO Decision in respect of TRIPs.
With the WTO Summit in Hong Kong on the horizon, this can send out a positive message, which will stand the EU in good stead, and so I should like to congratulate Mr Van Hecke on the result of negotiations with the Council and Commission.
I am pleased that a compromise has been struck and I hope that Parliament will accept it tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Hecke, on the enormous amount of work done in relation to this report.
The subject matter was difficult and complicated.
It is to be noted that, in the codecision procedure followed in respect of this proposal for a regulation, there were intense negotiations which culminated, I am glad to say, in a compromise text which includes most of the essential key points.
In my opinion, the inclusion of the following points in the compromise text is of particular significance.
Firstly, the necessity of vital technology transfer and technical assistance to countries deficient in national drug manufacturing capacity.
Such assistance will help much-needed, long-term improvement of healthcare provision in underdeveloped countries.
Secondly, the extension of eligibility to non-WTO members: such countries are just as much in need of assistance under the provisions of this regulation as WTO member countries.
Public health concerns and disease prevention and treatment cannot be differentiated on the grounds of WTO membership.
Thirdly, the extension of applicants to NGOs and international organisations such as the United Nations: it is well known that many NGOs and international organisations play a major role in providing vital healthcare services in developing countries.
Their rapid involvement in fighting disease and poverty and eliminating human suffering, especially in disaster-stricken regions, is well established and in most instances it is more important and better coordinated than national government assistance efforts.
It is therefore only logical that a request from an NGO acting with authorisation from an importing country should be eligible under these regulations.
Finally, although this regulation will no doubt help save millions of lives worldwide, I feel it has come a little too late.
Let us recall that the TRIPs Agreement was adopted in 1994; the landmark Doha Declaration on TRIPs and public health was produced in 2001; the decision of the General Council of the WTO was taken in 2003 and this regulation will probably come into force in 2006.
I wonder whether such a delay may have been responsible for much confusion, inaction and probably unnecessary human suffering in the developing world.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this is a matter of human rights â the right to survive â versus intellectual property rights â the right to be paid for something that one has produced.
Obviously, the right to life is more important than all other rights.
This represents the first step towards defending the right to life.
The Commissionâs proposal is too weak and, in my opinion, Parliament has improved it, especially with regard to enabling NGOs to use the directive.
Another improvement stems from our justified criticism of the need for remuneration and of how this is to be defined and from the fact that we also apply such considerations to countries that are not members of the WTO and whose citizensâ lives are worth just as much as those of citizens of WTO countries.
On the subject of adequate remuneration, the fact is that, if you do not have any money, you cannot provide adequate remuneration.
There just will not be any.
That must be made absolutely clear.
I also hope that these measures will be implemented as quickly as possible, as I do not believe that this legislation is sufficient, and the only way for us to find out if it is in fact sufficient is for us to get it through quickly so that we can test it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Van Heckeâs amendment makes a tangible improvement to the Commissionâs draft regulation to the benefit of developing countries, and for that he is of course to be thanked.
My group does, nevertheless, have a problem with the regulation.
While it is intended to incorporate and implement the 30 August resolution of the WTO General Council, it has, today, already become evident that the agreed system for the handling of patented medicines will not be workable in practice. This has been confirmed by respected international organisations with experience of diseases â âMÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšresâ and âAct Upâ for example â and proven by practical experience in such countries as Canada.
The compulsory licensing system is cumbersome â so much so as to make the provision of development aid and effective help in the fight against Aids epidemics impossible.
Even if the 30 August resolution softens the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the health field, we still do not see the fundamental human right to health as being given priority.
It is for that reason that my group will find it difficult to vote in favour even of an improved development draft.
Â Â  Mr President, I really do have to quote a great man of letters and say, âalas, two souls dwell in my breastâ.
On the one hand, six million people every year die of Aids, tuberculosis and malaria; they are from the poorest countries in the world, and they lack medicines that are both effective and affordable.
It is for that reason that the WTO, as long ago as November 2001, decided that its member states could, in emergencies â and I emphasise, in emergencies â abrogate the international patent protection afforded to medicines.
That is why, subject to certain conditions, domestic producers of medicines or other generic manufacturers can apply for a compulsory licence entitling them to manufacture cheaper copies of patented medicines.
That is the good news.
The other side of the coin is that the pharmaceutical research industry invests masses of money in effective and innovative preparations.
Research and development creates jobs, and the work to be done in it can and must be funded by patent protection.
I therefore believe that the principle of patent protection for medicines must not be undermined.
Research into medicines must continue to be worth the effort, since the development of new medicines is in the interests of all.
Only under exceptional circumstances, then, does it really make sense to award compulsory licences.
We must also prevent their being misused, and so the patent holder should be accorded certain information rights, enabling him himself to monitor compliance with licence conditions and to draw attention to breaches of them.
We also have to know what is to be supplied to which countries and in what quantities, and we really do have to prevent cheap copies from finding their way back into Europe by being reimported.
This can be done by, for example, special labelling, packaging or different colours or designs.
Taken as a whole, I regard the proposal on which we are going to vote tomorrow as a reasonable one.
Nobody here regards it as perfect, and so it is probably a good compromise.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for this regulation is intended to facilitate compulsory licences for the manufacture of medicines destined for countries with public health problems.
What is regrettable about this debate is that some Members â particularly in the lead committee â keep trying to point the finger of suspicion at the medical research industry, and hence also at those who deal with patents, with unwarranted insinuations that they are indifferent to people in poorer parts of the world.
Patents do not stand in the way of humanitarian action â the contrary is the case, for without them, innovative companies are unable to take on high levels of financial risk and invest billions in research and development.
It is only by means of such investments that medicines can be developed that can, for example, keep pace with the constant changes in certain pathogens.
That benefits not only us in Europe, but also people in every country throughout the world.
Were there no patents, medicines and vaccinations against many fatal diseases would never have been developed â medicines and vaccinations now within the reach of everyone, including of course people in the developing world.
Compulsory licensing is no solution to the problem of how to combat diseases in developing countries.
More effective control and better setting of priorities would make it possible for billions given for development and humanitarian purposes, but then misdirected, to be used to buy adequate supplies of medicines.
If we want to take the Lisbon Strategy seriously, that is to say, if we want to move research and development forward, we need an effective protection for patents that cannot be weakened or set aside at will.
TRIPS may well make compulsory licences possible, but they are not a necessity, for there are alternatives to them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal of the Commission to enable the producers of generic medicines to manufacture and market patented medicines, with a view to exporting them to countries that are not entirely self-sufficient, should be warmly welcomed because it represents a positive step.
The regulation, in fact, allows for the granting of licences, which are compulsory for export purposes, and provides that the conditions under which they are issued are identical in all the Member States of the European Union.
I consider it an inviolable principle that distortion of competition for operators in the single market be avoided by applying uniform rules to prevent pharmaceutical products manufactured under compulsory licences and at low prices from being reimported into the EU.
By acting thus, the EU is putting itself forward as one of the international players most committed to ensuring that citizens of the most disadvantaged countries have access to medicines at reduced prices.
Although I am a committed supporter of this proposal, I must, however, point out that the measures contained in the proposal in question reduce the protection afforded to intellectual property rights.
It would therefore be reasonable to allow patent holders the opportunity to be involved in the procedure laid down for the granting of compulsory licences for the manufacture and sale of medicines intended for export to World Trade Organisation countries.
This opportunity for involvement would be achieved through the right to submit comments to the competent national authority to ensure that the decision taken minimises any loss of intellectual property rights, by providing for both parties to have a say in the proceedings.
In particular, in the case of marketing authorisations, this procedure would allow the holders to enter the EU market in circumstances under which they would not otherwise be allowed to do so.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by MrÂ Duff, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on guidelines for the approval of the European Commission (2005/2024(INI)) (A6-0179/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, the turbulent proceedings surrounding the approval of the Barroso Commission seem like a long time ago.
Some of the fallout is probably reflected in the new framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament, notably that if Parliament were to withdraw its confidence in any Member of the Commission, the President will either sack that Commissioner or come before Parliament and explain why not.
But it is necessary too for Parliament, as well as for the Commission, to reflect upon the outcome of the approval procedure.
Parliament needs to do so from its own perspective.
This report, passed by a large majority of the committee, will be the product of that review.
The key to our resolve will be to secure an approval procedure that is transparent, fair and consistent; a procedure in which the Commission candidates disclose relevant information as to his or her professional capacity to do the job to which he or she will be assigned.
The report sets out our criteria for the assessment of candidates, including European commitment and the gender balance that is achieved across the whole team.
It codifies the procedure for the approval process, the organisation of the hearings, the questions, the issues of transparency and the decision-making process of each committee.
To achieve both greater clarity and coherence it is proposed that a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents should be charged with the task of declaring the hearings closed.
We assert our right to follow the same procedure should there be a casual vacancy from the Commission during its five-year mandate.
Finally, we ask that the next parliamentary elections be brought forward from June to May 2009 so that we will have more chance to prepare the approval process properly.
Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, both Parliament and Commission have learned a great deal from our experience of 2004.
The democratic accountability of the Union is hereby strengthened.
I commend the report to the House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to thank MrÂ Duff for his report, which has the â highly commendable â aim of rendering Parliamentâs procedure for the hearings of Commissioners-designate transparent and coherent.
The hearings procedure is a political exercise used by the European Parliament to increase the democratic legitimacy of the Commission before Parliament.
It is clear, therefore, that careful reflection is required when any changes to this procedure are proposed.
As everybody knows, in May last year the President of the European Parliament and the President of the European Commission signed an extremely important document, consisting of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission.
This framework agreement, along with the Treaties, constitutes the essential reference point.
In item 7 there is a specific provision on the appointment of the new Commission.
Three principles which must be applied during the hearings are very clearly detailed there: the principle of transparency and openness, the principle of fairness and the principle of consistency.
These principles were decided by common agreement and were signed last May by Parliament and the Commission, and must be applied throughout the entire procedure.
That said, I wish to draw the attention of the rapporteur and my fellow Members to two points.
The first concerns the consultation of the Commission President-designate in the context of the hearings procedure.
The framework agreement explicitly provides that Parliament establish the framework agreement and arrange contact with the Commission President-designate, in good time and before the start of the approval procedure for the new Commission.
It also lays down that Parliament must take account of any comments made by the President-designate, as stated also in Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure.
For this reason, recital E of MrÂ Duffâs report should be interpreted in the sense that the President of the Commission has to be consulted in good time, thereby giving him the opportunity to be heard, and for any comments he has to be accorded due consideration.
I therefore consider the formula set out by the rapporteur to be good.
The second point concerns the replacement of a member of the College.
I personally am in favour of the principle, also set out in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, according to which, in the case of a Commissioner being replaced during the Collegeâs term of office, the relevant parliamentary committee has the right, as well as the duty, to meet and hear the new member of the Commission.
This is unquestionably an important principle.
I wish, however, to point out that, while the term âCommissioner-designateâ is used in the report, the current Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the new member of the College, in the case of a replacement, is not termed âCommissioner-designateâ but rather âfull Commissionerâ right from the moment of his appointment.
It is of course clearly understood that â even if a full Commissioner â the relevant parliamentary committee must meet and hear him before he can begin to carry out his term of office.
These are the considerations I wish to leave for the rapporteur, as confirmation of the highly positive approach both the Commission and I myself take to the views expressed.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Duff report is the starting point for Parliamentâs ritual for approving the Commission, on account of the fact that the Rules of Procedure say almost nothing on the matter.
The ritual is commensurate with the importance of the political act of approving the Commission, firstly, because its legitimacy is enhanced by more stringent guidelines; secondly because Parliament is increasingly involved in the process of forming the Commission, and accordingly plays a role that is far from being merely symbolic; and thirdly because it strikes a fresh balance between Europeâs political institutions, which incorporates the mechanisms of monitoring and responsibility inherent in a constitutional relationship.
Parliamentâs procedure for approving the Commission now has a framework of standards establishing greater fairness in the Commissioner-designate hearings in the parliamentary committees and greater consistency in the final assessment, which is currently overseen jointly by the Conference of Presidents and the Conference of Committee Chairs.
We need to ensure that democratic procedures do not have a merely formal or symbolic meaning.
Rather, they are responsible for bringing the publicâs values and wishes to the mechanics of the institutions, so that the Community can make an informed decision.
The more ambitious the European political process has become, the tighter it has also become.
It therefore needs to be subject to intense scrutiny; it must lead to strong institutions and to leadership capable of taking a lead in pointing the way to the future.
Europe no longer recognises itself without the increased transparency and legitimacy among its institutions, and without the requirements of integrity and responsibility demanded of everyone, but especially of political leaders, given that it is they who are responsible for the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, one of the special features of the European Union is that its central administration does not just consist of faceless bureaucrats: it is headed by a political executive.
The Commissioners are politicians who hold office thanks to the confidence they receive from the European Parliament, and only for as long as they continue to enjoy that confidence, because we can of course dismiss them in a vote of censure.
That is essential to the political accountability of the system.
It means that, unlike many international structures, our central administration â albeit small â is accountable.
That is very important.
The hearings are a very visible part of the process of the appointment of the Commission, which underlines this principle of accountability.
It is something relatively new. It was not in the original Treaties.
The fact that we have a vote of confidence on the Commission as a whole and that its term of office coincides with that of Parliament was brought in through the Maastricht Treaties and enhanced with the Amsterdam Treaty.
The hearings are not even mentioned in the Treaties.
We have built that up ourselves.
It is now an accepted part of our procedure and one which is welcomed by all democrats.
This report essentially confirms the practice we have built up, but it brings in three small innovations.
First, it limits the written questionnaire that is sent out by committees to Commissioners beforehand.
These have tended to grow and grow and, frankly, seem to serve no particular purpose when we know in fact that they are answered in a rather bureaucratic way beforehand.
Second, the report proposes that within Parliament we have a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents of this House to make a global evaluation prior to the debate in plenary and to declare the process of hearings closed.
They could, of course, declare it still to be open and ask for a further hearing with one or another designate Commissioner.
That gives extra flexibility.
The third innovation is to call for the European elections to be brought forward from June to May, to give more time for this procedure.
That is something we should be asking for anyway as a European Parliament, because ever since we enlarged the Union northwards it has been a bit silly to have our elections in June, which is the main holiday period in the northern countries.
May would be a much better time in any case to have European elections.
The procedure has worked well.
What happened last time showed that it worked well and we are not asking for a right of censure on individual Commissioners.
What happened last time showed that there are ways and means of correcting queries about an individual Commissioner through the President of the Commission, whilst maintaining the collegiality of the Commission.
It works.
If it had not worked we would not have Mr Frattini here with us today to take part in this debate, and it is with pleasure that I welcome him.
I also welcome his comments.
They were slightly grudging at some points. However, I noticed that he did not challenge the fact that this report is entirely compatible with the Interinstitutional Agreement.
It is in that spirit that it was drafted and in which I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow by this Parliament.
I thank the rapporteur and all those who helped with this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I particularly want to thank the rapporteur for the great deal of work he has put in and also to say that my group endorses his report.
It was, of course, in 1994 that this House began the practice of hearings for those nominated to the Commission, and it was in 2004 at the latest that the public became aware of just how important the thorough examination of candidates for the office of Commissioner is, and above all of the fact that this House is not a governmental rubber-stamp.
The report provides Parliament with an important array of instruments for the future, and spells out in more precise terms what its rights are when it comes to the choice of the Commission.
I particularly want to stress the fact that we will in future have clear criteria for the assessment of candidates, those being indubitable independence, knowledge of the relevant portfolio and, in particular, complete disclosure of all information on their financial interests.
If, in future, Parliament acts in accordance with these guidelines, it will certainly benefit the credibility of both institutions in the eyes of the public.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Roure and MrsÂ Berger, on behalf of the Socialist Group in Parliament, by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by Mrs Wallis and Baroness Ludford, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the imposition of criminal penalties in the event of an infringement of Community law (O-0085/2005/rev.2 B6-0336/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the judgment of the Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 finds that the Community has exclusive competence for the adoption of criminal penalties to ensure the effectiveness of Community law.
It therefore allows the Union to reaffirm that the protection of its citizens is one of its fundamental principles.
It also gives us an opportunity to put an end to a recurrent conflict between the European institutions by clarifying the distribution of competences between the first and third pillars.
The case before the Court of Justice concerned an environmental protection directive that carried criminal penalties and was the subject of the Di Lello report of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
We agree with the European Commissionâs analysis.
This judgmentâs consequences go far beyond environmental protection and are likely to affect all Community policies and the fundamental freedoms recognised by the Treaty.
Serious encroachments on citizensâ fundamental rights must incur effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.
That is what we want for the data retention directive, for example, because it will have a significant effect on the private lives of European citizens.
One of the major consequences is therefore that the codecision procedure will apply in areas that were formerly the subject of unanimous voting with the European Parliament merely giving its opinion.
The judgment gives the European Parliament a deciding role and this strengthening of democratic control is a step forward for democracy as a whole.
The Commission has identified a number of framework decisions adopted on an erroneous legal basis.
The definition of such penalties should refer to Community provisions relating to the protection of fundamental rights.
I will therefore end with a specific question to the Commissioner: does the Commission also plan to review the framework decision on racism and xenophobia in this way?
Â Â  .
Mr President, it is a joyful evening, for I am delighted with what Commissioner Frattini has done, and I also very much endorse the document produced by the Commission â to which I am grateful â that describes the effects of the judgment of 13 December 2005.
Indeed, along with Mrs Roure and the Commission, I share the view that this pertains not only to environmental matters, but has repercussions in many more areas.
The Commission has produced a list of decisions that need adjusting â about which I will say something in a moment â but there is also an important decision underway that has been the subject of many debates, namely the decision on data retention.
The Commission knows that Parliament sets great store by the fact that an enormous amount of data will probably be collected but will be used for limited purposes.
Am I right in concluding from the judgment that legally, we can impose a penalty if this data is misused?
Whilst this is, of course, a matter of political resolve that we have to reach a decision of this kind, it is legally possible, and would that penalty legally apply, not only for the providers but also for the government?
The other point is about implementing this list so that it is legally in order.
I share the Commissionâs view in this, namely that we should not subject everything to a codecision procedure, and that we should make pragmatic adjustments to some extent, although I have reservations, because sometimes, there are aspects, such as facilitating unauthorised entry, which I know for a fact presented my group with a major dilemma.
Indeed, there are people who help others to enter the EU because they think those people really need political asylum.
I think that we should draw a distinction between people who help others for financial gain and others who really do this out of non-commercial motives.
Whilst in my case, I am still undecided as to whether we can carry out all those adjustments so easily, I do share the view that a whole new codecision procedure would probably be unwarranted for the lionâs share of the proposals.
I am taking advantage of the fact that I have not been silenced to add a quick question of my own.
Article 13, which refers to the old existing anti-discrimination directives, does enable the Member States to impose their own penalties if they consider this to be proportionate and effective.
Would it not be possible at some stage, to table a proposal to that effect, to throw this open to the whole of Europe in order to demonstrate that we consider this so important for the civil rights, that we in Europe think that any instance of discrimination should incur a financial sanction.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank MrsÂ Roure and MrsÂ Buitenweg for having raised this question, which is of key importance in Europe in terms of its space of legal competence in the field of criminal law.
I agree with the approach of both speeches and can promise that the Commission will make sure that this important decision by the European Court of Justice is applied in full, putting into practice its core principle, namely that when it is necessary to guarantee the effectiveness of Community regulations, criminal sanctions can be introduced by the Community legislator via the codecision procedure, and by that means only.
This opens up a very broad and significant area, both for the full involvement of Parliament, and as a way of moving beyond the intergovernmental approach, which up to now has prevailed.
Clearly, when drafting the proposals for the introduction of criminal sanctions, the Commission will have to hold to two main principles.
The first is the need for criminal legislation, because criminal sanctions can only be imposed when necessary.
This is a universal principle of law.
The second is the consistency of the various provisions: once again, contradictions within criminal provisions must be avoided otherwise there could in theory be grave legal uncertainty, precisely because of a lack of consistency.
We have identified certain areas in which the decision of the Court may be applied in practice.
As you are no doubt aware, we have decided to appeal to the Court of Justice in relation to the framework decision on marine pollution.
We did this a few days ago because the time limit for an appeal had not yet expired and we considered it opportune to give an immediate demonstration by contesting the framework decision on marine pollution before the Court.
We consider this to be one of the subjects on which a directive containing criminal sanctions should have been adopted, rather than a framework decision.
We have also proposed a means of extending this to other fields.
When, for example, a framework decision has already been handed down, one could, without altering the substance of the text, use an agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission to adopt the correct legal basis whilst avoiding having to open a discussion on the substance as well.
This type of solution would speed matters up greatly.
A final response on the two subjects of racism and non-discrimination.
Obviously I am in favour of adopting legislation which criminally penalises at least incitement to racial hatred, and hence to committing acts of racism.
In this area criminal sanctions are undoubtedly necessary, even if, as I am sure you know, agreement has unfortunately not even yet been reached on the framework decision.
I promised that in early 2006 I would propose a new initiative on racism and xenophobia in order to overcome the obstruction that has occurred within the Council.
Article 13 of the Treaty may be used instead to introduce criminal sanctions in cases of discrimination based on race or nationality.
The means exist, most obviously in Article 13, which undoubtedly forms the subject of a directive, and is therefore chiefly a Community matter.
In such cases the Commission may also adopt proposals for criminal legislation.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to Mrs Roure and Mrs Buitenweg.
As you are aware, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was not keen for this debate to take place this evening.
We feel it would have made more sense if, before anything else, the parliamentary committees concerned had carefully analysed the Commission communication on this judgment.
Apart from that procedural difference, however, we are broadly in agreement.
I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on his answers to the Chamber and on the Courtâs decision, which addresses our concern to strengthen Community law and the first pillar, and the decisions that we can make in areas such as these under the scope of the first pillar, rather than the third.
It would therefore appear that the Court recognises that criminal law and the criminal justice system do not fall under the Communityâs jurisdiction, but that this does not stop the Community legislature from adopting measures relating to criminal penalties in the Member States, provided that they are consistent and necessary in order to safeguard the efficacy of Community law.
A useful precedent has been set.
I feel that the Commission will make use of that precedent, and Mr Frattini can rest assured that Parliament, for its part, will also make use of it.
Mrs Roure talked of the impact that this agreement will have, not only on environmental issues, but in a number of other areas as well, including what we consider to be the most crucial area, namely that of fundamental freedoms when it is necessary to impose criminal penalties in order to ensure their effectiveness.
One of the consequences to which you referred, Commissioner, is that some framework decisions were adopted on unsound legal grounds.
The judgment mentions seven framework decisions, I believe.
This situation must therefore be regularised by means of the quick and simple adoption of Community instruments to replace these framework decisions under the codecision procedure.
What I should like to ask you, Commissioner, is whether you can give us some indication of the timetable that the Commission will follow for presenting these initiatives, in order that, under the codecision procedure, we can quickly bypass the legal framework that is bypassed by the judgment.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, a number of things have been going on since we tabled our oral question.
The Committee on Legal Affairs heard your representatives, and we have now received the communication from the Commission, the substance of which we welcome along with that of the decision by the Court of Justice.
I think it is a good thing that the Commission should have stated clearly that this decision by the Court of Justice is applicable in situations other than that which gave rise to it â which was environmental in character âand affects all policies, notably including the four freedoms referred to in the Treaty.
There have also been proposals that its applicability be restricted to the objectives of Article 2, something to which I expressed my opposition in the Committee, for which reason I approve of the way the Commission has framed its position on the subject.
What we, together, have to sort out is how we will, if it comes to it, go about transferring more acts from the third pillar to the first.
You have described the principles behind the two ways in which we might do this.
The first would involve not making any substantial changes, but merely changing the legal basis and concluding an inter-institutional agreement to obviate the need to have the content of the whole thing gone through again.
The second option would be to have a proper codecision procedure, with the Commission having the opportunity to make substantial alterations to the content, and it is this approach that I favour, subject to what is said in future debates, as being, in my view, more suited to the present day.
We have 10 new Member States, who surely also have an interest in now making the contribution to the legal acts that they were, of course, unable to make before accession.
Unless, then, I am persuaded that there is a better way of doing it, I am in favour of this matter being dealt with through the normal legislative process.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Council and the Member States argued before the Court, a teleological reading of the Treaties once again leads to the letter of them being overturned, not to say violated, especially Articles 135 and 280 of the EC Treaty and 29 of the EU Treaty, which clearly reserve criminal competence for the Member States.
Thus, without a treaty, without a mandate and against the wishes of the Member States and the Council, the Court of Justice and the Commission have agreed to use this judicial communitisation of criminal law to merge the pillars of competences within the Union.
That was one of the objectives of the Constitutional Treaty which, if I may remind those of our fellow Members who still refuse to accept the fact, has been rejected and has become null and void under international law.
The Commission has clearly lost no time in stepping into the breach this opened up.
On 23 November last, it added to criminal environmental law an initial list of nine new criminal competences it was unilaterally removing from the Member States.
This continued absorption of national competences is also reflected in the future European civil code, which is still being prepared, with no legal basis, by the Von Bar Group with a EUR 5 million subsidy from the European taxpayer.
Are the supranational institutions using some mysterious hegemonic principle that says the nations do not matter or are an obstacle to be overcome, to take their revenge for the referenda of 29 May and 1 June?
These judicial shows of strength are distorting the model of Europe that our countries agreed to.
We are faced with what French Constitutional Council President Pierre Mazeaud feared at the start of the year: a serious defect of consent.
I therefore want to say, quietly but solemnly, that those in this House who fail to respond to these shows of strength are committing an act against their governments, against their parliaments, against their constitutions, against the European treaties themselves and against the nations and are paving the way for renewed insurrections, not only electoral ones, against a Europe that is emphatically no longer their own.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion â which I think is shared by the vast majority of Parliament â the ruling of the European Court of Justice in Case C-0176 represents a success for the European Parliament, not only because the Court took up the suggestions made by Parliament in September 2003, based on a report by the Committee on Legal Affairs which I have the honour of chairing, but also because it has forced the Council to respect Articles 24, 29 and 47, which clearly state that the Treaty establishing the European Community has precedence over the Treaty on European Union.
For this reason, in the field of criminal sanctions, the Council will no longer be able to use Title VI to make unilateral decisions without the intervention of the European Parliament as colegislator.
I believe this to be a great advance and a great result which does credit to the European Union as a whole.
It seems clear that, without the intervention of Parliament, a fundamental principle of democracy, namely , would have been overlooked rather than reaffirmed.
The Court of Justice, whilst recognising, obviously, that the Community cannot establish criminal sanctions or achieve harmonisation of criminal law, has provided that â if criminal sanctions are essential to achieve the requirements or aims of the Treaty â the Community can oblige Member States to provide for them and apply them.
This means that if the Community has competence to regulate conduct in order to achieve a particular aim, it also has competence to decide if that conduct may be punished at a national level through recourse to administrative or criminal sanctions.
The European institutions are therefore called upon to carry out the ruling of the Court of Justice and â here I address myself particularly to the Commissioner â the European Commission has given certain indications as to how it will act.
I believe that merely transferring the provisions contained in a framework decision to a community directive is unacceptable if this transfer is not carried out with full respect for the prerogatives of the European Parliament.
Parliament must be able to intervene on substance if the legal basis provides that it is colegislator.
As far as the pending legislative proposals are concerned, I am grateful to the Commissioner if the Commission is taking steps to withdraw them or replace them with new proposals consistent with the case-law of the Court.
The Committee on Legal Affairs will continue to see that community law and the prerogatives of Parliament are respected.
Very precise guidelines will be laid down in an own-initiative report, for which we have already asked for authorisation in advance, and with which the Committee on Justice will concern itself.
Â Â  Mr President, on 13Â September 2005, the so-called European Court of Justice made a ruling that gave the European Commission the right to impose criminal sanctions on the citizens of Member States.
For the first time since King Henry VIII ended the jurisdiction of the Pope in ecclesiastical matters in England, a power other than the British Parliament will have the right to create laws and set the penalties for transgression.
The European Court of Justice is not a court of justice, it is an engine of political integration for the European Union.
This particular ruling applied only to environmental law, but it has left the way wide open for the Commission to apply it to other areas.
The Commission has ruthlessly exploited the decision of the court in order to publish a list of nine new areas of competence, which gives it the right to create new laws and impose criminal penalties.
It has also stated its intention to extend its power to create further criminal offences.
When this case first went to the court, 11 of the then 15Â Member States opposed it; the court ignored them.
A Commission lawyer has stated that it could compel the British Government â and the British Parliament â to punish its citizens for something that was not a criminal offence in Britain.
If a British government were to refuse to implement these criminal offences, then it could be taken to the European Court of Justice, which would compel it to do so.
The court would then act as judge and jury in its own case.
So much for the separation of powers of the executive, legislative and judiciary that has protected English freedoms for centuries!
The decision by the so-called European Court of Justice is nothing less than a judicial .
The Court has seized power from the Member States and handed it to the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, that was an interesting contribution from Mr Batten.
Speaking as a lawyer and a former Justice Minister in the United Kingdom, I have questions to ask Mr Frattini, and I will do so in an unemotional way, because I think this is a very interesting debate.
The competences of the European Court of Justice are undoubtedly a matter of considerable interest.
I am interested in them, because as we develop areas in which the Court of Justice will have competence, we have to look at it in the relationship that it bears to the courts of the nation states in Europe and the competences that they carry in particular areas as well.
This is the first opportunity we have had to debate this important ruling and I accept that the Commission naturally has an obligation as guardian of the Treaties to consider carefully the implications of the judgment.
I certainly believe in Member State competence and prerogatives when it comes to the general area of criminal law.
I am sure that is a view shared by most of the Member States.
There is an issue regarding the European Court of Justice approach to jurisprudence, and by and large I think it is fair to say that we would not favour judge-made law, which can in certain circumstances be anti-democratic.
I do not think it should be a pretext either for the Commission and Parliament to seek to carry out an extension of powers which conflict with Member Statesâ rights.
However, it is important, particularly as we know that the European Court of Justice does have a clear competence in many areas, that the parameters of the competences of that court are clearly defined.
It is important that it is spelled out very clearly to us how those competences will operate when set alongside those of national courts.
I have always been fascinated by the work of the European Court of Justice.
I was in Washington recently when Justice Roberts was going through his grilling to become the Chief Justice.
It was interesting to note that most of his was based upon the American Constitution, his interpretation of it and his delivery of decisions based upon it.
A limited area, you might think, but indeed the areas flowing from it were very extensive indeed.
I was deeply impressed by the way that the incoming Chief Justice dealt with those competences and his relationship with the United States Constitution.
That is why I think it is now time for us to hear of the ambitions and interests of the European Court of Justice, how it defines its role for the future and how it does so with a minimum of inconvenience and conflict with the nation-state courts themselves.
I will be very interested to hear what Mr Frattini would like to say on that particular point in his summing-up.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, from the speeches I have heard I deduce that this subject cannot be exhausted in the short interval of time set aside for this eveningâs debate.
It is a subject of considerable importance for Europeâs space of legal competence and these latest observations on the relations between the European Court of Justice and the national courts also require careful consideration, which I will not fail to give them.
As is obvious, criminal law is intended to punish the unlawful conduct of individuals and, if the matter falls under Community competence, it seems frankly unlikely that Parliament â the institution representing democracy â should not participate in the creation of criminal law.
That would mean that, if Parliament were excluded, only two of the European Community institutions â the Council and the Commission â would be participating in the decision-making process in matters of Community competence.
That is a key justification for the ruling of the Court of Justice, as well as a principle which, naturally, we shall investigate thoroughly.
How, then, can an incorrect legal basis be transformed into a correct legal basis?
There are three methods that may be considered.
As has already been stated in several of your speeches â such as that of MrÂ Gargani â if it is necessary to change the substance of the measure, this is done by withdrawing the measure itself â for example, a framework decision â and replacing it with a proposal for a new directive, either on the legal basis, or on the substance, and thus applying the codecision procedure.
It might, however, be possible â and I do not know if any cases of this sort exist â that a framework decision has a legal basis which proves to be irrelevant, whilst its content, on the other hand, is accepted.
In such a case â if Parliament and the Council agree on the need to change only the legal basis, whilst upholding the content â I myself can see a second method, which consists not in withdrawing the proposal and replacing it with a new initiative, but rather in an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Council, through which, quickly and inexpensively, it may be agreed to alter the legal basis and uphold the substance.
This is a hypothesis for which it would be very interesting to hear the evaluation of the Parliamentâs Committee on Justice.
Finally there is a third way, which we have already applied a few days ago, and for which we await the decision of the Court: the appeal that is before the Court of Justice, contesting a framework decision containing an incorrect legal basis.
In conclusion, MrÂ President, I wish to make it clear that the Commission will only ever exercise these competences if it proves necessary.
Criminal law is, I stress, a serious instrument of the legal system, which is why criminal legislation â which, as the founding fathers of law teach us, is the final remedy against the offences of individuals â must only be applied when it proves absolutely necessary.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on applying the EC competition rules to maritime transport (2005/2033(INI)) (A6-0314/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission has been reviewing Council Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86 applying EU competition rules to liner shipping for the past three years.
After extensive consultation with carriers, transport users, Member States and third countries, we believe that the ability that shipping lines have to fix prices and regulate capacity is no longer justified in todayâs market circumstances.
The current exemption is unique.
No other economic sector â even those that directly compete with liners â benefits from such a generous exemption.
Collective price-fixing and capacity regulation are by definition hard-core restrictions to competition.
These types of restriction have as their goal the artificial maintenance of high prices.
Participants in such a cartel may benefit. Their customers most certainly do not.
And nor does the wider economy. The present system can only be explained in an historic context.
Price-fixing by liner conferences actually results in higher prices for exporters.
EU shipping lines are faring well.
Four out of the top five world carriers are EU based.
Yet our exporters repeatedly draw our attention to the need to stop allowing price-fixing.
As regulators, our duty is to ensure that the rules are in tune with market conditions.
The exemption from competition rules for liner conferences is a relic of the past.
The last twenty years have seen considerable changes in the liner market, with an increase in cooperative arrangements between shipping lines in the form of consortia and global alliances that do not include price-fixing.
This goes to show that conferences are not central to the continued good health of the maritime industry.
The sector is important for the health of the economy as a whole.
Scheduled services in container transport account for approximately 40% of the EU-25âs external trade by sea in value terms.
Today, conferences are allowed to fix prices on all major shipping routes and these prices are generally assumed to act as a benchmark for prices on all shipping routes to and from the EU.
In addition to the benchmark effect of the conference tariff, an average of 30% of the price of transport is made up of charges and surcharges jointly fixed by lines participating in conferences and the same levels of charges are very often applied by non-conference carriers.
This means that 18% of imports and 21% of EU-25 exports are affected by carriersâ ability to jointly fix prices in the liner conference block exemption.
These figures show how important it is to unleash further competitive forces in the liner sector, much in line with the Lisbon Agenda and in keeping with the goal to transform Europe into the most competitive economy.
I welcome the work carried out by Parliament in reacting to the Commissionâs White Paper of October 2004.
I welcome in particular Parliamentâs recognition that the rules for the sector must comply with Article 81.
I am aware of the concern in certain quarters about the consequences of abolishing the conference block exemption.
What does abolition of conferences mean?
It means reliance on market mechanisms to determine price and capacity as in all other sectors of the economy.
We have carried out an extensive economic impact assessment: three independent studies were commissioned.
The results show that if shipping lines are no longer allowed to operate as a cartel, that is likely to result in lower transport costs to the benefit of exports throughout the EU and with a positive impact on developing countries.
Service quality and innovation are likely to be improved.
A more competitive environment should allow EU carriers to compete and grow.
Smaller carriers will also have an opportunity to grow if they follow an innovative business model.
No impact is foreseen on employment or in investment in new vessels.
Both carriers and shippers recognised that the most recent study by Global Insight was of a high standard and that its results were based on thorough research.
We have the solid backing of the European Shippersâ Council representing more than 100Â 000 European exports from the smallest to multinationals.
We have the support of UNICE.
The liner industry itself is more divided.
This is only to be expected as the industry has been insulated from competition and benefited from a legalised cartel.
But even so, much of the industry now accepts that the future must be based on competition and that the days of special regimes are counted.
In any event, as regulators we have to look at the larger picture.
Our concern is the competitiveness of EU industry.
This includes shipping lines as well as their clients, our exporters.
If we look at the majority of shipping lines, price-fixing is becoming less and less relevant to their business strategies as they seek more effective ways of ensuring their survival in a changing and challenging environment.
I would also like to assure Parliament that the Commission pays great attention to the international implications of any regulation that touches the shipping industry.
We are aware that liner conferences are tolerated in other jurisdictions and have engaged in bilateral contacts so as to ensure that our partners are aware of whatever changes are brought to our legislation.
Although the Commission is firmly convinced of the benefits of putting an end to the conference system, it is equally convinced of the need to give the industry sufficient time to adapt to a fully competitive market.
I intend to put a proposal to the College of Commissioners for the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86, including a substantial transition period before the conference system is abolished.
To conclude, the Commission is committed to better regulation and to the Lisbon Agenda.
I believe that abolishing the conference system will make the application of competition rules to the maritime sector simpler, more cost effective and fairer.
Abolition of the conference system will bring significant opportunities.
I am confident that both the liner industry and its clients will reap the benefits.
Â Â  . â Mr President, allow me to start by warmly thanking my honourable friends in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, whose comments and amendments enriched the report and the motion for a resolution on the review of the competition rules applied to maritime transport.
I also wanted to thank the European Commission for its willingness to cooperate throughout the procedure.
I particularly welcome the initiative to draft the White Paper.
It gives us the opportunity to evaluate the current situation and to study the real challenges to European shipping in relation to the competitiveness of the European Union and the Lisbon objectives.
That is why the report which I am presenting to you takes account of the proposals in this White Paper and of the demands of the White Paper for transport and the trends emerging in the international environment.
The bone of contention on which my honourable friends focused their attention was scheduled services between ports in different Member States or between the European Union and third countries, especially the conference system.
I shall not comment specifically on this, because the Commissioner set the conference framework.
Over all these years the conferences have safeguarded efficient services and price stability on the market, contributing to the development of European and international trade, to the good health â to use the Commissioner's expression â of the maritime industry, providing the opportunity â and this is important to us â for all sizes of shipping companies to participate.
Today, it is right that we should look at the adjustment of the system to new circumstances by revising Regulation 4056/86, a review that will allow flexibility, price competitiveness, stability and quality services and will allow real competition, in that, in one way, it will be protected from the dominion of the oligopolies.
There are clear tendencies to merge to create colossal companies which can impose their terms and conditions on trade and industry.
The top three European companies account for 35% of the world fleet, while at the same time new maritime powers have emerged, such as China, South Korea and Taiwan.
None of the studies presented by the European Commission convinces us that these fears are unfounded, nor have they convinced us of the important benefits which trade and industry might reap from the abolition of the regulation.
My proposal is that the European Commission should not propose the abolition of the regulation and should continue the dialogue with the interested parties, both carriers and shippers.
It should propose a review of the existing system, mainly by excluding the facility for freight rates to be fixed directly at the conferences, but allowing indicative prices to be set on the basis of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and calculating additional loading and despatch charges transparently and following dialogue with shippers.
We also propose, irrespective of the solution selected, that provision should be made for a transitional period which will allow all the factors to be adjusted.
To close, I wish to call on the European Commission to take account, when processing its proposal, of the legal and operational systems which apply in other countries, such as the United States of America, Australia, Canada and Japan, because a deviation in the European system could create destabilising trends at global level and bring about protectionist action.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, that was a terrific speech you gave us, but I am not sure that you have spoken to all the interested parties in the relevant business circles.
What you have said may well be true of firms like Maersk, the little outfit that has just bought up PNO, but what primarily interests me, and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou too, is what happens to the small and medium-sized shipping lines whose situation is quite different from that of PNO, and have not been bought up by Maersk or by any of the other big players whom you might care to name.
It is our belief that Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 cannot be deleted without being replaced.
Yes, of course, Commissioner, it must be adapted; that much is perfectly clear, and we all know it.
It has to be adapted, and the principal object of the exercise must be to do so in such a way that the small and medium-sized companies are enabled to reach agreements on technical matters and to exchange information in order to be able to see where they stand the best chance of succeeding on the world market.
That, Commissioner, is something to which you have paid no attention.
A group calling itself the âEuropean Liner Affairs Associationâ has come up with some good proposals, which contain not only a markedly more limited exemption, but also unambiguous rules to protect small and medium-sized enterprises.
There is actually a proposal for the opening of discussion forums with participation not only by shipping lines but also by shippers and the other stakeholders in the sector.
We do not want price-fixing any more than we want hostile cartels, and you must never suggest that my colleague Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou does!
What we want is technical agreements that make it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises to survive in shark-filled waters, that is to say, alongside the big conglomerates and alliances.
If such discussion forums are facilitated, there really is a chance of our managing to keep the small and medium-sized shipping industry afloat.
It simply has to be clear to us that, even though our big players dominate business worldwide, we do also have good reason to fear attacks by the Koreans and the Chinese shipping lines.
This, Commissioner, is where we have to do something for European shipping!
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Kratsa, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will be voting on the contents of the White Paper.
The Commission will be presenting its legislative proposal next Wednesday.
Is it already ready?
We can only hope that the echoes of our debates will reach the Commission nevertheless.
It would be a pity if they did not, because the report we have before us, late as the hour sadly is, is of a high standard.
I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa for the quality of her report and for her courtesy.
No one here disputes that healthy competition needs to be introduced into maritime transport, where most of the players are private operators.
Do we need to go so far as total deregulation, however?
That would be to overlook the changes that have taken place in the last few years and to deny the benefits of the present system.
As a result of the Court of Justiceâs and the Commissionâs decisions, maritime conferences have in fact ceased to be cartels.
They play a useful role, ensuring the stability and quality of the service and strengthening maritime safety through the regular renewal of fleets.
They also guarantee the diversity of operators.
Having said that, the present system can still be improved.
The exchange of information could be rationalised.
There is also a need for clear rules for calculating excess loads.
On the other hand, it seems to us dangerous to repeal Regulation 4056/86 without proposing even a provisional replacement.
Simply abolishing the present system would accelerate concentration in the sector.
Reducing the number of operators could have a negative effect on services to some ports and on prices.
We understand review to mean âimprovementâ not ârepealâ.
That is the message that Parliament should be sending to the European Commission and the Council with this report.
We hope it will be heard.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rapporteur has managed to secure a majority for her report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Despite it being a majority, it is striking how many Members abstained from the vote; 20 voted in favour, 7 against and there were no fewer than 19 abstentions.
Needless to say, I was, despite the outcome, very disappointed about that.
I would therefore beg to differ with the previous speakers.
Article 81 of the Treaty stipulates that cooperatives that distort the market are not compatible with Community law.
Paragraph 3 of the same article formulates, however, a number of exceptions which must be met in order to allow those cooperatives to go ahead after all.
On that basis, a block exemption shall apply to the liner trade under Regulation 4056/1986.
The Commission has launched an inquiry into the question to what extent this block exemption is still admitted in 2005.
Are the conditions of Article 81 (3) still being met?
The Commission has reached the conclusion that that is not the case and would thus like to review the rules.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission in this, and our Amendment 10, among others, is evidence of this.
In paragraph 9, the rapporteur flags that the four cumulative conditions of Article 81(3) are only partly being met.
At the same time, the rapporteur calls for the enforcement of a cooperative.
This raises some question marks, to put it mildly.
After all, if the conditions are only partly being met, we can quite clearly state that they are not being met, because the four conditions are really cumulative in nature.
The members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament were concerned about the impact a possible review may have on the shipping companies of the SME sector.
What businesses are we talking about then?
The likes of Pino Nedlloyd, Hapag Lloyd, APL, MYK?
To include these businesses under the heading of SMEs is, to my mind, going too far.
Nevertheless, the Commission has taken this on board and commissioned a study, among other things, to clarify the impact on the so-called smaller businesses.
This study has now been published and what is the conclusion?
The repeal of the regulation leads to lower transport prices and better service, and smaller shipping companies have not experienced any drawbacks.
This stands to reason, for the SME sector is mainly on the side of the consumers and shippers.
However, if Amendment 17 is anything to go by, both the Group of the European Peopleâs Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament remain unconvinced.
I would like to call on my fellow Member to have another careful look at paragraph 1.
According to the text before us, the objective of the review is to maintain and extend the European line trade sector in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
This strikes me as a misconception.
The objective of this review, as indeed that of the Lisbon Strategy, is to create a competitive climate in which the sector can operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.
It has never been the intention to protect the sector on the basis of improper arguments.
Finally, I should like to ask my fellow Members to have another closer look at the amendments â namely Amendment 1 to 14 â that I have tabled together with the Group of the Greens; I probably did this against my better judgment, but I did it all the same.
In this respect, the Commission does deserve more support than it is currently getting.
Finally, unlike the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner McCreevyâs conclusions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports a more consistent application of the EUâs competition rules.
Within maritime transport, the situation is characterised by a few large companies making a packet, precisely because there are price agreements in this area.
There is no free competition.
This is a peculiar feature of the EU system, and a regrettable one when it comes to maritime transport, which could become a good alternative to air and road transport if prices were fairer.
If prices are to be regulated at all, it must be in order to take due account of the environment or of employees.
It is not with that kind of price regulation that we are concerned in this case.
What we have here are some of the richest people in the EU, including Greek and Danish ship owners.
It is they who take the lionâs share because of a lack of competition and excessively high prices.
That they are doing this is obvious, and we can also see who is involved.
The Verts/ALE Group supports the Commission or, to be more precise, that part of the Commission that is present in this Chamber, against the Transport DG, and we very much hope that the most important amendments will go through.
If Amendments 3 and 12 are adopted, the Verts/ALE Group will be able to support the report.
Otherwise, we shall, emphatically, not be able to.
Â Â  . â Mr President, shipping conferences were created as a form of union for better cooperation between liner companies in a bid to control the profitable sector of maritime transport.
Today, the same monopoly business groups are calling for a change to Regulation 4056/86 and the European Commission also agrees with this approach, repeating the same argument, namely that these changes are necessary in order to provide users with cheaper services.
However, life itself has shown us that the major monopoly business groups which participate in maritime transport have emerged as the winners and the workers have emerged as the losers from this entire procedure.
Today, things have changed.
Companies are merging or buying each other out.
Behemoths are being created which impose their terms; in other words, we have a monopoly situation.
Today mergers and concentrations of capital in this specific sector have progressed to the point at which, essentially, a few companies â which you can count on the fingers of one hand â control scheduled transport.
Typical examples are a European-owned shipping company which operates 550 ships and an Asian-owned company which operates 112 ships.
To talk of competition under such circumstances is pure hypocrisy.
For cabotage, despite the fact that Regulation 4056/86 has been overtaken by Regulation 3577/92, we do not agree that domestic transport should be integrated into competition rules because, to judge from experience in my country, with its island configuration, the repercussions are dangerous, both for seamen and for island residents.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Parliamentâs work on theÂ Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report on the application of EC competition rules to maritime transport, and the Houseâs vote on this report tomorrow, are intended to act as a catalyst for work on regulations to promote healthy and fair competition in the maritime sector.
This sector was excluded from certain provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community by means of a Council Regulation.
In particular, the sector was excluded from ArticleÂ 81, which prohibits the conclusion of competition-limiting agreements, and from ArticleÂ 82, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.
I would note that our work and deliberations on this report, which focuses on Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86, are concerned with issues that have been dealt with in a separate legal opinion drafted in NovemberÂ 2005 at the request of the European Commission.
As I see it, therefore, it would be reasonable to examine the conclusions of this new analysis in some detail before taking any further decisions.
We should exercise great caution in taking any subsequent steps, and avoid any premature or rash decisions.
Such caution is all the more warrantedÂ given that any changes we make might fail to comply with the standards of the European Unionâs partners, or in other words the USA, Australia, Japan and Canada.
This would pose a threat to the stability of economic relations.
I should also like to alert Members to another important point, namely that any changes in this sector could have an adverse impact, especially on small and medium-sized shipping lines.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who consider it useful to review, but not abolish, Council Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86, whilst hoping that the aim of this revision will be to guarantee efficiency of services, adequate time frames, precise deadlines and freight rates in line with administration costs.
As has already been said, the exemption for liner conferences has traditionally given balance to the maritime sector, but it is also true that the decline in conferences has been made obvious by the figures on individual shipments â the 1994 law â and by the appearance of effective and independent major carriers.
In general nowadays, freight rates decrease when demand falls and increase when supply is limited, and it is well-known that conference agreements do not seem to have made it possible to impose coordinated increases on shipments affected by a decrease in demand.
The proposal to abolish the prior fixing of freight rates â which is the principal effect of conferences â is sensible and therefore to be welcomed.
It is necessary, however, to be vigilant and to check that, when all is said and done, this does not mean that ports of call are cut out or are selected exclusively on the basis of shipownersâ interests, and that it does not bring about an artificial decrease in freight rates.
This is already happening in consolidated trading practices: we know that Chinese exporters are arriving in Europe with negative quotations for their goods but are making up the GAP differential through the payment of exorbitant selling rights on handover which are then transferred back to the same Chinese exporter.
It is necessary, therefore, to pay very close attention and to monitor any aspects of artful liberalisation practices â as they could become â if our mutual aim is to have a competitive European merchant shipping sector along the lines drawn by Lisbon.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened with interest to the debate.
It is clear that the introduction of competition in the liner shipping sector constitutes a major change.
Such a change is positive not only for shippers, the consumers of liner shipping services, but also for the liner shipping industry itself.
I am committed to finding a balanced solution, one which furthers the interests of both shippers and carriers.
I believe that the way forward is to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86, which would lead to lower prices and would not negatively affect carriers.
It will be important to continue discussions with the liner industry.
This should ensure that the few positive effects of the conference system are retained.
This means the exchange of information between carriers, but not such as to allow collusion.
On this basis, I believe we can find a fair and reasonable way forward to the benefit of liner carriers and of the EU economy as a whole, and one which all participants in the market can support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Toia, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on European Electronic Communications Regulation and Markets 2004 (2005/2052(INI)) (A6-0305/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are about to have this evening takes its context from the next review of the regulatory framework.
It is therefore necessary to ask if this framework has worked, if and how it has been applied, if it has been in a position to promote a genuinely open, competitive and transparent market for all operators and if it has been able, at the same time, to promote the necessary investment.
Given that we need to provide for an updating of the regulatory framework, we have to ask along what lines this should happen.
In other words, we need to ask if we should give greater freedom to operators â as certain people wish, especially for the new markets â or instead maintain the regulated services.
These are the questions we must do our best to answer when we set about reviewing the regulatory framework.
Following on from the debate in committee, I would like to highlight certain priorities myself.
First of all, this sector is a driving force behind the development of the European economy, both according to Lisbon and because telecommunications are the cornerstone of any economy based on knowledge, innovation and research.
Telecommunications technologies act as a stimulus for productive innovation and a catalyst for the productivity of labour.
We need, therefore, to focus upon this strategic, high-investment sector â given that it requires infrastructure, research and constant innovation â and create a market for it that is open to new operators, with the widest possible choice for consumers and with the principle of access to networks as a key feature.
At the same time, however, we must avoid penalising operators that are already securely entrenched in the market, and we must effectively compete with the giants of the markets outside Europe.
This is a market characterised by constantly evolving technologies â I refer to broadband, third-generation telephones, voice, image and data convergence, and the new market of voice over Internet protocol services â and these innovations need to be sustained and encouraged.
Having said all this, I turn to how this is being applied in practice.
The Commission report describes a situation that varies greatly from country to country, and that constitutes a weak point in a market that is truly integrated at a European level.
The directives are poorly applied everywhere, and, where they are, the bodies needed for them â the National Regulatory Authorities â have not always even been established.
We must be aware therefore that there is still a great deal to be done as regards implementing the current regulatory framework before we change it.
This is an important point, MrÂ President, because it is impossible to implement this legislation, which requires flexibility and often intervention to prevent dominant positions in the market, without the system as a whole working.
It is difficult to bring in legislation if all the operators have not done their part beforehand in intervening at an institutional level to guarantee market transparency.
In our report, after the consideration of Parliament, we suggest various points: first of all it is necessary â and I say this strongly to the Commission â to open a debate on the whole institutional set-up.
It is necessary to strengthen the role of the Commission, to clarify and precisely define the role of the European regulators and to ask the Member States, whilst also involving Parliament, to guarantee the establishment of authorities that are genuinely independent and authoritative, as well as capable and in a position to work in a tireless and entirely transparent way, which is essential.
I propose, moreover, a task for the Commission: why not create, through the new regulatory framework, a European regulatory authority?
Beyond this clearer definition of the various institutions and their competences and duties, we need the involvement of Parliament.
We ask the Commission to draw up, at regular intervals, a report that provides, for the Commission as well, the clearest possible analysis of all the operatorsâ billing parameters as well as contract guarantees and price trends, in order to keep Parliament informed and provide it with a more front-line role.
We wish for greater opening up of the operator sector: whilst we welcome the increase in unbundled local loops, we think more should be done to allow further opening up and the entry of new operators.
We have seen that investment comes from established operators but some also comes from new operators.
I conclude with the central importance of the user and the consumer.
The question of roaming is crucial: we appreciate what the Commission and the European Regulators Group are doing but we ask for something more, which appears in our document to the Commission specifically on roaming.
Finally, reducing the digital divide also means increasing the number of users, including among Europeâs elderly and disabled.
I finish by welcoming the voluntary codes to protect usersÂ ...
Â Â  . Mr President, let me first express my very warm thanks to the European Parliament and to Mrs Toia in particular for this excellent report.
It is very encouraging to see that Parliament shares the Commissionâs policy priorities and concerns as regards implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications.
This support is important, especially when we have to make difficult or unpleasant decisions with regard to Member States.
You know that the electronic communications sector is a major driver for a knowledge-based society and economy.
Our regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2003, establishes conditions for competition, investment, growth and jobs, while guaranteeing basic consumer rights.
Our objective has been and will continue to be a single market with choice, quality and low prices for all European businesses and consumers.
The rapporteur is right, we are taking responsibility for ensuring that Member States implement the framework correctly.
The fact is that they do not always do this.
We maintain a constant dialogue with the European Regulators Group and the national regulatory authorities, in the context of the monitoring of this market.
When instances of non-conformity or incorrect implementation arise, we launch infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned.
Although some objectives have not yet fully been achieved, I can assure you that progress has been made since last year and this will certainly be reflected in the 11th implementation report which we are currently preparing.
I would now like to answer the specific requests made by the European Parliament.
The Commission shares your views about the importance of adequate frequency allocation and the need for sufficient flexibility in that respect.
We also fully share the Parliamentâs concerns on data retention, which is why the Commission has made a balanced first-pillar codecision proposal.
In the same way, broadband access and ways to reduce the digital divide are key priorities and will remain so under the i-2010 action plan.
You will know also that roaming charges are an issue to which the Commission has paid great attention.
In relation to the issue of transparency for consumers, we have set up a website with information on roaming prices in the Member States.
I can inform you that since this website came online a lot of Europeans have used it and prices are falling.
I take note of the concerns expressed in the report on the role of the ERG.
The ERG is an advisory body and a good forum for national regulators to exchange views and experiences.
I also take note of the request for the Commission to carry out regular studies on the transparency of invoicing, contract guarantees and trends in the market and prices.
This information is already available and specific studies are unnecessary, but I can assure you that if problems are identified, they are included in the annual implementation reports.
I would like to assure Parliament that the Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that measures relating to national markets do not jeopardise the completion of the single market in electronic communications.
We will continue to monitor Member Statesâ activities relating to the regulatory framework, and will submit an annual implementation report, which will be adopted by the Commission in February 2006.
A few words about the future.
The report makes reference to the need to open an institutional debate.
That debate has already started, and will go on until the first half of 2006.
In the summer, the Commission will publish a communication with the conclusions of the debate and will make concrete proposals by the end of 2006.
The European Parliament will of course be fully involved in this process.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Toia for her report.
Electronic communications play a key role in developing the European knowledge-based economy, fostering innovation and creating value for customers.
When fully implemented, the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications will enable innovative services with competitive prices to develop on a level playing field throughout the internal market.
I would like to support the Commission in monitoring and enforcing the implementation process of the EU regulatory framework in the Member States.
Currently, the establishment of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications has been a success story of the internal market, the field being one that has proven to be most beneficial for clients.
This success has been demonstrated by a decrease in prices and an increase in services in the electronic communications field.
However, the regulatory framework has also encountered problems, owing to its slow implementation in many Member States.
On the one hand, these problems are reflected in numerous ongoing infringement procedures that the Commission has initiated against Member States who fail to transpose parts of the framework.
On the other hand, some Member Statesâ national regulatory authorities might even have done too much.
Efficient operators and efficient markets should not be penalised.
In some Member States over-regulation has led to draconian competition where no operator generates any revenues.
Regulation should be there to please the customers, not only the competitors.
The Commission should continue efficient monitoring of the implementation of the whole electronic communications framework and it should be completed within the shortest time possible.
Once fully implemented, it is also very important that the monitoring task be shifted from the national regulatory authorities to the competition authorities.
In this respect, we should put more trust in competition law.
I urge the Commission to lower exorbitant international roaming charges â such as the ones the Commissioner has already mentioned â and to further increase customer visibility in international pricing on the website.
I heard that the website is updated only once every six months.
That is not regularly enough.
Lastly, I wish to point out that functioning mobile number portability system is vital to healthy competition and there should be no rates â or at least low rates â on carrying your number in every Member State.
The deadline for realising the number portability operation should be shortened in those Member States where it is still a serious problem.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the 10th report on the regulation of the electronic communications markets is a very important document for the sector because it provides an objective and in-depth analysis of market trends, both with regard to technological and economic developments in the sector and with regard to measures aimed at promoting competition.
I wish to extend my sincere thanks for the excellent work done by MrsÂ Toia, with whom I agree that the information and communications technology sector is enormously relevant both for the Community economy and for individual countries, given the notable contribution it makes to employment growth and the development of new technologies to improve and speed up communications.
European legislation is required to regulate the relationship between producer and user and to guarantee that digital technology is available to all, that governments invest more in infrastructure and, above all, that free and fair competition is maintained, thus ensuring better quality services at more and more favourable prices.
The report addresses five thematic areas.
First: the improvement of international roaming services, with a reduction in tariffs and greater transparency in billing and the drawing up of contracts.
Second: the establishment of a clear framework to regulate the institutional relationship between the European Commission and the European Regulators Group, to increase the responsibility and involvement of national authorities â thereby restoring competitiveness â and to provide greater incentives for investment, especially in the new emerging markets.
Third: an increase in the number of power lines so that broadband connection is available to all, without territorial limits and in the shortest time possible.
Fourth: the protection of user health, as argued by the rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who fully supports the rapporteur, MrsÂ Toia, hoping that the European Parliament will accept the recommendations in her report.
Finally I wish to congratulate MrÂ Reading on the work he is and will be doing in his report on research, which has the full support of the PPE-DE.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I want to congratulate Mrs Toia on the quality of her report and to thank her for working with the shadow rapporteurs and accepting our proposed amendments.
I would like to mention some essential points.
We need to encourage the creation of a single market in telecommunications covering the entire European territory.
Such a single market is necessary in order to reduce the digital divide, which is a priority aim for the European Union.
However, this transition to a new framework for the regulation and supply of electronic communications must respect the public and consumers by bringing the transparency and security necessary for the proper use of telecommunications.
This means transparency on questions of safety and public health, especially radiation measurement; it also means a correctly regulated market, which is the only way to guarantee fair service and pricing conditions.
This concerns international roaming in particular.
It is essential that we draw up an action plan, with a timetable, so that consumers can enjoy continuity of service, which means the potential for international roaming throughout European territory, at the best price and at the earliest opportunity.
On 7 December, the single Internet address .eu will be launched for businesses.
Just as the Commission is giving concrete expression to this long awaited decision, it should also act to bring in a single dialling code with a single tariff for the European Union as a whole.
That must be a priority of the action plan, the importance and significance of which I have just pointed out, strengthening a telecommunications area appropriate to the free movement of persons and of personal communications.
Â Â  â âThe world is better with you!â â announces the slogan of one of the large European mobile telephone service providers in Hungary.
But has the world actually become better in 2004, in the period reviewed by the report, and will it be better in the future as a result of the development of electronic communications?
Whatever the case, we can say that the information/communication sector boosts the development of European economy and facilitates the creation of jobs.
It is also obvious that the expansion of new technologies â primarily that of mobile broadband â facilitates the integration of social groups inaccessible by traditional means into the information society.
Therefore these are indisputable advantages.
However, we must also ask the question: at what price?
The answer is nowhere near as favourable as the effects mentioned above.
Complicated pricing models, strange fee constructions, a practice that oversteps the single market principle â roaming charges are only one example.
This is the current price of the advantages listed, of the better world.
I am not saying that this is an unaffordable price, as all of us, European consumers, are paying it month by month.
However, one of the most important objectives of our Parliament is to change the current situation, which is also our duty in the spirit of consumer protection.
Most importantly, we need transparency, and unambiguous and clear information for consumers.
We need true competition and a full implementation of the principle of the single and common market.
And last but not least, we need lower prices that reflect the true value of services.
Only when these objectives are attained will consumer protection be given the importance it deserves alongside economic considerations, and if this happens, then this report was worth preparing.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The fact is this current electronic communications regulation does not really work.
I say that as rapporteur for the report on Parliamentâs framework directive.
The consequence is that the internal market for electronic communications is not developing, the necessary competition is not evolving everywhere and consumers are not being offered the range of services they need, services for which there should be fierce competition.
The services are therefore not cheap enough.
There are many examples of this.
This also puts different Member States in different positions: where there is tough competition money goes on advertising.
If there is no competition money can be used on product development and the company concerned has a better chance for development than the one which has to compete fiercely.
Businesses are therefore in unequal positions among the Member States.
Another basic reason for this is that the Member States are not applying this legislation and that is definitely a problem.
The position of the regulatory authorities varies greatly from one country to another and the status they enjoy should be made more even among different countries.
How can we imagine, then, achieving the Lisbon objective in such a situation?
We need to make a great effort, together with the Commission, to persuade the Member States that it is to their benefit to apply this legislation.
As regards the new legislation, it has to be neutral with regard to technology.
It would be better if it were framework rather than detailed legislation, and it should guarantee a competitive environment and a secure service for consumers.
Obviously, again, roaming costs should be reduced.
We share the same concerns as the Commission, so can we not also move forward together?
Â Â  Mr President, I simply want to say briefly that I agree with most of the analyses that the honourable Members have made.
It is true that the regulatory framework is being applied very unevenly.
Competition, too, is operating according to very different national systems that are often inadequate.
That is why the Commission has to bring Member States before the Court of Justice when the rules are not enforced.
There are a number of cases pending before the Court of Justice, as you know; you also know that I am in constant touch with the national regulators, who meet in the European Regulators Group.
That exchange of views is extremely important because it is in a way an exchange of good practice and also an opportunity to bring pressure to bear on each other.
Moreover, the regulators are helping me over the prices of roaming, which are very high.
I have to make clear to you that the Commission is unable to impose prices itself, but it can push for a downward revision of prices.
That is what we have done with the setting up of an Internet site for comparing prices in our Member States and since that site has been up it has been visited by thousands of consumers every day.
Since it has been up, too, we have noticed many prices falling in many countries.
As promised, there will be a price review within six months to see what the trend is and where talks with national regulators are up to in the matter.
I told the honourable Members that talks about the present regulatory framework and its possible reform had begun.
Those talks are going to take a few more months yet.
The very important report before us today is Parliamentâs first contribution.
I am looking forward to other debates, other proposals from Parliament as from the main interested parties, and starting in the spring I shall be making a summary of those analyses, suggestions and proposals so that we can then go on to discuss a possible reform of the regulatory framework, adapting it to developing technologies and fine tuning it to the very different situations in the various Member States.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports;
â A6-0323/2005 by Mr Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax, with regard to the length of time during which the minimum standard rate is to be applied (COM(2005)0136 â C6-0113/2005 â 2005/0051(CNS)),
â A6-0324/2005 by Mr Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 77/388/EEC, to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country but established in another Member State (COM(2004)0728 â C6-0251/2005 â 2005/0807(CNS)) and
â the oral question to the Commission by MrsÂ BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the expiry of Directive 1999/85/EC as regards the possibility of applying on an experimental basis a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services (O-0106/2005 â B6-0342/2005).
Â Â  . We are debating two issues, and I shall start with the minimum standard VAT rate.
We are debating an issue of extreme legal and political sensitivity.
According to the Commissionâs report, an extension of the current temporary regime based on the Sixth VAT Directive â which expires on 31 December 2005 â would be justified.
What I mean is that we could set the minimum standard rate only, at the current level of 15%, and extend this regime, still with a temporary effect, to 2010.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our Parliament has debated this proposal, and basically agrees with the approach of the Commission.
Accordingly, we too agree with the proposal and with its time frame, namely with the extension to 2010.
We also accepted the necessity of having to debate this issue with extraordinary speed, before the last ECOFIN session on 6 December, to enable the Council to have the opinion of Parliament and make a decision in view of it.
Based on the debate of the Committee, we amend the original proposal tabled by the Committee in respect of one issue, namely that apart from the minimum standard we would also like to set the maximum rate at 25%, which would be the highest rate currently used in Member States; this would avoid any of the Member States having to resort to legislation amendments or budget course corrections in the very short term.
However, by adopting this course of action, the majority of our Parliament indicates that we believe in the necessity of preventing divergence of standard VAT rates.
However, our Parliament has also adopted another significant position on this issue, which does not affect the current prompt decision of prolongation, but it is important to us.
We would actually like to avoid a situation similar to the current one, where we are pressed for time both in respect of the extension of the minimum standard VAT rate and the intensive employment regime expiring at the end of the year, which has been implemented with the involvement of several Member States who have all gained valuable positive experience in the process.
Therefore we ask the Commission to prepare a study by the beginning of 2007, to enable Parliament to start a debate in 2007-2008 in good time, without any rush, concerning the direction and depth of the VAT policy to be implemented by Member States, and the European Union regulation required in this respect.
In our request proposal prepared with the participation of all parliamentary factions, we ask the Commission to evaluate the current standard implicit â that is, converted to one rate â VAT level differentials and their budgetary implications, particularly in respect of the differentiations seen in Member States joining the EU during the last enlargement, which are unable to apply the individual reduced rates, and can only effect transition to the special areas not included in the Sixth VAT Directive (that is, not included in Annex K or Annex H) until 2007.
Based on the material to be prepared by the Commission, we will be able to define our parliamentary position on the issue of VAT charged at source or charged to the consumer, and then examine whether or not, in the spirit of subsidiarity, we need to set a minimum and a maximum rate at Community level, and if the answer is yes, whether we should use the normal standard or implicit â that is, the actual converted â rate for these VAT rates.
Another further issue to be debated by Parliament in the following years in light of the efficiency of the Stability and Growth Pact is the extent of freedom to be granted to Member States for the possible reduction of VAT rates, and whether the standard rates or the individual exemptions from standard rates are most likely to distort the market (if they distort it at all).
At the same time, we could also examine the issue of whether the priority given to consumption tax â at the expense of direct taxes, and mainly taxes affecting the workforce â can actually assist Member States in achieving the Lisbon employment targets.
These would be the issues of the next debate, for which sufficient time should be allowed.
I am convinced that a good background report prepared by the Committee may assist Parliament with this issue, and we will be able to accept a considered position even before 2010, but at this point we still propose extension, with the amendment that we must also set the maximum rate, at 25%.
My second report concerns VAT refunds.
The amendment to the Eighth Directive, tabled before us, is part of a highly significant, triple amendment package tabled by the Commission in October 2004, the effect of which has been â rightly â extended by the current Commission, and which has become famous for the single-window system, the so-called âone-stop-shopâ.
Parliament has already adopted a position on this issue, as well as on tax cooperation between Member States, in connection with two reports tabled before Parliament, and now I am pleased that at the request of the Council we are also able to express our views, even if retrospectively, on the Eighth Directive addressing VAT refunds.
First of all, I would state that we fully agree with the approach of the Commission to the entire draft package, including the amendment to the Eighth Directive, as this helps enterprises collect outstanding VAT from other Member States, and it also speeds up this process by the use of electronic methods.
So far, collection has only been possible if an entity was VAT registered in another Member State.
Many refused to follow the extended and costly procedure, and in the majority of cases outstanding VAT has not been collected at all, because the administrative procedure would have cost more than the actual amount of outstanding VAT.
The current amendment will primarily improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which had the most difficulty in sustaining the apparatus required for refunds in a cost-effective manner.
The approach of the Council allowing a period of three months for the competent authorities to assess a claim is also small-enterprise-friendly.
We also support the proposal that a very stiff, one-month late penalty fee must be paid by the competent tax authority for each month after the expiry of the time limit.
We did not accept the proposed amendment that would have left this to be regulated individually by Member States.
Our amendment proposals have also been formulated in line with this approach of the Commission, as we have emphasised that alongside enterprise protection, the tasks of Member State tax authorities must also be stated clearly, with rectifications where required, and specific time limits for forwarding, consideration, decision making and refund.
This is the content of our amendments.
We also specified separately that the three-month investigation period cannot re-commence even in the event of queries, requests for additional information or any other problems â as we have understood from the Commissionâs proposal â as in our opinion the full procedure cannot exceed four months even in the presence of such problems.
Our proposal aims at avoiding unnecessary delays in the refund period and keeping the moneys in treasury funds.
Although for legal reasons we were unable to include this in our opinion as a formal amendment proposal, I still hope that as part of the package, as part of the overall OSS package, the speed of cooperation between authorities will increase, as this helps avoid cash-flow problems for small enterprises, problems related to VAT refund entitlement and the determination of ratios, and even abuses, because fraud and the formation of fictitious companies very often arise from an attempt to reclaim fictitious export VAT.
I hope that in the course of the Council debate, the 10â40-day time limit for electronic data forwarding, given to tax authorities in the country of residence, may be shortened in respect of the upper limit of 40 days.
However, the priority is to implement the package as soon as possible, and we hope that in a few years (we asked for four years in connection with the OSS) we will be able to evaluate implementation based on the Commissionâs report.
I am convinced that the procedure (and the screening of abuses) may be speeded up in the future by using some kind of a shared database â or by easier access to the databases of other Member States â but this will require the settling of a large number of legal, data protection and other issues, which should be looked into following the first evaluation.
Therefore, at present, the most important thing is that this constructive proposal is put into effect as soon as possible, and that our enterprises may enjoy its benefits.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we wanted to take advantage of the two reports by our distinguished fellow Member, MrÂ Becsey, on the subject of VAT in order to table an oral question to this Assembly which, I hope, will be followed by the adoption of a resolution.
As regards, in fact, the reduced VAT rate system in labour-intensive sectors, we are in an economic, social, political and legal situation that is unpleasant to say the least, if not downright complex.
We are today faced with a system that has been extended twice.
Thereafter, a proposal by the Commission dating from 2003 was submitted to us, of which the Members of our Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour on 4 December 2003 and which has since been blocked by the Council.
Very often we are told that better regulation implies Parliamentâs working more quickly, but I sometimes get the impression that we should also see how things take place from the Councilâs perspective.
We are here in the realm of unanimity and, while certain Member States will intervene strictly on the basis of national interests by exploiting VAT rates, they are blocking the extension of this system at the Council, a system that has proved its worth.
In fact, this system enables us to sustain employment, to combat undeclared work and to organise the tax system more coherently at the level of the Member States.
That is why our committee wanted to table this oral question, by means of which we fully support both the Commissionâs initiative and the successive efforts of the Luxembourg and the UK Presidencies, both of which have put on the table a compromise proposal that is totally in keeping with the wishes expressed by this Parliament from 2003.
Today we have our backs to the wall: this twice-extended system will expire at the end of the year and, in nine Member States, entire sectors still do not know, at this very moment, which tax system will be applied to them as from 1 January of next year.
We are today on the eve of an ECOFIN Council at which, I hope, the Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will hear the very loud signal this Assembly wants to send out to them through this oral question, as well as through several written statements, which have been submitted at our Parliamentâs Registry and signed by a large number of Members.
The Luxembourg proposal, taken up by the UK Presidency, enables what was, until now, a simple experiment to be clarified, simplified, harmonised and brought into widespread use.
For the construction sector and the home care services sector, it is primarily a matter of prolonging the reduced VAT rates.
It is a matter of extending a more flexible mechanism and of making plans for this mechanism to be extended until 2015.
It is a matter of coherently discarding what is included in the notorious Annex H. On the initiative of the UK Presidency, it is a matter of evaluating the entire mechanism every five years.
It seems to me that we have here before us balanced proposals that will make it possible, I repeat, to sustain employment in labour-intensive sectors â that is where the coherence of the proposed fiscal mechanism comes in â to combat undeclared work and to contribute to what is in line to become the leitmotiv of this House â and, I hope, beyond this House, of the Council â namely, better regulation and the Lisbon objectives.
Allow me once again to say to the Council, even though I see that it is not represented in this House this morning, how important it is to obtain the agreement of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance.
I believe that solidarity, which must also govern this Collegeâs work should, at the very least, if the Luxembourg and UK proposal were sadly unable to obtain unanimous approval, lead to a further one-year extension of the system as it stands.
This would be the âleast worstâ solution.
Â Â  . Mr President, before I start my introductory remarks I would like to offer my apologies to you and to the honourable Members for the delay.
We had some traffic problems but now I am here and I will let you know the position of the Commission.
I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, MrÂ Becsey, for his two reports, and to Ms BerÃšs for the oral question on such an important issue which is very close to my heart.
I will first comment on the proposal on the minimum standard VAT rate.
I will continue with comments on the oral question and the motion for a resolution concerning the reduced VAT rate.
Finally, I will comment briefly on the eighth VAT directive proposal, which is part of the one-stop-shop package on which an extended debate took place in this House back in September.
The Commission thanks the European Parliament for the quick handling of the minimum standard VAT rate proposal and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his active and positive contribution.
This proposal needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency as the present rules come to an end on 31Â December 2005.
