Lastly, this agreement is wholly uninspiring, as it fails to honour commitments entered into with candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania.
This kind of attitude is what is known as hypocrisy.
Â Â  . The outcome of the Council meeting at dead of night in Brussels last December fails Scotland and fails Europe.
It is unacceptable to the Parliament and I am pleased to support this motion to reject the deal as agreed and to start negotiations on making it better.
Parliament has been instrumental in forcing the Member States, the UK being chief among them, to act reasonably, but we can still do better than the deal before us today.
I think Parliament is right to hold out for a better compromise and am glad that we have passed this motion today and look forward to the negotiations.
Â Â  . I welcome the decision of the European Parliament's Conference of Presidents to appoint 22 MEPs to a Committee of Inquiry charged with investigating the case of citizens, as many as 6Â 500 of whom are Irish, who were robbed of their savings due to the crisis at insurance company Equitable Life.
I support the petition which Equitable Life investors have submitted to the European Parliament's Petitions Committee.
It is entirely right that their case will now be investigated fully by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry.
The Irish Government should now appoint an investigator who will represent Irish citizens' interests in this matter and work with the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry.
Â Â  . Constituents across Scotland have contacted me seeking action on Equitable Life, not just words.
Today we have answered their pleas, and I am glad that Parliament has taken this decisive step when the London government has not.
People had their savings and pensions plans thrown into chaos when Equitable Life collapsed, and it is right that they continue to seek answers.
I look forward to working with the committee to get to the bottom of this issue.
Â Â  . In the Europe of freedom and values, it must be made perfectly clear that citizensâ rights and the primacy of the rule of law deserve complete protection.
Combating terrorism should fall into this category.
Accordingly, we must not abandon our heritage and the broad international support we enjoy.
What separates us from the terrorists is our profound respect for people and for all of their rights.
This temporary committee must carry out its mandate to collect and analyse any information that may prove relevant in discovering the truth behind reports, backed up by Human Rights Watch, that appeared in the Washington Post.
We must get to the truth, not only because lingering doubts feed suspicion and foment speculation, but also because under no circumstances can we allow European territory to be used for the purpose of secret detention.
That would be shameful and would fly in the face of international rules on human rights, and of European rules and values.
Â Â  . As regards the decision to establish a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry to investigate claims of secret CIA prisons and the torture of prisoners on EU soil or in countries seeking EU membership, if EU Member States or candidate countries had been involved, actively or passively, in running 'extra-judicial prisons', there would have been violations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is important that we get to the root of the matter.
We must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities.
We want to know the truth, nothing more than the truth.
If we do this, then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture.
Â Â  . I voted for the setting up of a European Parliament inquiry into allegations of CIA activity in relation to alleged abductions, 'extraordinary rendition', 'detention at secret sites', 'detention incommunicado', torture, cruelty, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners on the territory of the EU, including acceding and candidate countries.
It is important, in light of widespread concerns, including those in my London constituency, that the EP inquiry makes a serious effort to assess the veracity of the allegations.
Â Â  . â In the face of the disclosures and commotion caused by the action of the CIA, with citizens being abducted, suspects moved, investigations carried out and jails in European countries, the European Parliament is trying, in setting up the Committee of Inquiry, to pull the wool over the eyes of the peoples of Europe.
It is displaying hypocritical concern about the infringement of human rights on European soil and trying to save the 'lost honour' of the ÎU.
However, it is a fact that the EU itself and the governments of the Member States have concluded secret agreements with the USA, have fallen in fully with the so-called anti-terrorist strategy and are now trying to play at being surprised and innocent doves.
It insults and underestimates the peoples when the political groups in the European Parliament, whose parties are in government and have signed the agreements, make a show of protesting about their results.
The ÎU and the USA are jointly responsible for the unaccountable action by the secret services which, apart from anything else, are preparing to apply the terrorist laws to strike the grass-roots movement and unleash wars against countries and peoples.
Â Â  . During conflict situations, especially the one in which the United States and the Allies are currently engaged, it is even more essential that our fundamental, civilised values be upheld; we need to be all the more vigilant in extreme circumstances.
I therefore share the view of all those who, in Europe and the United States, have raised their voices against any abuse or violation of these values.
That is my unequivocal position, and one that I have expressed on previous occasions.
That being said, with regard to the so-called âCIA flightsâ, I must express my disappointment at the way in which this debate has been conducted.
It has been based largely on a conjecture, suspicion and accusation, and the word of our allies and our most esteemed political leaders of EU Member States appears to be the one that holds the least value.
Against this backdrop, I feel that the Conference of Presidents managed to reach a solution that was appropriate and, above all, balanced and suited to the role that Parliament could play on this issue.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . The allegations that our friends and colleagues the Americans have used European airports as staging posts in flights which would be illegal under our laws are worrying in the extreme.
It is right that we in the European Parliament should seek to shed light on this murky business, as this issue is of importance to all our citizens.
I for my part do not believe that the Americans are guilty of half the things they stand accused of, but we will only be able to answer these allegations by getting to the truth of the matter, and I look forward to working with the Inquiry to do just that.
Â Â  . The EU must maintain a clear and consistent position in defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, in relation to what ought to be, in the broadest sense, the Middle East peace process.
In this particular case, the steps that have been taken in Lebanon require our effective support both in word and in deed.
In practice, we need to work together on any leads that may uncover the truth behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.
I therefore voted in favour of the report before us.
I should also like to mention the procedural issues raised by the rapporteur, which I feel are worthy of further attention.
Â Â  . We welcome the adoption of the final report, approved by the Conciliation Committee, on the management of waste from the extractive industries, which is very much of interest to Portugal.
This new legislation will strengthen the environmental rules in a number of Member States, and impose more stringent obligations on companies to tidy sites after completing their industrial activities, and in so doing honour their responsibility to protect the environment and public health.
The inventories that must be carried out on existing situations, in order that appropriate measures can be taken, are of similar importance.
We trust that these proposals will be put into practice across the board.
Â Â  . This directive is an important legislative text on the environment.
Following the laudable work done by both the rapporteur and Parliamentâs delegation in the Conciliation Committee, I must express my backing for this report, which contains important measures that will pave the way to reducing the detrimental effects on the environment, and the risks to human health resulting from waste from the extractive industries.
I therefore voted in favour of the SjÃ¶stedt report.
Â Â  There are some 20Â 000 bathing sites in the European Union, and people have no idea of what dangerous bacteria lurk in their waters.
Swimmers swallow on average some 50 millilitres of water, and children sometimes swallow ten times that amount while splashing around, so the absence of any risk of contracting an illness must be guaranteed.
There are various agents that can cause illnesses ranging from nausea to skin eruptions, but also others that are potentially fatal.
It is all the more encouraging, then, that the European directive has been able to improve the quality of bathing water over recent years, but it has made drastic incursions into the capacity of smaller lakes, such as those in the Austrian Alps, to regulate themselves.
It follows that we can no longer rely solely on the provisions of the law, on prohibitions and investments, but must instead try to demand of the public that they cooperate actively and be aware of environmental issues.
Â Â  The EU should not, of course, have a common directive governing bathing water quality.
We have voted in favour of the report, since Parliament listened to our criticisms and is cutting back on the regulations we have at present.
The report also vigorously rejects the proposals for further regulation that existed when Parliament debated the issue last time.
It should be pointed out that the previous proposal clearly showed how difficult it is having detailed rules that are to apply under quite different conditions.
In countries with long coasts, large stretches of water, short bathing seasons, low water temperatures and sparse populations, the requirements should be different from those in countries with heavily populated beaches to which many people travel in order to bathe in warm water during long seasons.
We Swedish Conservatives are pleased that we have obtained a hearing for our criticisms.
Â Â  . I naturally support this proposal.
It is of particular importance to my country, Portugal, whose coastline covers half of national territory, which boasts a number of rivers and other waterways, and where a population of bathers enjoys water sports in increasing numbers.
This proposal represents a significant step in terms of protecting the populationâs health and the environment, as the amendments on the table will bring clear improvements in terms of the understanding, monitoring and quality control of bathing water.
The text that emerged from the Conciliation Committee will plug gaps and bring up to date the regulation on bathing water currently in force.
There are now stricter requirements, such as new bacteria limit values for water to be considered of âsufficientâ quality, the fact that public information and participation is now mandatory and the EU-wide standardisation of signs, which will help to reduce health risks and to prevent disease and infection.
Â Â  I have today chosen to vote in favour of the Conciliation Committeeâs joint text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality. I do so on the basis that this is an issue to which subsidiarity applies, by which I mean that it should be dealt with at local or regional level in this case.
Bathing water is an issue that affects many Swedish municipalities that have a huge number of bathing beaches.
It is therefore important for the directive not to place a burden of increased bureaucracy on the municipalities.
My having, in spite of everything, voted in favour of this draft has to do with the fact that it is in many ways an improvement on the 1976 bathing water quality directive that applies today.
Firstly, it is simpler and, secondly, it contains improved health and environmental requirements.
A slimmer but more efficient EU needs to look at whether issues such as this should not be passed back to the Member States to be dealt with at national or local/regional level.
Â Â  . The most important aspect of the solution that has been reached is that the 1976 directive on bathing water quality, which had been rendered out of date by developments in scientific knowledge and increased health demands, has in some aspects been brought up to date.
According to the rapporteur, these amendments will result in a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 7.5%.
The conciliation process was a difficult one, given the highly divergent positions involved, and the outcome was satisfactory but inadequate, particularly as regards the parameters that have now become mandatory.
The greatest gains have been made in the area of informing the public.
It is hoped that up-to-date information will be made public and will be visible at the bathing sites themselves.
Â Â  . The text obtained in the Conciliation Committee and brought before us for the vote today contains very welcome amendments to the proposal tabled for second reading on 21Â AprilÂ 2005.
The fact that the proposal to remove the distinction between coastal and inland waters was not incorporated and that the category of âsufficientâ quality was not removed from the final text safeguards Portugalâs overriding interests in this matter, and meets the most recent WHO recommendations.
I welcome the proposed parameters for assessing bathing water quality, along with the methodology adopted for evaluating and classifying it.
I am therefore in favour of the adoption of those parameters.
I feel that it will thus be possible not only to improve the environment but also to protect and better inform the citizens on the quality of the bathing water that they use.
Â Â  This report deals with an issue that should not be on the EUâs agenda.
It does not, of course, make sense to compare the status and requirements of bathing water in the Mediterranean with those of thousands of lakes in countries such as Sweden and Finland.
The Bathing Water Directive is an example of how, in practice, the EU rarely applies either the principle of subsidiarity or the principle of proportionality.
That is regrettable.
The proposal in which the conciliation procedure has resulted has certain advantages compared with the directive that currently applies.
For example, there are fewer criteria that the Member States will have to apply.
At the same time, absurd new requirements have been introduced, such as the requirement that signs identical across the EU should be introduced at bathing sites.
We are confident that the Member States are able independently to deal with issues concerning water quality at bathing sites.
We are thus opposed in principle to the Bathing Water Directive and have voted against the Conciliation Committeeâs compromise.
Â Â  I have chosen to vote in favour of the Conciliation Committeeâs joint text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality.
In principle, I do not believe that bathing water quality is an issue that should be dealt with at EU level. It should be dealt with by the Member States at national or local level.
I voted in favour of the draft because the proposal significantly simplifies an earlier, 1976 directive on bathing water quality.
Voting in favour of this proposal is part of the fight to simplify EU legislation.
It also, of course, involves changes for the better where health and the environment are concerned.
In order for the EU to be more effective and show more dynamism on the major cross-border issues, policy-making in certain areas needs to be handed over to the Member States.
This is one such area, and it should be dealt with in places closer to the people.
Â Â  I voted for this report because the new fourth water quality category as introduced by the Council is maintained, and the four categories are now combined with better figures for the level of toxicology defining them.
These new figures should help decrease the risks to bathers' health by improving the category levels.
Â Â  . The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on the directive on the management of bathing water is based on new criteria for assessing water quality and informing the public.
Stricter rules and better information for the public are extremely important for Portugal, given the extent of the Portuguese coastline, and given the social, cultural and economic value that that coastline and its innumerable waterways bring to the country, in terms not only of tourist activities, but also of socio-cultural activities.
Every effort must be made to prevent and reduce health risks.
I therefore feel that this proposal is a highly significant step towards protecting the peopleâs health and the environment.
These amendments will lead to clear improvement in terms of the understanding, monitoring and quality control of bathing water, and will help to strike the required balance as regards the cost of introducing new quality criteria.
I therefore voted in favour of the Maaten report.
Â Â  . The subject of this resolution, the quality of bathing water, is important, but should in my opinion, from the viewpoint of subsidiarity, be dealt with at the national level.
There is no added value in regulating this subject at the European level.
For this reason I vote against this resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, annoyingly, my speech had to end as time ran out, and I would like to remedy that.
I will read what I meant to say, so that environmental organisations will not misunderstand what I said:
An example of this is the letter that came this week from the biggest environmental organisations, which gives a misleading picture of the right to access to justice that is now possibly opening up to them.
They mention that industrial countries are able to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and now this legislation would only bring them to the same level.
The letter fails to mention that at present the environmental organisations do by no means aspire to the same level as companies, regarding which there is a call for this decision to affect them âdirectly and individuallyâ, in other words, as an interested party.
Instead, the environmental organisations should now be able to choose, within the entire Union and ignoring criteria relating to interested parties, which area they are interested in.
It was misleading that this essential detail was left unsaid.
Â Â  . I very much welcome the draft regulation to apply the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention to EC institutions and bodies.
Citizens have a legitimate right to information and environmental justice, including from the EC.
In particular, I believe the definition of 'environmental information' set out in the proposed regulation should include information about the state of progress of proceedings against Member States for infringing EC law.
All too often, the only way EU citizens can find out about the failure of their Member States to respect the commitments they have freely entered into is by monitoring Commission press releases.
This is not sufficient and has to be put on a firmer footing.
Lastly, I regret the failure of the Council to reach agreement on the related draft Directive on Access to Justice, as endorsed by the EP with amendments on 31 March 2004, and I urge the Council and the Commission to redouble their efforts on this particular initiative.
Â Â  . In our view, the amendments adopted today to the report on application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in the European institutions are highly significant.
In the report, priority is given, firstly, to the publicâs right to information on procedures for participating in the decision-making process, namely how to use those procedures, secondly, to the right of access to information; and, lastly, to access to justice in environmental matters.
Amendments have been brought in, for example, on defining priorities regarding environmental policy and public involvement in defining environmental policy.
It is now compulsory to indicate clearly how information can be obtained, such as information on the state of progress of proceedings for infringement of Community law and to make information available by assessing the outcome of various consultations.
In some areas, however, it falls short of the requirements of the Convention, in particular with regard to access to justice, insofar as there are no established support mechanisms for reducing or eliminating recurring financial obstacles; indeed, access to justice is often restricted precisely because those seeking justice do not have the necessary financial resources.
Broadly speaking, however, this is an important step towards ensuring, on the one hand, effective participation, via procedures developed within a reasonable timescale, and, on the other, access to information, which will enable sound, democratic participation.
Â Â  I voted against some of Parliamentâs amendments on the application of the Ãrhus Convention.
I am obviously in favour of the public being as fully informed as possible.
Yet, I do not believe that this information should lead certain NGOs repeatedly to initiate legal proceedings, when the former are still not recognised as representative.
If the general interest is proven, then it must take precedence over often selfish considerations.
Â Â  We believe that the Ãrhus Convention constitutes a valuable legal tool for guaranteeing public access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making processes.
The Convention has a constructive purpose, then.
We have voted against AmendmentÂ 25.
Purely as a matter of principle, we believe that lawsuits should be brought before national courts that apply current law.
Â Â  .
In a society that is based on democratic values, I believe that each party should be accorded the same rights. These also include equal, non-discriminatory access opportunities to justice for citizens, companies and NGOs.
Article 230(4) of the Treaty already provides for this and is therefore sufficient.
That is why I considered it appropriate to vote against Amendments 19, 22, 24 and 25.
Â Â  Mr President, it was, in fact, already evident after yesterdayâs debate on the liberalisation of port services, that a large majority of Members of this House were, and are, sensitive to the justified arguments put to them by the European dockworkers, which is, of course, a good thing.
We can only hope that the somewhat other-worldly European Commission does not persist in its anger and in that respect, we should not hold out too many hopes because we will, I believe, again be presented with the Bolkestein directive as early as next month.
Having said this, I take a great deal of pleasure in pointing out that, by rejecting Mr Jarzembowskiâs report today, we have clearly opted for the principle of âjobs for our own people firstâ.
We have protected our own national dockworkers against unfair competition from countries that apply entirely different working conditions.
I am delighted that the left and the right in this House have for once put their own people first.
They have for once put the fundamental interests of our own citizens above ideology.
It is to be hoped that this is an example that will be followed.
Â Â  Mr President, I did not reject the proposal for the port directive.
In my view, we should have amended it and improved on it, for a balanced package of amendments was before us.
We could have done as the trade unions requested, and removed the self-handling clause from the directive.
We could have prepared a framework for licences and contracts, for the selection of port service providers by the port authorities.
We could have drafted a clear legal framework for the pilotage services.
We could have drawn up clear transitional arrangements for existing licences.
A majority in this House regarded that as unnecessary, even though European port policy has been the subject of discussion for ten years now and even though we are probably familiar with all arguments by now.
I am not prepared to indulge in short-term thinking and bury my head in the sand.
We, politicians, have a duty to carry out our legislative work, which was not the case today.
We are now passing on policy to the judges at the European Court of Justice, who will decide what the free movement of services in our ports means.
Our Parliament was short-sighted today.
I was of a different opinion.
Â Â  Mr President, I was the EPP rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee for the Port Services Directive, and obviously I voted to reject it - but for completely different reasons from almost everyone else in this House.
This directive was a step back from the liberalisation that we have already undertaken in the United Kingdom.
Whilst many in this House were burying their heads in the sand to the fact that we are now operating in a global economy and our competitors are better and quicker at doing things than us, I was concerned that this pretty pathetic proposal for a directive emanating from the last Commission, which should never have been resubmitted by the current Commission, did not go far enough.
There are many reasons why we should be aware of and concerned about our global competitors.
Sticking our heads, necks and everything else into the sand, and forgetting that we are in a global market, is no way to deal with that situation.
Â Â  . I voted against the proposed Port Services Directive as I believe it would have serious implications for the main port in my constituency: Belfast Port.
By imposing the usual 'one-size-fits-all' solution on all EU ports, the directive would subject Belfast Port, which handles 66% of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade, to unnecessary and commercially restrictive practices which would damage its economic viability.
In particular, Belfast's on-going investment programmes, crucial to the docks' future and currently being rolled out, would be adversely affected because of the need to constantly re-tender, which is not practical in securing long term infrastructure.
While it is quite right that certain markets should be open to competition, I consider it unnecessary to apply such requirements in this form to markets which are already the product of open contractual competition, such as that of cargo handling in Belfast Port.
Northern Ireland relies greatly on the maintenance of a competitive and efficient port infrastructure.
In my opinion, this unnecessary directive would only stymie the development of Belfast and other ports.
I therefore totally reject this proposal, whose effect would be stultifying and regressive.
Â Â  .With our European ports featuring among the most modern and most competitive in the world, I fail to understand the need for a directive aimed at liberalising port services in Europe.
I also fail to understand the Commissionâs obstinacy in wanting to impose a law that the shipowners, the managers of European ports and, above all, the dockworkers find unsatisfactory.
This is stubbornness verging on a denial of democracy, when it becomes clear that the Commission is daring to trot out the same proposal already rejected by Members of this Parliament.
By introducing self-handling, this text threatens not only the jobs of thousands of workers in European ports but also the safety and security of goods and persons, because these workers are made to compete against crews who are employed on a casual basis and who often have no professional qualifications.
By voting against this iniquitous text, I therefore wanted to assure those who champion the survival of their profession that they have my support.
I call on the Commission finally to get down to work in order to ensure a high employment rate and upwards social harmonisation, instead of engaging in the systematic and shameless dismantling of our fellow citizensâ social benefits, coupled with unrestrained social dumping.
Â Â  .The Commission wants to bring into force a directive that was already rejected three times by the European Parliament during the last legislative term.
This is a denial of democracy.
There is, however, no reason to adopt this text today. It is a text that seriously threatens peopleâs safety and jobs.
By means of self-handling, which allows ânovicesâ to do dock work and to handle cargo, this text introduces social dumping and calls safety arrangements into question.
Out of all those groups working in the ports, not one is satisfied with this text: not the shipowners, not the pilots and not the boatmen.
Why, then, if not in the name of free enterprise, do we want to turn our ports into supermarkets by selling off the port structures to the private sector?
European ports are competitive, and if we were to make laws, they would relate to maritime safety, the safety of the straits, spatial planning and the very high concentration of crews in the North Sea to the detriment of the Mediterranean Sea.
The Commission proposal does not meet the current requirement of our ports.
It must be rejected.
This month, it is the port services directive and, next month, it will be the âBolkesteinâ Directive.
When are we going to listen to what Europeans have to say?
Â Â  .
I voted against this proposed directive and I welcome its rejection by Parliament. This rejection shows that the system of checks and balances in the EUâs institutional system actually works.
Without the existence of the elected European Parliament, there would have been a real danger that, if left to their own devices, the Commission and national ministers in the Council would have adopted this undesirable piece of legislation.
Â Â  . The ALDE Group believes that port services must be covered by a Community legislative framework which takes account of their particular conditions.
Such a framework should allow fair access between the suppliers of services to port activities and would represent an essential asset for the development of the ports.
It would also be an opportune moment to consider the role of the port authority or the operating methods of the port.
In addition, a very clear clarification of the conditions of attribution of State aid must be carried out in order to guarantee transparent and fair competition between ports.
In the absence of such a framework, the Treaty would be applied on a case-by-case basis, which would lead to a situation where the disputes would be resolved in the courts â a de facto government by judges â and where the two legislative arms of the European Union would be left aside.
The European Commission proposal was not sufficiently complete or clear to gain the support of the European Parliament without substantial amendment.
Following the rejection of this proposal, and for all these reasons, ALDE urges the European Commission to conduct a comprehensive consultation process with ...
Â Â  . The EU can only develop and establish itself if it is based on values such as solidarity, non-violence, law and order and the resolute promotion of public non-violence.
Parliamentâs discussion on the directive on market access to port services took place in an atmosphere loaded with undue pressure and violence, leading to material damage and injuries to people which can never be justified.
Those responsible for breaking the law and disturbing the peace must not derive any benefit from their actions.
Consequently, regardless of the intrinsic value of the issues addressed in this directive and the balance of social interests that was reached, I opted to abstain.
Â Â  , . We voted to reject the proposal for a directive because we believe that the unbridled liberalisation of access to the public services market will create serious public health and safety problems, and will hinder the guaranteed provision and sustainability of the service â a public service, let us not forget â thereby leading to a reduction in the efficiency of that service.
Three years after the Commissionâs first proposal in this area, which was rejected at the time, we find ourselves once again debating a proposal for a resolution that was voted down in the Committee concerned, a vote that sends a clear message to Parliament: any text capable of creating a series of legal inconsistencies with the existing international legal framework and with current Community law â for example Regulation (EEC) No 1191/69 concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service â and of leading to the complete deregulation of auto-handling services cannot be deemed positive.
This message actually goes further, and clearly demonstrates that a proposal applicable to substantially different ports, in which forced liberalisation is liable to lead to economically damaging monopolies and, lastly, a proposal with terrible social consequences cannot realistically be accepted by representatives of the people of Europe.
Â Â  .The European Commissionâs directive on the liberalisation of port services is nothing more and nothing less that a Bolkestein directive applied to the ports.
It has come back to this Assembly, even though it had been rejected in its previous - almost identical - form a few months ago.
Like the Bolkestein Directive, this text engineers social dumping on the very territory of the Union, threatens jobs and provides no guarantees whatsoever: not in terms of competitiveness, of growth, of efficiency or of safety.
This is nothing more than a âliberalisationâ exercise in the name of a form of competition that is viewed as sacrosanct, with no regard for the actual consequences.
There is no doubt that European ports are not as competitive as we would like them to be.
There is no doubt that we need to relieve the congestion on land routes.
There is no doubt that a great deal could be said about certain trade union monopolies and their corrupt practices.
Yet, it is not by destroying jobs, by proposing ideological texts devoid of impact studies or by opening up our economies to unfair international competition that you will resolve these problems.
Our main aim has to be one of defending the European jobs of European workers and, for us in the , one of defending the French jobs of French workers.
Our decision to reject the text is final.
Â Â  The Port Services Directive constitutes an example of superfluous EU legislation.
We voted against the report and recommend that the Commissionâs proposal be rejected.
We chose to support those amendments aimed at limiting the scope of the directive.
We thus voted in favour of proposals whereby pilotage services and self-handling are to be excluded from the scope of the directive.
We are critical of the Port Services Directive for a number of reasons.
â The Port Services Directive takes no account of the principles either of subsidiarity or of proportionality.
Political decisions on pilotage, unloading and self-handling must be taken at national level.
â Under the proposal for a directive, employees doing the same jobs can belong to different union organisations.
This paves the way for stoppages and militates against peaceful and orderly relations within the industry.
â The Port Services Directive will scarcely promote competition.
Ports are companies that compete with one another.
The Port Services Directive is an attempt to force them to accept a situation in which other companies are able to take over parts of their business against their will.
That is absurd.
No one would come up with the idea of forcing Volvo to accept subcontractors they do not want.
Competition between port companies is a good thing and leads to more efficient solutions.
If a large-scale enterprise in another industry is not efficient and customer-friendly, it is driven out of business.
That is also the way things work in the companies constituted by European ports.
Â Â  .This is a directive which imposes regulations and controls which are neither necessary nor wanted.
The directive, as proposed, endangers the livelihood of port workers in many countries among them Malta.
This is fundamental for us.
As drafted, this directive brings with it a lower quality of services, lower levels of safety and more threats to investments which have been made or which are still to be made aimed at improving the infrastructure in a number of ports.
Contrary to what is being said by members of the Commission, this directive will neither create new markets, nor make competition more just and much less will it create new opportunities for workers.
On the contrary this will affect negatively not only those who work in ports but also other sectors of the economy.
We have to understand that with the enlargement of the European Union, diversity of Member States has increased and so one must be careful that when we legislate we do not put all countries in the same boat and assume that what counts for one country, counts for all.
Therefore in solidarity with workers in Malta as well as in many other countries, I am voting against this directive which creates disadvantages for workers and which ultimately creates more problems than it solves.
Â Â  .I voted against rejecting the text. In fact, I should have liked the opportunity to give my verdict on the amended text.
The proposed amendments would have enabled us to help European ports meet the needs of international competition.
The emotion of the moment has prevailed over the future of our ports.
I should like to highlight the unacceptable attitude of the dockworkers.
We would never have seen a national parliament attacked like the European Parliament was attacked yesterday.
By throwing paving stones, steel bars and the like, the dockworkers laid the blame on Parliament, when Parliament is the institution in Europe that does the most to defend workers.
I therefore condemn their ploys.
While I share their concerns on some points, I will never give in to violence used as a pressure tactic.
It is a question here of an attack on democracy.
Yes, it is inconceivable that unqualified personnel should work in our ports.
However, we cannot constantly go on about economic development, competitiveness and social progress if we do not provide ourselves with the resources to take action in these areas.
It is imperative that we offer the ports in Hamburg, Marseille and Antwerp services that are at least as attractive as those offered in Asian ports.
Their survival depends on our doing so.
Â Â  . Our proposal to reject the directive on port services has, I am pleased to say, been adopted.
For the second time, attempts to liberalise port services have been defeated, following a significant mobilisation of the workers in the sector, who, from the very outset, have fought against this new onslaught on jobs with rights.
This had also been an attempt to put this sector, which is so important to national development, in the hands of the major shipowners, thereby driving the two sides even further apart.
We must remain alive, however, to any fresh attempts at EU level to table again a proposal that has now been rejected twice.
Any attempts at privatising port services, via the inclusion of the sector in the unacceptable proposal for a directive on the internal services market, or by stealth via the re-submission of the proposals on intra-Community shipping, must be resolutely combated.
As the workers have emphasised, there is no justification for a Community directive on the sector.
At this time, the victory for the port services workers must be saluted.
This is a victory that forms part of the workersâ struggle in different countries against the EUâs neoliberal policies, which pander to the interests of the major economic and financial groups, attack workersâ rights, and undermine the national public sector and services.
Â Â  . Port services must be covered by a legislative framework taking into account their specificity.
A Community framework would allow equitable access to port activities.
Furthermore an integrated policy is necessary to facilitate the development of European ports.
It would also be the opportune moment for due consideration of the role of the managing body of the port as well as the operating methods of the port.
In addition, very clear clarification on State aid rules is essential in order to guarantee transparent and fair competition between European ports.
Decisions on a case-by-case basis, which would lead to a 'Gouvernement des juges', where the two legislative bodies of the European Union are left aside, are not acceptable.
The European Commission's proposal was not sufficiently complete to gain support.
Following the rejection of this proposal, and for all reasons mentioned, I urge the European Commission to enter into a vast consultation process with all parties concerned, also giving voice to those parties neglected until now and representing the demand side, and to propose an ambitious white paper on European seaports policy in its entirety, and this at the earliest possible opportunity.
Â Â  . I voted against the report and against the directive just as I had done the first time this proposal came before us.
Port owners and managers did not want the Directive. Employees and trade unions did not want it.
I am pleased that MEPs have once again rejected the proposal and I hope that this time the Commission will listen to our democratic voice, not attempt to reintroduce their unwelcome plans.
Â Â  The Danish Liberal Partyâs Members of the European Parliament voted in favour of the first amendment, recommending rejection of the Commissionâs proposal, as it is impossible to bring about a satisfactory outcome in the light of that proposal.
There is a need for a port services directive, but not in the form proposed by the Commission.
The process of obtaining legislation in this area must be started afresh.
Â Â  .Job cuts, wage dumping and social dumping and the lowering of safety standards and professional qualifications: this is what the European Commission is proposing to us in its third version of the directive on the liberalisation of port services.
The thousands of dockworkers throughout Europe who demonstrated in NovemberÂ 2003 to denounce these wrongdoings will not have been enough to make people see sense.
The anti-national and anti-social ultraliberalism sanctified by the Commission admits of no exceptions: on the model of the approach to the draft European Constitution, rejected by France and the Netherlands in referenda, there is a still an omnipresent desire in Brussels to put this port services directive back on the European agenda.
A true âlittle sisterâ of the Bolkestein Directive, the directive on the liberalisation of port services has the sole aim of allowing employees to be pitted against one another through the use of foreign, under-qualified labour on board ships that all too often sail under a flag of convenience, and this to the detriment of national workers.
Having attacked our public services and our textile, coal and iron and steel industries, these Taliban of free trade are now, therefore, attacking port workers by seeking to impose their anti-national philosophy, which consists of giving preference to foreign workers in the job market.
As always, the , for its part, is in favour of defending French jobs.
Â Â  What the Commission is proposing to us with this directive on the liberalisation of port services are nothing more or less than ports of convenience.
We want nothing to do with these, any more than we do with flags of convenience whereby unscrupulous shipowners take on poorly trained and underpaid labour.
The liberalisation at any price desired by Brussels in this area is synonymous with unemployment and social destitution.
In the name of its ultraliberal and anti-national ideology, the Commission is notifying us of a reduction in costs to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services.
Demolishing the monopoly enjoyed by dockworkers will lead not only to yet another graveyard of society but will lead to insecurity in European ports and will ultimately make them less competitive.
In November 2003, thanks to the terrific mobilisation of dockworkers and port agents from the whole of Europe, this âBolkestein Mark Twoâ directive was derailed, and an unjustly stigmatised profession thereby prevented from being opened up for the benefit of under-qualified workers from the developing countries.
Once again, it is the preference for employing foreigners that is endorsed and, with it, the end of professionalism, skills, traditions and social benefits.
Â Â  If there is one subject that awakens passions within the European institutions and provokes reactions in the Member States, it is the liberalisation of port services.
In 2003, the European Commission achieved the feat of getting thousands of basically French, British, German, Belgian and Dutch dockworkers onto the streets in order to demonstrate, sometimes violently, against a draft directive that would jeopardise their status and lead inevitably to large job losses in their profession.
Indeed, the most controversial aspect was that of self-handling, that is to say the opportunity for a shipowner, using his own staff and equipment, to take care himself of certain port services that, until now, had been the preserve only of dockworkers.
The document proposed to us today has not abandoned the principle of self-handling, thereby leaving the door wide open for anyone to engage in the activities of dock work, pilotage, towage and mooring and for unscrupulous shipowners operating coffin ships to use under-qualified and underpaid staff.
Whatever the objective pursued, Europe must not be constructed in a way that is to the detriment of safety standards and standards of professional qualification.
From the comfort of their ivory tower, our European leaders are, once again, going to have to try and come up with something better, or else shelve their proposal.
Â Â  . I find it utterly incomprehensible how the European Commission, scarcely a year after the failure of its first proposal for a directive on market access for port services just before the end of its term of office on 13 October 2004, can put forward a new proposal for a directive that not only contains drastically more stringent provisions but also retains the same core rules that were the downfall of its predecessor.
I believe that the proposed directive represents a departure from the hitherto accepted model for European competition policy, which was about ensuring workable competition, and according to which regulatory interventions in a market or in individual market segments can be justified only if structural market conditions or attempts by participants in the market to restrict competition are interfering with economic efficiency.
I am relieved at the outcome that has resulted from this debate, as also at the evident effect of the extensive protests (although I do of course condemn most forcefully the outrages perpetrated in Strasbourg), for the proposed directive constitutes an intervention in competition for loading services in ports, although no action is required on the basis of the marketâs structure, the way it operates or the results obtained from it.
Â Â  . I voted to reject the Port Services Directive as I believe that Member States should regulate the internal workings of their own ports, provided that they are in line with European competition and state aid laws.
Â Â  The tidal wave of ultraliberalism and unbridled free trade had, for 20 years, been breaking destructively over our coalmines and steelworks and over those industries of ours whose products included textiles, leather, machine tools, electrical goods and motor vehicles. It laid waste our fishing ports, our farms - including our sheep, cattle and poultry farms - our vineyards in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, our banana plantations in the West Indies and our plantations in RÃ©union, leaving women and men, including our countriesâ workers of both sexes, suddenly without social protection.
When the wave finally came to grief, it was in its encounter with the will of the French people, expressed in the referendum of 29Â May 2005.
The people do not want to see our forms of social protection dismantled any further. Nor do they want any longer to see preference given to the base exploitation of foreign âworkersâ by the Bolkestein directive and its younger sister, the Directive on Port Services.
This Wednesday, 18Â January 2006, the Front Nationalâs MEPs have secured a parliamentary majority for refusing, for the second time, to allow European dockworkers, port pilots or any of our personnel responsible for stowage and other dock work to be sacrificed in Europe for the sole benefit of the multinationals that hold sway over maritime freight.
Â Â  . With regard to the Commission text on the table, I share the concerns of many Irish stakeholders who made submissions to the Irish government, and which are also shared by many fellow Member States.
The principal concern is that the Commission is proposing legal requirements which could adversely impact on the essential commercial and trading remit of the major ports covered by the proposed directive.
Therefore, the workability of the Commission proposal for mandatory licensing of all internal port activities is questionable.
As regards Irish seaports, governmental research (Sea Ports High Level Review) has shown there to be strong competition in the market for services internal to ports.
Indeed, the landlord model is working to great effect in major ports where it is the common standard that internal services are provided on a competitive basis, with no single dominant operator.
This has been important in facilitating private sector involvement in port service provision.
The research also highlighted high levels of competition on and between Irish Sea routes.
As an island, enhanced competition between ports is also vital, but future attempts at achieving European port policy must have the support of the port sector.
Â Â  â I voted against the report on the liberalisation of port services because, instead of strengthening the transparency of investments and state aid, it focuses on strengthening competition between European ports.
Through a system of invitations to tender, private companies will be able to use their own crews in ports, while permanent dockworkers will lose their jobs.
The âself-handlingâ proposal is absolutely unacceptable.
There is already sufficient competition in our ports which, it should be noted, are also among the cheapest in the world.
Further price reductions and increased competition will have negative consequences both on safety measures and on environmental protection.
Â Â  . I voted against the report because there are provisions which affect the commercial activities of ports in a detrimental fashion and which also affect the health and safety issues of workers at ports.
I am not satisfied that these issues have been dealt with.
Â Â  . This package has been roundly rejected by ports, unions and other bodies across Scotland.
As a maritime nation we already have efficient port services and the competition model the Commission seeks to create in this package is not suitable to Scotland's needs nor, I believe, to those of Europe as a whole.
The protests we saw at the beginning of this week were marred by the disgraceful violence of a minority, but the irony is that they were protesting in front of the one EU institution which supports their cause.
I am glad that we have today sent the Commission home to think again, and hope that the Commission will now accept our view on this matter.
Â Â  I voted in favour of referring the document back to Parliamentâs Committee on Transport and Tourism. This would have enabled more thought to be given to the document, with new amendments being added, have permitted a variety of professionals (shipowners, pilots, boatmen, towage workers and dockworkers) to be consulted again and have allowed the European Commission to be asked to withdraw the text, and all this in an atmosphere of calm.
I voted against rejecting the proposal for a directive, firstly because the proposal, with its proposed amendments, would have constituted a sound basis for Parliamentâs work, this being only the first reading.
Many professionals want to see a regulatory framework, and we need European rules in the interests of fair competition and in order to favour investment in ports and establish legal certainty in this sector.
Nor did I want to echo the position of the Left which, in rejecting the text, has caused amendments to be rejected which would have provided guarantees in terms of maritime safety, training and social standards.
Finally, I refuse to yield to the pressure exercised by the dockworkers, whose demonstration on Monday was unacceptable, involving, as it did, injuries to at least 12 people and damage to the tune of EURÂ 300Â 000 in Strasbourg.
I genuinely regret that it can today be said that MEPs gave in, faced with the dockworkers.
Â Â  , . I have voted in favour of rejecting the directive because we had only been given the option of voting for or against the original Commission proposal.
This proposal for a new Port Directive leaves a great deal to be desired in many areas.
Although Mr Jarzembowski had produced a substantial and sound package of amendment proposals, there was insufficient support for them.
As we have no choice but to carry on with the discussion on a European port policy in the broad sense of the word, I have urged the Commissioner to come up with a discussion document that we â it is to be hoped â get our teeth into.
Â Â  Mr President, I was with the delegation that went to the Afghan elections in September, and even then we were saying that the large amounts of money that the European Union, among others, was investing in development cooperation in Afghanistan meant that a special parliamentary delegation would be necessary, and I think it extremely important that we have, by our resolution today, provided for one.
One of the tasks that I believe this group of Members will have will be to monitor the European Unionâs political objectives in Afghanistan, above all else developments in the field of human rights and womenâs rights.
Â Â  We support Afghanistanâs development towards peace, stability and democracy following the fall of the Taliban regime.
However, we view the EUâs ever more prominent military role in the country with concern.
Afghanistan is not in the immediate vicinity of the EU.
Nor, therefore, is it the EUâs task to station troops there.
Rather, that is the task of individual countries or defence organisations acting on a mandate from the United Nations, which should be given a better basis for taking military action in trouble spots around the world.
In view of the above, we are abstaining from voting in the final vote on the resolution, but we support the proposals concerning the protection of human rights.
Â Â  . The most shocking thing about this Houseâs Joint Resolution on Afghanistan is that it contains not one word of criticism of the Westâs military operations.
Instead, it endorses the NATO âInternational Security Assistance Forceâ (ISAF) operation and the so-called âwar on terrorâ in the shape of âOperation Enduring Freedomâ (OEF).
It is far from enough that the Greens should call merely for the separation of ISAF and OEFâs command structures, for, in their operations on the ground, ISAF and OEF are inseparable.
The extension of ISAFâs mission into southern Afghanistan, into what is more evidently a war zone, with the consequent deeper involvement in the war, will make matters worse.
The substantial European troop presence in Afghanistan will have the effect of relieving the pressure on the US troops and hence on the occupying forces in Iraq.
It is also necessary to close down the military bases that make an armed presence in Afghanistan possible in the first place, especially the German military base at Termez in Uzbekistan, through which pass all the troops sent to be stationed in Afghanistan.
What makes the collaboration with Uzbekistan such a scandal is the fact that the country is under the rule of an authoritarian regime, one that, in particular, bears responsibility for the Andijan massacre.
The closure of the forces bases in Afghanistan is also long overdue by reason of the latest offence against international law, the bombing of a village in Pakistan by CIA units.
Â Â  . The purpose of this explanation of vote is to say that I share Parliamentâs satisfaction, in broad terms, with the process of democratisation in recent years.
Long gone are the days of the Taliban regime, with its horrific abuses and its breaches of the most basic rules and principles of human rights.
Much remains to be done, but todayâs Afghanistan is, most assuredly, a better place than it has been for a number of decades.
This expression of satisfaction must not cover over two points.
On the one hand, as previous speakers have mentioned, there is a great deal still to be done at various levels in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the international community, and not least the EU and its Member States, must continue to provide practical support, both material and human, aware as we are that this is a time-consuming, yet, as we have seen, encouraging process.
Â Â  . We have abstained in the final vote on the Afghanistan resolution.
We were against the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan and we demand the withdrawal of the United States-led coalition forces.
We believe that the ISAF forces should be formed by countries which have not been involved in the United States coalition forces, and mainly formed by Muslim countries, in order to facilitate communication with and understanding of the Afghan people.
The ISAF peacekeeping forces should be under the direct command of the United Nations, independent of NATO.
But in the resolution we also note several important points on the need to develop democracy, the living standards of the people and gender equality, as well as the need for a stronger regime of development aid to Afghanistan.
The conclusion for us is therefore to abstain in the final vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I am absolutely opposed to discrimination against homosexuals.
I nevertheless regret that the reportâs title was so completely unsatisfactory and that on some points it was necessary to abstain.
If we are to speak here about a real problem, that of discrimination, why on earth use a word like homophobia, which is a totally inappropriate word used in psychology?
Phobias are different kinds of anxieties.
They are fears which are considered to be neurotic disorders.
Therapy is needed to help them: they cannot be treated through political control, no more than claustrophobia or arachnophobia can.
Real phobias often develop as a result of something that happened in childhood, and there may be a very good reason for them.
I am worried that if we start putting people on trial here for their feelings or phobias, it will only result in one new form of discrimination and manipulation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I deplore the methods used to arrive at the drafting of the joint resolution.
I consider it unacceptable that the talks were shamefully held in private, without the involvement of the group that I represent.
I am well aware, of course, that all the political groups are equal, but evidently some are more âequalâ than others.
My group firmly believes that there should be no room in a democracy for injustices or discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion.
I have, however, felt it necessary to reject a resolution that is not mine and which, above all, contains paragraphs that in my view are inconsistent with the purpose of the document itself.
I read that homosexuals should be fully recognised as victims of the Nazi regime: of course they were!
Does that mean, however, that other persecutions were perhaps less serious?
Are we forgetting the cruelty they suffered under Communist regimes, and under others too?
Given that the freedom to express oneâs own sexuality has to be guaranteed, I believe that it should always be exercised with respect for the values and principles that set our society apart.
The family has always meant a father and a mother, a man and a woman, and I do not believe that the European Union, by promoting campaigns against hypothetical discrimination, can give itself the right to ride roughshod over national governments just to endorse the wishes of certain not exactly worthy lobbying groups.
The European Union cannot act on matters of values, culture and the family as if it were dealing with the single market, asking the Member States to legalise homosexual unions for the sake of uniformity and a misplaced duty to protect peopleâs rights; instead, it would be running the risk of undermining the system of values that lies at the heart of our age-old society.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the resolution, and on this subject I have to agree with Minister Tremaglia, who once said that âpoofsâ, or at least those who support them, are in the majority in Europe.
Nevertheless, all lovers of political correctness â and I am proud not to be one of them â should also think about linguistic correctness: âhomophobiaâ is the opposite of âxenophobiaâ.
The European Parliament does not accept xenophobes and it does not accept homophobes: what, then, should a person be?
Â Â  I voted against the motion for a resolution on homophobia in Europe because I think it reductionist to treat the fight against homophobia as being, principally, a fight against forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation.
This confusion between homophobia, the definition of which is âfear of what is the sameâ, and an aversion to homosexuality is a source of misunderstandings.
Setting aside issues relating to marriage and children, in relation to which political reflection and the demands of society deserve parallel periods in which to come to fruition, I am naturally in favour of combating all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation, but I consider that, on the one hand, the issue of human beings being treated unequally and, on the other, fear of people similar to ourselves deserve better than this resolution.
Â Â  . Whilst the Dutch delegation within the Independence and Democracy Group will support the resolution on homophobia tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, it will not support those tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, or, indeed, the common draft resolution on homophobia in the European Union.
The Dutch delegation is able to endorse the resolution by the UEN Group, because only in that resolution is it clearly stated that policy measures in the area of discrimination fall within the remit of the Member States.
The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here.
Furthermore, we would like to say that we condemn the incitement of hatred against homosexuals and violence inflicted on people on the basis of their sexual orientation.
We believe that the enactment of policies intended to prevent discrimination on the grounds of religion, race or sexual orientation is a matter for the Member States.
The resolutions of the different groups overlook this principle by directing their attention to the political situation in a number of Member States.
Â Â  â European countries seem to be victims of an infectious homophobia that is cause for concern.
It is a homophobia all the more shocking because people no longer appear to have any hang-ups about it and because it is everywhere rife, expressed in verbal or physical violence, the persistence of discrimination and the introduction of new legislation (for example, the Latvian Parliament has tabled an amendment to the Latvian Constitution to prohibit marriages between persons of the same sex).
Whether in disguise or taken for granted, homophobia has no place in the European Union.
Non-discrimination is guaranteed in the texts (the Treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights).
It ought to be so in actual practice.
Moreover, it is very much to the credit of this European Parliament always to have been in the vanguard of this fight.
It has committed itself to promoting peopleâs rights and lessening discrimination (February 1994, September 1996, July 2001 and June 2005).
It must do so again today.
That is the ambition behind this resolution, which is unambiguous in condemning discrimination in all its forms.
It relies on the will to bring about change, demanding that the arsenal of anti-discrimination measures be supplemented on the basis of ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty and that a communication be issued on the obstacles to the freedom of movement of homosexual couples whose partnerships are legally recognised in the EU.
It is a clear and necessary political signal.
I shall vote in favour of it with determination and conviction.
Â Â  . I welcome today's vote on this issue, and especially Parliament's overwhelming commitment to treating same-sex partners with equality of respect.
I very muchÂ regret Parliament's unwillingness to say what is going onÂ within our own Member States.
We knowÂ that what Parliament says and does affects public perceptions.
Recent events and statements inÂ Poland and parliamentaryÂ debates in Latvia andÂ Lithuania have been shameful in my view.
Some of the debates have amounted to hate speak.
This sort of behaviour runs counter to Council of Europe Conventions and EU Treaties, so the EuropeanÂ Parliament should be brave enough to speak out and confront this.
Â Â  . I share the concern expressed in this motion for a resolution, in common with others previously discussed here in Parliament, with specific regard to a number of principles with which I identify and which I advocate.
All forms of hate should be rejected; all forms of discrimination by the law should be combated.
In this resolution, however, there is a range of proposals which I believe go beyond what I feel should be Parliamentâs scope and which, to my mind, impinge upon what should be the scope of individual countries.
There is a trend among certain political groups, with which I have no truck whatsoever, to try to adopt what has been rejected in their home Member States in the EUâs institutions.
I object to this.
Lastly, I should like to point out that phobias, as the manifestation of behavioural problems, cannot be combated in legislation nor at parliamentary level.
Â Â  . We are all opposed to all forms of discrimination and violence.
Unequivocally, there can be no exception to respect that is due.
That being said, the free and democratic debate taking place in Member States on their own civil legislation, on laws relating to the family or regarding personal status, must not be confused with âhomophobiaâ.
This would be tantamount to creating an atmosphere of undue intellectual pressure and restriction, totally at variance with an open democratic society.
Opposing views must not be confused with âhomophobiaâ.
It is wrong to foster or invent feelings of hate and intolerance.
To classify differences as âphobiasâ is in itself an example of extremism.
Much of this resolution does not in fact tally with the definition of âhomophobiaâ as it appears in Recital A, which means that it loses all relevance and meaning.
Furthermore, there are several parts that run counter to the principle of subsidiarity, a guiding principle and cornerstone of the entire Union, which would only serve to undermine the European project.
This is why I voted against.
Â Â  Homophobia means âfear of those who resemble usâ.
There is nothing pejorative or malicious about the term. A phobia is a neurosis characterised by extreme anxiety in the presence of the source of distress, and it requires suitable treatment in the form of deconditioning, analysis and the use of drugs.
I voted against this resolution, which does not deal with homophobia.
Any form of violence against anyone is to be condemned.
There are no different categories of citizens.
The right to life, liberty and security, together with respect for human dignity, apply to all human beings.
These rights are guaranteed under law.
The right to respect for private and family life and to freedom of thought, conscience and religion are fundamental rights protected by the international treaties.
The Member States must respect the right to marriage, which stipulates that, as from marriageable age, a man and a woman are entitled to marry and to start a family in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of this right.
The European Union has no competence in these areas and cannot judge the constitutions and national laws of its Member States which, having all signed the European Convention on Human Rights, are accountable in the matter of such rights to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, I was one of those involved in drafting the resolution on climate and who attended the Montreal Summit.
I cannot consider the result achieved at the Montreal Summit to be anywhere near as favourable as we, in the name of political correctness, now feel obliged to say it was here.
Only one quarter of all emissions will be covered by the obligations to cut them, and I therefore think it is somewhat intellectually dishonest to speak of achievements.
Sooner or later the EU will have to end all this sweet talk and face facts.
If three quarters of the worldâs producers of greenhouse gases are allowed to continue to increase their emissions, it will be time for us to say that this solution has failed and to start to take some other form of political action on climate.
Will it be a matter of political pride, however, if we are unable to admit such a thing?
Â Â  . We broadly welcome the resolution tabled as a follow-up to the 11th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Montreal, as it underlines the desire of the parties to honour the Kyoto Protocol and regrets the continued reluctance of the US administration to join any significant partnership on climate change.
We are opposed to some points in the final resolution and regret that our proposals were not adopted.
We were especially disappointed at the rejection of the proposal to which we put our name calling for an urgent review of the relevant flexible mechanisms before the Community emission trading scheme can be extended to other areas, such as aviation.
We believe that this extension must undergo an analysis demonstrating that it will help to combat climate change and that there will not be any bias in favour of wealthier countries and regions over developing countries and industries.
We also object to the emphasis on the trade in rights to pollute, even in respect of an assessment.
Â Â  Global climate change constitutes a significant problem that there are good reasons for dealing with at international level.
The June List would, however, reiterate the position it put forward earlier, namely that the European Parliament should not take over the Member Statesâ foreign policies by calling on third countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so.
Individual national governments can make appeals of this type independently.
We also believe that the Member States should be able to adopt their own positions in connection with negotiations on international climate issues.
We presume, however, that agreements entered into will be observed by all the parties.
We are critical of the proposal to set up a communication strategy at EU level to inform people about climate issues.
EU cooperation is based on the Member States having confidence in one another.
We are convinced that individual Member States can successfully take the measures required for giving the general public access to appropriate information on climate issues.
The position we are expressing through this explanation of vote constitutes the attitude we adopt on principle regarding this issue.
The explanation of vote thus applies to future matters of a similar kind.
Â Â  . The Cree Indians have a saying to the effect that it is only when the last tree has been uprooted, the last river poisoned, and the last fish caught, that man will discover that he cannot eat money.
It could well soon come true.
For all too long have we heedlessly tampered with natureâs delicate framework.
Only now have we started to give more attention to the protection of the environment and set in motion the first and vital joint projects aimed at saving it.
We will, though, have to redouble our efforts.
The fact is that we are slowly but surely turning our backs on the Gulf Stream, our natural source of heating, and, every day, as we do so, ocean currents altered by global warming are robbing us of some 86 million tonnes of arable soil, some 225Â 000 more human beings are being born, and desertification proceeds at a headlong and ever-faster rate.
Europe is threatened by the most devastating change in its climate for a good 5Â 000 years.
With ice melting to the north of it, and deserts spreading out to the south, with, at the same time, enormous âreservesâ of carbon dioxide accumulating in the permafrost and the tundra, things will become pretty uncongenial in the foreseeable future.
Various experts have worked out an immense range of possible solutions, which languish in their desk drawers; the time has come for us to give our closer attention to them and to their implementation, and, at long last, to work together towards a common goal.
Â Â  The June Movement has voted in favour of paragraph 45 of the report on the environmental aspects of sustainable development, but wants minimal directives to be used in introducing ecotaxes at Community level so that more far-reaching requirements might be laid down in the individual Member States.
Paragraph 45:
âSupports the introduction of ecotaxes at Community level; stresses that, like the other market instruments, they are an essential tool for an effective pollution reduction policy; calls on the Commission to make proposals and the Member States to adopt the first European ecotax by 2009 at the latest;â
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report before us, which seeks to assess the environmental aspects of sustainable development and offers some criticisms of the Commissionâs position, with regard to the inadequacy of certain directives and the scarcity of financial resources.
Although it does not specifically tackle the policies that lie at the root of environmental problems, such as the emphasis on competitiveness at the expense of people and the environment, with the profit motive always to the fore, there are positive points, such as the promotion of less polluting forms of transport, the role of territorial and forestry planning and the need to ensure food supplies.
We also welcome the connection that it makes between poverty and the environment, although it is appalling that the most important aspects in this field, namely that liberalisation is not the answer to poverty and social exclusion, were rejected in plenary.
The criticisms of the inadequacy of the proposals in the fight against poverty, social exclusion and increasing inequality were similarly rejected.
Â Â  This report deals with a list of significant issues within the area of sustainable development.
The June List believes that there are good reasons for EU cooperation on cross-border environmental issues.
However, the report addresses a number of crucial political areas that should lie outside the EUâs competence.
The following are examples:
â the investment to be made in public transport or, as the case may be, the development of road networks in the Member States;
â debt cancellation for developing countries;
â environmental taxes at EU level;
â the inclusion or otherwise of environmental education as a subject on the curricula of primary schools in the Member States;
â tax on labour in the Member States;
â employment and social integration.
We are very critical of the fact that the EU institutions have a voracious appetite for increased influence.
We have thus chosen to vote against the report as a whole but are well disposed towards individual paragraphs, mainly those dealing with genuinely cross-border environmental problems.
Â Â  . Sustainable development is unquestionably one of the EUâs key objectives and a global challenge.
Accordingly, sustainable development strategies require a long term political vision at the highest level.
We must address social, environmental and democratic challenges responsibly, not only at public authority level, but also at the level of the citizens.
We ensure, however, that all of the measures to be taken tally with our objectives of social and economic growth and development, which are crucial to the future of our societies.
This report examines the progress made since 2001 and sets out fresh measures.
As part of the process, we must reiterate the need to ensure that sustainable development is a priority for the future of Europe, and retain our objective of meeting the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report.
Â Â  . Sustainable development must take higher prominence across all of our policy areas, and I am glad that this report provides a starting point on how to achieve this and am glad to support it.
In my own country, Scotland, we have a unique contribution to make in terms of renewable energy, with our vast natural potential offering us the opportunity to become Europe's green powerhouse.
But this potential will not be developed without strong encouragement from government at all levels, and we must redouble our efforts to take the ideas in this report and build upon them.
Â Â  The Spanish Socialist Delegation is pleased with the approval of this own-initiative report, which is intended to improve the prospects for achieving genuine sustainable development.
Nevertheless, I would like to point out that, in the second part of Amendment 2 (paragraph 15), we have decided to vote against because we believe that the water protection and management policy must be based on criteria of rationality, efficacy and efficiency and not solely on the adoption of measures to reduce water abstraction, since that could have negative consequences of a different nature.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Johannes Voggenhuber and Andrew Duff, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the period of reflection: the structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union (2005/2146(INI)) (A6-0414/2005).
Â Â  Mr President, this is Parliamentâs first response to the crisis created by France and the Netherlands in rejecting the Constitution.
It is a chance for us to reflect on what will be lost, especially for Parliament, should we be incapable of salvaging the project and bringing it to a successful conclusion.
It is a chance for us to respond to the cacophony of sounds emerging from the ranks of the Council â some simplistic, some in breach of the Treaty, some improbable politically.
It is a chance for us to encourage the Commission to be more forthright and incisive to assist us in finding a way forward out of the crisis.
It is a chance for Parliament to fill some political space and to bring a focus to the period of reflection.
We know that we cannot achieve all this by ourselves but must have the close collaboration of national parliaments.
I must say that I find it fairly curious in this context that the Presidents of the Austrian, Finnish and German Parliaments seem somewhat reluctant to cooperate with us.
It is up to the parliaments to decide whether or not they turn up.
Those who choose to turn up will have a decisive say in fashioning the decisions about the future of Europe.
The proposals, which received strong support from the committee, set out a parliamentary process.
We seek to establish a series of parliamentary forums to debate some fundamental â perhaps even primitive â questions about the nature and purpose of Europe.
We want to have the debate about the reform of common policies that the first Convention was in some part frustrated in being denied.
This policy debate can and should be radical, but it must take place within the constitutional context and be closely related to issues of competences, to instruments and to procedures.
The first of these forums will take place on 9Â May and will address its conclusions to the European Council, which is to take some first decisions about the furtherance of the project.
We would like to draw the period of reflection to a close at the end of 2007 with a firm, clear decision on what to do with the Treaty.
As the resolution states, there are, in theory, several scenarios we could follow, but in practice there are only two.
The first is to supplement the present Treaty with interpretative protocols or declarations.
The second is to make rather more substantive changes to Part III so that we address the legitimate concerns and disquiet expressed by citizens in France and the Netherlands and in some other Member States.
Between and inside the groups there is certainly controversy about the appropriate way to express ourselves.
However, on the essentials of salvaging the Treaty, we are strongly united and I commend the resolution to Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today sees us presenting the report on the period of reflection on the European Union, from which, after many months of debate, and endorsed by the overwhelming majority on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, emerged a road map showing a way out of the constitutional crisis.
Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this.
From him I learned that the future â by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours â can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him.
If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well.
Of course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Councilâs magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis.
At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, âWe are not uniting states; we are uniting peopleâ.
That is what todayâs argument is about.
Are we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door?
Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19thÂ century, those primal misfortunes from Pandoraâs box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace.
That is what this dispute is about.
Before we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches.
They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance.
To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding ânoâ.
The Constitution is not dead, for peopleâs need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible.
The crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which peopleâs expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course.
It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls.
This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course.
What we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elitesâ project and turning it into a , a popular cause.
I hope that this House â if it adopts this report â will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it.
We did not envisage that this debate should be without form.
We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europeâs role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues â and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective.
Perhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies.
What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum.
My hope is that, aided by the Commissionâs level-headedness and this Houseâs courage, this further step may be taken.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy to me to be speaking today in your plenary and meeting you, both of these things for the first time.
I am particularly glad that the mandatory dialogue between the institutions has reached a topic that is particularly demanding of cooperation.
As both the rapporteurs have already said, it is true to say that 2005 was a difficult year; Mr Voggenhuber went so far as to use the word âcrisisâ.
We are indeed going through a crisis of confidence where the European public are concerned.
We must answer those questions that they have every right to ask of us.
I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity, of which all of us together â the Commission, Parliament and the Council â must make use.
It is at this point that I would like to extend most especial thanks to your House, for you were wrestling with this issue at a time when the governments were not yet willing to make a serious start on debate.
The Duff/Voggenhuber report has been the occasion, in this House, for a debate that will help us to move on.
The Austrian Presidency has, from its very first day, endeavoured to engage in this debate, to carry it further and develop it.
You will all have been able, as you followed it, to note how very vigorous it has been from the very outset, with the whole spectrum of opinions being given voice, and the report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee reflects that.
One thing that does come across clearly is that there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens.
Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term.
Our belief that this debate must be a wide-ranging one reflects the view expressed in your report, which we are debating today.
What we need is not just a debate about the constitutional treaty or the legal dimension, but a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want, where we want to go, where Europeâs borders are, and how we can address the European publicâs fears and worries.
We, in the Council, want not only to continue with this debate, but also to conduct it in greater depth.
We have planned a series of events at which we want to have broad-based discussions with the European public.
Only yesterday, we were discussing with the Commission and with your House the methods and strategies whereby we might communicate this Europe of ours and what it stands for to the public and by what means, in what discussion forums and in what depth we might best meet the expectations that people have of Europe.
As the President of the Council said today, we do intend, at the same time as we kick off the debate, to consider the issue of European identity.
On the 250th anniversary of Mozartâs birth, in Salzburg, we intend to address the question of âWhat is Europe, what is the European identity?â
Right through to the end of the Austrian Presidency, there will be a whole series of other events, for the debate on Europeâs future is a many-sided one, and it is only when all of its sides are lit that all the dimensions with which we have to do become apparent.
Important though this public debate is, there will also have to be practical work done in order that it may be clearer to us which way we should go, and it will have to be done by the governments of the Member States.
The Council Presidencyâs most important task is to get all the Member States on board, for it is only together that we will be able to move forward.
As the Chancellor has already said, what we want to achieve is to be able, at the end of our Presidency, to produce a sketch of the way ahead and to agree on how we can best cooperate in achieving our common goals.
I hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe, and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006.
From the Constitutional point of view, I believe it can only be better than last year.
I hope, as the person responsible both for Constitutional issues and for interinstitutional affairs, that we can continue our fruitful, effective and close cooperation.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs for this report on the period of reflection and the motion for a resolution.
I have already discussed it on several occasions with the two Members of the European Parliament who were members of the European Convention.
I would like to underline the considerable progress made since the initial considerations and congratulate the co-rapporteurs for the job they have done and also for their ability to take on board the many views expressed during the intense discussions in committee.
I will limit my remarks to four points.
The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective.
The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch ânoâ votes.
I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution.
During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate.
If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value.
I also took note of your favourite option.
Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures.
Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizensâ support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%.
Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text.
That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it.
It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe.
That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizensâ concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security.
Secondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States.
What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some.
The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process.
We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States.
My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States.
You can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework.
Thirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency.
The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it.
It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency.
In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences.
This synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken.
This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States.
Fourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution.
The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect.
Respect for those who said ânoâ and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance.
Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance.
We should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each countryâs democratic traditions.
All of us play important, but different, roles.
In conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities.
European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe.
This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work.
We have to combine this process with creating legitimacy for our institutions by delivering the political results that European citizens want, so we have to consider their daily concerns as well as the constitutional issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, largely because of the national parliaments, which constituted the largest group in the Convention, it and the Intergovernmental Conference gave the draft constitutional treaty a balanced reception, with fourteen countries ratifying it, two of them by means of a referendum, while two did not.
This failure, which had to do not only with national issues but also with the mood in Europe as a whole, represents a failure on the part of national politics, but also of European politics, in that we have not succeeded in justifying Europe.
We have to take the publicâs concerns seriously, not least in France and in the Netherlands; we cannot simply disregard them, but should spell out why we need this sort of Europe.
That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people.
It has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want.
They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it.
It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity.
Citizensâ rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this.
This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection.
It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that.
That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I andÂ II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a âroad mapâ and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives.
We should now concentrate on dialogue, assess the reflection period, and put forward our proposals in 2007.
It follows from this that we cannot take action right now, as Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber propose; that would be premature and does not reflect what the public wants.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very grateful to both the rapporteurs for their report.
I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions.
Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted?
I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House.
I refer, of course, to the issue of energy.
It was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy; I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject.
The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy.
This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost.
I see this as the road down which we must go.
I could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time.
There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues.
What we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress.
I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution.
That is absolutely vital.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as somebody brilliantly put it, for fifty years the European project has been a football match played behind closed doors.
With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch.
Todayâs crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do.
Reinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be.
The question is, however, accountability for what?
We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction.
No Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the âDâ for âdebateâ, âdialogueâ and âdemocracyâ, it does not also include âDâ for âdeliveryâ. Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be.
That is why even self-inflicted failures, like todayâs refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous.
There are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure â transport is one example.
There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level.
In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be.
Today it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War.
What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium.
We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow, but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today, or we would risk invalidating all our reflection, no matter how clever it might be.
Â Â  . â I am a proud member of the Independence and Democracy Group, which has been portrayed none too accurately as Eurosceptic.
It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution.
I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue.
The principle of â let the other side be heard â is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue.
My views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless.
The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions.
This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible.
Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber.
I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form.
It is naÃ¯ve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation.
Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point.
Our Committeeâs report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today.
Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be.
It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009. This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States.
If we are to prescribe the outcome of dialogue in advance, if we reduce dialogue to the level of a stage-managed performance involving unrepresentative bodies, if we continue to spend money in such a way that only the most gratifying opinions are heard, the EU will never have any chance of developing effective structures.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on the even-handedness of their report, and that I am very glad to be able, today, to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on it.
This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitutionâs incorporation of codecision â which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam â in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed.
Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy.
Although the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements.
The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose.
They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them.
This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present.
Since the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EUâs Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision â which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food.
Â Â  . Mr President, on this occasion I really am speaking from the heart when I say that both rapporteurs are to be congratulated, not only on the report that is now before us, but also on their sustained commitment to the idea of a constitution, even at times when there was little support for it.
I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past.
I have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committeeâs opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee.
The Legal Affairs Committeeâs particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution.
In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect.
While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidencyâs critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all.
We have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution.
Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable.
We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III.
I will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments.
The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, on 28Â November 2005, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the opinion I had prepared for it by a large majority.
What does this opinion say?
First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties.
The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe.
I am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, MrÂ Duff and MrÂ Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda.
Firstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy.
Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended.
The definitive strengthening of Parliamentâs role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote.
Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter.
There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental.
Forgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security.
Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document.
Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?
Finally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26Â May 2005.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr Winkler, Commissioner. Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now.
Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic.
The future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women.
As MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions.
Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to.
Uncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution.
Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards.
Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States.
The governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them.
A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion.
Mr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters.
They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions.
The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate.
Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to make three points.
First, it is nice to start talking about the Constitution again.
The budget is out of the way; we can start focusing on other things.
To me, it seems as if the Constitution has been in intensive care for the past eight or nine months.
Now it has been slowly taken out and I think the process of recovery will be slow, but I think we should be looking at 2009.
I think the message of this report is that all options are open; easy does it; let us not say that the Constitution is dead; let us not start renegotiating; let us not say that this Treaty cannot enter into force.
We have time and we have to think about it.
The second point is that recently there has been some controversy between the European Parliament and the speakers of three national parliaments.
We need to turn that into a positive.
The European Parliament should not, and must not, be arrogant or paternal towards the national parliaments.
Yes, let us have a European forum, but let us do it together and have a real debate about the future of the Union.
My final point is that from some sections in the past few months we have heard talk about âcore Europeâ.
I think that talk is absolute and utter rubbish, because the people we hear it from are usually the people who want to put the brakes on integration.
Let us start by ratifying the Constitution; let us get the ball rolling, let us work together and, most importantly, let us work together within the institutions of the European Union.
I cringe at any talk about âcore Europeâ outside.
The best way forward is to do it inside the Treaty, do it together, and I am sure we can overcome this and have a Constitution by 2009.
Â Â  . Mr President, just one year ago this Parliament endorsed the Constitution by an overwhelming majority.
Now there are at least two views within that majority.
One view is to say that this text of the Constitution is dead following the referendum defeats in France and the Netherlands; that we had better start thinking of something else and preparing a different way forward.
The other view is to say: wait a minute, this text has actually now been ratified by a majority of Member States.
The heads of government themselves in the European Council did not declare it dead, they extended the period of ratification and opened a period of reflection.
In that period of reflection we must listen to those who said ânoâ, but we must also listen to the majority who have said âyesâ and find a way forward that can ultimately bring the two together.
This report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints.
It says that it is too soon to conclude now; the period of reflection must be extended at least until 2007.
Until then we need to keep all options open.
We need longer and deeper reflection.
Of course â as is to be expected â we say that this Parliament would prefer to maintain the text, but we recognise that that would only be possible if measures were taken to reassure and convince public opinion.
What those measures are is left open.
There are, in theory, many options: supplementary interpretative declarations, extra protocols, rewriting part of the text, rewriting the whole text, starting a new text.
That we will conclude at the end of the period of reflection, but for now let us keep on with that reflection, deepen it, broaden it and reach conclusions in a yearâs time.
One thing is certain, Mr President: the status quo â that is, the current Treaties â is not sufficient for this Union in its enlarged form to function effectively or democratically.
This issue will not go away.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Liberal Democrats in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe warmly welcome the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the period of reflection.
We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework.
We considered the Constitutional Treaty to be an efficient tool for moving the EU forward and for giving it the political dimension and social perspective that are both necessary.
We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life. Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead.
Nor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society.
This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution.
It is a serious problem.
Jean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed.
That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection.
The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise.
It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda.
It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe.
We must not decide just yet on the future of the document.
That time will come after the period of reflection, after the European debate and after having changed the context.
The report presented to us states this very well.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Duff-Voggenhuber report.
The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice.
The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and â all right, yes, we must say it openly â to steer it as well.
Two things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House.
In fact, MrÂ Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted âyesâ to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it.
It is not like that.
The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility â not a theoretical one, but a practical one â might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum.

To think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes.
I therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options.
Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the period of reflection decreed by the European Council following the victory of the 'no' camp in France and the Netherlands has achieved its first result: it has improved people's manners.
For example, the two co-rapporteurs of the resolution we are now debating did not consider it appropriate this time to describe the majority of the electorate in France and the Netherlands with the unkind epithets that some levelled at them a few months ago.
I would therefore like to thank MrÂ Voggenhuber and MrÂ Duff for emphasising here, at least in their resolution, that the citizens have in fact, and I quote, 'expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account', and that we need to respect their decision and 'to analyse carefully the reasons for the negative results'.
That is a step forward.
This would be even clearer if the report stated that the draft treaty is now dead and that the debate now centres on what should replace it.
My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens.
As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence.
The question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate?
How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty?
That is where the problem lies.
The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure âŠ public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case âŠ the Constitution enters into force during 2009'.
In that case, it is no longer a debate, but a communication campaign.
It would be a shame if we followed that route.
It would be a missed opportunity.
That is why my group, almost without exception, will not go down that path.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to ask the ostrich majority in this House: have you not heard that 55% of French voters voted ânoâ, against the advice of 90% of their deputies and senators?
Have you not seen that 62% of Dutch voters did not follow the advice of the 80% in the national parliament?
Have you not read the Treaties calling for unanimity in Treaty changes?
Why break your own rules?
You seem to have both eyes and ears.
Use them!
The proposed Constitution is dead!
Still you urge national parliaments to break the law.
You continue to propagate the text.
On the outside of this building you still proclaim âyesâ to the Constitution.
Could you imagine a national parliament praising Labour policies and condemning Conservative ones on the front of the parliament building itself?
No, you could not, could you?
You still use taxpayersâ money to distribute millions of brochures propagating what was rejected.
You started ratification of a text which had not yet been properly translated.
You refused to publish a reader-friendly edition of the Constitution, because you wanted the text approved without being read.
You manipulated the time schedule for holding referendums and hoped to drive the UK into a corner after 24Â ratifications.
But, dear colleagues, you lost, as I have done several times.
Now it is your turn to follow the verdict of the voters.
Instead, you finance further propaganda: EURÂ 300Â 000 to the European Movement; EURÂ 110Â 000 to the European Federalists; millions of euros to those in favour of the Constitution.
We demand a free, fair and open debate with equal representation of the âyesâ and ânoâ sides.
Shame on those of you who will vote for overruling the Dutch and French voters!
The SOS Democracy Intergroup has started a minority report.
We reject the idea of a state constitution, ask for the existing Treaties to be reviewed and for a cooperation agreement to be established instead.
A new agreement could be drafted by a directly elected convention and put to referendums in all the Member States, perhaps at the same time as the next European elections.
Then we would know the verdict of the citizens.
The French voters have not regretted their ânoâ; many Dutch voters have changed their minds, but they were the ones who voted âyesâ.
Listen to the voters, let us make a fresh start.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work and what they have tried to achieve with this report.
Secondly, and most importantly of all, I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having the political courage to take this issue out of the esoteric area and put it back on the political agenda.
One of the most important issues we have to look at â and it follows on from what MrÂ Bonde has just been saying â is: when is a ânoâ really a ânoâ?
When is it that one country can stop every other country from moving forward?
When is it that two countries can prevent other countries from moving forward?
The uniqueness of what the European Union has been about is that it has striven to find common ground between very different and varying interests.
Just because we have hit a barrier with regard to progress in constitutional change and treaty change aiming at a more efficient and effective way of decision-making, does that mean that we have to stick our heads in the sand, as some of my colleagues would say?
The ostrich, whilst it may stick its head in the sand at some stage, is also the fastest runner on the ground.
We have to learn very quickly how to become fast runners to deal with the concerns that people have.
Those concerns are not just related to the model of the European Union.
Many of those who voted ânoâ in France or Holland voted that way because of domestic political reasons.
They also voted out of fear.
As we discovered in Ireland some years ago, there was an irrational fear in some people when they voted ânoâ, a fear of the huge influx of immigrants taking all our jobs, stealing our social welfare and ruining our country.
The reality was totally different: integration is possible; common sense and calmness is possible, but most importantly of all, this is true not just within this insular House and not just within national parliaments.
Until such time as we convince the citizens and allow them ownership of the European Union project, only then and truly then can we say that we have a citizensâ Europe that rightfully belongs to them.
Â Â  Mr President, after the Constitution so spectacularly failed its own test for survival, namely, approval by all Member States, a report which denies the resulting reality could only have come from the rarefied atmosphere of unreality that is the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
With breathtaking arrogance this report, and indeed the last speaker, seeks to second-guess and repudiate the democratic verdict of the people of France and Holland by declaring that those results were not about rejecting the Constitution, but about dissent and other issues.
Nonsense!
The question on the ballot paper was about one thing only â the acceptability of the Constitution â and the answer was equally clear.
Why not face the truth?
You lost.
Instead, the Europhiles in this House have a new catchphrase.
They think it is very clever: âContext, not text, is the problemâ.
How fitting that it begins with the word âconâ.
For that is what this period of reflection is all about.
How can the text be repackaged so that next time they can con the voters into buying the soiled goods that is the Constitution?
Â Â  Mr President, on the basis of what the last speakers had to say, I have to conclude, to my great astonishment, that a citizen is important when he says ânoâ and apparently not when he says âyesâ, but could I just say at this point that there have also been positive referendums and that 13 Member States have already approved the Constitution.
That is just as important to me, which does not mean one should not take the ânoâsâ into consideration, for they also send out a strong message we should take into account.
That is only a negative message, though, one that does not offer an alternative, whilst, paradoxically, the fear that this ânoâ expresses would probably be best allayed in a European Constitution, in a European response.
Indeed, as the Commissioner was right to point out, looking at Eurobarometer, we notice that the citizens know very well that a number of cross-border problems require a European response and âmore Europeâ.
I particularly have the second and third pillars in mind, which is mainly what the Constitution would have catered for.
Another paradox is that during the referendum debates, the strengthening of this political Europe was virtually overlooked in the second and third pillars.
I do think that it is indeed now time to actively use the period of reflection provided for by the Commissionâs plan D. We should, in other words, take all the time we need and not rush into anything.
That is why I endorse the report that is before us now, because it points in that direction, although I fear that certain amendments which the rapporteurs have re-tabled seem to favour the short cuts and draw conclusions prematurely.
I think that we should take the time, together with the national parliaments, mainly to provide a response to the basic question mentioned in the report.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to remind the Commissioner and certain fellow Members that, twenty years ago, Spain joined the European Union.
It was good news for my country and surely for the whole of the Union.
I say this because we Spanish joined twenty years ago and a little more than a year ago we held a referendum and voted âyesâ to the European Constitution, with the same rights, duties and responsibilities with which other countries, France and the Netherlands, voted ânoâ.
A âyesâ is worth the same as a ânoâ, whether expressed by referendum or by a parliament.
And today an absolute majority of members of the Union have said yes to the European Constitution.
This report â I have had the opportunity to work with its two rapporteurs for four months, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group â is a balanced result, which essentially says four things:
Firstly, this Parliament still considers the Constitution to be the best instrument for creating a more democratic and effective Union.
Secondly, if it does not enter into force, the Unionâs political and institutional problems will worsen, not just persist, and furthermore it will be impossible to carry out more enlargements on the basis of the Treaty of Nice following the entry of Bulgaria and Rumania.
Thirdly, we must begin a genuine period of reflection and debate, amongst the institutions and with the citizens, in order to seek solutions to the current crisis.
At the end of this period we will have to draw conclusions that allow us to move forward and complete the political union.
Fourthly, to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005, a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text, which would only be possible with the appropriate measures.
We shall then define the appropriate measures.
Given the current political context, we can say that there are new elements on the basis of which we can move ahead with the Constitution and refute two positions: firstly, the statement that the Constitution is dead â well, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated â and, secondly, the idea that we must first deal with unemployment, immigration or fighting crime, a view which ignores the fact that, in order to do so, we need this Constitution.
This is not just an issue for institutionalists.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for my part, I would like to move from medical metaphors to cooking ones: I would like to invite this Chamber to say 'no' to this plate of microwaved leftovers.
We have before us a dried-up, cold dish that has lost all its flavour and all its aroma.
We could, of course, use the same ingredients to make a different meal, perhaps adding a few spices and removing the most unpalatable ingredients.
But the citizens of Europe are entitled to a new recipe, a new meal that will be to everybody's taste and will not just be yesterday's leftovers reheated.
I have to say, with the greatest of respect to my fellow Members, that I sometimes have the impression, when I hear some of them talk amongst themselves, that they are too personally attached to the corpse of the ConstitutionÂ âÂ to return to the medical metaphor.
I wish these Members could have the courage to let go of this text that they saw come to life in their arms and the courage to take a new step: inventing the new recipe that Europe and its citizens need.
Â Â  Mr Joan i Mari, I would ask you not to continue this speech, because the interpreters are under instruction not to translate from Catalan.
If you continue speaking in Catalan, the Members of this House will not be able to understand what you are saying.
Â Â  As I said to you, Mr Joan i Mari, your speech has not been translated by the interpreters and the text of the speech will not be reproduced in the verbatim report of proceedings.
Â Â  Mr President, there is one sentence in the report that cannot be given enough emphasis, and it is this one: âthe Treaty of Nice is not a viable basis for the continuation of the European integration processâ.
To it I would add that this Treaty represents the beginning of the end for an enlarged Union of citizens.
What, after all, is Nice all about?
It is about there being no fundamental rights binding in law, no citizensâ initiatives, no clear demarcation of powers, no full budgetary rights for the European Parliament, right of national parliaments to intervene in response to proposals from the Commission, no parliamentary control of Europol, no foreign minister and no European diplomatic service.
The list of all the things that Europe stands to lose without a constitution is a very long one; there must be no march back to the past.
Are we then to say, in all seriousness, that Nice must be cast in concrete?
I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on.
Europe needs a new Treaty.
The one thing that is blindingly clear is that âas you wereâ will get us nowhere.
Peopleâs worries and problems must, at last, be taken seriously â that is the message that comes over, loud and clear, from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution.
What we need is a political shift in the European Union, in the shape of a move towards a social Europe.
It is only then that there will be active public support for the enlarged Union and for a Europe united in peace.
Â Â  Mr President, the tone of the report by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber reminds me of the plenary debate a year ago, when this House made a great show of embracing the Constitution, and nothing seemed to stand in the way of its being successfully ratified by all 25 Member States.
To my disappointment, I now have to conclude that Parliament has not learnt anything from the lesson of the double ânoâ.
This House is not reflecting on the future of Europe, but a strategy for getting the twice rejected Constitution ratified after all.
All of this, of course, under the guise of considerable measures to put the mind of public opinion at rest.
Against the backdrop of these transparent attempts to ignore the express will of the French and Dutch electorate, I should nevertheless like to express my appreciation for a number of amendments tabled by both rapporteurs.
They, at any rate, are not obsessively holding onto the present Constitution; they also appear to have understood the ânoâ in France and the Netherlands better than the Members of the large groups and they also display a greater willingness to really look at the issues.
I heard my dear fellow Member, Mr Voggenhuber, speak about nationalism.
I have so high a view of his intellectual capacities that I assume that he does not include all opponents to this Constitution in this, for that is really not what I am about.
Â Â  I would like to thank Mr Duff for a worthy report.
In the eyes of many European citizens the EU spends its time discussing bananas, the shape of a carrot and solar radiation levels, but not the issues that relate to the everyday life of European citizens.
Seven out of ten citizens in Slovakia know very little about the EU and its structure.
Citizens view the Union as something distant from their daily problems.
It came as aÂ shock that more people cast their votes in aÂ recent Big Brother reality TV show than during the elections to the European Parliament.
Mass media play an important and crucial role in informing European citizens.
Citizens are interested in the EU and want information on how it functions.
The mass media should begin to inform them about the work of European institutions and the ways in which their decisions can affect everyday life.
For this to happen, however, the right conditions need to be in place.
I can appreciate that a journalist may find it difficult to explain draft legislation containing thousands of amendments, especially if the text is published just a few days before voting takes place and is not, for that matter, published in all languages.
If the media are to inform citizens objectively about the work of the EU, they must focus on genuine work rather than titbits or scandals.
At the same time, however, we must create the conditions for citizens to become better informed; we must eliminate the complex nature of European legislation and restrict the number of debates taking place behind closed doors.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope that you will understand me because I am going to speak in an official language.
I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation.
I believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points.
Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention.
Firstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have.
And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted ânoâ in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text.
That is the reality.
Those who say ânoâ are people who reject but do not build.
They are not proposing anything.
Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu.
Secondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution.
Why?
For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept â and this Parliament is right to state this in its report â the idea of taking one thing but not another.
We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking
Thirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason.
We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution.
This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteurs for working through a very important issue at a rather difficult time.
The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs Plan D.
What has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution.
Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy.
All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed.
The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion.
I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate.
Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed.
What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution.
I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired.
In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one.
What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion.
There are various options available to us; my countryâs Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss.
This period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength.
We have every chance of coming out of this crisis in better condition than we were in when it started.
Â Â  Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty is dead, long live the Treaty.
Although it is true that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected more on account of context than text, it is also true that the text of the Constitutional Treaty proved too weak to solve the problems in context.
It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas.
Why do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum â so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum â or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European ?
With regard to context, the Dutch citizens â like, I assume, those in most other Member States too â do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much.
What they do want is a Europe that becomes competitive, creates jobs, combats terrorism and cross-border crime, that pursues proper external policy, and that, at long last, simply does what it is expected to do.
If we do not succeed, then, breathing new life into a Treaty review is like flogging a dead horse and all talk then becomes academic.
Certainly, we need a new Treaty in order to make Europe more democratic and more efficient, but there is no rush.
Some of the many excellent ideas which our rapporteurs have floated are intended to extend the period of reflection to late-2007, to keep more options open and also in general, I welcome a method to indicate how we should hold the debate.
What we do not need, though, is a document entitled âConstitutionâ which frightens people off rather than involving them.
After all, a rose smells just as sweetly under another name.
As a result, holding onto the name and the text for dear life is for my group an insuperable problem.
If the solution is to submit an improved text â and I truly hope we will succeed in this, for it is important â then I am in favour of submitting it to all European citizens in a referendum, to coincide with the next European elections.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not a Voggenhuber-Duff report, it is just a duff report.
The question is, is the Constitution dead or is it just sleeping?
If the answer to all this had been âyesâ, there can be no doubt that the Commissioners would have had no difficulty in explaining what âyesâ meant.
It is just us poor peasants who happen to believe in ânoâ who now need to have it explained to us what ânoâ means.
âNoâ in this case means sheer arrogance on the part of the Commission in presuming to go ahead with this project, when 70% of people in Austria do not want it to go ahead; when two-thirds of the population of Great Britain do not see any benefit in future membership of this sham Parliament; when the people of France have voted ânoâ; and when the people of Holland have voted ânoâ.
What part of ânoâ does the Commission not understand?
âNoâ means that large proportions of the population of Europe do not want to continue with this pretence.
We thought we were joining a common market and it has grown and grown and grown like Topsy until this final report, which is pushing us towards full political union.
Well, it will all fall apart, without any doubt, because that is not what people thought they were voting for.
I am glad that UKIP will not fail, because nothing can stop an idea whose time has come, and that means national freedom.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Europe arose in the Middle Ages with Christianity as its foundation.
The European Union originally came about in order to prevent further wars.
Nations and peoples tend to join together either around something or against it.
Europe is now a thing of the past.
It has been replaced by the European Union, which still lacks a common vision binding its members together.
At present, every one of us can come up with a reason for rejecting the Constitution.
Some believe the budget is too small, others that it is too large, whilst others have concerns about Turkey.
The new Member States are unhappy about the unfair common agricultural policy and the closed labour market.
Nonetheless, we want to stay together.
We need to do away with all divisions between us before taking the Constitution to the citizens again and this time we must listen to what the latter have to say and take it into account.
Â Â  Mr President, although the minority is always much noisier, many of us here in Parliament believe that in order to function appropriately, the European Union needs a Constitutional Treaty, particularly in areas such as increased transparency and the increased controlling role of Parliament, or even the protection of minority rights in Europe.
However, the main reason for the crisis that has developed is not the content of the Constitution that ensures a better regulation of the future functioning of the European Union, but the fact that in the eyes of many citizens, the performance of the European Union is not satisfactory and it is not convincing.
The institutions and the elite running the European Union have lost the trust of a number of citizens.
I agree with the opinion of the European Commission, and as I mentioned in my accepted motion for amendment, it is important to ensure that one of the objectives of the period of consideration is to find ways for the European Union to regain the trust of citizens.
We also believe that in order to ensure success, we need a debate on how the European Union can increase its performance and how it can contribute to the solution of the real problems of people.
The Constitutional Treaty, or its most important sections must be preserved.
But we must know that the trust of European Union citizens cannot be regained by complicated texts, but by the performance of the European Union, by jobs, economic growth and the effective representation of common European interests in the world.
And if we regain their trust, people will also support the Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to start by thanking the co-rapporteurs, MrÂ Duff and MrÂ Voggenhuber.
They have done some tremendous, very open-minded work, which forms an excellent basis for discussion, as has been said.
I myself am a former member of the Convention, a socialist and a Frenchman, in no particular order, and I would like, at this stage, to step into this infamous debate on the death or otherwise of the Constitution.
I have every respect for the people who voted for this text âÂ I myself voted 'yes'Â â but, at the same time, we cannot act as if nothing had happened, as if the French and Dutch votes made no difference to the situation.
Neither can we act as if there was now only one possible solution, only one result, namely the ratification, after a few detours, of the original text rejected by the French and the Dutch.
That is why we need to help the rapporteurs, and to that end I have co-signed, with them and with MrsÂ BerÃšs, a number of amendments calling for reality to be taken into account.
I would refer you in particular to three amendments: AmendmentÂ 18, AmendmentÂ 24 and AmendmentÂ 27.
I think that, if we adopt them, if Parliament adopts them, it will give itself a wide range of options, it will be open-minded, it will make a real contribution to the debate, and it will not get bogged down in a single solution, idea or way of thinking.
When all is said and done, I want to vote in favour of this text, as do the French socialists, but we cannot do so if it is just a one-way street.
Therefore, let us continue to move forwards tomorrow by voting in favour of these amendments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the draft Constitution has been rejected.
Of that there can be no doubt.
Two countries have voted against it in referenda and done so with large majorities and high turnouts.
The fact that the European political establishment is now trying to explain this away is a democratic scandal.
Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how the results of these referenda are to be circumvented.
They have, of their own accord, the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries.
They are beginning to calculate how many countries were in favour of the draft Constitution, in spite of its being clear that all the countries have to approve the proposal.
Rarely has it been so clear how wide the gulf is between the political elite and the populations on EU issues.
Everything indicates that the draft Constitution would have been rejected in Germany, too, if there had been a referendum there.
The same applies to the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and perhaps other countries too.
The EUâs power-wielding elite talks shamelessly, however, about difficult setbacks that made their presence felt last year.
