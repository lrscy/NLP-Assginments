All of these questions are laden with consequences and concern the meaning of life itself.
This is why we must have dialogue, especially within the European bodies, and I regret the fact, Commissioner, that President Prodi gave a sneak preview of his interventions on Monday to the press before he shared them with the European Parliament.
I must say that his comments were very cautious and carefully measured on this issue.
Secondly, I think that in order to hold this debate, Parliament should create an ad hoc Parliamentary committee which, could, in the first instance, quickly take the initiative of hearing experts from all disciplines, both from Europe and from across the Atlantic.
This debate must also, however, be held in the public domain.
That is why I propose that European 'assises' for bioethics be launched and there should finally be a provision which allows us to frame practices in this area at a time when we are pointlessly establishing monitoring centres.
I propose that a European Agency for reproductive and biotechnological medicine be created.
. (FR) Mr President, I feel that I should respond, because Mr Liese asked a specific question during the debate.
His question concerned the fifth framework-programme.
On this issue, it is quite clear, as Mr Liese surely knows, as it is clearly stated in the fifth framework-programme, since it is subject to a codecision procedure, that research involving cloning techniques for reproductive and therapeutic purposes are quite explicitly excluded.
As a result, in the framework-programme, this is clearly completely excluded at the moment.
I simply wanted to clarify this point, Mr Liese, since you asked the question.
With regard to the debate, on the other hand, as I said in my introductory speech, the Commission would like to enter into a debate with Parliament on these issues which are, as we have seen, very complex and very interesting.
I have received eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Question Time (Commission)
Question No 41 by (H-0613/00):
Subject: Cooperation with drug counselling networks Cooperation between the Commission and the networks it promotes has deteriorated significantly since 1998: contracts between the networks and the Commission are often not concluded until the projects have already been under way for months.
The Commission nevertheless insists that the projects should begin on the strength of nothing more than a provisional written notification.
Payment of instalments by the Commission is sometimes delayed for years.
All the networks are affected by the ever-growing bureaucratic burden and, above all, by the Commission's failure to make repayments, and are very much hampered in their work.
Some associations have even had to close down because of delays in payment by the Commission.
Why has the Commission not succeeded in recent years in providing the networks it supports with contracts and instalment payments rapidly and in parallel with projects?
The Commission shares the concerns of the honourable Member about the problems relating to contracts and payments for the drug prevention networks subsidised by the Community action programme on prevention of drug dependence.
These problems have several causes.
Firstly, it is clear that there has been a human resources problem in the Public Health Directorate in Luxembourg, which deals with this work.
In short, the staff complement has been insufficient to deal with complex procedures and often inexperienced beneficiaries proposing too many small projects.
This situation was aggravated last summer when a decision was taken in the light of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts to end the contract with the technical assistance office which helped in the implementation of this programme.
Secondly, a large number of small projects are implemented under the anti-drugs programme, placing additional strain on the already limited human resources at our disposal.
During the last five years, the average size of projects in terms of co-financing granted by the Commission has been EUR 180,000.
Thirdly, experience shows that participants in the network have had little understanding of the Commission's contract and payment procedures.
In many cases, therefore, the Commission has had to make repeated requests to the drug prevention networks for missing documentation needed to finalise contracts or produce payments.
Fourthly, in the light of experience with subsidies from the Community budget and the criticisms of the Court of Auditors, greater rigour may have been brought to bear on the documentation relating to contract costs, resulting in knock-on effects on the timing of payments.
In responding to these problems, I am taking a number of steps.
The Commission's proposal for a new public health framework and strategy highlights the need for clearer objectives and more efficient management with a greater impact on key priorities.
Therefore, fewer but bigger projects will be co-financed in future, making for more efficient use of the human resources needed to manage implementation of the programme.
As the budgetary authority repeatedly stresses, we must match resources and priorities more realistically in the future.
In addition, as you are aware, following the Commission's recent review of its staffing needs, a request for additional posts is being put forward to the budgetary authority, including a significant increase in posts for the health and consumer protection DG.
If the budgetary authority agrees, a number of these posts could be allocated to tackle the kind of problems which we are discussing today.
The inexperience of contractors regarding financial control requirements will continue to necessitate significant advice and other inputs from already limited staff resources.
The Public Health Directorate intends to carry out an information campaign to help contractors to understand the Commission's procedures and requirements more clearly.
On the issue of red tape, the departments concerned are currently reviewing their documentary requirements with the aim of simplifying and speeding up payment procedures without neglecting the necessary financial control measures.
As a result of the measures already taken, the situation has been improving, and I expect it to improve further so that contracts can be agreed more quickly and payments made in accordance with the Commission's 60-day rule.
Should you have any specific points to make, perhaps you could provide me with the relevant information in writing, and I will certainly raise them with my staff.
Commissioner, I am pleased to hear that certain measures are to be taken.
Nevertheless, I call into question the fact that when the Commission encounters problems with the partners participating in particular projects, it attributes at least half of these problems to the partners themselves.
I have information to the effect that even small project partners are in full possession of the facts about the contracts and know exactly what they have to submit.
I have had a case described to me where the same paperwork was submitted on three separate occasions, but the Commission still maintained that it had never received this paperwork.
I therefore wish to put in another request for the application procedure to be attended by extremely clear guidelines laid down in advance.
I have encountered problems of this kind before, not just in the drugs sphere, but with many other partners that work with the Commission and seek co-financing.
It is not only in the drugs sphere where the application procedure takes such a long time and is so complex, and I believe the problem does not lie wholly with incompetent, small project partners, but can also be put down to the fact that the requirements set by the Commission are not clearly formulated.
The question remains as to whether we really want to cut back on the small organisations within the European Union, when it is important to support drugs projects - including those in the regions - using a whole range of approaches, specifically in this area, but also in general.
I believe it would not be in our interests to only give large organisations a chance to move things forward in this sphere, rather our aim must continue to be that of promoting a variety of organisational structures.
That would be a wholly misguided attempt at a solution to my mind.
. In relation to the first issue raised, I do not suggest that the problem lies wholly with, as you say, incompetent project partners.
What I am saying is that is the reason for some of the problems that have arisen.
It is something I am concerned about and am seeking to address by making sure that there are clear guidelines, as you suggest, so you and I are fully in agreement on that point.
With regard to the size of projects, since 1996 a total of 149 projects have been selected for over EUR 25 million, with an average amount of EUR 180 000 per project.
Under the new health strategy we will reduce the number of projects and increase their value and impact, thereby using our limited human resources more effectively.
It does not always follow that smaller projects are better than bigger projects, but if human resources are applied efficiently it will be for the betterment of the projects concerned.
Question No 42 by (H-0629/00):
Subject: Scientific advice concerning phthalates Will the Commission now release the statement agreed on 25 November 1999 by the CSTEE (Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment) on that committee' s view of the misinterpretation by the Commission of the scientific advice on the subject of phthalates, the statement being referred to in the minutes of the Scientific Steering Committee' s meeting of 10 December 1999?
Will it indicate who in the Commission is responsible for this failure to follow accepted practice on the publication of all minutes, reports and agreed statements by scientific committees, and will it indicate who was responsible for delaying the publication of the main minutes of the CSTEE meeting of 25 November 1999 until April 2000?
Thank you for giving the opportunity to clarify the issue that is the subject of your question.
As referred to in the minutes of the plenary meeting of the Scientific Steering Committee of 10 December 1999 the chairman of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment informed the SSC about the SCTEE's intention at its plenary meeting of 25 November 1999 to attach a statement to the minutes of the meeting, clarifying the interpretation of its opinion on phthalates in toys.
The minutes of the meeting under discussion would normally have been adopted at the occasion of the next SCTEE plenary meeting which took place on 4 February 2000.
However, at that plenary meeting several committee members considered that the minutes were in general too long and requested the secretariat to follow the format of other scientific committees.
Following this request the committee decided to postpone the adoption of the minutes to the next plenary when the draft of a more succinct version would be available. This inevitably delayed the process of adoption until the subsequent plenary meeting held on 11 April 2000.
Once approved its content was immediately made public on the Internet - in the course of that very week in fact, as is the usual Commission practice.
There has accordingly been no failure in publishing the minutes.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for his reply although I have to say that five months is a long time to wait for minutes.
What I say now is no reflection at all on the Commissioner himself, but I hope that he would accept with me that science must inform our decisions on risk and how to manage it.
In this case the science was less than adequate.
It was not validated by peer review and so on. So when it came to the Science Committee and the chairman's views it was significant that his advice - in his words - did not justify a banning action.
The resulting ban on other phthalates had nothing whatsoever to do with children's toys or teething rings.
This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle.
That principle only holds good if the decisions are scientifically irreproachable.
It was not a happy experience and I hope the Commission would agree that both the Commission and Parliament have a lot to learn from this experience.
I fully agree with the honourable Member when he says that science must inform our decisions and that is what happened in this instance.
The relevant committee produced its report, as it is required to do in its area of responsibility which is of course risk assessment.
That information was passed on to the Commission, since it is one of the EU institutions responsible for risk management.
The Commission took the view, having regard to the advice contained in the documents sent by the relevant committee, that phthalates or toys designed to be placed in the mouth posed an immediate and significant risk to babies under the age of three.
The Commission made a clear assessment of this issue.
I submitted emergency proposals to the Commission as I am entitled to do under the General Product Safety Directive and my colleagues agreed that this was the appropriate to action to take in the circumstances.
My colleague, Commissioner Liikanen, has adopted a more long-term approach to the whole issue of phthalates and placticisers in toys and so on.
I wish to say once again that I agree that science must inform our decisions, and that, in my view, is what happened in this instance.
Question No 44 by (H-0688/00):
Subject: Water needs in the Middle East The constantly increasing demand for water in the Middle East is set to play a significant part in relation to the outlook for cooperation and understanding among the peoples of the region.
After a three-year break, the Steering Committee of the Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources (MWGWR) for the region began work again in 1999 and adopted specific programmes on the saving and use of water resources in the Middle East, with EU funding.
The issue of water in the Middle East was also discussed in the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and the Israeli side has also raised the subject of further funding for such programmes.
What policy will the Commission pursue on this matter, with a view to promoting cooperation among the peoples of the region and averting conflicts arising from water needs?
Water will be a crucial issue for the Middle East in the coming decades.
The region has the lowest per capita availability of water anywhere in the world and it is steadily decreasing.
Water is indeed one of the main issues of the Middle East peace process, not only in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians but also between Israel and Syria.
The Commission's policy focuses on the various dimensions of the water question in the Middle East, the security as well as the economic, environmental and social dimensions.
Just and comprehensive water agreements between Israel and its neighbours, sustained by effective regional cooperation, are necessary for lasting peace in the region.
The Commission is an active participant in, and a main donor to, the multilateral water working group of the MEPP.
As a concrete contribution we have committed another EUR 4 million in 1999 for the completion of the regional water data banks.
We also promote the concept of a regional cooperation structure.
The Council's special taskforce on water in the Middle East has met with the Israeli, Jordanian and the Palestinian water commissioners and is actively coordinating EU water policy.
The Commission's policy aims at helping the region to achieve a sustainable management of the scarce water resources in combination with assistance to explore new resources.
Current water management and consumption in the Middle East cannot be sustained.
Estimates suggest that in the overall Mediterranean region agriculture absorbs over two thirds of total national water consumption, while accounting for only one third of GNP and labour.
This discrepancy is even sharper in the Middle East.
Therefore assisting reform of domestic water policies in the countries of the Middle East is a priority.
Indeed the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Stuttgart in 1999 decided to make water a priority for the partnership.
As a first result the EUR 40 million action plan adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference on local water management in Turin in October 1999 would provide a further opportunity for cooperation in this sector.
A call for proposals will be published soon.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
In addition to highlighting the seriousness of the problem and its effect on the Middle East peace process, my question was aimed at regarding the lack of water resources as a serious political issue.
We all talk about the impending crises over water shortages.
Something must be done.
Commissioner, what initiatives are you going to take to formulate rules of international law in the management of water resources so as to eliminate any hotbeds of local and regional political antagonism, seeds of crises and a peculiar type of imperialism?
Your answer to the Israel - Syria question should go somewhat beyond; to the Tigris and to the Euphrates, to Turkey and to Syria and elsewhere.
I believe that rules of international law must be established to manage water resources. These rules must contain clear conditions for all the countries involved, through which rivers that cross more than one country flow.
This must also apply to lakes that belong to more than one country.
The Commission is supporting crucial water projects in the Palestinian authority and in Jordan through MEDA.
The most recent example is Community support of EUR 5 million in grants for the project management of the Greater Amman water sector improvement programme, plus a substantial loan from the European Investment Bank.
Apart from the support we give to the multilateral water working group, I can mention the Euro-Mediterranean water information system three-year action programme.
The European Commission contributed EUR 1.2 million towards its implementation.
The Euro-Mediterranean conference on water management in Marseilles on 25 and 26 of November 1996 was organised on the initiative of the European Commission and the French Government, with the support of the city of Marseilles.
The International Office for Water took charge of the secretariat.
So the Commission is constantly involved in this project, has been for some time and continues to be.
Question No 45 by (H-0689/00):
Subject: Transport of animals In the year 2000 television documentaries are still being broadcast in the Member States which clearly show that live animals are being transported on EU territory in breach of the provisions of the directive on animal transport and in disregard of all ethical principles.
How does the Commission intend to ensure that the Member State authorities monitor shipments of animals and scrutinise routes between Member States?
When will the Commission put forward revised proposals for directives to govern the transport of live animals?
What view does the Commission take of the fact that in those Member States in which shipments are carried out properly costs are higher than in those which repeatedly breach the relevant rules, even though the EU has a single market in foodstuffs?
What steps is the Commission taking to halt shipments over long distances as a general rule and replace them with shipments of frozen and processed products?
Second part
I agree that it is a matter for concern that rules on the transport of animals are not being sufficiently enforced in certain areas.
While Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation, the Food and Veterinary Office of my Directorate-General undertakes specific control and inspection missions to check that Member States apply Community legislation in an effective and a uniform manner.
These checks have revealed certain shortcomings in the compliance of some Member States with the Community legislation.
As a result, infringement proceedings based on Article 226 of the Treaty have been opened against certain Member States and others are under evaluation.
I will shortly present a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during the last quarter of this year.
The report will show that Member States currently have difficulties in fully implementing Community legislation.
As the conclusion to the report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals, address the difficulties I have referred to, ensure inspection by the FVO and provide for infringement proceedings if appropriate.
As soon as possible, several basic issues of the directive should be evaluated on a scientific basis, notably data concerning travelling times, stress related to loading and unloading operations and loading densities.
In this framework, measures to encourage the slaughter of animals closer to the places where they are raised also merit examination.
I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission.
I look forward to further discussion when I present the report on transport in the next few weeks.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply, but I would like to say very briefly that, now, as the EU is enlarging to the east in accordance with a very tight timetable, and they have been transporting horses from the Baltic countries, among others, into the EU area on journeys of up to a hundred hours long, I think it is quite odd that at the same time we are calling on applicant countries to adhere very closely to the guidelines and legal provisions.
In our own territory, however, we allow such violations that - as has been seen in public - are simply inhumane, considering we are supposed to be a civilised western Europe.
I would like to highlight this and ask what sort of timetable is now in place for real action, taking into account the fact that we have to put our own house in order before new Member States join the EU?
Although I cannot give you a specific timetable, I do assure you that infringement proceedings have already been opened and others are now being evaluated.
The situation is under constant review, I have had a number of discussions with the Director-General of my DG, who is an expert on transport, and I am drawing on his expertise.
You also draw attention to our relationship with the applicant countries.
The Commission believes that the most effective way to achieve a widespread improvement in animal welfare standards is to work towards an international consensus.
The long-distance transport of horses has been discussed with heads of veterinary services in the central and east European countries currently negotiating accession to the Union.
A protocol of action to improve the protection of the horses and donkeys transported over long distances was agreed in April.
The first results of the implementation of the protocol will be discussed at a specific meeting with all the competent authorities of the accession countries at the end of September this year.
So I can give an assurance that this issue is high on the list of priorities in my service and we will be monitoring it closely and pursuing it actively.
Mr President, it would be interesting to know if the Commission is intending to have research carried out in this field, based on the best practice model.
Are you intending to create incentives, with a view to ensuring that live transport is carried out in such a way that is actually tolerable for the animals concerned?
I am satisfied from the advice that I get from my service and the other information that is made available to me that any measures that are necessary are being taken.
On that basis, the directive is being amended to improve the protection of animals during transport, providing in particular for additional measures to protect the horses with a mandatory unloading and fixed resting period for commercial consignments of horses passing through a border inspection post of the Union.
I should like to ask a related question regarding the banning of Staffordshire terriers in Germany under their dangerous dogs law.
Many of my constituents in the United Kingdom are writing to protest against this German law banning certain breeds of dogs which appear to pose no threat to public safety.
Given the pets' passport project at European level and a right for pets now to move freely within the European Union as a result, does the Commission have any legal competence to intervene and protect animal welfare and, in particular, these domestic pets in Germany, of which there will be a needless slaughter potentially and possibly even extinction of a fine breed of British dogs?
Commissioner, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, this is not a supplementary question.
We could invite Mr Tannock to ask this question during the next part-session, but if you wish to reply to it, you may do so.
As a matter of courtesy to the honourable Member I would say that had you given me notice of this question I would probably have been in a better position to give you a comprehensive answer to it.
I am the Commissioner responsible for animal welfare. There is a competence to deal with these issues relating to animal welfare.
If such issues are brought to my attention and come within the relevant directive, then action can be taken.
The only practical suggestion that I can make to you is that if you would like to write to me and give me specific details of the issue that you have raised I will have my services examine it and deal with it.
Mr Tannock, you may express your opinion in writing on a bilateral basis or you may do it in public in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, and the Commissioner will reply.
Thank you very much, Mr Byrne, for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 46 by (H-0600/00):
Subject: Communication on children's rights Following the Commission's statement to Parliament to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in November 1999 when it indicated that it would be publishing a Communication on children's rights, can the Commission now give Parliament a definite timetable for the publication of the Communication?
Given that the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) on children will take place in September 2000, what is the Commission's plan for coordinating EU and Member State input to the Special Session?
Is the Commission prepared to acknowledge that, in view of the special session, a Communication on children's rights is of the utmost importance?
I would refer the honourable Member to the letter dated 20 June which she and a number of her colleagues received from President Prodi on this very subject.
In his letter the President made absolutely clear the Commission's commitment to all measures which safeguard children's rights and mention a number of areas both external and internal where the Commission was active on these highly important matters.
However, the President also sought to situate the Commission's action in these areas, as in others, in the context of the Treaties' revision.
He acknowledged that competence for action concerning children remains primarily with the Member States given the lack of a clear legal basis in the Treaty for the Community to safeguard children's rights in terms that go beyond the existing framework.
In the current framework the European Commission has already undertaken a considerable number of initiatives to protect children's rights as in the Daphne and Stop programmes which fall under my competence.
The Commission is also pursuing action in the social and educational field with a view to improving the situation of children.
Further evidence of the importance we attach to this subject can be found in the fact that it was the Commission which undertook the initiative to include a specific article on children's rights into the charter of fundamental rights.
The draft article concerning the protection of children incorporates the main principles of the New York Convention as the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and consideration.
We will continue to insist that the charter foresees the prohibition of the employment of children.
In his letter the President also expressed the view that it could indeed be useful for the Commission to evaluate if all Member States have pursued the content of UN Convention on the rights of the child.
Although all the Member States have ratified the Convention, its implementation varies widely and the views of the Member States on how to best protect children's rights diverge to a considerable extent.
It is my conviction that such an evaluation might represent a useful contribution for the participation of the Union in the special session of the United Nations general assembly in September 2001.
The Commission believes that its ongoing actions in favour of children, its active advocacy for an appropriate inclusion in the charter of fundamental rights and its support for this idea of having an evaluation as described represents evidence of its commitment to this important subject.
As you know, I am a great admirer of yours and I am sure that you were as uncomfortable repeating your answer today as I was hearing it.
I know of your own personal commitment but actually you have not given me any clear indication of what the Commission is actually going to do in the UN conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time.
Having listened to the extent of plans that the Commission has in relation to animal welfare, I can only wish that they had similar plans in relation to the welfare of children.
Accepting the legal limits within which you have to work, could you in fact give me any indication that anybody from the Commission for example is going to be present at this United Nations conference in September?
In what context and are they proposing to make any input into the conference?
I will answer with pleasure.
As a matter of fact, we are both talking about the same thing, which is the United Nations Special Meeting of the General Assembly on Children's Rights in September 2001 next year.
Since we are talking about that my approach is that we should have a study to evaluate how the United Nations Convention on Children's Rights has been implemented in our Member States.
This study should be completed in time to be used as basis for the Union's participation in the United Nations Special General Assembly next year.
I am sure that we can count on the support of the incoming Swedish Presidency in the first six months of next year.
It has already made it clear, that it will be making children's rights a top priority.
So I think I have explained what action we propose to take and when we propose to take it.
Mr President, does the Commissioner agree with me that there seems to be a new and growing abuse of children which is within the competence of the European Union?
Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging.
They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees.
Either they should be taken into care or the begging is unjustified because they should be receiving social benefits from the state.
This is something perhaps which should be added to the list of child abuse which we as a Community ought to be looking into very carefully.
I share the concern of the honourable Member in the sense that begging is an activity where children are forced, sometimes by their own family, to act against their dignity.
As you know, the responsibility for protecting the dignity of children falls, above all, within the competence of the Member States.
Nevertheless we are now launching a debate on a specific legislative initiative to define the list of crimes against children.
I will consider your suggestions with an open mind.
Question No 47 by (H-0606/00):
Subject: Absence of passport controls in the Schengen area In the Commission's view, how has the absence of passport controls under the Schengen Agreement worked during the European football championship in the light of the mass arrests made in Brussels and Charleroi?
First of all, it should be pointed out that many of those involved in the incidents that occurred in Brussels and Charleroi, come from one of the European Union' s Member States, the United Kingdom, which is not a member of the Schengen area.
These are therefore people who, when travelling to see football matches at Euro 2000, were subject to checks carried out at the external borders of the Schengen area.
It should also be borne in mind that for the duration of Euro 2000, the Belgian and Dutch Governments made use of a safeguard clause in Article 2(2) of the Schengen Agreement, which lays down that, when public order or national security are threatened - and in my view, the fear generated by these cases of 'hooliganism' certainly meets these criteria - a Member State may decide that, for a limited period, national border controls, adapted specially for the situation, can be implemented, even at internal borders within the Schengen area.
The Belgian and Dutch Governments adhered to the prior consultation procedure laid down by the Schengen Agreement.
The controls that are envisaged therein were temporarily reintroduced at internal borders, but this was not carried out in a systematic way.
These were targeted checks, specifically based on information supplied by the Member States in the framework of police cooperation, concerning supporters likely to pose a threat to public order.
Establishing controls at the external borders and, temporarily, at the internal borders of the Schengen area is not the same as closing a border or systematically turning away people who wish to enter the territory in order to attend a football match.
In accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Union' s citizens have the right to move freely through the territory of Member States. Restrictions may be imposed, however, for reasons of public order and in individual cases only, i.e. when the person concerned represents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to society' s fundamental wellbeing.
This is why I say that Community law does not allow for a collective restriction to be imposed.
Having the nationality of a given Member State and wanting to attend a football match are not sufficient grounds for being turned back at the border.
This is why an assessment of the measures for cooperation between the authorities of the Member States concerned is already underway and why this joint exercise aims to learn the lessons of Euro 2000, in order to see how police and judicial cooperation can in the future be improved in terms of combating hooliganism.
I should like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for his answer.
I supported Portugal as well as I could there at King Baudouin' s Stadium in Brussels, but France won in the end in a match in which it has to be said that France had the better team.
I was gunning for Portugal for as long as I possibly could, though.
As I say, thank you for your answer, but I should still like to ask a follow-up question.
A lot of people find it appalling that, here in Europe, there are riots, hooliganism, aggressive language and violence such as are unknown in connection with sporting events in, for example, the United States.
I know that Great Britain is not a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, but that day may come.
Do you think that the measures we are now taking are adequate, and what lessons can be drawn for the future?
Perhaps next time, Portugal will also be in the final.
I do not consider there to be any link, whether direct or indirect, between Portugal' s defeat and the outbreaks of hooliganism.
It is a fact of the game that sometimes luck is not on your side.
In any event, Portugal will be hosting Euro 2004, and that is why, for Euro 2000, the Commission supported several practical initiatives for police cooperation in order to try out new methods of cooperation and to learn lessons from them.
We are now in the process of assessing those measures.
As soon as the report is available, it will be discussed and legislative measures will be adopted at European level, which is our objective - to adopt measures at European level that are capable of supporting this police cooperation in the fight against hooliganism.
I am currently awaiting this report.
As soon as it is ready, it will certainly be made public and the debate on what initiatives need to be taken will begin.
I have a follow-up question also concerning the Schengen Agreement and exemption from the requirement to carry a passport.
As the Commissioner surely knows, the Nordic countries are to become signatories of the Schengen Agreement in March of next year.
It has emerged that, in future too, Swedish citizens who are to travel within the Schengen area will have to carry their Swedish passports with them because Swedish ID documents do not state the country of which they are citizens, as required under the Schengen Agreement.
What was promised as a union with exemption from the requirement to carry passports still makes the latter compulsory for Swedish citizens.
I wonder if the Commissioner can confirm that, once Sweden has entered into the Schengen Agreement, the latter' s regulations will, in the future too, require Swedes to have their passports with them when they travel to other countries within the Schengen area.
What are your views on this?
Mr SjÃ¶stedt, I would say that this matter should be seen from a different angle: that of creating common standards for travel documents, whether they are passports or identity cards.
That these common standards should exist is laid down in the Treaty, and the Commission has a proposal at an advanced stage of preparation for the adoption of common standards for the instruments in question.
I cannot give you a fixed timetable, that is, I cannot guarantee that these documents will be adopted before the expected date for the integration of the Nordic Passport Union into the Schengen free movement area.
What I can guarantee is that we are working hard at formulating uniform standard models of documents that will solve problems such as the one the honourable Member has just indicated.
Question No 49 by (H-0692/00):
Subject: European police academy What stage has been reached in the plans for a European police academy, with regard to virtual networks linking existing bodies and the creation of an actual academy at a particular location?
The European Council of Tampere of October 1999 called for the establishment of a European police college for the training of senior law enforcement officials which should start as a network of existing national training institutes.
Considerable progress has been achieved so far.
The Portuguese Presidency submitted a draft Council regulation at the end of June 2000.
The French Presidency aims at adding a Council decision adopted by the end of this year.
This would make it possible to meet the deadline of having the European police college in place by 2001, as mentioned in the Commission's scoreboard on justice and home affairs.
A number of Member States are in favour of creating the European police college as a permanent network of national training institutes.
Other Member States regard the current presidency proposal for a network as a temporary stage on the road to an institution at a fixed location.
The Commission has, from the beginning, insisted that the European police college will become a fixed institution after having functioned as a network for an initial period in line with the Tampere conclusion.
This has led to the draft regulation now containing the following approach.
From January 2001 the European police college is set up as a network of national training institutes, a virtual academy.
It will function in this form for three years.
After that period a decision will be taken on the form in which to continue with the European police college.
The Commission continues to take the position, however, that the draft regulation should contain a clear obligation for the European police college to become a fixed institution after having functioned for a few years as a network.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his precise answer and substantial input in this matter.
In the meantime, I have been appointed rapporteur for the subject and I am sure that we will work closely together with a view to moving matters on.
But the question I have is this: is the Commission still planning to conduct a study into the feasibility of making this college a fixed institution?
Because as you know, the European Parliament has called for this to be a fixed institution and not a virtual academy.
Are you proposing to conduct a study on the feasibility aspect?
You can rely on receiving our full backing for this.
There is a first study on feasibility by the General Secretariat of the Council which was the basis of this current draft resolution of the Council.
But we intend to promote our own initiative in the area just to make sure that we will have all the necessary information to take a further step ahead as soon as possible.
It is urgent to have that second step in order to make the European police college a fixed institution.
The Commission will not drop that idea.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your replies this afternoon.
Question No 50 will be replied to in writing.
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
Question No 51 by (H-0647/00):
Subject: Social security in a stronger European economy One of the European Union' s main tasks in the 21st century will doubtless be to ensure that due importance is attached to the social dimension by comparison with the economic and political dimension.
Common social policy objectives must be defined and attained in order to ensure that the process of increasing integration and the forthcoming enlargement is supported by the European public.
Can the Commission say whether it will take action with a view to the increased harmonisation of social security systems, which still differ widely, and the harmonisation of professional qualifications in all areas?
Is it correct to assume that the EU' s extremely sparse powers in the fields of social policy and employment will be expanded in the future?
Mr President, the two basic issues are whether we intend to harmonise social policy and whether the power of the Commission will be extended to cover social policy issues.
I will start with the Lisbon Council resolution, which made clear reference to the need to combine the policies of competitiveness and social cohesion, the need to update the social model, to invest in people and to combat social exclusion.
Under the Treaties, it is naturally impossible for the Commission to put forward policy on issues relating to social policy But we feel that, in the wake of Lisbon, there is agreement within the Council, and the Council has unanimously decided to cooperate in the field of social policy and to extend the method of open cooperation to issues such as social exclusion and social protection.
I am bound to say that the agenda that was tabled in June, in relation to which there was special cooperation with Parliament and with the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker, accurately describes the measures and actions relating to social policy under the Treaty, but it also categorically states that the harmonisation of social polices is not on the cards.
Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible.
But our objectives can be achieved using methods such as social dialogue, the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund, which has a large budget, mainstreaming, political analysis, research and, finally, legislation.
In July 1999, the Commission presented a communication entitled 'A Concerted Strategy for Modernising Social Protection' .
This put forward a two-pronged approach.
The first is to combat social exclusion and the second concerns future cooperation on issues of social protection and pension systems.
To achieve these goals, the Commission is giving priority to the enactment and implementation of social indicators, which are necessary to assess polices, to specify objectives relating to poverty and culture, which will be discussed during the course of the French Presidency, and to reach agreement on axes concerning the viability of pensions.
Commissioner, thank you very much for providing these clarifications.
Allow me to express the wish that is dearest to my heart in the form of an additional question: what special measures will the Commission endeavour to take in the future, with a view to working towards the harmonisation of the social security systems, professional qualifications and the social dimension in all areas?
It was extremely interesting to hear how matters stand in this respect, and to learn that the trend is more positive than it has been hitherto.
However, I believe we must convince the people of the European Union that freedom of establishment is not a hollow expression which ultimately applies in full to tourists, rather, they must understand that for people who work, or have worked - firstly in terms of the insurance system and then in terms of the pensions system - freedom of establishment is a reality, and not a hollow expression.
I believe we must join forces to this end, in order to try and persuade the Council to frame policy in this area that is more transparent, progressive and forward-looking.
Mr President, I would agree with the general approach taken by the honourable Member, but I would like to remind him of the margin for manoeuvre of these policies at a European level, especially since they are national policies. Secondly, according to our studies, there are such major discrepancies in the structure and organisation of pension and social security systems that it is impossible to talk about harmonising them.
Thirdly, regarding the rights of workers as they move from one country to another, there are already two regulations in existence.
In July, the Council of Employment Ministers held an in-depth debate on changing the regulations for workers living in one country and working in another. But I must emphasise that these systems are so different that the difficulties in bringing about the harmonisation you propose are virtually insurmountable.
Mr President, Commissioner, the harmonisation of social security systems would require harmonisation of the financing of social security, or, in practice, the harmonisation of taxation, not just with regard to its technical framework, but also its levels of taxation.
We all know that consensus has still not been reached on this as far as policy is concerned, and that that is not going to come about quickly.
For that reason I believe that a policy like this of taking small steps at a time is quite in order in this matter, and I would also ask how one aspect of this one-step-at-a-time policy is going, in other words the directive on a single market for additional pensions.
The directive was supposed to have come from the Commission for a reading in the European Parliament in July, and now we have heard that it is probably being postponed until September.
It may also be that it will not get discussed throughout the whole of the French presidential term.
Could you give an update on this directive on a single market for additional pensions?
Mr President, I would like to say that this directive, which is being prepared in collaboration with other departments and other Commissioners, such as the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Competition, is still being developed. I will be able to give you a more complete text at a future sitting.
We are currently at the debating stage.
Question No 52 by (H-0649/00):
Subject: European social non-governmental organisations The role of European social NGOs as an important link between Europe' s citizens and the Commission, Parliament and Council is increasingly recognised in areas such as social policy, trade, development and the environment.
What plans does the Commission have to propose a legal basis for civil dialogue between the EU' s institutions and organised civil society?
It is clear that, during the preparation of the White Paper on a new form of government within Europe entitled 'Spreading Democracy within Europe' , one of the basic issues is the role of civil society in the new forms of democracy that will be operating in Europe and in all Member States.
The level of cooperation and the forms of collaboration between the Commission and NGOs are of particular concern to all Ministers without portfolio whose programmes are implemented through NGOs and who have, I would say, a special burden to bear in the social field.
As you know, a dialogue is taking place today based on the working document submitted by the Commission on the Commission and NGOs and the construction of a stronger partnership.
This dialogue aims to enable us to come up with new proposals on issues such as the representativeness of these organisations and issues of a procedural nature such as their funding and operation.
Within the framework of this dialogue, on 30 March 2000 I met members of the platform of European NGOs and a dialogue took place, which focused on two categories of issues. The first category covered the proposals they put forward, which were invaluable for the social agenda.
The second focused on issues concerning the representativeness and the organisation of NGOs in the social arena at a European level, the financial problems they are faced with and the special procedural difficulties they have in obtaining funds. Related issues included the quality and the specifications of the services they offer.
I am bound to say that their contribution to this dialogue was extremely significant.
Just a short time ago, in June, a meeting took place between the official group of the Secretariat-General and the platforms of European social and developmental NGOs, and we believe this dialogue will soon come to an end. After assessing the current level of cooperation and the institutional framework within which the NGOs operate, the Commission will be in a position to put forward a new, integrated proposal, consolidating their statutory role and their ability to function.
Thank you, Commissioner and I certainly agree with the substance, particularly of the early part of your answer.
I welcome the fact that NGOs are funded through the exclusion and anti-discrimination action programmes.
But I have one specific question: why are only eight or nine NGOs, as far as my information is concerned, funded through these two lines?
Secondly, NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding.
My information is that they are being pushed into project funding and 18 environmental NGOs, for instance, are receiving from the Commission funding towards their running costs.
It occurs to me that two years after the 1998 budget freeze, it might be time now for the Commission to respond to what are very clear needs from the European-based social NGOs for core funding to cover their running costs.
As you know, concerning particularly social issues and NGOs, there were some rules concerning the size, the representativeness and the results of these NGOs.
We know that in this social field there is a huge number of NGOs and it is very difficult for the Commission DG to know with which of them they can cooperate.
Sometimes there is confusion at national level.
So we have decided to establish the criteria and to agree with NGOs the criteria on the basis of which we can select the NGOs we can work with.
This is why we must solve the problem of the issue of representativeness, and the issue of the network to be established at European level.
Question No 53 by (H-0675/00):
Subject: Employment in Greece In its answer to my Oral Question H-0778/99 on the Greek action plan for employment, the Commission stated that the Greek Government recognised the problem concerning the difficulty of recording fluctuations in employment and unemployment and had therefore undertaken, first, to reorganise the country' s public employment services, second, to establish effective centres to promote employment and, third, to introduce a system of computerised employment cards and to employ appropriate computerised systems to monitor all these policies.
What is the unemployment rate in Greece at present?
To what extent is the Greek Government meeting the undertakings it gave regarding the above-mentioned matters?
Can the Commission provide statistics concerning the number of jobs created as a result of the implementation of the employment programmes, in other words how many of the unemployed have found work?
According to statistics provided by Eurostat, the unemployment rate in Greece in 1998 was 10.7%, whilst the European average during the same period was 9.9%.
For the moment, Eurostat does not have statistics on Greece for 1999 and forecasts for 1999 were 10.4%.
It is clear therefore that there are no appropriate statistics recording fluctuations in employment, which makes it difficult to assess the policies and measures being implemented. The new action plan for employment and the new measures announced by the Greek government based on this new action plan for employment are a move in the right direction.
There are significant undertakings concerning, firstly, the organisation and coordination of statistical services in Greece with those in other European countries and of Eurostat. It is clear that, without a statistical base, it is difficult for us to put in place specific policies.
Secondly, there is an undertaking to speed up the reorganisation of public employment and statistical services. This reorganisation will be completed by the end of 2001.
The Commission does not have any information on the number of unemployed who have found work through the various employment programmes in Greece. That is why there is also an undertaking to continuously assess the existing training programmes, together with the Commission, to ensure that those who pass through these programmes are adequately monitored.
I would just like to say that the tabling of your question coincided with the announcement of recommendations for all Member States.
The most fundamental recommendations concerning Greece are, firstly, to make changes to the statistics, the indicators, the studies and the employment services. Secondly, tax disincentives and other disincentives militating against the provision of community subsidies for entering the labour market will be examined in detail.
Thirdly, training and the participation of social partners in this process will be promoted.
Fourthly, business enterprise will be encouraged and procedures to create new companies will be simplified.
Finally, cooperation between social partners will be encouraged and the organisation of labour relations will be brought up to date, at the same time guaranteeing flexibility and security.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have more or less the same statistics as you. Indeed, I am this very moment holding in my hands the latest Eurostat report of 5 September 2000.
The figures are more or less as you gave them.
What I would really like to highlight is the following: for many years now, Commissioner, long before you were appointed to your post, I have been trying to find out - even a rough estimate will do - how many people have found work as a result of these employment actions, and I still have not succeeded.
What prospects do we have of finding out at some point, albeit from one action if not more generally?
Secondly, you said we would have the results by the end of 2001.
But I think it is totally unacceptable that there can be a debate using these figures, which have been collated throughout the European Union, month by month, category by category, and only the column referring to Greece is empty.
I just wonder what we can discuss on this basis.
I apologise for having to say this, but I have run out of patience.
Greece is going through a period of transition which, I would say, equates with the first period of the policies concerning its accession to EMU.
It is clear that certain areas that have been mentioned have suffered delays in relation to other countries.
I agree with you that especially the part about statistics is extremely important, not only for the assessment but also for the implementation of policies. The undertaking in the employment action plan is a clear undertaking.
The recommendations make specific reference to this. The Employment Guidelines for 2000 give priority to the action plan.
It is one of the issues to which the Greek Government has made a commitment. I hope that this time next year we will be in a better position.
Madam President, personally I like you, but I have to say that I do not like the Greek Government, especially concerning its stance on employment. The results speak for themselves.
And I think that what you have said thus far also speaks for itself.
How can anybody shape employment policy when they do not know what employment is, when they do not know how many people have found work thanks to training programmes?
I want to focus on one thing. I want to ask you a specific question so as not to have a long discussion about this.
Specifically on training, what do you believe and what do you propose asking the Greek Government to change in the 2000-2006 period by comparison with the previous period, during which we all have the impression that things were not going well, despite the fact that the statistics were not accurate?
The information that does exist even shows that things are getting worse.
So what will change in the 2000-2006 period?
Before I start, I would like to point out that, for historical and political reasons, every country has a different starting point and that, in the framework of the Third Community Support Framework, the next five years will be a great opportunity for all countries to assess strategies and funds alike.
With specific regard to training, to which you made reference, as you know, in Greece there is the EKEPIS [National Certification Centre for Vocational Training], a certification centre set up with the approval of the Council, which has had very satisfactory results and has made some positive assessments. Over the next period it will complete its certification procedures.
In other words, it will certify trainers and programmes, which has hitherto not been carried out.
Secondly, training must be geared towards the choices made by a country in a service and information society. In other words, the fields covered by training must be linked to the choices made by the country.
Thirdly, the establishment of centres to promote employment must be completed.
So far, 24 have been established.
We must have at least 100, according to the plan that was drawn up at national level.
These centres must distance themselves from the classical provision of services for the unemployed and must come into line with the models that we already have in the European Union. These models relate to the individualised provision of services for the unemployed.
And of course the system of computerised employment cards must be implemented for monitoring to be successful.
The action plan for employment for 2000 contains these undertakings.
The funding is available for these programmes and my opinion is that, during the 2000-2006 period, training programmes must be geared towards the specific points I have mentioned.
As the author is not present, Question No 54 lapses.
Questions Nos 55, 56 and 57 will be replied to in writing.
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 58 by (H-0602/00):
Subject: Delay in issuing a 'certificate of specific character for foodstuffs' In 1994, after a long process of preparation, research and discussion in the Italian sector concerned, an application was drawn up in respect of whole virgin honey in accordance with Regulation 2082/1992/EC.
The file, accompanied by a request for a `certificate of specific characterÂŽ, was submitted by the whole virgin honey association and forwarded to the Commission by the Italian Ministry for the Environment on 8 September 1995.
It was not until August 1999 that the Commission's approval was obtained, and then only thanks to various approaches by the Italian Government and the Minister, Mr De Castro, in particular.
Since then, however, the association in question has heard nothing more.
In view of the fact that eleven months have gone by since the Commission expressed its favourable opinion, and the regulation in question lays down specific time limits for issuing the certificate, could the Commission explain the problems that have prevented the official award of the certificate and what action it intends to take to resolve them?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the registration application in respect of whole virgin honey, which is at issue here, is not in accordance with the requirements of the legal provisions currently in force in the Community.
In particular, the application of this designation is contrary to 1974 Directive 409, which is presently in force.
Therefore, it has not been possible to date, to grant the Italian application for protection by means of a 'certificate of specific character' within the meaning of Regulation 2082.
However, as you are aware, there is a proposal to amend this directive.
As soon as the Council and Parliament have amended the directive, and a designation of this kind is permissible, it will at last be possible to bring the assessment of the application for the aforesaid honey to a successful conclusion.
I am very grateful for your precision, Commissioner but I have to say that I am not satisfied.
If I am not mistaken, as I said in my question, the Commission expressed a favourable opinion.
I am aware that, since then, the common position on the directive has been redefined and that Parliament is expecting to hold a debate on the subject.
However, it would appear that the reference to regulation 2082/90 may be a departure from the directive and that the directive and the regulation could be considered to be separate channels.
I would therefore ask you to clarify this point, or I will not be a bearer of good news for the Italian farmers.
Mr President, Mr Sacconi, that is easy enough to explain.
We cannot introduce protection of origin for a product, when to do so would be contrary to Community law provisions.
Therefore, it is absolutely essential for this amended Community regulation to come into force first, because this will rule out any conflict.
It will then no longer be a problem for us to grant the protection sought by the Italian Government, or the region concerned.
Question No 59 by (H-0609/00):
Subject: EU funding to Coillte According to a European Court of Justice ruling of August 1999, Coillte has illegitimately received EU loss of income forestry grants under forestry funding Regulation 2080/92 amounting to Â£6.5 million from 1993 to 1999.
The European Court ruled that as Coillte, the Irish semi-state company responsible for forestry development, was a 'public entity' , it was not entitled to such payments.
In light of this judgment, is it the view of the Commission that Coillte is not entitled to further payments of Â£30.5 million of funds as part of the next round of forestry funding under Regulation 2080/92?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Mckenna' s question boils down to whether Coillte is entitled to receive co-financed grants from the agricultural fund, specifically the guarantee section, in order to offset loss of income in forestry developments, under Regulation 2080/92.
I would like to point out that there has been no judgement from the Court of Justice on this specific issue.
However, it is true that the Commission classifies this company called Coillte as a state enterprise, because it is owned by the Irish State.
It is therefore not entitled to loss of income grants.
According to Article 2, paragraph 2, letter b of the Regulation on Forestry, these grants are reserved for farmers and other natural or legal persons under private law.
The Commission will therefore refuse to co-finance grants paid out, backdated to 1 August 1996.
A total of some EUR 4.8 million was paid out in 1997 and 1998.
The Irish Government contested this financial rectification in so-called mediation negotiations.
The arbitration body is still working on this and has not resolved the issue conclusively as yet.
The Commission has taken the stance during these negotiations that, to date the Irish Government has failed to provide any evidence that Coillte should be classified as a private company.
The Commission is unable either to confirm the sum of GBP 6.5 million quoted by Mrs Mckenna, or that of 30.5 million, which obviously relates to future payments.
However, the Commission will adopt the same stance it has adopted to date with any future applications.
I am very glad to hear the Commission's reply because the funding that Coillte has was set up by the state, it was the state that set Coillte up.
It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development.
Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing.
What is interesting as well as that the chairman, Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments.
At a recent meeting with Coillte I was told that the government is gong to challenge this decision.
I believe it is actually a waste of taxpayers' money to challenge it because I think it is quite clear to anybody with an ounce of common sense that they are not entitled to this money.
What is really devastating is that they have actually prevented the people who should have got the money from rural depopulation for ensuring that people who did lose income actually got the money and I would like to see the Commission ensure that Coillte get no more money because they were not entitled to it in the first place and that they have to pay it back.
They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either.
Mr President, there is really nothing I can add to that.
What Mrs McKenna has just had to say describes and elucidates precisely the Commission' s position.
There can be no question of a State as an entity, and in this case, as the 100% owner of a company, being a drawer of income, and therefore it cannot suffer loss of income either.
It is therefore evident that this money must be paid back, and that this company must not receive any fresh funding.
In addition, I would point out that this mediation procedure is not equivalent to an arbitration procedure, instead it merely represents the opinion of an institution that was set up by the Community.
However, the findings are not binding on the Commission, as we have already mentioned on more than one occasion here in Parliament.
On the other hand, each party is, of course, at liberty to go to the European Court of Justice, but we have no authority to decide on the matter.
Question No 61 by (H-0618/00):
Subject: Cost of enlargement and Mediterranean agriculture In view of the forecasts and the most recent legislative proposals for Mediterranean agriculture covering products such as cotton, rice, fruit and vegetables, tomatoes, shell nuts and olive oil, which will have a highly adverse impact on employment and social progress in these poor areas of Europe, and bearing in mind the budgetary plans with a view to EU enlargement, will the Commission say how it intends to ensure that Mediterranean agriculture does not in fact end up footing the bill for future enlargement?
Commissioner, perhaps you could give me a clearer reply to the following question, which is extremely important for enlargement:
Does the Community legislation applicable to candidate countries from the moment they join, the so-called acquis communitaire, include, in your view, the aid and financial support of the CAP?
Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I assume that when you talk about support, you are referring primarily to the direct payments provided for in the market organisation, and which constitute a major theme in the enlargement debate.
You are right in principle.
All Member States will have to respect the same acquis communitaire in the long run.
Therefore, there can only be one common agricultural policy and not two different ones.
But you yourself know only too well - and this has been the case hitherto for any country acceding to the EU, be it Spain or Portugal, or any other State - that the accession treaty, which does in fact constitute a primary right, contains transitional arrangements, which of course allow for departure from the acquis in some cases.
That is, after all, the point of having transitional arrangements.
As such, it will not be possible to answer the question as to when the Member States-to-be will actually receive their full quota of direct payments - as provided for in the common market organisation - until the enlargement negotiations have been concluded.
After all, it is precisely this issue that the enlargement negotiations are focussing on.
Question No 62 by (H-0633/00):
Subject: Subsidies for growing tobacco Tobacco growing in the European Union is subsidised to the tune of millions of euros per year while at the same time over half a million EU citizens die each year of diseases caused by tobacco.
The subsidies paid for tobacco growing should be redirected so that they encourage current tobacco farmers to go over to growing healthier crops.
How does the Commission propose in future to amend the basis for the allocation of structural fund aid so that large-scale tobacco growing can be halted in the EU?
What does the Commission consider would be a realistic timetable for carrying out the necessary changes?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m' s question covers old ground as I see it.
I would remind the House that the Commission presented Parliament and the Council with a report on the common market organisation of tobacco as early as 1996.
The report pointed out that this sector makes a decisive contribution to maintaining the viability of certain regions within the Community, some of which are highly disadvantaged, and where there are few alternatives.
In the light of an inquiry at the time into the social and economic consequences of abolishing Community subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the decision was taken not to go down this path.
However, this was also because there was evidence to show that subsidising tobacco cultivation has practically no effect on tobacco consumption, and thus on the risk to EU citizens ' health.
This led to radical reform of the tobacco sector in 1998.
The key aspects of this reform were as follows: firstly, there was an improvement in quality, in particular, tobacco growers switched over to low-nicotine and low-tar varieties.
Secondly, research activities have been stepped up, financed by the Community tobacco fund.
The appropriations for said fund were doubled.
One of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the possibility of switching from tobacco cultivation to alternative activities.
Thirdly, with a view to encouraging farmers to go over to other crops, the reform measures also made provision for a mechanism whereby quotas are repurchased from farmers who are willing to give up tobacco cultivation.
In this way, these farmers are offered money, as it were, in order to facilitate conversion to other crops.
The provisions laid down in the tobacco market organisation can also be supplemented within the framework of the support measures for rural development.
On a final note, I would just like to say that the Commission will of course assess the reform measures taken.
We will provide the European Parliament with a report on the functioning of the amended market organisation by 1 April 2002.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your replies.
This is a question of redirecting aid in support of other products.
I have made these comments on many an occasion, as nothing rocks mankind so much as tobacco, which kills so many.
Regarding the analyses you refer to, I would like to know on what sort of objective analyses they are based, as I am concerned about the health of all of us and, similarly, the livelihoods of tobacco farmers.
We should be able to change their means of livelihood and keep them at that economic level where they can produce health products for all of us.
Mr President, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, I am sorry that there was no interpretation at the beginning.
To be brief: naturally I would be only too pleased to send you the analysis that was carried out at the time.
The social implications, and the effect on income were also assessed during this analysis.
I will gladly make the documents you have requested available to you.
Is the Commissioner aware of research at the Scottish Crop Research Institute in Invergowrie near Dundee that shows that tobacco plants can be genetically modified to accept the implanting for multiplication of potential anti-cancer vaccines?
It is quite ironic really.
Would it not be desirable to redirect the European tobacco-growing industry towards such benign purposes and to further promote this type of research?
Mr President, Mr Purvis, I have to be quite honest with you, and tell you that I have not been informed about the results of this research; perhaps because it was conducted primarily for health reasons, and therefore falls within the remit of the Commissioner responsible for health.
But I am keen to acquaint myself with them.
Only, irrespective of whether these results are positive or less than positive, as I see it, it is imperative that we - and we must never forget this - convince smokers of their importance, with a view to encouraging them to buy cigarettes that meet these requirements.
It is not the tobacco growers' problem, because they will inevitably grow the kind of tobacco the market demands.
Perhaps the best all-round solution is to carry on as I have been doing for the past 15 years - I too was a smoker in the past - and not smoke at all. Then the problem will only exist on a very small scale.
Mr President, preventive health care is a major priority for everyone here in this House.
We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question, although I have always been, and still am, a non-smoker: does the Commission not think that if tobacco cultivation were to be completely discontinued within the European Union with immediate effect - as called for by a fair number of people - people would just carry on smoking regardless because tobacco products would be imported into the EU?
Commission. (DE) Mrs Schierhuber, when you look at the balance of trade in the tobacco sector, you notice that the vast majority of products - and especially tobacco - used in the manufacture of cigarettes, are already imported.
The only difference is that, we are trying, as it were, with the aid of the common market organisation, to produce some of the tobacco that people consume anyway, ourselves, so that we do not have to import everything.
In so doing, we are giving some families the opportunity to draw an income from this type of cultivation.
I am absolutely convinced that the health problem, which undoubtedly exists as a result of tobacco consumption, can only be brought under control if we alert consumers as to the effect smoking can have on their health.
There will be no decline in tobacco consumption until we have succeeded in driving this message home to consumers.
We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side.
In economic terms, the only way to achieve this is to alter patterns in demand.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler, for your replies.
Questions Nos 63 to 109 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Water policy
The next item is the report (A5-0214/00) by Mrs Lienemann, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on the Council directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy [C5-347/2000 - 1997/0067 (COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that together we have produced a useful piece of work in this water framework directive.
We have produced a useful piece of work; it may be a collective compromise, but it is a compromise which incorporates stringent requirements, which I think will clear the way for a qualitative and quantitative leap in water management.
In the long term, our fellow European citizens must enjoy high quality water everywhere, whether surface or groundwater.
This compromise was made possible by active commitment, by the balance of power that the European Parliament was able to create, by the participation of all the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs who assisted me, and by Mr Provan, the chairman of our delegation in this difficult conciliation procedure.
I would, however, also like to thank the other participants who are, of course, the Commission, which had to play the role of intermediary and technical innovator, and did so extremely rigorously and effectively, the Commissioner and also all the staff of the Commission.
I would also like to thank the Council, especially the Portuguese Presidency and their Minister of State, Mr Pedro Silva Perreira, who made this agreement possible.
I have all the more reason for saying this, because this directive certainly requires a greater effort on the part of the southern European countries than it does from other Community countries with easier access to water.
In which areas has significant progress been made?
Firstly, the directive is strictly binding in legislative terms.
Second, the implementation of measures concerning the issue that we in Parliament considered absolutely crucial, that is the elimination of priority hazardous substances and a complete end to discharges of such substances.
You are aware that this House wanted our directive to be compatible with the commitments given under international conventions, in particular OSPAR, as stated in the directive.
The arrangements introduced will clear the way for a list of priority substances to be gradually drawn up every 4 years, that is, priority substances which must be reduced in quantity, and priority hazardous substances, which must purely and simply be eliminated.
Third, there was the important and sensitive matter of groundwater.
We were faced with the problem of producing a rigorous definition of what we called good groundwater status.
In order for this good status to be specified, it was decided that a 'daughter' directive should be drawn up, that is, a directive that will implement the framework directive.
Parliament was rather afraid that the new directive would provide an opportunity to delay requirements to combat pollution and immediate measures to prevent the pollution of groundwater.
This is why we wanted, and secured, the stipulation, first of all, that if the directive were not approved by the Members of the European Parliament, the Member States would draw up rules guaranteeing good groundwater status.
If the Member States did not do this - it is a kind of Sword of Damocles - if 75% of the level laid down in the applicable pollution standards governing good groundwater status is reached, then the Member States will have to reverse the trend.
In general, the directive takes account of Parliament's determination to ensure that action by the Member States enables any upward trends in the pollution of groundwater to be reversed.
So you see, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that in this way we have come up with a system that enables us to make significant progress, and not just in terms of the main principles, but also in the overall effectiveness of the decisions that have been made.
Nonetheless, we shall all have to be vigilant.
Firstly with regard to all the daughter directives, which will implement the framework directive.
We shall be involved in the codecision procedure to determine the list of priority substances and priority hazardous substances.
A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed.
The second major task for this House will be the substance of the framework directive on groundwater.
In short, I think we have done the bulk of the work.
We will continue to work together, but I have a feeling that at the dawn of the 21st century, with this framework directive, Europe is entering a new age where the protection of water, that most fundamental resource, will become a priority in terms of policy and the behaviour of all those involved, whether they be farmers, industrialists or consumers.
In any event, this is the intention of our directive and I have no doubt that the Commission and the Member States will ensure that it is implemented.
Mr President, with the outcome of the conciliation concerning the Water Framework Directive, we are completing what, for the European Parliament, has been a tough but successful piece of work lasting ten years. At the same time, however, we are, as a result, standing on the threshold of new tasks that are at least as important.
Since the end of the 1980s, a range of Commission proposals had been submitted to the House, aimed at revising existing directives and made necessary by scientific and technical developments.
When those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy initially examined the proposals, we found that no effort had been made to coordinate their provisions or the concepts behind them.
In June 1995, and at our group' s insistence, the European Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held a hearing of experts on the European Union' s water policy.
The experts' statements confirmed our concerns.
The Council and the Commission complied with the call for comprehensive European water protection legislation to be drawn up.
The idea of the current Water Framework Directive was born at that time.
In February 1996, the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication.
In a very comprehensive report, our fellow PPE-DE Group member, Mr Florenz, has clarified the European Parliament' s aims and identified the current shortcomings.
In the light of the discussions between the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission proposal of December 1996, which had been produced under great pressure of time, was supplemented in two stages in 1997.
The definitive, official Commission proposal was finally ready in February 1998.
By working together closely in this way, Parliament and the European Commission gradually moved towards a consensus, a process also helped by the intensive discussions during the first and second readings in the European Parliament and the conciliation procedure.
I should particularly like to thank the Commissioners responsible, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, and especially the Commission officials involved, for this constructive cooperation.
In Parliament' s view, the result we now have before us is a great success of a kind which would still have been unthinkable two years ago.
This success is reflected in the removal from the statute books of the hitherto fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection, the coherence of the relevant water directives at EU level, the legally binding nature of the measures taken pursuant to Article 4, the shortening of the deadline for complying with the aims of the directive, the satisfactory way in which the issue of costs has been settled, also in accordance with Ireland' s wishes, the introduction of the combined approach whereby limit values and quality objectives are established with a view to reducing the levels of pollutants, significant improvements over the common position regarding the requirements for groundwater protection and, finally, the inclusion of the goal and the definition of the OSPAR Convention with no stipulations in terms of time.
I should like once again to make explicitly clear in this connection the particular importance we attach to reconciling Community law and international conventions, albeit in such a way that the substance of international conventions does not automatically become legally binding in Community law.
Finally, mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures.
Welcome as this result is, we cannot, however, rest on our laurels.
The Water Framework Directive now needs to be put into effect.
I should also, of course, particularly like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and, finally and most especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.
Our shared success has only been made possible by her incredible commitment and the huge amount of time and energy she put into her work.
It was a pleasure for me to cooperate with a colleague in this way.
My own special thanks go to you, Mrs Lienemann, and our own staff here in Parliament.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, very much indeed, as we can all see how committed she was to this work.
In addition, Parliament got its own point of view across quite well, especially with regard to the important issue that, at last, we have the prospect of attaining a situation in which hazardous substances can no longer get into groundwater supplies.
In my opinion, it should be as clear as day that when we know a substance is dangerous, in no case should it be able to get into groundwater, as water, apart from anything else, is a very important resource for people in terms of health.
Obviously it is just regrettable that the deadlines for implementation are an unreasonably long way off.
All in all it has to be said that in certain fields of industry in the European Union we have made progress.
In many areas, for example, the community and industry have played their part relatively well.
Agriculture and forestry, however, are still problems, with their diffuse discharges.
More needs to be done about this.
Regarding consumers it is naturally important how consumption is controlled, and here charges and taxation are of prime importance.
For that reason, it is a bit hard for me to understand how people can even begin to think that water could be a commodity paid for out of general taxes, as it is only through charges that consumption can be controlled really sensibly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the Edinburgh Summit nearly ten years ago, Mr Kohl and Mr Major assured one another that there was no need for a European water policy.
If the Spanish wish to pollute their water, they should do just that.
But the tide of deregulation has turned.
In 1996, the Commission proposed the ecological water directive, which did not amount to more than five pages, however.
We now have a substantial legislative document of 60 pages, with 90 pages of appendix.
This is thanks to cross-party cooperation, between the groups within the European Parliament. I would especially like to thank Mrs Lienemann, but also Chris Davies from the liberal group and Mrs Schleicher from the Christian-Democrats.
The Greens feel that 80% of this document has been a success.
What was disappointing was the water price policy.
What is successful is the fact that we have a new principle for chemical substances.
Chemical substances are no longer banned because they are also harmful to human health, but in line with a new principle that harmful substances do not belong in the water.
I think we can be proud of this.
Mr President, the conciliation has been quite difficult.
This has to do with the fact that the subject is itself both extensive and technically very complicated.
It also has to do with the fact that the positions of Parliament and the Council were far apart when the conciliation began.
The fact that the result has turned out as well as it has is largely due to the tireless and committed work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, whom we wish to thank.
The directive could, of course, have been still better and beefed up even more, for example as far as the timetables are concerned.
That would have been desirable.
Yet, it is obvious that the European Parliament has gained most and that the Council has had to give most ground in the negociations that have taken place.
The clearest proof of this is that the rules are binding, something which Parliament had demanded.
In certain respects the directive forms a framework whose contents are still unclear.
This is especially true in the case of the phasing-out of dangerous substances.
This is an issue upon which further work will be done in the daughter directives.
Crucial to how the directive will operate is the question of how it will be implemented and monitored.
All in all, the foundations have been laid for a coherent water policy and for long-term improvements in water quality.
We shall therefore be happy to vote in favour of the proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say that I am making this speech on behalf of Mrs GarcÃ­a Orcoyen, who was unable to attend this sitting.
Tomorrow's approval of this framework directive will represent a great step forward on the road to the cohesion and harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States with regard to the quantity and quality of their water.
In this last stage of the long parliamentary process undergone by this directive, in particular during conciliation, the European Parliament has been able to present a united front in defending its arguments before the Council.
The rapporteur's superb coordination and the will to reach an understanding shown by all the political groups have made this final text possible, and it has been improved in basic aspects such as the legally binding nature of the objectives without omitting to take account of the various problems in the Member States.
I must also congratulate the Council on its flexibility in the face of the criticisms put forward by Parliament, and the Commission for its effective mediation.
Tomorrow, a new and equally important stage in the directive' s development will begin, in which the European Parliament must continue to participate extremely actively in monitoring and controlling the fulfilment of objectives and deadlines and the drawing-up of reports or legislative acts derived from the directive.
One of the weakest points to have become apparent during the drawing-up stage must be strengthened: the incontestable need for more and better means of technical advice for subjects which, like this, require highly specific knowledge, and in which the social and economic cost of a small calculation error can be great.
Finally, I would like to emphasise what makes this directive a real tool for sustainable development: the balance achieved in the consideration of water as an extremely valuable economic resource and as an essential element in the conservation of European ecosystems.
The development of this directive may provide an important meeting point in the much-reviled relationship between economy and ecology.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Water Framework Directive contains many positive initiatives in favour of comprehensive and integrated water protection.
Yet the objectives are timid, vague and extremely long term.
We cannot wait 30 years for the European Court of Justice to decide whether or not the environmental objectives are in fact legally binding.
The Member States have been called upon to improve the quality of our water quickly in order to achieve the objectives in 15 years' time.
Where groundwater protection is concerned, Parliament has unfortunately bowed to the interests of industrial agriculture and recognised its right to go on polluting the environment to the same degree.
It is now also the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that existing standards are not undermined, the yardstick by which the success of the Water Framework Directive will be measured.
Any more kow-towing to industrial agriculture would lead in the longer term to our most important drinking water resources being destroyed once and for all.
We are pleased, however, that the Greens have achieved a great breakthrough when it comes to emissions of dangerous substances, which now have to be identified on the list of priority substances.
In this area, we must make genuine efforts to meet the OSPAR objectives as well and to avoid what is an incalculably serious risk to health and the environment.
Mr President, the forthcoming Water Framework Directive is based on the justified principle that citizens of the European Community are entitled to use drinking water on a daily basis.
This should be provided for by law.
A simple, uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed.
Important directives such as those on protecting the food we eat, on municipal sewage disposal, on plant protection and on nitrates are being revised and redefined on the basis both of ecological criteria and criteria of origin.
The tasks are therefore broadly defined.
As a farmer, I advocate the closer involvement of those who represent the interests of professional groups and serious consideration of their criticisms.
Farming, forestry, fisheries and, in particular, the horticultural industry should also be involved in the decision-making process so that the required combination of voluntary restraint and state regulation is achieved.
The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone.
Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community.
I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, it was a very turbulent night sitting in which Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed upon a common water policy for all Member States.
Parliament' s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding.
Let us remember, however, that until the very end a number of Member States vehemently resisted any requirement that they should manage their own water resources more carefully and in an environmentally more conscious way in future.
However, it was splendid to see the way in which the Members of the European Parliament transcended all party differences and quite clearly agreed that there should be no common position without a legal requirement.
A further important victory for MEPs involved the protection of groundwater.
Dangerous substances must completely have disappeared from groundwater within 20 years of the Directive' s publication.
Will we achieve this objective?
It now remains for whatever dangerous substances are meant here to be listed in an annex to the Directive, and it is already clear to me that there will certainly be further heated discussions on this matter.
I believe, however, that the great objective of protecting Europe' s groundwater for future generations is not in dispute.
The process of re-thinking has taken place: a considerable victory for the political process and a considerable victory on behalf of our children.
I am pleased that there has been a satisfactory outcome to the conciliation procedure with regard to the important report dealing with numerous technical issues on water policy, an outcome which we owe to the persistence, competence and motivation of our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.
Over the next quarter-century, we will make more progress in this field in the protection, good management and renewal of this resource than in the discovery and exploitation of new deposits.
I would like to make two points to emphasise the importance of integrated water management:
firstly, I would like studies to be carried out on the establishment of a federal "water and environment" management system in the various countries at European Union level,
second, we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are implemented and encourage them, not only at European Union level, but also in the aid that we give to third countries in the form of "water" projects, the impact of which lies in a hydrographic ecosystem affecting the countries of the European Union, but also those that are part of the MEDA agreements, for example, which must be taken account of in the MAP projects and even in others, like the Upper Nile basin or Switzerland.
Mr President, the commitment that has been obtained on the text of the new Water Framework Directive is generally positive, even though it contains certain controversial aspects, worthy of criticism, which can nevertheless be ironed out when the various studies, action plans and draft regulations provided for in the text we have just approved are drafted.
It is a positive development that water management requirements are to be integrated into a single system - hydrological basin management, which is based more on geographical and hydrological areas than on administrative and national borders. This is a particularly important issue for Portugal, whose main rivers are shared with our neighbour, Spain.
Equally positive is the statement that water is not a commodity that should be bought and sold like any other. This means, of course, that special measures must be put in place to protect a commodity that is publicly owned, whilst safeguarding the interests of the population, in particular, domestic water supply and agricultural activity, especially small farms and family-based holdings.
The final text does state that Member States can attend to the social and economic effects on the affected area as well as the geographic and climatic conditions. This will enable Member States to deal with their different situations by means of established exceptions, which may nevertheless prove to be insufficient to cope with agricultural situations in the South, particularly where Portugal is concerned.
We shall nevertheless pay close attention to the way this policy is implemented in practice in the years to come.
Mr President, this is a framework directive with ambitious targets for the protection and improvement of water quality, taking account of the polluter-pays principle.
We will not have the entire picture until the relevant daughter directives are in place over the next few years.
Water pricing policies by the year 2010 will have to provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently.
The new paragraph 4 of Article 9 will allow for the continuation of the established practice in Ireland of not applying water charges to the domestic water sector.
You can only govern with the consent of the people and by 2010 domestic water charges could well be acceptable to the Irish electorate.
At the moment, it is a hugely politically-charged issue.
I thank my colleagues for their understanding, particularly Mrs Schleicher, who represented our case with understanding through all stages, especially at conciliation.
The principle of subsidiarity in relation to water pricing policy is jealously guarded in Ireland, but public opinion will probably change by 2010.
If we do not apply household or domestic water charges by then we will have to explain our action to the Commission.
There is growing appreciation in Ireland that clean drinking water is a scarce resource and that all services, particularly the cost of distributing clean water to all households, have to be paid for.
At the moment the central exchequer or the taxpayer, is paying for this, yet many do not benefit.
Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges.
Many are on group water schemes which are not part of the public water supply and have to pay dearly each year for the privilege of rather questionable quality water being distributed to their houses.
So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion.
Mr President, I believe that today we are witnessing an important act.
We are coming to the end of a long road on which there has been a long battle, long discussions, but in the end, some positive agreements and constructive positions on the part of the three institutions, the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which have made this agreement possible.
As with any agreement, some will think it too little, others too much, but there is a middle point, a balance that is acceptable for the diverging points of view of those who have worked all this time.
Furthermore, they have carried out serious work on a highly complex subject.
On behalf of my colleague, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, I would like thank Mrs Lienemann for her kind words. As rapporteur for all this work, she has played a leading part and carried out a colossal task, with the persistence and tenacity of her principles which, combined with a dose of realism, have enabled this agreement to be reached.
As she herself points out, and this is no minor issue, a subject such as water demonstrates the diversity of Europe, with its radically differing characteristics between countries.
In some countries, vast expanses have under 400 millimetres per year, that is, semi-arid zones, while in others the average far exceeds 2 500 or 3 000 millimetres.
The focal point of this directive, in which water is considered as a whole, a total flow, with no distinction between surface and groundwater, which is the mistake that was made for a long time, is the right focal point and implies a step forward.
The effort to keep our aquifers in the European Union as clean as possible, or as unpolluted as possible, is a key effort if we want to guarantee balanced development, sustainable development and a habitable Europe for future generations.
On this subject, I have to say that a moment ago one of the Members referred to conversations between two European leaders.
Yes, some may still pollute their aquifers, but some have been polluting them for some time, for example with huge pig farms.
I do not want to go into detail, but people in glass houses should not throw stones.
Mr President, I would like to point out that monitoring and follow-up are essential to this directive.
Monitoring and follow-up that, subsequent to the flexibility and realistic approach that abound in all the articles of the directive, will undoubtedly allow us to guarantee the cleanliness of our water.
This is absolutely essential as, in short, there is no life without clean water.
Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission what is happening with the 1991 Directive on ecological water quality which has so far not officially been withdrawn by the European Commission.
One further request, both to Parliament' s President and to the Council and the Commission: the texts are still deficient in so far as the specialist terminology in the specific languages is not correct.
I would ask for this to be re-examined, for the terminology in each country is quite distinct.
It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised.
It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology.
I would therefore ask for this matter to be looked into again.
In the German version alone, I have found more than twenty mistakes.
I happily leave it to you to examine this matter.
Mr President, with regard to the directive on ecological water quality, to which I believe Mrs Schleicher is referring, this framework directive incorporates all the essential elements of the proposal on the ecological quality of water and I understand that the latter has already been withdrawn.
If this is not the case, it will be withdrawn in the near future.
With regard to the translation problem, what Mrs Schleicher is referring to is a very important factor as the terminology is indeed highly technical in this field and a suitable translation is essential.
I shall simply pass on these observations to the competent departments and the translation departments in particular so that, if appropriate, a more detailed revision of the specific terminology and definitions contained in the directive may be carried out.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
End-of-life vehicles
The next item is the report (A5-0212/2000) by Mr Florenz, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a Council directive on end-of-life vehicles [C5-258/2000 - 1997/0194 (COD)].
Mr President, to begin with, I should like to take the opportunity of thanking my colleagues for bravely cooperating in the intensive way they did.
It was, of course, not always as simple as that. With me, it never is.
However, I am very grateful to you that we have got through all this.
A number of years ago, the European institutions made the right decision to attend to private motoring.
We began with cars and oil and are now faced with the question of what to do with the nine million cars which end up on the scrap heap every year.
Tonight, we shall also be discussing tyres, and we shall certainly one day also have to discuss how roads need to look in the future, given that they are much too noisy.
In view of the nine million cars withdrawn from circulation every year and the 45 million litres or so of waste oil, I think something needed to be done about this issue.
I believe the Commission has undoubtedly submitted a somewhat overly prescriptive proposal with, in my opinion, some outmoded initiatives in terms of environmental policy. Fortunately, more work has, however, been done upon the proposal in the course of the three readings, and we now have a proposal which is along the right lines.
Let us bear in mind that, where motoring as a whole is concerned, 80% of damage to the environment is due to driving, 19% to car manufacture and only 1% to the disposal of vehicles. We must therefore set the correct priorities where this issue too is concerned.
I therefore believe that, by setting exhaust values and quality standards for fuel, we have begun in the right way, and today we closed with the question: how do we deal with the issue of end-of-life vehicles?
We have introduced rigid quotas, without which no progress can be made.
This Parliament ought also, however, to have had the courage to make a really bold decision in favour of a really new type of car for the future, one which will not weigh 1 500 kg but perhaps only 1 000 kg and which, with its lifetime 'mileage' of 300 000 km, may be seen to have genuine advantages in terms of environmental policy.
On the basis of the Commission' s proposal, we have unfortunately allowed ourselves to be persuaded to adopt old quotas which frankly promote cars made of steel rather than modern, versatile cars which are made of other materials and which are much lighter.
Cars of this kind, made out of plastic or fibreglass or whatever, do not, however, have the advantage of being able to be recycled.
How, for example, can you seriously expect to recycle an airbag, which is there as a safety feature and not for recycling purposes?
A bold move towards a special quota for really light cars would therefore have been appropriate in this case.
Unfortunately, we have missed that opportunity, something I particularly regret.
One general point - and also a disputed one in this House - was the question of costs.
The Commission has been quick to say that, in the future, all costs are to be borne by the manufacturer.
At first glance, that is a brilliant idea. The only thing is that, in the end, this would harm the consumer by eliminating competition.
And that is my overall objection to this Directive.
Certainly, we would now be clearly transferring the costs to the manufacturer, but to one who no longer had any competition and who would in future dictate the cost of recycling cars. And it is precisely this which is anti the consumer.
We need more, not less, input from the market in this area.
This is a wrong decision, which I very much regret because it will have consequences.
We see this already where computers are concerned. The Directive concerned is, in fact, on the table.
Before long, it will be lawnmowers, then mopeds and then furniture which will be subject to such directives. I wonder to whom, one day, we shall return our old roads when they are too noisy, and who is to pay for the transaction.
Cost allocation is therefore not as simple as all that.
I should really have liked things to have worked out differently, but I accept the majority decision.
The bans on metals are quite in order because we need, in the longer term, to come up with a ban, and not only because of the scientific results.
We have made exceptions which will be reviewed by the Commission in three years' time for, together with the scientific advisory board, the Commission has overall responsibility for making the relevant decisions in this area in three years' time.
I believe it will do so.
All in all, I believe that, apart from the issue of cost, this Directive is a great success and marks a step forward.
I would thank the Commission and the Council and, once again, my fellow MEPs.
It has been a pleasure to work with you.
Mr President, I too have reason to thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz.
I also found that the Parliamentary delegation very much got its act together during the conciliation and has finished by submitting a very good proposal.
Two aspects are of particular importance for me. First of all, we have succeeded in clarifying the fact that, from the end of next year, end-of-life vehicles will have to be properly disposed of throughout the European Union.
In other words, it will no longer be possible to dispose of cars illegally or to abandon them somewhere in the woods. Nor will there be the impulse to export them in one way or another to Eastern Europe.
Instead, they will have to be properly disposed of on the spot by authorised companies.
For me, that is one of the great, fundamental successes of this directive.
The second important point for me is no longer the issue of costs and competition.
These are problems we argued a bit about and finally solved quite reasonably by means of a compromise which all sides find workable. Instead, the second important point is the fact that, by means of this Directive, we have established that new cars must demonstrate in their type verification and test that they are easy to recycle.
In this Directive, we are calling upon the Commission to alter the directive on type licensing so that, in the future, new cars have to be built in such a way that they can easily be recycled.
That is the crucial thing.
In that way, we are moving away from the end-of-pipe technology whereby we always have to consider what to do with the remains of cars.
Instead, we need to bear in mind, right from the time that vehicles are built, that cars, like other products, have to be re-used and disposed of.
That is precisely the right way of going about matters, and I am therefore very pleased that we have got the directive up and running in this way.
Mr President, the compromise that has been reached is a great success for environmental and consumer protection.
It is the first time that manufacturers' liability for waste has been up for debate at all, and the fact that manufacturers' liability is soon to become a reality is to be welcomed.
The compromise reached on heavy metals is also a giant step towards an environmentally friendly strategy for dealing with the flow of materials.
I believe that this outcome, which is also excellent from a green point of view, will help encourage the motor industry to be more innovative and to begin to develop cars which can be recycled more easily.
However, the compromise is also a slap in the face for our Chancellor and, more precisely, for the German car industry, particularly Volkswagen which has unfortunately tried to stand in the way of this Motor Directive.
I also hope that the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, will draw the relevant lessons from this debate and, when it comes to the Directive on Electronic Waste - which is again concerned with manufacturers' liability - will also, in actual fact, try to act in the interests of the consumer.
I hope too that we do not allow ourselves to be put under pressure by individual industrial interests.
Mr President, our group is quite satisfied with the result of the conciliation, even if there is always, of course, room for a little further progress.
Our objective has always been to obtain as soon as possible a comprehensive system for recovering end-of-life vehicles, with stringent demands in terms of recycling and a ban on dangerous substances.
We also wanted manufacturers to be held completely liable, so that it is the manufacturers who take financial responsibility for recovery.
Once this decision has been made, the position in a few years' time will be quite close to what we had wanted to achieve.
What is worth noting, as far as the conciliation process is concerned, is the fact that Parliament has unfortunately slowed down this development towards manufacturer' s liability instead of speeding it up.
It would be quite alarming if Parliament were to exchange roles and, instead of making the running, hand over that role to its opponents.
Mr President, as the rapporteur and Mr Lange have already said, the positive outcome of this legislative procedure is useful, not just in terms of what the directive lays down but also because it marks the start of a process and there is the prospect of a gradual change across the entire manufacturing process in a sector as important as the automotive industry, and a review of the entire process, from vehicle design through to the choice of new materials and components to make proper recycling possible.
Not only is manufacturing reconciled with environmental protection, but we are taking the first steps along the road which has been defined as the environmental conversion of the economy, in what is, I repeat, such an important industry.
Of course, we have only achieved this result after complex negotiations with car manufacturers, who have at last agreed to bear the financial burden of scrapping cars as from 2007.
Lastly, it is important to highlight another point too, which is of a more specific political-institutional nature.
Let us be honest, we are all aware that we started the conciliation procedure from very opposed positions - there was even a certain amount of interinstitutional tension between Parliament and the Council - with many national differences in terms of both experience and interests.
And yet, thanks to the commitment and sense of responsibility of all concerned, we reached a consensus in a difficult, major and highly controversial field, and in doing so we have added another building block in the construction of Europe. At this point in time, in terms of the more general debate currently underway, this is a significant result.
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to end-of-life vehicles, we have reached a sound compromise.
For the first time, European legislation defines manufacturer' s liability in no uncertain terms.
In 1994, the packaging directive provided for liability to be shared between the government and manufacturers.
This has proved ineffective in practice.
We are now dealing with manufacturer' s liability in the case of end-of-life vehicles.
I welcome this for it will be in the interests of manufacturers to produce their cars in such a way that they can be recycled more easily.
Unfortunately, the text stipulates that the manufacturer will be wholly or mainly responsible.
This means that systems will be set up which differ from country to country, which is unfortunate, as this runs counter to the internal market idea.
In the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive, this must be regulated more effectively.
We need to move towards individual manufacturer' s liability.
My own country, the Netherlands, has a great deal to learn in this respect.
Mr President, it is true that the legislative procedure has been long and difficult, and I have said so.
It should be noted that the Commission's initial proposal was presented in July 1997.
During this prolonged procedure and in spite of the complexity of the legislation, it has been possible to solve a series of problems thanks to the colegislators and, once again, to the three institutions' will to come to an agreement.
I am therefore pleased with the agreement on a joint text, reached on 23 May this year at the Conciliation Committee.
I would particularly like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and to the members of the said committee.
I am sure that the joint text represents a good balance between the need to guarantee a high level of environmental protection and the legitimate concerns of the various participants.
I would, however, like to emphasise three statements that the Commission will make when it adopts the directive.
The aim of these three is to make some clarifications which the Commission considers to be essential.
Firstly, the provision laid down in Article 5(1) does not oblige the Member States to establish separate collection systems with special funding requirements, but allows them to use the existing waste collection systems.
Second, with regard to Article 5(3), it is the responsibility of the Member States to decide which producers, concessionaries and collectors must be registered in accordance with the framework directive on waste or in a new register created specifically.
Third, I would like to clarify that Article 7(1) does not lay down requirements, conditions or additional criteria in relation to the technical inspection of vehicles.
Generally speaking, this text constitutes a significant step towards sustainable production and consumption, a model for future Community initiatives in the field of specific waste management such as, for example, the directive on electrical and electronic waste, to which reference has been made.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Once again, I congratulate all the speakers and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on the work carried out.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Air transport and the environment
The next item is the report (A5-0187/2000) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Air Transport and the Environment [COM(1999) 640 - C5-0086/2000 - 2000/2054 (COS)].
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on a very timely and far-reaching communication which explicitly acknowledges the rapidly growing environmental impact of air transport and clearly recognises that this growth is unsustainable.
Before coming to the proposals contained in my report, it would be helpful to remind ourselves of some of the key issues in this debate.
Essentially, the problem can be expressed very simply: aviation is growing at an unsustainable rate.
It is a serious environmental threat and not only is it a problem, but we are actually subsidising that sector, which is making the situation very much worse.
In terms of aviation growth, air traffic is forecast to almost double in the next 15 years.
When you think what that means in terms of congestion and environmental impact, then clearly that is a nightmare.
To take a case that I know well in the UK, the government's own air traffic forecasts which were published in June this year show total passenger numbers at UK airports rising from 160 million in 1998 to 400 million in just over 20 years' time.
That increase of 240 million is equivalent to four new airports the size of London Heathrow or eight new airports the size of London Gatwick.
Obviously the environmental consequences of such expansion would be totally unacceptable and these projections only serve to show the nonsense of assuming the possibility of continuous exponential growth.
What are the environmental impacts of this growth?
On the noise side, we know that as far as ordinary people on the ground are concerned those changes that have been introduced to make individual aircraft quieter are actually in danger of being cancelled out by the increasing frequency of each noise incident.
On the emission side, air travel is the world's fastest growing sources of greenhouse gases which cause climate change.
That may only count for 3% of total emissions today, but by 2050 it is projected it could account for up to 15% of total global emissions or even more.
You would think that litany of environmental problems, coupled with a projected growth that is clearly unsustainable, might have produced some measures to discourage the exponential growth of this sector, but not a bit of it.
On the contrary, global aviation policies are actually encouraging the unrestrained growth of this sector.
Aviation is massively subsidised.
Unlike motor vehicles or trains, airlines pay no tax on their fuel. Indeed it has been calculated that the European aviation sector receives about EUR 30 billion in subsidies every year.
To mention some of the key points of my report very briefly: on noise, current noise standards for new aircraft have actually been in existence since 1977 and there is therefore an urgent need for more stringent standards.
I am recommending that the EU uses the World Health Organisation's own guidelines for Community noise to develop new guidelines for daytime and night-time exposure by 2003.
On emissions, a perfectly feasible target for the developed countries would be to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 5% on 1992 levels by 2012, which is the first budget period according to the Kyoto Protocol.
This would be a first step to reverse the current exemption of international aviation from responsibilities.
On subsidies, the report makes it clear that in principle we support the taxing of aircraft fuel at an international level, but we recognise that there are political difficulties with this because of the need to get international agreements at ICAO.
In the light of those political difficulties, we are proposing instead an environmental charge based on the polluter-pays principle.
In fact, such a charge would be a more subtle instrument since it could actually be calculated to reflect both the amount of fuel used and also, by factoring in the efficiency of the aircraft's engine, the amount of pollutants generated.
Indeed the political difficulties of introducing such a measure would disappear since it is perfectly within the rights of the EU to introduce a levy on all flights starting from airports in the EU.
One final but very important point, you will hear the airlines say that all this is very well but it should be undertaken by ICAO, the international body.
The fact that it is an international body means that it moves at a very slow pace and what the Commission communication proposes - and what I endorse in my report - is the principle that some of the more industrialised regions like the EU should be able to move more swiftly towards more stringent standards than other regions like the developing countries.
This does not spell the end of ICAO.
What it does is to introduce some flexibility into ICAO which is perfectly consistent with other international organisations.
Others do just the same thing.
The reaction of the airlines is to ask why we are picking on them.
In fact, clearly the opposite is the case.
The airlines have been getting away with not paying their way for over 50 years.
Meanwhile, other Members of this House are quick to claim that the measures I propose will have devastating effects on the European aviation sector.
That is nonsense.
An environmental charge along the lines I have described would not have adverse effects on competition because it is levied on all airlines using EU airports regardless of their origin.
They claim it will have crippling effects on the European economy and that too is nonsense.
The aviation sector is responsible for some jobs but it should not be forgotten that making aviation pay its way in terms of taxation will create thousands of jobs in other sectors.
So I commend this report to you.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that all Members of this House care deeply about the environment despite the fact that the rapporteur and members of the Greens would have you believe otherwise.
Environmental concerns must, however, be balanced against the needs of the aviation industry to ensure its success in the future.
I was disappointed with the report from the Commission, not least because it was so negative towards aviation.
Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur.
I would like to assist honourable Members by pointing out the following information: air transport is responsible for generating 25 million direct jobs world-wide.
In the United Kingdom alone aviation is responsible for supporting nearly 500 000 jobs.
The United Kingdom transports GBP 35 billion worth of exports, maintaining unrivalled access to global markets and contributes around GBP 3 billion per annum to the exchequer.
If multiplied by the number of countries in the European Union one can see and understand just how important this industry is to our economies.
In terms of environmental impact, aviation uses less than 8% of the land required for rail and less than 1% required for road use.
In practical terms, aside from maritime transport, aviation is the only form of international transport now transporting a third of all goods world-wide.
Over the past 15 years CO2 emissions have declined by 70% and unburned hydrocarbons by 85%.
Aviation is responsible for just 2.5% of CO2 emissions.
Short-term measures are available, such as tackling the 44% air traffic flow management delays and 30 bottlenecks which take place over France, Italy, Spain and parts of Germany.
National governments must take action now.
They should also tackle land planning around existing airports and take responsibility for their decisions in the past.
To suggest that either a tax on kerosene, which is internationally exempt from tax for the aviation industry, or VAT on tickets or aircraft purchases is the answer is incorrect.
The industry already pays all its infrastructure charges, some of which go towards environmental improvements.
It is not subsidised.
Finally, if Mrs Lucas' proposals were passed, they would decimate the aviation industry: aviation, tourism, businesses and the aerospace industry.
Their supporters would love to abolish cheap flights.
In short, they would make Europe uncompetitive and give Americans and overseas carriers an unfair advantage.
I would hope in future the proposals from the Commission are thought through more carefully.
Otherwise its members may find that flying to or from Brussels or Strasbourg or on holiday, for that matter, with a European carrier may not be an option.
Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas.
My group has not proposed any further amendments for this plenary discussion.
This means that we agree with the thrust of the report, and I would like to dissociate myself somewhat from the comments made by Mrs Foster, suggesting that the Commission proposals or those included in the report would spell disaster for aviation.
I do not think you should try to block a sound environmental policy by making this type of threat.
The Commission statement on aviation and the environment is a first step towards better European legislation. This is needed given the growth in aviation and, along with it, the growth in environmental pollution caused by it.
We therefore endorse the key points of the Commission proposals.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists is all for imposing European rules on the aviation industry and making it pay for the environmental pollution which it causes.
As Mrs Lucas has already stated, we do not want aviation to be given preferential treatment.
But today we are merely tracing an outline.
What conditions must European legislation meet?
We will then look forward to the further regulatory and legislative proposals which will also contain the details and specific standards.
So what are the guiding principles of the Group of the Party of European Socialists?
We are at any rate of the opinion that rapid growth in aviation leads to the creation of more and better train alternatives, to give an example in terms of short-distance travel.
I believe that the shift from one mode of transport to another which is more environmentally-friendly is of great importance.
We do not think that capacity growth in aviation is unlimited.
Secondly, we would like European noise standards: in the interests of the public and to discourage competition between certain airports.
Noise at night should, in our opinion, be given more attention and we share Mrs Lucas' view that, in the development of standards and more detailed rules, the standards of the World Health Organisation should come first.
Accordingly, we are expecting ambitious proposals from the European Commission.
The third point naturally relates to emissions, the emission of pollution to be precise, which, in our view, should be tackled as well.
This is also why we support the principle of a tax on kerosene.
However, the viability of these ideas and proposals is questionable.
As stated in the report, we would like international consultation and further research.
Since the outcome of this research is uncertain, we support the fall-back position, as formulated in Paragraph 20 of the report, in the form of a European environmental levy.
In the final analysis, what matters is for us to follow the Kyoto agreements, and aviation should contribute substantially in this respect.
We prefer to have effective agreements on noise and emission worldwide, but should these not materialise, we certainly will not rule out a European policy.
I believe that that is also an important element in the report, and it has been formulated clearly in our view.
We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit.
Should this not be the case, we feel that we should be able to table European rules in a few years' time.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report.
It is indeed the case that aviation is growing rapidly.
I share Mrs Foster' s view that aviation is a major economic sector, a sector which provides services which are irreplaceable up to a point.
At the same time, however, it is abundantly clear that such a sector also brings with it a number of adverse environmental effects, such as noise and air pollution, and that we need to invite the sector to take a pro-active approach in dealing with this issue as quickly as possible, more so than is the case at present.
Both the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas' report provide guidelines as to how this can and must be done.
I would like to highlight a few points.
It is clear, as Mr Wiersma has already stated, that the different modes of transport - road, train, etc. and also aviation - must be treated the same way as much as possible, which is not the case at the moment.
There are specific reasons for this, but something must be done about the matter.
I believe that it is clear that, in tackling the problems of noise, standards, tax on kerosene, etc, we should certainly at the present time opt for a worldwide approach.
A regional approach is premature at the moment, and I am pleased that the rapporteur has amended a number of her points in the original text to this effect.
In my opinion, the European Union does not need to take any unilateral measures at the moment, if I can put it that way.
There are important negotiations under way, Commissioner, which will have a positive outcome, or at least we can still be hopeful of this.
I believe that this is a factor of importance.
Another important point is that noise must be tackled by means of a package of measures.
Hence my amendment to provide details of these measures.
I have also tabled an amendment to develop a common method of measurement which will enable us to curb competition between different airports, as referred to by Mr Wiersma.
It is, of course, important for competition between airports not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment.
I believe that this is a factor of importance and that is why we need European regulations in order to prevent competition between the different airports.
Mr President, at the present time the United Kingdom has rates of fuel duty which are spectacularly higher than in other parts of the European Union.
One of the effects of this is particularly detrimental to the peripheral parts of the country.
It has a disproportionately distorting effect on competition, affecting local firms in the periphery competing against large multinationals in the UK.
That is an important caveat to put down about ways in which fuel taxes can distort local economies.
I do not think there is a good environmental argument for trying to drive most of the population of the United Kingdom into the bottom south-east corner.
I did not enter politics to repeat the Highland clearances.
That said, it is also clearly absurd to exempt aviation from the duty to diminish greenhouse gases and ozone depletion and it is also a good thing to look towards an equality of taxation across the European Union, as Mrs Lucas has done, rather than grossly distorting differentials between different parts.
I have considerable reservations about how this will work in practice, but we should welcome the principle that Mrs Lucas has put forward.
Mr President, the fight against noise pollution and gaseous emissions is a just fight, which we support, as it pursues the objectives of citizens' well-being and environmental quality.
Nonetheless, the reduction of these noise or gaseous emissions must be limited to the commendable search for technical solutions that are to everyone's advantage.
It must not serve as a pretext for other objectives in the field of tax or for extending the competence of the Commission.
The latter should instead concentrate on correctly carrying out its already vast range of tasks.
In these circumstances, we cannot accept the instigation of this eco-tax.
This first step towards a European tax will only affect passengers, once again, without achieving any of this report' s objectives.
Our citizens are already squeezed hard by taxes and, at a time when the Member States are trying to reduce taxation, a European tax could put our businesses in a difficult position in relation to their competitors, in particular American businesses or others, with numerous disastrous consequences for employment.
We cannot accept this.
Furthermore, we demand that tax subsidiarity in favour of the Member States be observed.
Europe, rather than artificially swelling its budget by means of this tax, should use this budget more effectively, with respect for the freedom of the individual.
The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax.
The eco-tax will solve nothing.
This is a purely ideological measure, with no direct effect on the environment.
We would prefer a rational measure that respects the interests of the individual and favours economic development while fully respecting the environment.
Mr President, where air traffic too is concerned, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats supports the initiative of the European Commission and of the responsible Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, to reconcile causing as little damage as possible to the environment with citizens' and companies' interest in being able to travel.
The Committee too has made a decision along the same lines, although we ought in all honesty to say that we had completely to re-write Mrs Lucas' report, since it was based upon totally unrealistic premisses.
However, we finally reached a majority agreement.
The summer has again shown how important air travel is for people heading for their holiday destinations.
Particularly where families with children are concerned, air travel offers the quickest means of getting away to the sun, and the one which puts least strain on the nerves.
At the same time, it provides the basis for jobs and businesses in many parts of the European Union.
Business travel and freight forwarding on international air routes are also vital to trade and commerce.
On the other hand, air travel has an obvious detrimental effect upon the environment due to exhaust emissions and noise pollution.
We must make sure that we limit these forms of damage to the environment, at the same time, however, as distinguishing between the damage caused to health around airports and the ways in which people' s ordinary well-being is prejudiced.
I fear that, if we were to adopt the WHO' s regulations, none of us here this evening would be allowed to go on working, since more than ten hours spent in this Chamber is scarcely compatible with these regulations.
So let us be realistic, please.
The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats in any case calls for a significant reduction in permitted levels of noise pollution - which, in view of the international character of air travel, ought more sensibly to be regulated within the framework of the ICAO - and for noisier aircraft to be excluded from using European airports following brief transitionary periods.
We hope, and are campaigning for, a situation in which the Member States of the European Commission will provide a clear mandate.
If, however, we were not to obtain success at ICAO level, then we should have to take action ourselves, for Europe is densely populated and we do not have the luxury of the large distances between population centres that are to be found in America or Africa.
We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise.
Mr President, we know that traffic emissions are one of the greatest environmental problems we have and they have also proved to be one of the hardest to get rid of.
That is because the volume of traffic is growing even faster than the economy.
In this sense the problems of air traffic are still greater because we have to find global solutions for them.
On the other hand, we have heard that the Kyoto Protocol does not contain provisions concerning air traffic emissions.
Furthermore, air traffic problems are not discussed in the directive on ceilings for emissions which is under consideration.
Being in this situation we really have to channel greater efforts into the work that is done in ICAO and its environmental protection committee, which drafts international environmental norms.
This is a regrettably slow process, but we have to be able to set objectives that are sufficiently ambitious in scope and create negotiating mandates to be able to make progress accordingly.
In my opinion it would not be a bad idea if the developed, industrialised countries, including the European Union, were to set an example in this matter.
It is important to develop engine technology, as a decline in the volume of traffic is not foreseeable.
We will have to have recourse to different acts, environmental taxes, charges and administrative measures, for example regulation of departure and arrival times, taking account of the fact that rail traffic exists alongside air traffic in areas where long distances are not a hindrance, and that must be developed.
Mr President, I would like to emphasise the importance of the aim to use efficient, alternative transport, in place of short flights, which was mentioned in this report.
For example, high speed trains, and, in some cases, short sea crossings offer a more environment-friendly alternative to short flights.
This will be vital to ease congestion at airports and for environmental reasons too.
Replacing short flights with alternative forms of transport will make room for long haul flights, for which there is no alternative.
In Parliament we discussed several reports before the summer recess that aimed at improving the competitiveness of railways and sea transport.
In addition to improving rail and sea transport competitiveness, we also need to take other action. One possibility is an environmental charge specially designed for air traffic.
It should be introduced in such a way that the charge would be less for the unavoidable long haul journeys than it would for short flights for which there is a more environment-friendly alternative.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is the third in a series which deals with the air transport situation.
Whilst the previous two focused on the freedom and growth potential within aviation, this one highlights the downside, justifiably so, in my opinion.
As I have already indicated when we discussed the Atkins report, the measures which are currently being drafted for aviation only provide short-term answers.
They cannot provide a lasting solution for the problems of congestion and environmental pollution.
This report looks beyond the near future, which is why I would like to congratulate Mrs Lucas.
It is not an unnecessary exercise to indicate the pre-conditions within which aviation should function, both in terms of space and the environment.
This, however, does require sufficient expertise and alternatives.
At present, there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects.
This should not deter us, however, from sketching the outlines for the future and to expect this to be done internationally.
This report sets the right tone for this, especially for the benefit of the Commission.
Despite our positive attitude to this report, there are a number of elements which, in my opinion, do not belong in a report such as this one.
I am referring to the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the regionalists.
They may seem like a kind gesture, but these matters are better dealt with by the Member States.
Mr President, this Parliament would not be able to function without aviation, which according to some might not be such a bad thing.
But we need to focus all our efforts on how we can minimise the effects of the rapid growth within this sector on the environment.
I would like to highlight a number of points.
In my opinion, the European Union should support the ICAO process.
Only within the context of this international body is it possible to discuss tighter rules for noise generated by aircraft.
We should however urge caution.
Proposing new standards has a huge impact on the European aviation industry as a whole.
In concrete terms, a standard considerably stricter than the current one would mean that out of the present European fleet of 3,300 aircraft, 1,067 would need to be replaced.
Such a rapid and forced decommissioning would make it practically impossible to replace these aircraft with new ones, due to, among other things, the small production capacity for new aircraft.
We only have two manufacturers.
The consequences for European aviation are not hard to imagine.
It would need to surrender part of the market to its competitors, and it is very questionable whether this would benefit our safety.
Furthermore, it would lead to a considerable reduction in employment, with all the problems that this entails.
Air fares would go up.
I am very aware that this would be a bonus for some, but do remember that, for airline passengers who need to travel short distances, there is still no real alternative, contrary to what one of my fellow MEPs just stated, to the effect that we would all much prefer to see such passengers travel by train..
Member States and my country in particular, the Netherlands, are extremely slow in introducing high-speed trains which could form a viable alternative for short-distance travel.
Aircraft manufacturers should be put under considerable pressure to build cleaner and quieter aircraft.
That is why the new standards cannot be put on hold forever.
We will try to exert this pressure at international level but we will run out of patience at some stage.
Finally, I would like to say a few words on noise-sensitive airports.
In my opinion, measurements should be taken in a truly objective manner and complaints from those living in the vicinity should not be the only point of reference.
An international standard needs to be established, but some airports, which do not cause any pollution whatsoever to those living in the vicinity, should be exempt so that they are not hindered in their development.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we are all convinced that we have an obligation and a duty to protect the environment and contribute to sustainable development with an environmental policy that has seen its importance increased subsequent to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I agree with the Commission on drawing up more stringent standards on noise and also on establishing transitional provisions to satisfy the needs of the regions that are confronted with noise pollution problems.
We also believe that it is essential for us to participate as one in the 33rd assembly of the ICAO in autumn 2001, speaking with one voice because, without a doubt, there is strength in unity and on subjects as important as the tightening of standards against noise it is vital.
It would also be important to ask the Commission to present proposals for the introduction of economic incentives aimed at achieving a reduction of the negative effects on the environment.
Naturally, what we do not agree on is the unilateral establishment of tax on kerosene, as a unilateral decision without the backing of the ICAO would have a minimal impact on the environment, would create legal problems, would damage competition among European airlines and would consequently affect users, who would see their tariffs rise.
It would also be essential that, before taking any measures with regard to the adoption of taxes on the aviation industry, a study should be carried out on the costs and benefits that these measures would imply.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants, placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single European sky, by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give Mrs Lucas credit for her report.
I mean her original version.
She is right when she points out that if the volume of air traffic continues its rapid growth it will be absolutely necessary to take measures to control the problems it causes.
It is part of sustainable development to reduce emissions and bring noise levels down.
The report gained the support of everyone in the committee.
The amendments made to it, however, throw the baby out with the bath water.
The original report was a natural extension of previous EU legislation, but if the amendments are adopted it will mean enormous financial losses for European companies that have taken investment decisions on the basis of EU acts.
For example, the time span for noise reduction is very long.
The time that passes between the decisions taken and implementation can be up to two years.
But now some excellent aircraft which have just been modified in accordance with Chapter 3 would have to be scrapped in four years' time.
The citizens and companies of the Community must be able to have confidence in legislation, as continual shifting of the goalposts undermines long-term plans.
The resultant costs weaken the area' s air transport competitiveness as compared with airlines outside the EU, and, at the same time, in fact, makes it harder to adopt environment-friendly technology in the airlines based within the EU.
What is economically realistic about demands for new technology in the name of environmental protection to replace aircraft which are still serviceable and in good condition?
On the contrary, this sort of action will constitute a burden on the environment, as materials will have to be produced and aircraft built before the economic lifetime of existent equipment is up.
In addition, scrapping serviceable aircraft will mean an additional burden on the environment.
Drafting radically new regulations on aircraft noise has to happen globally and under the auspices of ICAO, and careful, long-term community and town planning consequently has a key role in this.
Finally, I would like to remind everyone that increasing fuel tax in the air transport industry would bring with it an added burden for those who live in sparsely populated countries.
A long journey is a long way to go.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Lucas on the report that is the basis for our debate today.
As we are all aware, the environmental consequences of air transport have recently attracted a great deal of interest.
At local level, the debates surrounding airport development are increasingly determined by environmental considerations relating to noise abatement and air quality improvement in areas surrounding airports.
Many citizens living in these areas believe that much more could be done to improve their situation and that is what they are demanding.
Furthermore, the long-term impact of gases from air transport on climate change is undoubtedly a cause of concern in the world today, as is the impact of other types of emissions.
The air transport system must therefore be handled globally and coherently, from an environmental point of view, that is, we must also take account of aspects relating to the activity of air transport.
We must try to reconcile interests that are not always easy to reconcile as air transport undoubtedly involves economic interests that are characterised by high investment costs which require a long life span before they are paid off.
For example, an aircraft requires a much longer life span than other types of investment in order to be adequately paid off.
