It is a positive challenge for the authorities to take on, given the benefits that consumers can draw from the increasing use of the Internet, and also given the continuing need to ensure that whatever the technology adopted for the conduct of transactions, the key principles that support the Community's legal order should not be circumvented.
Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon, Mr Monti.
We will now move on to the 20 minutes of questions to Commissioner Reding.
Questions to Mrs Reding
Question No 26 by Bernd Posselt (H-0301/03):
Subject: Minority languages
How is the Commission preparing for EU enlargement in terms of the promotion of minority languages, and what part do linguistic minorities whose languages are majority languages in other Member States play in the discussions?
In reply to Mr Posselt, I would like to say that the definition of minority and regional languages used by the European Commission is that established by the Council of Europe in its European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
What we mean by a regional or minority language is, and I quote, a language 'traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the state's population, and different from the official language(s) of that state'.
This definition therefore encompasses many languages that are minority languages in one country but majority languages in another.
As regards the promotion of minority and regional languages within the Union, the Commission finances the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages as well as the Mercator research centres.
Their 2003-2004 work programme includes measures to provide information on European policy in the areas in question to the future members of the Union.
Meetings are held on this issue, such as the Bolzano Conference of 26 and 27 May on the topic 'Best practice in promoting linguistic diversity in an enlarged Europe'.
The European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages has also begun to work on the establishment in the new Member States of national committees representing linguistic minorities, along the lines of similar committees existing in the current 15 Member States of the Union.
It must be said that the future members already have the same opportunities as the Fifteen as regards minority and regional languages, namely the funding of initiatives through the existing programmes.
Some of the programmes involved - Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci - are also open to all of the candidate countries.
Finally, the Euromosaic study on the production and reproduction of the minority language groups in the European Union will be extended to the new Member States.
The new Member States have also been invited to participate in public consultations that have been launched by the Commission as part of the preparations for an action plan for language diversity and learning, which will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July, in the context of the analysis of the new generation of Leonardo, Socrates and Youth programmes.
All linguistic minorities, including those whose language is a majority language in other Member States of the enlarged Union, have been able to take part in these consultations.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to express my thanks for your very detailed, very good and concrete response and put to you an additional question.
I am not sure whether you will be able to give me an answer to it straightaway or perhaps only in writing, after this question time.
Member States are supporting minorities in the accession countries.
For example, with the agreement of the countries concerned, Germany is giving support to the German minority in Poland and the German minority in the Czech Republic.
There is now a rumour in these countries that at least part of this support by another Member State would be unlawful after accession to the European Union.
I cannot really understand that and therefore wanted to specifically ask about it because this question is currently making people extremely worried.
Can it be that the promotion of minority languages by other Member States is unlawful in the EU?
.
(DE) Mr President, in this regard I can reassure Mr Posselt that the Union will not intervene in projects that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the competence of Member States.
I am therefore at a complete loss to explain the origin of this discussion because if a Member State wants to help out another Member State or a third country in some way and wants to carry out cultural projects in this Member State, then this is a matter for the Member State and the Union should not interfere.
On the contrary, I am happy for Member States to organise numerous cultural projects in their neighbouring countries.
I was very interested in the Commissioner's response and her definition of languages, which is well known in this House.
I fully support the notion of providing financial assistance to minority and lesser-spoken languages, and like many colleagues I am familiar with the educational programmes and the work of the Bureau.
As the Commissioner knows, respect for someone else's language, respect for that person and his or her culture and customs, helps support the integration of those communities.
In that vein, can I ask the Commissioner to at least consider, perhaps by means of a study or a survey, giving support for re-defining the definition and including other languages perhaps non-European in origin, but still spoken and understood by many people, languages understood across many EU states - Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and Tamil, to name but a few.
I realise that this is a significant suggestion, but my fear is that if we do not at least consider this, we will be sending a very divisive message to many ethnic minority communities at a key time of integration.
In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases, and I agree with the support of those languages, are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands.
I wonder whether the Commissioner would be prepared to consider that?
.
In answer to the honourable Member, all Community action concerning languages is inclusive, not exclusive action.
We have not clearly defined what the languages are because in the action programme which I am going to present in July this year we would like to outline all the languages spoken in the enlarged European Union.
We will see if it is possible to include migration languages such as those you mentioned, Mr Evans.
At any rate, they are not excluded by any of our texts.
Mr President, as regards the issue of language learning beyond the official languages, that is to say, the regional languages, minority languages and also the issue of migration languages which has just been raised, I believe that these areas should indeed be kept separate, with the official languages, regional and minority languages on the one side, and the migration languages on the other.
I would ask the Commissioner to share her opinion with us on this point, also with regard to the programme which was launched in connection with the European Year of Languages and which was very clearly defined.
In my view, also given that the funding available is limited - the Commissioner needs far more resources for this area of activity than she is currently being provided with - some sort of prioritisation is essential.
.
(DE) Mr President, the honourable Member is quite right, of course: we will never have enough money to do everything.
However, during the European Year of Languages, we not only gave the official languages their say; we also facilitated the provision of funding for languages which are actually spoken in the territory, if that was what associations or citizens wanted.
We must be vigilant in monitoring what is happening through our schools and in society in general.
In our schools, it is inevitable that the mother tongue is the official language, the first language.
I have always demanded that we should endeavour to teach two foreign languages in addition to the base language, and this is something that our heads of state and government have accepted.
That is one point.
The other point is respect for multiculturalism, for cultural diversity in our society, and I do believe that in some regions, languages spoken by migrants are also part of this cultural environment.
That is the reality, and it must be taken into account when analyses are carried out and language diversity is subjected to academic study.
Nonetheless, the priority, in my view, will continue to be supporting traditional languages and promoting multilingualism in our schools.
Question No 27 by Joan VallvÃ© (H-0306/03):
Subject: Violence at football grounds
The subject of violence at football grounds is addressed in the Council Decision of 25 April 2002 concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension (2002/348/JHA
In response to the question by Mr VallvÃ©, the Commission must point out that it does not give an opinion on issues that are outside its remit.
At present, the European Union does not have any direct competence as regards the organisation of sports events, or, at least, I should say that it does not yet have any such competences, as the Convention is currently looking at this issue.
In this respect, the European Court of Justice has on several occasions recalled that sporting bodies have a broad degree of autonomy as regards the way in which they organise their competitions.
As Mr VallvÃ© mentioned in his question, the European Union's official position on security at football matches has an international dimension and is set out in the Council Decision of 25 April 2002.
This document does not contain any references to the subject raised in the question.
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her response and her analysis of the future of sport in the European Union.
As you know, the Union is made up of nation states but also of multinational states.
In some of the latter, certain nations may have national teams, as is the case with Scotland and Wales.
However, it is not the case with Catalonia.
In future, we would like to see our national team participating in official competitions.
We therefore thank you for your response, Commissioner, and we believe that in future the European Union, in its bid to recognise the cultural identities that exist throughout Europe, will have to allow these cultures to express themselves through sport.
Mr President, Mr VallvÃ© is well aware of my love of the cultural diversity in the Union and the great wealth this diversity offers all Europeans.
Naturally, Catalonia, with its language, its history and its wonderful culture, is part of this tradition of cultural diversity.
As far as sport is concerned, I am afraid I cannot say any more than I have just said because it is up to the sporting bodies, whose autonomy is recognised by the Union through the Court of Justice, to resolve the issues raised by Mr VallvÃ©.
While I do not have a photographer present like Mr VallvÃ©, I have a serious point to make about violence at football matches.
Could the Commissioner tell me the latest position on the question of organised racist violence at football matches?
My own country, England, will shortly be playing a football match against a candidate country and risks being thrown out of the competition in question as a result of racism from its fans.
While I know that this is the preserve of UEFA and not a matter directly for the Commission, I want to ask about the increase in racist violence at national and regional football matches, the fact that it is organised - often from the far right but not exclusively so - and whether the Commission would at least make a statement about this increase because, as the previous speaker said, sport is an expression of the culture and way of life of countries within the European Union.
I am particularly worried about that expression from candidate countries where racism in football matches will be on the rise.
.
The honourable Member is right.
It is shocking to see how something which should be the expression of joy is distorted into the expression of rejecting other human beings.
It is for this reason that, with the help of the European Parliament, the Commission has decided to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport.
We would like to discuss this phenomenon in schools, clubs and society at large, and to speak about the true values of sports, which are about fair play, about recognising the other, about people reaching out their hand, not clenching their fist.
I would like all Europeans - including Members of the European Parliament - to commit themselves during that year to getting that message across to young people in our Member States and in the enlarged Europe.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response to Mr VallvÃ©.
I would also like to voice my support for his request regarding national teams, although I did understand your message, Commissioner.
As regards cultural diversity, Parliament has adopted several resolutions, one of which I hold particularly dear: that of 1989, which recognises that the Catalan language has a somewhat special role among the minority languages and which called on the Commission to publish a number of fundamental texts in our language, Catalan.
My predecessor in this role, Mr Gorka KnÃ¶rr, who is currently the Vice-President of the Basque Parliament - whom I am replacing for that reason - had raised the question of Basque.
Why does Catalan enjoy minor status as a recognised language and why can Basque not have the same status?
Therefore, at the very moment when the Spanish authorities have shut down the only Basque newspaper, Egunkaria, I would like to ask you the reason for this difference in the status of Basque and Catalan.
Commissioner, this question is not supplementary to the question on violence at football grounds; it bears no relation to it.
Question No 28 by Theresa Zabell (H-0328/03):
Subject: Article on sport in the future Treaty
Can the Commission say what steps it has taken to ensure the inclusion of an article on sport in the future EU Treaty?
Reports concerning anti-doping measures in sport are more and more worrying and sportsmen are increasingly vulnerable.
Can the Commission say what it knows about the new World Anti-Doping Code and what its opinion of it is?
There is sometimes good news even in politics, and I think that this is one example from the point of view at least of the work being carried out in the Convention.
In fact, the inclusion of a Community competence in the field of sport is currently being considered by the Commission for its draft constitutional Treaty.
Following the proposal by the Praesidium of the Convention to introduce such a competence under the areas of supporting actions, the Commission, through its representatives, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, took the initiative of submitting a draft article to the Convention, to which my services and myself made a significant contribution.
The draft constitutional Treaty, as it currently stands, incorporates the principles of the Commission's draft and includes competence for sport in Part III, Chapter V of the Treaty, areas where the Union may take coordinating, supplementary or supporting action: education, vocational training, youth and sport.
Sport is therefore added.
In this article, paragraphs 1 and 2 are specifically dedicated to sport, and I am very happy with this proposal, as with this article, the Union encourages the educational and social functions of sport without harmonising the laws and regulations of the Member States.
Therefore, this new article, if included at last in the final Treaty, would also provide the response to the previous questions.
The second part of the question relates to the new World Anti-Doping Code.
As you know, the Commission welcomes all efforts to combat doping.
However, there is no unique or miraculous solution that would enable us to resolve this problem.
The World Anti-Doping Code will help to combat this scourge, but other measures are needed too.
The Code is a preventive instrument, targeted at high-level sport.
Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that the fight against doping should also cover the amateur sector and encompass issues of prevention, education and research.
The Commission wants to emphasise that the issues covered by the Code are not directly within its remit, but it is following these developments very closely and will continue to keep a close eye on them.
The Member States support the Code, and the Commission, which does not have an official position as this is an intergovernmental matter, is, instead, stepping up its efforts in the areas of education, prevention and legislation on sports foods.
We have therefore established a form of complementarity: we help the Member States to reach agreement.
Moreover - before the major meeting in Copenhagen on doping - a meeting of Sports Ministers was organised by the Commission in Brussels with a view to enabling Europe to speak with one voice.
In these cases, however, it is the ministers who speak and not the Commission.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
I would like to congratulate you on the good work you have done, because I believe that introducing sport into the future European Union Treaty is very important.
It seemed very difficult, but all indications are that it will be achieved.
I am reassured by the information you have given me, because I had seen certain proposals from international sporting organisations which really did not reassure me very much in terms of the inclusion of sport in the future Treaty, amongst other things, because, being rather difficult, we ran the risk of achieving nothing in the end.
With regard to combating doping, my feeling is that, since the World Anti-Doping Agency was created, there is almost less control in this area then there was before.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this and on whether she believes it is necessary to rather reinvigorate the fight against doping at European level and, if possible, at world level.
The honourable Member welcomes, as I do, the wisdom of the Convention members, who have actually included sport in the draft treaty, taking into consideration what the Union and Parliament have been saying on this subject for years.
We have been talking about the social dimension and educational dimensions of sport for years.
It is these dimensions which have been included in the draft treaty, not, I am glad to say, the excessive demands of certain sporting bodies.
The wisdom of the Convention members has therefore prevailed over the demands of certain sporting organisations.
At this point I should like to thank all the sportsmen and sportswomen and all the sporting organisations, including the President of the International Olympic Committee, who have been helping us for years in our aim of getting this article included in the treaty.
I should also like to thank the Convention members, the Members of the European Parliament and all the national politicians who have contributed to this effort.
As for the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, it poses a few small problems, since among other things it is not based on international law and, therefore, neither are its proposals.
The Agency is a body under private law, which does not make things any easier.
As for controls, I do not know whether there are fewer now than before.
Just about everybody tells me that there are too many, and that everyone is carrying out overlapping and contradictory controls, and that it would be better to concentrate them and to act logically and in accordance with Member States' laws.
Many problems still have to be sorted out before a final solution is achieved.
A World Anti-Doping Agency code is not enough.
We need a change in, or an adaptation of, Member States' laws.
Imagine a situation in which a sportsman is given a two-year suspension and appeals before a national court, and it turns out that the law of that State is not in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency code. The sportsman would be acquitted and we would find ourselves in complete chaos, and with even more uncertainty than before.
I believe that we must decide, at last, to endeavour to strike a balance, to reform Member States' laws on doping and to obtain from the Union an assurance that it is committed to complementary action in the form of educational and preventive measures.
Mr President, I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner is taking action in this area and I offer her my congratulations.
On the issue of doping, I have a very specific question: time and again, when doping cases occur, it is pointed out that the athletes were not clear about the content of the products.
A fairly simple measure which could be adopted - although it is admittedly not absolutely watertight in its effect - is to identify doping products on the label, perhaps by including a red dot or a red line on the packaging, in order to draw specific attention to the content and the risks associated with doping.
Could the Commissioner take steps in this direction?
.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Ebner is right.
We are responsible for the labelling of medicinal products.
I have already spoken to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne about ways in which we can label medicines in order to prevent such substances entering the body by chance - although as we know, something like that does not happen entirely by chance.
However, we also know that it is not just medicinal products that are causing the problems, but also food additives, so this whole issue is fairly complex.
However, if we want to control doping in Europe, we need a comprehensive list of the medicines and additives concerned, and this list must then be distributed - in collaboration with the sports associations - to the sportsmen and sportswomen themselves.
Therefore I believe that providing information both to sports doctors and to athletes is extremely important.
I also want, however, to point out that we do not just have a problem with professional athletes.
For example, we carried out a study on fitness centres which revealed that even teenagers - primarily young men between 15 and 17 years of age - are taking banned substances because they have seen the older ones doing so and because these substances are freely available in some of these fitness centres.
We are clearly dealing with a public health issue here, and in this respect, I believe that more political action is needed than we have seen to date.
Mr President, Commissioner, I found out today that France has banned rugby.
That is fine by me.
However, my question is this: do you think that boxing is really a sport which should be encouraged, and do you think that boxing is especially conducive to the morals and ethical values of young people?
.
(DE) Mr President, I do have my own favourite sports, and I must say that boxing is not one of them.
Has France banned rugby? That is news to me.
I need to check that and see why it has done so and what the underlying thinking was.
As far as the rest is concerned - and this is the message to be sent out during the European Year of Education through Sport - I believe that sport is enjoyable; it brings people together, both as individuals and as nations, and it must seek solutions to social problems. It should not be a social problem itself.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
Question No 29 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0293/03):
Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece
Presidential Decree 81/2003 transposes Directive 1999/70/EC
Mr President, Greece has indeed transposed the directive and very recently notified the Commission of the implementing legislation.
The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the transposition and will take a decision following a careful examination of the dossier.
However, it is perfectly clear that, under clause 5 of the directive, the Member States must establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts.
The directive gives the Member States a number of options as regards the application of this clause.
They must introduce at least one of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts, maximum total duration of the contracts and number of renewals.
A first reading of the presidential decree shows that article 5 makes provision for the above and that it expressly stipulates that the renewal of fixed-term contracts of employment is allowed if justified by an objective reason and examples of objective reasons are given.
Of course, the Member States themselves determine what is meant by the term 'objective reasons'.
However, the measures introduced must be adequate measures to prevent abuse.
For example, the argument that work in the public sector per se is an objective reason for unlimited successive fixed-term contracts is unacceptable.
There must be objective grounds based on the nature of the object.
The Commission, as I said, intends to arrive at an evaluation of the transposition of the implementing legislation and to proceed to take any subsequent action required.
Mr President, I appreciate the Commissioner's reply and I understand her position, given that she herself is from Greece.
As she understood, the question does not concern the objective reasons and the implementation criteria, it concerns the scope.
I have noted what she said about the public sector, but I should like to ask her: when does the Commission believe that it will have finished its evaluation of the scope of the directive and of what I consider to be the unacceptable exemptions being made for the public sector and certain industries?
There is legal chaos in Greece.
We already have judgments from the courts of first instance in Patras and Larissa and from the court of appeal in Crete, which apply the directive and do not apply the presidential decree.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she could estimate when we shall have this opinion from the Commission.
What we are trying to do is to present it as quickly as possible.
All I need say to you is that we received it about 10 days ago.
There are legal procedures, but there are also internal committee procedures.
I believe that we shall be able to present our evaluation before the summer.
Question No 30 by Paul RÃŒbig (H-0302/03):
Subject: EU senior citizens' card
Today's senior citizens are active, dynamic and enjoy travelling - not only within their own country, but all over Europe.
This makes the introduction of a European senior citizens' card useful and worthwhile.
Such a card would allow the holder to pay the reduced rate for senior citizens for public amenities, museums and events etc. throughout the whole of Europe.
This would not only support and encourage mobility, but would also increase general acceptance of the EU, and improve contact and understanding between individual Member States.
Does the Commission feel it is possible or necessary to introduce an EU-wide senior citizens' card?
Mr President, several years ago, in 1989, the Commission issued a recommendation which it addressed to the Member States concerning the introduction of the European over-60s senior citizens' card.
The Commission's recommendation at the time concerned the possibility of access for senior citizens to all resources provided by decision of the Member States to their own senior citizens, from museums and cultural activities to free subsidised transport.
Of course, the technical obstacles to the introduction of this card proved to be quite considerable.
To date three cost/benefit studies have been carried out, describing the systems which exist and the limitations to which they are subject, together with the obstacles which exist in numerous Member States.
The final report from the last study was submitted to a contact group of representatives from the Member States for policies for senior citizens and to the association group of senior citizens' organisations.
No Member State and none of the pan-European senior citizens' organisations in this group, to which the final study was submitted, supported the idea of the card or the proposals contained in the report.
Consequently, the Commission does not consider the introduction of a senior citizens' card in the European Union to be feasible.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Flemming, ladies and gentlemen, the senior citizens' card really should also be a symbol of the tremendous purchasing power enjoyed by senior citizens in Europe.
We are all aware of the current strikes about the pensions reform.
I think that the best practice model would be appropriate here too.
We should demonstrate which kind of best-practice reforms have achieved the target most effectively.
I would therefore like to ask you this: does the Commission have any thoughts on how to promote pensioners' power as consumers in future through best practice and benchmarks?
Mr President, it is not easy to give an answer at this precise moment to the question of whether there are global policies to strengthen the intervention of the purchasing power of senior citizens.
They are consumers.
We know that there is a very large section of the European population who are pensioners and well-off pensioners.
These people really do have mobility at European level and participate in consumption, but the question was very specific and concerned the need for a card.
It is a nice idea.
I agree with you that this sort of card would facilitate the mobility of pensioners even more, but an idea also has to be adopted by those who will be called on to apply it and by those who will be called on to enjoy its advantages.
At this precise moment, we see that there is no inclination either on the part of the Member States or on the part of senior citizens' organisations.
Obviously, if there is any movement, we too shall act accordingly for our part, but I do not think that the Commission has any possibility of acting at present.
Commissioner, age is the future for Europe and - I hope for you all - it is your own future too.
I have already reached it: I am already seventy years of age.
I am also very proud that the European Union, in Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, has the only constitution in the world to include a ban on discrimination on grounds of age.
Yet this is no longer provided for in the Convention's draft.
My question to you is this: do you see any possibility of bringing influence to bear, even at this stage, so that this unique ban on discrimination which currently exists in Europe can be included in the new constitution as well?
Both the text presented this precise moment to the Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights retain the wording concerning the issue of discrimination based on age intact.
It is precisely the same wording which we had in article 13.
It has not changed.
It is an element of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it refers to age, race, religion and sex.
There has been no change to the sectors to which the area of discrimination refers.
Question No 31 by Michl Ebner (H-0304/03):
Subject: Youth unemployment
Youth unemployment is a phenomenon deserving of serious attention and is indeed dealt with accordingly in the European Union; even greater significance will, however, need to be attached to it as a result of the accession of ten new countries as part of enlargement to the East.
The Member States will in future be confronted with an influx of young people seeking work from the new Member States which will boost their own rates of unemployment.
Is the EU equipped to cope with this imminent surge of arrivals?
Have specific projects already been drawn up?
What kind of assistance is the Commission providing and what objectives is it pursuing?
Naturally the European Commission has analysed the prospects and specific problems concerning youth unemployment in enlarged Europe.
The first point concerns the fear of waves of immigrants.
Usually, it is the youngest workers who move.
Studies which we have carried out show that mobility from the 10 future Member States to the present European Union of the 15 will be relatively limited.
It is estimated that there will be an outbreak in the first years, which will reach 250 000 people per annum, half of whom will be manpower, but that this mobility of manpower will start to decline towards the end of the decade to fewer than 100 000 people.
Of course, these studies always have a significant number of forecasts.
However, they are fairly convincing if you think that they have taken account of all the prevailing conditions in each of the Member States.
Similarly, previous experience of enlargement in Europe and studies into the phenomenon of immigration suggest that young migrant workers from the new Member States will tend to migrate towards the wealthier areas of their own countries, to large towns where unemployment rates are relatively lower and there are relatively good prospects of finding work.
Young people in these countries tend to opt first for their own towns and their own areas which are better developed, rather than choosing to go to another country.
So much for the study of the phenomenon of immigration flows.
The second point concerns transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers decided at European level.
As you know, there is an agreement on the free movement of workers during the first two years.
Following accession, each Member State can decide on free movement, but it can also postpone it for five years.
This is the 5 + 2 rule.
The third point concerns the strategy on employment, the application of policies in which the European Union has an added value.
Here we must say that there has been cooperation here for three years between the European Commission and each of the candidate Member States, where essentially we are trying to support the creation of individualised action plans to combat unemployment.
Considerable efforts are being made to include reducing the drop-out rate from school, which is a serious problem in many of these countries, and to prepare them so that, with the new generation of Structural Funds, there will be optimum investment in human resources.
Thus, I repeat that my reply includes three basic categories of issues.
Immigration flows and the study of the phenomenon with possible forecasts. The second is the institutional framework as configured at European level and the third is the application of policies on employment.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like the latter part of your informative comments to be given added depth, especially with regard to the use of the Structural Funds in the field of education.
You specifically raised the issue of school drop-outs.
I think it would be very important for the European Union to focus especially on education and training, so that young people in the accession countries have a chance to benefit from suitable job opportunities in their own countries.
It would also be important in psychological terms, in terms of the basic attitude in these countries, for young people to see that they have a chance in Europe and that Europe guarantees them this chance.
For this reason, I am wondering whether it is possible, in terms of funding, to launch special measures via the Structural Funds.
Mr Ebner, at this stage, a first round of discussions is being held for the next generation of the Structural Funds.
The discussion also relates to which areas funding from European resources should be directed at and to the priorities of the sectors which have to be financed.
There is broad agreement that high priority needs to be given to human resources.
Without significant investment in human resources, there will be a problem with the take-up of funds, even for the projects, even for business support.
Thus, the discussion is being directed to a large extent towards the fact that the candidate countries, as they are already doing, will have to prepare those structures with which they will be able to fund the employment strategy, to fund the infrastructures of their education systems and the reforms needed, all of which are very important to their development.
It is not my feeling that, with the agreement that already exists, significant resources will be safeguarded for the new countries.
As the Commissioner knows, she has made me a very happy man today, but hopefully she has made a lot of other people very happy too!
I am talking about the work in the Luxembourg Council today and the Atypical Workers Directive, which has not passed further.
That is genuinely very important for youth employment opportunities.
Many young people and young students rely upon temporary work for employment in between term times and they will therefore be as happy as I am at the lack of progress today.
My question to the Commissioner is really will she consider - and I am only asking her to consider, not to commit herself - saying a final goodbye, rather than au revoir, to this directive?
If so, she will not only make me happier, but a lot of young people happier too.
.
Mr Bushill-Matthews, would you accept the title of 'charming provocateur'?
It is true that today we were not greatly successful.
However, as you know, the directive for temporary agency workers is a very difficult and complicated one.
The central concept of this directive is to strike a balance between flexibility and security.
I am not at all ready to say adieu.
As I said in my press conference today it is an au revoir, not a 'goodbye'.
Therefore you can expect a new phase with negotiations on this directive.
Mr President, I should like to enter this very interesting debate and state that I agree with the answers the Commissioner has given.
Nevertheless, I believe that the problem of unemployment amongst young people in Europe is almost a red herring since, if we are able to increase Europe's economic growth, we will be providing employment and we will need many young people.
Consequently, the young people from the countries now joining the Union, who will be able to compete on the labour market of the current fifteen, are an asset and not a problem.
There could certainly be a problem in the countries they leave behind.
To put it briefly: economic growth plays a crucial role in a country's capacity to absorb young people and this growth and economic development must be of concern to everyone.
Young immigrants are always an asset.
Mr Bushill-Matthews is well aware that the contribution made by young Portuguese people and Portuguese immigrants has been crucial to the great prosperity that his country, Luxembourg, now enjoys.
I totally agree with you, I only need give you a few figures.
In order to achieve the objective of full employment in 2010, we need to create 22 million jobs for the 25 new countries, so that we arrive at unemployment throughout Europe in the order of 3.5% - 4%.
Is this feasible?
As you quite rightly said, provided growth rates are achieved and the agreed reforms are applied, we have statistics from the past to show that we created 5 million jobs in the 15 countries alone over a four-year period.
Thus a combination of growth and reform can indeed give the desired result.
My second comment is that obviously the problem is in the countries from which immigrants come.
We have the brain drain phenomenon, the fact that these countries are losing human resources at their most dynamic age, the cleverest, most spirited people, and it is very important for these countries to keep their human resources, which is also why our approach, especially with the Structural Funds, is to invest in human resources, especially at these ages.
Question No 32 by Roy Perry (H-0316/03):
Subject: Misapplication of the Acquired Rights Directive with respect to British lecturers
The United Kingdom has stated by way of a letter to the Commission that it is removed from the field of application of Article 3(2) of the Acquired Rights Directive 77/187/EEC
.
I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the importance and seriousness of the issues at stake in relation to the complaint concerning the presumed wrong application of Directive 77/187/EEC following the transfer of colleges of further education in England and Wales to the private sector in the 1990s.
Indeed, this has led to continuous correspondence with the Commission services since 1996.
The honourable Member is probably aware of the fact that the Commission's legal analysis differs from that of the complainants.
According to our information, the United Kingdom has now correctly transposed Directive 77/187/EEC into national legislation.
Accordingly, disputes concerning incorrect application are, in principle, a matter for the national courts.
Therefore the Commission services have stressed on several occasions over the years that the national courts constitute the appropriate legal framework for dealing with the issues raised in the case concerned.
It should be recalled in this respect that the complainants have indeed addressed the national courts but without success.
As far as the legally binding nature of collective agreements in the United Kingdom is concerned, I would like to point out that this is also a matter of interpretation of English law, often requiring a factual appreciation.
The directive and, in particular Article 3(2), does not oblige a Member State to change the legal nature of collective agreements.
Furthermore, even if, generally speaking, collective agreements are not legally binding in the United Kingdom, nothing prevents them from being legally binding if they are incorporated into an employment contract, thereby becoming part of the contractual terms.
Whether or not this is the case is often a complex issue requiring a factual appreciation.
Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the complainants' case, a recent judgment concerned such a binding collective agreement applicable in the National Health Service.
In its judgment, the European Court of Justice explicitly acknowledged that it is for the national courts to determine, if necessary, whether benefits arising from a collective agreement bind the transfer and thus also bind the transferee under Article 3(2).
Accordingly, a non-enforceable collective agreement before the transfer will continue to remain non-enforceable after the transfer.
I am grateful to you for allowing this question to be taken.
I hear with interest what the Commissioner has to say, but she will know very well that there is no comfort in that response for many lecturers in the United Kingdom who assumed that they were going to be guaranteed the rights they had in their previous employment.
They thought that under the Acquired Rights Directive they had some hope of protection of their rights.
The result has been that those who chose to use those rights have seen ten years of pay freeze, ten years of a freeze on any chance of career promotion, and removal of pension rights.
Will the Commissioner say this afternoon whether she thinks they are right in concluding that the acquired rights directive - which they thought would give them protection - has been a totally worthless piece of European legislation?
.
As you very well know, there are two different issues: first, the transposition of the directive and how we evaluate this transposition and, second, implementation.
There have been thousands of pages of correspondence on this matter over many years.
As far as the transposition is concerned, there is now a legal decision according to which this transposition is acceptable, and there is no problem with the government of the United Kingdom.
On the second problem, implementation, it is for the national courts to decide whether it is implemented correctly or not, and there is a decision of the national courts, so the Commission cannot go further.
I am grateful for what the Commissioner says in terms of compliance by the British Government.
I have myself been approached on similar cases, particularly in relation to the exclusion of pension rights from being fully protected under the Acquired Rights Directive, as in the case of a company in Boreham Wood in my constituency.
I wonder if the Commissioner, looking forward, might learn some lessons from the case raised by my colleague and myself in terms of future reviews of the directive even if further action under the current rules appears not to be possible.
.
No, there is nothing in the pipeline concerning the changes in this Directive.
Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 33 to 55 will be replied to in writing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission, I should like, first of all, to thank the President, Mr Pat Cox, for his kind invitation, for the quality of the welcome that has been given to my delegation and to me personally, and for the words which he has kindly spoken about me and about the Algerian people, which demonstrate the strong links which unite us with the people of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking to you at a time when the people of Algeria are still seeking to eradicate the consequences of the disastrous earthquake which has plunged them into mourning, to heal the wounds and the traumas caused by this catastrophe and to rebuild the ruins and to restore life to the towns and villages which were destroyed.
I am most anxious to express our profound gratitude for the gestures of solidarity and sympathy which the European Parliament made to us, and for the assistance of all kinds which was immediately sent to the disaster area by the countries of Europe.
This spontaneous show of solidarity has been a great comfort to the people of Algeria, and I should like, on their behalf, on behalf of the families that have been so sorely tried, to express once again our feelings of intense gratitude to all those who have been at our side throughout this cruel affliction.
Mr President, on 22 April 2002 at Valencia, in Spain, Algeria and the European Union, by solemnly signing their Association Agreement, set the seal on a new and sustainable relationship for a future of solidarity and cooperation.
This agreement represents a genuine economic anchor binding Algeria to the European Community, and it is an illustration of our consistent desire - a desire which is shared by our European partners - to base our relationship on the essential values of mutual respect, shared prosperity and friendship.
The undertaking that we gave together on that occasion opens up broad prospects for intensifying the political dialogue between Algeria and the European Union, in the interests of a global partnership which we are hoping will be in line with our expectations.
Was it not an omen that the Treaty of Rome was signed by a France which had full and entire sovereignty over an Algeria which was already into its third year of the war of national liberation and which was nevertheless still divided into three French dÃ©partements?
Was there, at that time, a single signatory State to the Treaty of Rome which had the good taste and presence of mind to express reservations in favour of our country which was occupied and struggling to gain national liberty?
This undertaking is in line with my country's consistent attitude in favour of privileged cooperation with Europe, as is demonstrated by the gamble taken by Algeria in making Europe, right from the beginning of the seventies, its major energy market.
Algeria committed itself very early on in that respect, via the construction of gas pipelines through Italy and Spain, to the path of long-term cooperation with Europe, thereby giving an expression to a fundamental act of faith in European integration and in future prospects for cooperation with the European continent.
All this goes to show the importance that my country has always attached to the promotion of political dialogue and an economic partnership with the European Union, and I can only say how much I welcome the fact that the signing of our Association Agreement has strengthened our conviction.
Traditionally, we have held regular political consultations with the European Union, a lively and constructive dialogue involving the exchange of many delegations of political parties and members of parliament, who have helped to introduce a climate of understanding into our relationship as a result of a mutual desire to know one another better in order to be better able to cooperate.
Mr President, in this troubled time for international relations, the Euro-Mediterranean region is facing major challenges of different kinds, which are in danger of aggravating the instability factors and the fracture lines between the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Europe's southern Mediterranean coast is the soft underbelly of Europe, as an eminent leader of the twentieth century once said.
It was precisely in order to address this situation and to arm ourselves in advance against these dangers that, together, seven years ago now, we launched the pioneering Barcelona process, with which all the countries surrounding the Mediterranean were to associate themselves.
For Algeria, such a process remains a key reference framework, as well as an essential forum for political dialogue and cooperation, and also an instrument which is relevant to the promotion of stability and security throughout the whole of the Mediterranean basin.
By its objectives, and by the actions which it envisaged, it gave rise to great hopes among the peoples on the southern shore of the Mediterranean basin.
Today those hopes assume even greater significance at a time when the enlargement of the European Union towards Eastern Europe is in danger of diverting the attention of European countries away from the south towards the east, thereby displacing the real centre of interest of the Barcelona process.
For my part, I remain convinced that the enlargement of Europe ought to be a source of precious political inspiration, enabling us to imagine innovative concepts of cooperation between Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean, and calming legitimate fears of the risk of Europe's distancing itself from its neighbours to the south.
It is all a question of balance, and I am sure that the European Union will be able to reconcile its various demands which, let us not forget, also influence the stability and the security of the continent of Europe.
Is it not true to say that, twice in its history, my country has found itself, all too unwillingly, involved in two world wars which had Europe as their principal theatre of action, and that, ever since Sedan, Algeria has taken part in all France's wars?
The Euro-Mediterranean project into which we have launched ourselves without hesitation implies, on the part of everyone, a total commitment to the implementation of the objectives set out in the Barcelona Declaration.
In this context, our action must take into account the interests of all the partners involved, and must respond to our many and varied concerns.
Consequently, it must be global, balanced and multi-dimensional.
Mr President, the emergence of the new context of globalisation had allowed us to hope that growth and development would occur at the same rate.
The countries of the South agreed to many sacrifices, often under duress, in order to be a part of this development of the world economy, and adapting to this new situation has often involved painful adjustments and given rise to burdensome social repercussions.
It has to be admitted now that the promised prospects have, so far, become a reality only in the wealthy countries.
The split between rich and poor countries is becoming increasingly wide.
It is currently a source of deprivation, a source of violence and a source of intolerance, accompanied by other social scourges such as rural exodus and population migration.
As part of the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area, we are obliged to implement, within relatively short time limits, far-reaching changes to our economic and social system.
That represents an enormous challenge and involves huge upheavals in our social and economic structures.
We cannot hope to succeed in making these changes unless the Association Agreement allows the Algerian economy, which is already stretched as a result of the reforms that have been carried out over the past decade, to acquire the means to become integrated, gradually and harmoniously, into the world economy, and to acquire the added value which will give it full credibility, particularly from the point of view of increasing the flow of European investment.
Despite the difficulties which I have just mentioned, Algeria has launched a huge programme to boost the economy, and has provided funding in the form of USD 7 billion over a period of four years.
This is barely enough, in view of the size of the reforms underway.
The support of the European Union is absolutely essential at this particular stage, especially in the form of a sustained commitment to keep investments flowing.
I am afraid that the financial support measures allotted to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as part of the MEDA programme fall well short of expressed expectations.
An example is the budgetary appropriations allocated to Algeria for the first and, in particular, the second tranches of the MEDA bilateral programme.
Mr President, the last 12 years have been an appalling nightmare for the Algerian people, who, while suffering the violence of a particularly cruel form of terrorism, have also had to cope with natural disasters, with droughts lasting several years, with floods, and with several earthquakes, the latest of which has just devastated the area around Algiers.
Although international solidarity was spontaneously and generously shown on the occasion of the last two natural disasters, the people of Algeria have, by contrast, had to live with the feeling that they had been abandoned to their fate during the whole of the time that they were subjected to the extortion, destruction and massacres perpetrated by terrorists who - most cruelly of all - claimed to be motivated by religion.
The developed world has taken a long time to understand the threat posed by this phenomenon, which has usurped the mantle of ideological respectability and used democracy as a means of persuading European opinion that it has the right to destroy Algerian society.
These terrorist organisations have even found asylum and freedom to act in certain capital cities of Europe, where the massacres in Algeria were still giving rise to questions and doubts which showed a total ignorance of the internal situation of the country and of the threat that it represented to the rest of the world.
It was only after the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States that the world's perception changed and it became possible to envisage terrorism as an international scourge against which it would be necessary to engage in a merciless battle on a worldwide scale.
I think I can say that, at that moment, the situation in Algeria became better understood and the sacrifices borne by the Algerian people were at last fully appreciated.
Terrorism is a threat to the very foundations of civilised human society.
As a matter of urgency we must put an end, finally, to this nihilistic culture of terrorism.
However, it is even more important to mount a thorough campaign not only against the manifestations of terrorism, but above all against its causes, its roots, and everything that gives it sustenance.
This world will never build anything solid or lasting unless it bears this objective firmly in mind as a major priority.
However, deprivation engenders violence, and unless you wage war on poverty, poverty will wage war on you.
In that case we shall never fully enjoy the happiness of a peaceful and secure world.
After 12 years of struggle, the security situation in our country has improved considerably, but it still requires the measures of vigilance and protection made necessary by the isolated acts of violence which occur from time to time.
The policy of civil concord and national reconciliation which I introduced as soon as I took office has made a very significant contribution towards calming social tensions, and has reduced terrorist violence to its lowest ever level.
Today, that violence no longer constitutes an obstacle to the resumption of economic activity and growth, or to national or foreign investment.
In the same way, political life has come into its own again, and last year saw several important steps regarding the organisation of legislative elections and the holding of local elections - both of which showed crystal-clear and total transparency - and the constitutional amendment which enabled Amazigh to be elevated to the status of a national language.
Our willingness to create a state subject to the Rule of Law, which respects the rules of democracy and which respects political pluralism, has once again been reinforced by these democratic advances.
The Algerian Government remains convinced that the deepening of the democratic process and the acceleration of economic and social reforms will allow the emergence and the strengthening of a civil society which is capable of making its contribution to the progress of Algerian society, while respecting the rights and the duties of each individual.
In this context, the overall approach of the Government tends to give automatic preference to dialogue and consultation and to make them not only the instrument of political and social regulation but also a powerful factor in promoting vital political and social consensus.
In this dialogue-centred approach, economic and social problems, and the numerous social claims which form the corollary to those problems, assume a special place because of the enormous constraints burdening a national economy which finds itself in the process of changing and of opening up to the demands of the market economy.
It is by no means easy to evolve from a planned economy into a liberal economy, any more than it is easy to evolve from political dirigisme to democratic openness.
What is more, the market economy, like democracy, originates from a culture which cannot be imposed.
At another level, the consolidation of a State subject to the rule of law also comes about through a commitment to reform education, the structures of the State, and the justice system.
In this context, the revision of the penal code and of the penal-procedure code which Algeria has started work on is intended to provide more guarantees regarding the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press, to which we remain fundamentally committed, seeking in this way to reinforce the ethics of the associated professions.
In our countries, too much 'state' is an aberration.
The decline of the state, however, leads to catastrophe and anarchy.
The issue of human rights is one of our main concerns.
It is included in the steps that we are taking to consolidate a State subject to the rule of law.
We are aware of our imperfections in this area, but we all know that in any society respect for human rights requires a long apprenticeship which leads to a true human-rights culture.
We are seriously committed to that, and we are persevering in our commitment.
The creation of the National Consultative Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights is a response to this major concern, and demonstrates our willingness to move forward in this area.
The Association Agreement which now links us to the European Community will enable us to multiply our contacts and exchanges with European countries, and I am convinced that this will lead us towards a strengthening of the democratic tendencies in our own country, and towards a greater openness towards the human-rights culture.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is this the place, is this the time?
I believe that it is, and I do so in good faith.
It is therefore with painful emotion that I again refer to the memory of the victims of the crisis that our country has experienced, assuring their families, as I stand before you here, of the compassion that all Algerian people feel towards them in their pain.
The international community has also shown its sympathy and compassion towards them.
Immediately after the dreadful earthquake which shook several provinces, or wilayas, of the country, I asked the Algerian authorities to mobilise all civil and military resources without delay to cope with this national disaster.
The very next day, the Council of Ministers passed the necessary emergency decisions, which the Government immediately implemented.
Thus the People's National Army, the Security Corps, the civil defence authorities, the medical and paramedical services, Sonelgaz, the Algerian water authority and the other major public services, with an acute sense of duty, mobilised all their available human and material resources and united their efforts in order to cope with the crisis and with the tragic situation with which the country was suddenly faced.
As I speak to you here today I should like to express my gratitude, in particular, for the tremendous upsurge of national solidarity which emerged spontaneously throughout the country on the part of all our citizens, and in particular our young people, who were so keen to bring to their brothers in distress the support of the whole nation.
I also wish to emphasise how great has been the international solidarity, which shows the esteem in which Algeria is held today and the respect which is felt for the Algerian people.
All the countries, large and small, rich and less rich, to whom I now express my gratitude, in addition to the telephone calls and the messages of condolence and sympathy sent to me, have expressed their willingness to provide any material aid which our country needs, and have been anxious to show their sincere and brotherly solidarity in the form of practical gestures, which the entire Algerian population particularly appreciates.
In this respect I should like to pay particular homage to all those specialist rescue teams, from countries which are our brothers and our friends, who, alongside the People's National Army, the civil defence authorities and the Algerian medical teams, have done a splendid and remarkable job of work and have provided us with assistance which is greatly appreciated in these difficult times.
This extraordinary chain of national and international solidarity has been remarkably well supported by the great majority of the media who have done everything possible to provide, in this case, a real public service, making their communication and broadcasting resources available to the families of the victims.
In these sad circumstances I must emphasise that the state has done its duty, the government has assumed its responsibilities, the public institutions and services have played their part and the civilian and military agents of the state, the local authorities and the public establishments and enterprises have done what was required of them.
I have personally been at pains to supervise personally the smooth running of operations to assist the victims and the implementation of measures of all kinds adopted in this field, and to verify that all the institutions in the country are remaining mobilised for this purpose.
Finally, I should like to turn my thoughts to the people who have suffered, and who have met this terrible ordeal with exemplary courage and dignity, and I should like to say to them, speaking from this House with you as witnesses, that we shall take it upon ourselves to reconstruct the areas affected by the earthquake.
The Algerian people have demonstrated, yet again, that solidarity to them is not an empty word, and that they will find in themselves the strength and the capacity to overcome this new ordeal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, facing Europe, the African continent is seeking a way of escaping from its under-developed position and, like the European continent, it is trying to achieve unity through better coordination of its efforts and better use of its resources.
This ambitious undertaking is intended to be based on a vast economic programme which is currently known by the name of NEPAD, and which the leaders of Africa have once again presented to the Heads of State of the G8 countries at their meeting in Ãvian.
I raise this question because I know the interest that Europeans show in everything that relates to Africa and the sympathy that they have always shown towards the efforts of Africans to participate in world development.
In Africa, development, which has been called the 'new name of peace', has for a long time now been more familiar with the inhibiting burdens of selfishness than with the generous outbursts of a dynamic concept of interdependence between nations.
The so-called 'lost decades' for developing countries have been followed by more of the same, and the spectres of poverty, famine and pandemic diseases constantly reappear in Africa.
The countries of Africa have learned much from their failures and their mistakes, in their economic and social choices and in the implementation of particularly restrictive structural adaptation programmes.
It is thus having come to the end of a path rich in lessons that we find ourselves contemplating the possibility of effective African integration, conceived as a long-term, complex and multi-dimensional undertaking and supported by the cooperation of the world outside.
It is a possibility because Africa has courageously brought about a revolution in attitudes in order to ensure a future of democracy, peace and prosperity.
The decision taken at the Algiers Summit of the Organisation of African Unity, establishing an African doctrine for the disqualification and rejection of anti-constitutional changes in political regimes, was a historic decision, marking an important stage in Africa's development.
In the same spirit, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (now known as NEPAD) defines new methods of operation, based on specifically African efforts characterised by responsibility and solidarity, such as Peer Review, which is a system whereby each African Head of State voluntarily submits his internal actions to the calm and rigorous assessment of his peers.
For its part, the institutional architecture of the African Union includes provisions intended to ensure that the nature and democratic operation of national governments are equipped to deal with any attacks and attempts to pervert them, so that joint African action is in line with rules which no one is allowed to infringe.
In this context, it is of the utmost importance that we should really turn globalisation into an opportunity for the development of the countries of the South, by the encouragement of new forms of partnership, capable of unleashing the dynamics of sustainable growth and development.
From this point of view, it must be possible for globalisation, which takes the form of a remarkable contraction in space and time, to become more human and more democratic, because unless the equal participation of all the actors in the great movements of contemporary history is encouraged, globalisation will intrinsically involve the risk of giving free rein to violent forces hostile to the cohesion of national societies and of international society.
The tragic events of 11 September 2001, which brought the horror to its climax, demonstrate the truth that, in the world of today and tomorrow, there can be no sanctuary of security and prosperity in an environment of vulnerability, disorder and destitution.
When international debate covers up legitimate concerns in order to sanction the status quo, when the logic of power relationships carries more weight than mutual understanding, when the voice of reason is stifled or ignored on the international scene, extremists will find an inexhaustible source of nourishment in the injustices, disappointments and frustrations that people experience in their daily lives.
Fundamentally, the response to the phenomena of violence lies in the proper management of international relationships and the promotion of human rights, in their indivisibility and universality at worldwide level.
This presupposes that the international community will abandon its former practices and open itself up to new horizons, in the search for a better-quality destiny for the human race.
It also presupposes that Africa will receive its fair share of the benefits of the growth of the world economy, and will become a centre of attraction for the flows of capital and technologies in which it is so cruelly lacking, so that it can assume primary responsibility for its own development and contribute to the greater equilibrium of the emerging international community.
We should like to believe that the meeting in Ãvian has amplified this message and that the G8 countries have confirmed their faith in the recovery of Africa and renewed their determination to give it all their support in the best-understood interests of everyone.
Algeria is one of the African countries which founded NEPAD, and its activities on the African political scene reflect the major role that it plays in accepting responsibility for and solving the problems which arise in our continent.
A new dynamic is emerging in Africa, whether it is concerned with settling conflicts, deepening the democratic process, improving governance, strengthening institutional capacities or being more ready to accept responsibility for the human dimension of development.
On a smaller scale, we are working with our other partners in North Africa to give substance to the Arab Maghreb Union, of which Algeria currently holds the presidency.
I personally have faith in the future of the AMU.
I have taken on the task of remodelling it on sound and secure foundations. I have not given up hope of being able, soon, to convene an AMU summit, which will enable us to re-launch sub-regional cooperation.
Algeria remains attached to this objective, which cannot be made conditional upon the settlement of the Western Sahara question, which is an issue that requires, in the last analysis, the application of international legality and the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan, to which we are continuing to lend our support.
The role of the UN remains central here, as does the holding of the absolutely essential referendum on self-determination.
Recent developments in the Middle East, a region which is so sensitive and which has suffered so much, constitute a forceful challenge to all of us, because of the serious threat that they represent to stability and security in the region and to peace in the world.
Deprived of their most basic rights, the people of Palestine continue to suffer the horrors of a brutal occupation which has lasted too long, and they are paying a heavy toll faced with Israel's intransigence and its systematic stubbornness in opposing any peace initiative, the latest of which, the 'roadmap', has given rise to no less than fourteen major reservations from Israel, which completely destroy the - albeit very modest - substance of the plan.
It is high time that the international community and, in particular, the United Nations Security Council, pulled itself together and acceded to the legitimate claim of the Palestinian people finally to have their own independent State, ...
(Applause) ... in the context of respect for the rights of all the peoples of the region to live in peace and security.
We hope that the unacceptable intransigence and repeated demands of Israel will not result in the failure of this latest attempt at a settlement represented by the 'roadmap' of the Quartet, despite the somewhat diffident nature of its content.
It is also time that those Syrian and Lebanese territories that are still under Israeli occupation were evacuated and returned to their legitimate rulers.
The situation in Iraq is also a source of great concern in the Arab world.
On this issue, Algeria remains in favour of the strict observance of law and of international legality.
It now believes that the political stabilisation of Iraq will be achieved by re-establishing the sovereignty of the country, ... (Applause) ... and that the international community, represented by the United Nations, must be effectively involved in any process of political rehabilitation and reconstruction in Iraq.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to paint you a picture of the situation in Algeria and of certain other issues, both internal and international, which are a source of concern to us.
I have tried to promote a better understanding of the situation in Algeria, a situation which Members of the European Parliament can always appreciate for themselves by coming to visit our country, where they are always welcome and where we shall be happy to receive them and very happy to listen to their comments and above all to their advice.
These exchanges, which are based on mutual confidence as well as an already established friendship, are more essential than ever now that we are linked by an Association Agreement which strengthens our solidarity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again to thank you for the welcome that you have given to my delegation and to me, and for having been willing to give your attention to what I have to say.
From this platform I say, with your permission, that my country too is made either to succeed or to learn from its misfortunes.
One day soon, in a national upsurge of reconciliation between Algerians, the fields of hope will be green again, and the orchards will once more be covered in blossom.

The winds of adversity and of national discord will be conquered, without a doubt, by the grace of God and thanks to the tenacity of the Algerian people, tempered like steel by suffering, and, in an increasingly interdependent and mutually supportive world, thanks to the help and the support of the international community.
(Loud applause)
President Bouteflika, I should like to thank you for your official visit to the European Parliament, a visit, as I have already emphasised, without equal and therefore a first.
I should like to thank you for your fascinating speech which has touched us all and to which we have listened with a great deal of interest.
Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0154/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on transboundary movements of genetically-modified organisms [15546/1/2002 C5-0081/2003 2002/0046(COD)] [Rapporteur: Mr SjÃ¶stedt].
. (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
When the Cartagena Protocol was successfully negotiated in 2000, this was a significant success for the European Union.
It was also a success for all those of us who want free trade to be conducted in the context of environmental concern and respect for consumers.
The protocol clarifies the conditions for global trade involving genetically-modified products.
To date, 49 countries have ratified the protocol.
It is only necessary for one country to ratify the protocol for it to come into force.
The draft law we are now to debate lays down EU rules for the export of genetically-modified organisms.
In adopting these rules, the European Union fulfils the requirements laid down in the Cartagena Protocol.
These new rules are coming at precisely the right time, and they may perhaps also serve as a model and inspiration for states that are working on their regulations right now.
Compared with the proposal tabled by the Commission, the rules we are to adopt tomorrow are a little stricter and clearer.
They are more in line with what is laid down in the protocol and, in certain areas, go still further.
In Parliament, we have focused on tightening up the proposal in certain key areas.
We have made sure that rules and definitions shall not be looser than what is laid down by the protocol and that express approval by the country of import shall always be required before the export takes place.
The draft law now makes this crystal-clear, explaining that the absence of a response from the country of import may never be viewed as 'silent consent'.
The legislation of the country of import must always be respected.
The proposal makes it clear that we must not export anything from the EU that is not permitted within the EU and that there must be considerable transparency, with the public being given information about the export taking place.
The proposal also makes it plain that responsibilities must be clearly distributed so that it is the actual exporter who gives notice of the export.
Overall, the text we are now to adopt means that the European Parliament has obtained a hearing for approximately 80% of what we wanted to get through at first reading.
We have also discussed this proposal with the Council of Ministers.
COREPER has already adopted the text we are to adopt tomorrow.
In this way, we can avoid conciliation, and the legislation will be ready when the protocol comes into force globally.
That has been possible thanks to a significant consensus between the Council of Ministers and Parliament.
There has also been a clear willingness to compromise and a shared desire on the part of the political groups to work quickly.
This has happened following constructive cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, whom I would thank, one and all.
We have also had very close cooperation firstly with the Danish and then with the Greek Presidencies.
They too deserve thanks, and the same applies to those with responsibility at the Commission's Environment Directorate-General, who have been of very great help.
By adopting these rules, we show that environmental considerations and respect for developing countries' legislation are key concepts for the EU's view of the global trade in genetically-modified products.
There is a need to do this at the very time when the United States is pushing for issues of this kind to be resolved within the World Trade Organisation.
We have recently seen examples of how this country has dumped genetically-modified food in countries that do not permit such food in their own national legislation.
This shows very clearly how important it is for the EU to adopt rules right now that indicate a more responsible, credible and long-term approach to these complex and very controversial issues.
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, in Swedish, for his excellent work on this very complex issue.
It is an issue of great importance not only for us Europeans but also for the rest of the world, especially the developing countries.
. Mr President, the proposal on the table today is linked to the recent ratification by the European Community of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
The overall purpose, as we have heard already, of this United Nations agreement is to establish common rules to be followed in transboundary movements of GMOs in order to protect biodiversity and human health at world level.
The European Union has to fulfil its international obligations, which means transposing into our own legislation the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol.
This is the objective of the proposal we are discussing today.
The Commission has already expressed its reservations on some political points of this procedure, particularly since the common position agreed in the first reading goes well beyond the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol on a substantial number of issues.
Despite its reservations, the Commission is willing to cooperate on the basis of the package of compromise amendments we have on the table today, in order to increase the chances of reaching agreement at the second reading.
Therefore, in a spirit of compromise, the Commission will not oppose the package.
However, the Commission still believes that it might have been better to adhere more closely to the provisions of the protocol in order not to impose an excessive burden on Community exporters.
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that it is important to progress swiftly in order to have the implementing legislation adopted before the protocol enters into force.
This will be soon, as Mr SjÃ¶stedt said, since 49 countries have already ratified it and the deposit of 50 instruments of ratification is required for its entry into force.
I would like to stress that the European Union has been a key player in these international negotiations from the very beginning.
I remember this vividly since that is what I had to start with as a new Commissioner.
We need to send a clear signal that we intend to honour our commitments and be in a position to fully implement the protocol as soon as it enters into force, which should now be a matter of months.
The Commission is in a position to support the package of amendments submitted for the approval of the Parliament as part of a compromise.
The package consists of Amendment Nos 19-26.
Let me just comment briefly on some of the amendments from the package to illustrate the Commission's position.
Amendment No 19 does recognise the need to respect the party or non-party of imports that can be regulated by your safety framework, consistent with the protocol.
This is in line with the position taken on numerous occasions by the Commission in international forums, which is to respect the right of countries to a free informed choice with regard to GMOs.
So the Commission can accept Amendment No 19.
It can accept Amendments Nos 24-26 on improved public access to information regarding transboundary movements of GMOs, which is in line with the general framework of public access to environmental information and with Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.
Amendments Nos 21 and 22 impose an obligation to wait for prior written consent before proceeding with the export of GMOs.
The Commission believes that this goes beyond the Biosafety Protocol and is also the only amendment in the package about which the Commission had some serious reservations.
However, as part of the overall compromise, the Commission can agree to both amendments.
By way of conclusion, I would like to say that Parliament has worked in a swift and transparent manner in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council.
Once again, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, for his efforts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by thanking our rapporteur Mr SjÃ¶stedt very warmly for his cooperation, which was positive and fair.
However, my thanks are due equally to the Commission, the Danish and of course particularly the current Greek Presidency, which worked with great commitment to achieve a compromise between the Parliament and the Council.
We are all keen to avoid a conciliation procedure for this report, for it deals, after all, with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the protection of biological diversity, which is a subject close to everyone's heart.
The European Union was indeed a key player in the negotiations on the Cartagena Protocol.
This makes it all the more important to transpose the Protocol swiftly into Community law now, thus sending out a clear political signal of our continued commitment.
The main priority of the draft before us is to find a solution, which has eluded us until now, to the issue of EU exports of living GMOs to third countries.
Here, practicability must be the key imperative.
We must achieve realistic legislation that can be applied in practice.
This is why I am pleased that the Council has not incorporated, in this regulation, a number of amendments proposed at first reading, for example on the inclusion of aids.
These amendments aimed to intervene in pending legislative processes through this report on the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol.
By 'pending legislative processes', I mean the legislation on genetically-modified food and feed, their labelling and traceability.
We debated and voted on this matter at second reading in committee just two weeks ago.
The outcome was very close; opinions diverge widely and it still remains to be seen how the plenary will finally vote in July.
It would therefore be quite wrong to try to anticipate the outcome.
A vote on the environmental liability regulation has only just taken place at first reading as well.
A final decision on this issue is certainly not yet in sight.
For this reason, any statement on the liability issue in connection with traceability of GMOs and aids in the current report on transboundary movement had to be emphatically rejected.
These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law.
However, relevant amendments from the first reading did not make it to this second reading either.
I am pleased that the Council has decided in principle to adopt my amendments on exemptions to the system of notification and information for GMOs in transit and in closed systems.
We really do need these exemptions to ensure that there are no impediments to research.
The Council has also made it clear that the so-called Advanced Informed Agreement procedure set out in the Cartagena Protocol should only apply to first movements.
Conversely, this provides an exemption to the information procedure for GMO exports to a third country, if this third country has already given approval to another country for the import of the same GMO.
These exemption provisions are necessary since the AIA procedure, as the information procedure in this case, does not promise any enhanced safety and would simply obstruct transboundary movement unnecessarily.
I believe that the report before us, with all the compromises that we have drafted, is good and viable, and would ask all of you to vote for all the compromise amendments.
This will set us on the right course and avoid a lengthy conciliation procedure.
Mr President, I should also like to say a big thank-you to Mr SjÃ¶stedt for his outstanding work on putting into effect the Catagena Protocol on Biosafety in Europe.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt has shown considerable openness and a very great desire to achieve results, but I also think that the Commission and the Council - during both the Danish and Greek Presidencies - have made very positive contributions so that we can now avoid protracted discussion in the Conciliation Committee.
We are now obtaining a high level of protection in relation to the rules for the export of GMOs from the EU. I think that the developing countries, in particular, are well protected.
They are in the position of being able to exercise genuine choice in connection with the import of GMO products, even though they may of course be thought to be exposed to quite aggressive marketing from parts of industry.
By far the majority of Parliament's amendments have been accepted, and this means we can have the Catagena Protocol put into effect without its wording being weakened for political reasons - on the contrary, with the wording of the protocol being tightened up in certain respects.
This means, for example - and I see this as the most important thing of all - that there can be no export of GMOs without the express consent of the country of import.
It is not enough that there should be no reaction, and this cannot be interpreted as tacit consent.
Express consent is also required, something that I think has been quite crucial in these negotiations.
In my opinion, the result makes an important contribution to the overall complex of laws that we shall now soon have on the subject of GMOs and that are designed to protect our health but, above all, to protect biodiversity, even though the ability genetically to manipulate the products of nature has opened the way for doing so.
This is, however, a constructive contribution to the overall picture.
Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this issue, which has enabled us to come to an agreement on this second reading.
At a time when GMOs are the subject of intense debate, not only in Europe but throughout the world, it is vital that we can agree on at least some aspects of the regulation.
Amongst the most important points in this report are the requirement for prior written express consent of the importing country before any movement of GMOs can take place, an obligation on the Commission to make export notifications available to the public and the requirement on Member States to prevent accidental cross-boundary movement of GMOs - the latter addressing the major debate of the moment, coexistence.
Here we are talking about implementing the Cartegena Protocol, which covers the export of GMOs to countries outside the EU.
The protocol, as others have said, will enter into force when ratified by 50 countries.
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that 49 countries, plus the European Community, have already done so.
As eight Member States have been awaiting adoption of this regulation, a positive vote tomorrow will lead almost directly to the Cartegena Protocol coming into force.
This will have a significant impact, particularly on the poorest countries, allowing them the choice of whether or not to accept GMOs, the very choice that we want for people everywhere, including those people forced to depend on aid.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that it has been possible to achieve a common position between the Council, the Commission and Parliament here.
It would have been very sad if no consensus had been reached on such an important issue.
As Mr Lund has already mentioned, the Council initially agreed unanimously that the exporters must have the approval of the importing country before they undertake the first transboundary movement.
However, in order to meet the Commission halfway, the Council and the Parliament then voted in favour of the requirement for this approval to be provided in writing prior to the first transboundary export of a GMO.
It was also possible to reach a consensus between the Parliament, the Council and the Committee with regard to the exporters' notification documents.
The exporter is required, for a period of a minimum of five years, to keep a record of the notification and the acknowledgement of receipt from the competent authority of the importing country.
He is also obliged to forward these documents to the authority of the Member State from which the GMO is exported and to the Commission.
The Commission then makes these documents available to the public in compliance with the European regulations on access to environmental information.
This new-found consensus between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission will, I believe, give the public the opportunity to be informed at all times about everything that happens.
I am certainly convinced that these provisions will be effective.
I hope very much that this new European regulation will overcome much of the public's mistrust of GMOs.
Mr President, like everyone else, I welcome this report.
We should not underestimate the significance of the step forward that we will take tomorrow when we vote on it in Parliament.
It will bring all the EU countries into compliance with the Cartegena Protocol and enable them to go forward and ratify it.
The ratifications will bring the protocol into force.
There would then be further countries of the world quickly coming forward to ratify it, to ensure that they are present next April at the first conference of the parties that will turn the Cartegena Protocol into a reality in terms of an international trading system.
I welcome that.
It is an excellent step forward.
It demonstrates how we can introduce the new technology of genetic modification.
We can control it, use it, put the products in the market place and give people choices, wherever they are in the world, whether they are rich or poor.
I welcome this report because it will show us a way forward.
There remains only one last piece in the jigsaw of legislation within the EU needed to implement the proper control and use of GMOs, which is the traceability in labelling legislation that we hope to bring before Parliament next month.
This is a pragmatic and sensible way forward. This is a way in which we can use these new technologies and implement them to the benefit of all.
I hope we can take lessons from what we do tomorrow when we deal with further legislation next month.
Mr President, I too would like to pay very warm tribute to the rapporteur.
This regulation is a great success.
It means that the eight remaining Member States yet to ratify the Protocol can now begin the process.
The Protocol will therefore come into force very soon, marking the start of a new era in international environmental law, an era of international genetic technology law.
The Biosafety Protocol is the first international treaty to regulate genetic technology, and it does so explicitly and exclusively.
It is to be hoped that the voices still raised to dispute that there is any difference between genetically-modified and conventionally bred organisms will at last fall silent.
This House has greatly improved the regulation before us on numerous points, often in exemplary cooperation with the Council.
On many key points, the regulation goes far beyond what is required by the Biosafety Protocol itself.
The fact that all groups support the compromise reached is therefore encouraging and a hopeful sign for the implementation of future environmental agreements.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am now faced with the very difficult, if not impossible, task of finding something new to say.
Everything has already been said, but not yet by everyone.
I shall therefore follow everyone else's lead and express my warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work and positive cooperation.
I would also like to congratulate him on his excellent substantive work, as well as on his great sensitivity during the negotiations, which enabled us to achieve a compromise among the parliamentary groups and among the European institutions.
I think that is absolutely crucial.
It has already been said repeatedly here today that the speedy entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol is naturally an issue that is close to everyone's hearts.
However, I do not want to pass up the opportunity to express my great regret that the largest exporter of genetically-modified organisms, namely the United States, again remains outside the frame on such a key issue, where global multilateral regulations are essential.
We face a major political challenge, that of convincing our counterparts in the United States of the need for such regulation.
The common position is also a great success.
In substantive terms, the Council endorsed almost 70 per cent of the position adopted by Parliament at first reading.
I note with satisfaction, especially as rapporteur for genetically-modified food and feed, that there is clearly something of a tradition here, with the Council generally following Parliament's position.
I hope that the vote tomorrow will be a major step towards the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0151/2003) by Mr De Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels [COM(2002) 595 C5-0558/2002 2002/0259(COD)].
. First, I should like to than the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for his report on the Commission's marine fuels sulphur proposal.
I know that he only took over as rapporteur late in March, so I should like to commend his efficiency and indeed urge the Council to follow his example.
The aim of the Commission's proposal is to reduce ship emissions of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter.
These are directly related to the sulphur content of marine fuels, which is currently 2.7% on average, or 27 000 parts per million (ppm) compared with road fuel, which has a new sulphur limit of 10 ppm.
We therefore propose two new marine fuels sulphur limits: a 1.5% limit for all ships in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel, which is the internationally agreed sulphur emission control area; the same 1.5% limit for passenger vessels going to or from ports anywhere in the European Union; and a 0.2% limit for ships at berth in EU ports.
These limits will achieve significant emissions reductions, which are targeted at reducing acidification in northern Europe and improving local air quality in ports and coastal areas.
The human health benefits include 2 000 life-years saved annually as a result of better air quality.
The proposal is cost-effective, with benefits outweighing costs by over 2 to 1.
It is also practical and enforceable, designed to allow ships to obtain compliant fuel and use it safely, and to allow effective enforcement in ports.
Importantly, given that shipping is a global industry, the main element of the proposal is aligned with internationally-agreed rules set out in the International Maritime Organisation's Air Pollution Convention, that is, MARPOL, Annex VI.
In preparing this proposal, the Commission worked closely with the industry and NGO stakeholders to make sure the result was environmentally ambitious as well as politically and practically feasible.
We will consider Parliament's amendments with the same objective in mind.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Goodwill from the Christian Democrats, Mr Langen from the Socialists and Mrs Thors from the Liberals.
We worked well together.
The topic of sulphur in marine fuel may sound technical and dull, but it is very important in terms of both acidification and of public health.
In 2010, the amount of sulphur originating from sea-going ships will be nearly as high as that originating from all other land resources combined.
This is because we have already done a great deal on land. The large chimney stacks of factories and power stations, but also cars spring to mind.
In a few years' time, we will be heading towards 10 ppm, compared to 27 000 ppm accounted for by sea-going vessels.
This is nearly 3 000 times higher than for cars.
Acidification is still a major problem.
In my own country, the Netherlands, for example, only 10% of the environment is protected against acidification, which leaves 90% that is not.
Heathland is still changing into grassland, and sensitive ecosystems are still facing destruction.
This is why I am extremely pleased to have struck a compromise with all the political groups, which goes much further than what the European Commission proposes.
Indeed, we suggest introducing a 0.5% limit in two steps.
Only then will we tackle the problem of acidification in all seriousness.
The other reason why we want to go so far is public health.
Sea-going ships emit black carcinogenic particles, which the wind carries for 50, 100, even hundreds of kilometres - an aspect that the Commission has overlooked.
This is why we feel that the proposal to reduce sulphur content levels down to 1.5% is too modest.
I should urge Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to immerse herself in this issue and to adopt the European Parliament's proposal.
We will then clean up those sea-going vessels in one fell swoop and not take any half measures.
How do we arrive at this 0.5% threshold?
This is indeed ambitious.
A reduction in the sulphur content from 3% to 1.5% is possible for oil refineries without too many extreme costs.
Reducing it even further to 0.5% is technically feasible, but will certainly cost three times as much, and ship owners will ultimately need to carry these extra costs.
As the Commissioner stated a moment ago, the shipping industry is a very competitive business.
This is why it is particularly pleasing that a company such as P&O has already fitted one of its large ferries with a scrubber, which only cost a bargain EUR 1.5 million. It will reduce sulphur by 95%, carcinogenic particles by 80% and the emission of NOx by 10 to 20%.
The device is called an eco-silencer, as it also greatly reduces the noise level.
In my view, this scrubbing technique works very well.
As long ago as in 1988, there was a ship in Norway that was equipped with this installation, the first of its kind.
We have, however, added a clause to the Parliament amendments that a trial should be done first to make sure that the system works really well.
Once this is successful, we would like to give the go-ahead, also to a system of emissions trading, so that it becomes possible for companies to equip their ships with a new system of this kind one after the other rather than all at once.
If they all needed to be fitted simultaneously, or if we all went down to 0.5% in terms of bunker fuel oil, it would be a much more expensive operation.
Such a system of emissions trading is cheaper.
In short, ecology and economy go hand in hand.
This is why, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, I would urge you to have another look and join the Parliament in reducing the level to 0.5%.
A final reason why it is important to do something about these particles is that according to many climate scientists, these particles also adversely affect the climate.
All sea-going ships together account for 20% of these particles.
This aspect should also be taken into consideration.
This is a third reason why we should go beyond 1.5% and go for 0.5%.
Mr President, Commissioner, in our discussions in the Committee on Industry, we focussed especially on the various technical options to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels.
Here too, we started by considering the real impact of such a reduction.
We can visualise this in very practical terms.
If you visit any port in the European Union - let's take Hamburg as an example - and sit down on the quayside, you have buses on one side which comply with the Euro 4 limit and now produce virtually no particulate emissions, and on the other side you have ships - service barges, perhaps - where you can actually see the particulate matter being released.
There is clearly something wrong here, technically speaking.
It is therefore appropriate to step up the measures adopted in respect of shipping.
In Hamburg, for example, 80% of sulphur dioxide emissions and around 20% of particulate emissions now come from shipping, even though there are of course far fewer ships on the sea than private vehicles and lorries on the roads.
If we consider that ships are replaced relatively infrequently and engines are long-life products, it is difficult to achieve very much with exhaust gas technology for diesel engines in the short term.
We are therefore focussing on the technology to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels.
That has a direct impact, and Mr de Roo has already given us the figures: such fuels typically contain 2.7% of sulphur, compared to 0.0001% for automotive fuels.
There is clearly a great deal of potential here.
We need to agree on the level of reduction we must achieve.
The aim is to introduce a 0.5% sulphur limit on marine fuels in order to attain a real reduction in sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions.
We spent a long time discussing how we can sensibly achieve this target, and finally opted for this two-step approach, which offers scope for development.
I too would ask you, Commissioner, to go along with this two-step approach so that we can finally achieve the 0.5% limit.
It is supported - as you see - by a large majority in this House.
Of course it would be better if we could proceed on the basis of an international consensus here, because naturally, the ships are not only refuelled in the European Union.
However, MARPOL is itself a cumbersome vessel, as the Commissioner knows, which offers little room for manoeuvre.
In my view - and the negotiations on the other issues of relevance to the environment and safety bear this out - if the European Union is the driving force here, MARPOL will start to move as well.
In other words, if we take this step towards a 0.5% limit, I believe that this will offer us the prospect of achieving more robust agreements on this limit at international level.
From our perspective, the task is not just to decide on a specific technology.
If it is possible to reduce sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions in another way than by reducing the sulphur content, that is naturally to be welcomed.
The aim is to reduce emissions.
It is not our job to decide how this should be done.
To that extent, I am also in favour of examining alternative technologies and, if this review produces the right outcomes, to implement them as well.
We have therefore opened the way for alternative technologies here as well.
The cost issue was naturally a major consideration in the Committee on Industry.
Low-sulphur fuel is of course more expensive.
However, as experience in the Baltic bears out, low-sulphur fuel oil has the advantage of resulting in less maintenance work and better fuel efficiency, so the additional cost of using low-sulphur fuel oil is to some extent compensated by cost savings.
I therefore believe that in the interests of the environment, but also in the interests of the economy, the 0.5% limit should be the target. I believe this is the right route, so let us follow it together.
Mr President, as Mr Lange has already said, we have made tremendous progress in reducing the emissions from road vehicles, by using better technology, using catalytic converters and lean-burn engines and by supplying better fuel - the ten parts per million diesel which Euro 4 would lay down.
At the same time we have the problem of what to do with the residue from the oil refineries, because we are taking the sulphur out of the fuel used in road vehicles, fuel which is 26 000 parts per million sulphur.
So of course we export to the third world.
The Prestige tanker was carrying high-sulphur heavy oil from Estonia to Singapore, but a lot of the rest is used in shipping, causing pollution at sea which we prevented on land.
We have an international agreement under MARPOL Annex VI to reduce the sulphur content in sensitive sea areas to 1.5% in the Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic.
Even this small step forward will cost one billion euros per year, a cost which will be ultimately borne by the consumers buying the goods which are delivered by ship.
The easy bit is to achieve this, using low-sulphur crude or blending.
Stage two as proposed by Mr de Roo will be more expensive and it needs to be carefully costed before we go forward with that.
There is of course another approach, and that is not to just look at the fuel, as in cars, but to use abatement technology, so called 'sea-water scrubbers', and I am pleased that the compromise includes provision for trials of this new technology.
As we speak two ferries owned by P&O operating on the Dover/Calais route, an important connection between old and new Europe, are undergoing major refits in Germany.
One of them, the Pride of Kent is being fitted with the converter, the Eco-Silencer, and its sister ship the Pride of Canterbury is not being fitted, although it has been adapted for fitting at a later date.
I am confident these trials will show that the benefits of using this technology go over and above the directive in terms of delivering a 95% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions, as against a 40% reduction which we can achieve through using the fuel.
It is a big improvement over MARPOL Annex VI, with the additional benefit of reducing particulates by 80% and a substantial reduction in nitrogen oxide pollution.
The environmental concerns that Mrs Thors expressed need to be addressed, particularly the effects of putting this dilute sulphuric acid into the sea in certain port areas and also how we dispose of the sludge on store in an environmentally sensitive way.
I would like to thank Mr de Roo and of course Mrs Hautala, who started this report, and the other rapporteurs for the constructive way in which we have managed to negotiate an agreement within Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not usually thank my fellow rapporteurs, but this time I want to thank Mr de Roo, together with all my colleagues, for their constructive cooperation.
We have worked openly and constructively.
I have proceeded on the basis that we in actual fact want to improve the environmental situation in the coastal states.
When, today, we look at the Commission's proposal and at the MARPOL Convention's Annex VI, we see that, according to information I have received, it should quite soon come into force because 47.57% of world tonnage is affiliated to it.
I must, however, say what a shame it is that a great many EU countries, including the country I know best, have not ratified it.
I think, however, that the example involving MARPOL shows that the Commission's proposal was not perhaps as ambitious as we had wished and that we must make further progress.
When we get together to take a measure within the maritime sphere, we can now, as Mr Lange also said, achieve a very great deal internationally.
Together, the EU countries and the candidate countries have such a large fleet that we often have our rules put into effect in the IMO.
I therefore also view the directive and the improvements we are making in the light of this.
That is how we must work together.
We have been talking a very great deal about the new reduction methods, an area Mr Goodwill said I had been anxious about.
In actual fact, I want the Commission to take an honest and broadly based look at the subsequent environmental effects.
It may well be that the methods are better for one area of the environment but worse for another.
We need broadly based follow-up systems in different eco-systems in different types of water.
The overall effects need to be looked at.
Finally, I want to say that our group will request a separate vote on Amendments Nos 20 and 21 in order to clarify anything that may be obscure.
Our group will also vote against them because we do not think it is possible to implement them.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr de Roo on his excellent report and on the fact that he was able to reach a compromise with the shadow rapporteurs.
I shall say, first of all, that, according to data from the European Environment Agency, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions we must focus on maritime transport.
This focus on maritime transport in order to resolve the problem of climate change must not be developed, however, at the cost of acidification by sulphur dioxide emissions.
I therefore consider it unacceptable that the efforts made on land to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions have not been matched at sea and I consequently welcome the Commission's excellent initiative, although I feel it should be more ambitious.
First of all, the upper limits for sulphur content should be lower, and so I fully support the figure of 0.5%; secondly, zones should be extended with the aim of reducing sulphur dioxide emissions into other zones to below the levels laid down in the MARPOL Convention - it is therefore crucial that the Commission fights within the MARPOL Convention to extend these emissions reductions to the Mediterranean, the Northeast Atlantic and the Black Sea; thirdly, I believe it is important that our action in the field of climate change to reduce the economic costs of complying with the Kyoto Protocol can also be applied to the problem of acidification.
If we are going to achieve a EUR 1.3 billion reduction in the cost of complying with the Kyoto Protocol in Europe, we should also apply an identical system for sulphur dioxide emissions trading so that we can lower even further the cost of achieving these aims.
. Mr President, the Commission has carefully considered the proposed amendments.
We are able to accept three-quarters of them fully, in part, or in principle.
Most offer helpful clarification and improve the quality of the proposal, as has been expressed by speakers here tonight.
Those amendments that we cannot accept or accept only in part relate to three main issues.
The first and biggest issue is the proposal for tighter marine fuel sulphur limits extended to a wider sea area.
The report proposes a phased approach, starting with the 1.5% set out in the Commission proposal, with a tighter 0.5% limit in a second phase.
Later phases also extend the area where ships have to comply with these limits in all exclusive economic zones and territorial seas throughout the European Union.
Amendment No 20 contradicts this and goes further still, proposing that the 0.2% sulphur limit for ships at berth should be extended throughout the 12-mile territorial seas of all EU Member States.
We believe that these new and extended limits are premature.
I do not doubt that there may be environmental benefits.
These have not been quantified; nor have the costs, which could be significant.
Contrary to the normal rules of economics, the more low-sulphur fuel is required, the more expensive it gets. That is because refineries have to invest more and more in de-sulphurisation technology to increase capacity.
The proposed new phases also go beyond the internationally agreed 1.5% sulphur emission control area in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, but it is open to Member States to propose the designation of new sulphur emission control areas at the International Maritime Organisation and to negotiate tighter fuel limits for these areas.
Shipping is a global industry.
Given that this international policy mechanism exists, we believe that it should be used as a first resort.
However, if tighter limits prove necessary and an international solution cannot be reached, the review clause in the proposal gives the Commission the right to take action at EU level at a later date.
The second issue concerns emissions offsetting, or trading.
The concept of emissions trading for conventional air pollutants is not currently well developed at EU level, even for land-based stationary emission sources.
For sea-going mobile emission sources - ships - we also believe that the idea is somewhat premature.
Trading is not permitted under MARPOL Annex VI.
Another concern is that ship emissions of air pollutants have regional or local impacts that trading schemes might not be sensitive enough to address.
It is quite difficult to see how and by whom any scheme would be administered and enforced.
That said, we are actively considering emissions trading and other economic instruments as possible complements to regulation in future.
For this reason we can accept Amendment No 44 in principle, which requires the Commission to consider a range of economic instruments and report back to Parliament and the Council.
The last issue relates to requirements on the Commission.
Amendment Nos 32 and 44 propose to bring forward the date of the Commission's 2010 report on the implementation of the directive.
They also require the Commission to present new proposals, with a report, to revise fuel sulphur limits or to introduce economic instruments.
The Commission believes that it would be too early to report on the implementation of the directive in 2007 or 2008, given that some of the proposed fuel sulphur limits would not enter into force until 2008.
We also believe that it is premature to prescribe the content of the report and require it to be accompanied by legislative proposals.
While we can accept Amendment Nos 30 and 34 in principle, we believe these are also too prescriptive about the Commission's activities.
You know how sensitive we are to these things.
In each case we would propose an alternative wording.
Finally, just a few words about the possibilities offered by exhaust-gas cleaning.
The tighter fuel sulphur limits proposed in today's report are linked to the possible use of exhaust-gas cleaning technology or scrubbing, as an alternative means of compliance.
This is allowed under MARPOL and, provided it does not emit harmful effluent into enclosed waters, the Commission proposal already includes a review clause to allow scrubbing in future.
The technology appears to offer potential benefits, reducing sulphur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides and particles.
It may also cost less than switching fuels for ships which frequently travel on EU seas.
On the other hand it is very important to prove that the technology has no adverse impact on the marine environment, so that we do not simply replace one environmental problem with another, as you have also pointed out.
Subject to successful sea trials we believe that scrubbing can indeed be considered as an alternative to low-sulphur fuels and not just for the proposed second-phase limit of 0.5%.
So, we welcome Parliament's proposals for a new text on scrubbing.
I would like to hand in a list in writing summarising the Commission's position on all the amendments tabled
Thank you Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries:
(A5-0168/2003) by Mr Hudghton, on the proposal for a Council regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms [COM(2002) 672 C5-0026/2003 2002/0275(CNS)];
(A5-0165/2003) by Mr Stevenson, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EEC) 2847/93 [COM(2002) 739 C5-0030/2003 2002/0295(CNS)];
(A5-0162/2003) by Mr Fava, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Action plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry [COM(2002) 600 C5-0073/2003 2003/2039(INI)].
When the representative of the Commission first presented this report to the Committee on Fisheries, he stated that the subject was so technical (and even routine) that we may even find it boring.
I disagree.
Devising and implementing technical measures aimed at protecting and conserving young fish is of crucial long-term importance to the fishing industry, as well as to the aim of achieving sustainability in fisheries.
If technical measures are unsuccessful, or are seen to be applied inequitably between fishing nations or types of fishery in a particular area, then the ultimate objective will not be met.
The timing of this particular proposal, on the heels of the December Fisheries Council and its decisions on CFP reform and interim cod recovery measures, provides an opportunity for the Commission and the Council to regain some of the credibility which currently is severely lacking - certainly around northern fishing nations such as Scotland and Ireland.
The amendments which were approved by the committee - and which I hope will be endorsed by the whole House tomorrow - include two, which simply correct inaccurate references in the Commission's text.
Of the others, Amendment No 2 seeks to ensure that the Council will have an input to the detailed rules in connection with the conditions under which combinations of net sizes may be carried.
This is an area which the Commissioner will know has caused significant difficulty under the current regulation.
It is unlikely that unilateral rewriting of such important rules by the Commission will help to restore any faith in the process.
Amendment No 4 addresses another - in my view - unacceptable anomaly, namely the provision which would allow those fishermen using the very smallest of mesh sizes in industrial fisheries for sandeel, for example, to retain undersized fish.
The rationale that it is somehow acceptable to land undersized fish, provided it is not sold for human consumption, is totally impossible to justify to those involved in the whitefish sector who use the largest of mesh sizes, while suffering draconian cuts in their quotas and days at sea.
A number of amendments which were lost in committee have been retabled by my group.
I seek full support for their inclusion tomorrow.
The proposed establishment of Regional Advisory Councils, which was agreed, albeit in a watered-down form, as part of the reformed CFP, provides an ideal forum in which to involve stakeholders and to harness existing expertise.
Unless RACs are to be given meaningful work to do, they will quickly become regarded as pointless talking-shops.
Equally, if technical measures are to be supported and implemented by fishermen, it is essential that they accept that particular measures are appropriate to the task.
It seems to me that this proposal provides the ideal opportunity to achieve these two worthwhile ends - the meaningful involvement of experts through RACs, and therefore a greater likelihood that technical measures will be effective and appropriate to a particular fishing zone.
Further amendments address the question of Member States' ability to take action, in relation to their own fleets, which exceeds the minimum required under EU regulation.
The current version of the technical measures allows for this provision.
It is mysterious, in my view, that this provision has somehow disappeared without adequate explanation from the new proposal.
Surely if conservation is the objective and technical measures are utilised, it ought to be permitted for individual Member States to seek to achieve additional benefits if they deem it to be necessary This provision should also be able to be applied by Member States to their own fleets in waters other than Community waters.
The challenge currently facing EU fisheries management is to somehow recover from a major crisis in confidence.
Certainly in Scotland there is such a crisis, which has led my own political party, the SNP - a pro-European party - to commit itself to campaign for the scrapping of the CFP as currently formulated.
This week in the Westminster Parliament, a Bill will be tabled calling for UK withdrawal from the CFP.
Unless a dramatic change in attitude is forthcoming, such demonstrations of disgust with the process will continue to be expressed.
I hope that the Commission can accept that there is a need for it to take the lead in changing the perceived 'we know best' attitude, which can lead to such resentment.
The current proposal, not even mentioning Regional Advisory Councils once, is unacceptable.
I hope that this omission can be corrected.
I hope that Parliament will support all of the amendments tomorrow.
I hope that the Commission too will accept that there is a need to change the way things are done, and done for the better.
Mr President, we are well aware in this House that many thousands of fishermen, processors and ancillary workers have suffered severe hardship as a result of the cod recovery proposals agreed by the Council last December.
The whitefish fleet in Ireland and the UK in particular have been hardest hit, being forced to tie up their boats for half of every month and having their quotas cut by more than 50% on the days that they can fish.
These interim measures have been in place since 1 February this year and yet not a single penny in compensation has been paid to any of those affected by the cuts.
It was salutary to note that Commissioner Fischler himself saw the need to call upon the Member States to live up to their responsibilities and apply for aid from the fisheries budget.
He said that of the EUR 3.7 billion in the budget to 2006, only 3% had been earmarked for socio-economic aid, despite the obvious hardship suffered by many fishermen.
In fact, in the UK the figure is 0%, which is a shameful indictment of the UK Government.
Its failure to apply for this aid or indeed, to submit proposals for emergency aid from the EUR 150 million voted by a huge majority in this House in March, amounts to a naked betrayal of our fishing sector in their time of need.
No wonder more than 230 UK fishermen have applied to scrap their vessels.
But decommissioning on such a scale, on top of the 20% who scrapped their vessels last year, could take the UK whitefish fleet below the critical mass needed to support the harbour workers, ancillary staff and processors on whom the remaining fishermen rely.
If they go, the whole industry will collapse.
And it is against this background that I must express my surprise at the Commission's position on the Irish Box.
It seems to me to be an utter paradox that the Commission can, on the one hand, support such a draconian regime to enable cod and other whitefish stocks to recover, while at the same time calling for the effective dismantling of the Irish Box.
The Irish Box is one of the most important nursery and spawning grounds in European waters.
It is of vital importance as a conservation resource, as numerous scientific studies have demonstrated, and yet the Commission appears ready to accept the argument that restricted access in this zone somehow amounts to discrimination.
Let us be quite clear about this.
Of course there is restricted access within the Irish Box.
That is why it is a conservation zone.
But the Irish, British, French and Spanish fleets have been fishing in the Irish Box for years.
Now I am well aware that our Spanish friends are dissatisfied with the current arrangements which restrict access to only 40 of their trawlers.
However, it is worth noting that the 40 Spanish trawlers fishing in this zone at any given time are all massive 25-metre plus vessels, often twice the size of local Irish boats.
The problem is, there are a further 120 massive Spanish trawlers waiting just south of the Irish Box, keen to gain access, but I do not see hundreds of Greek or Italian trawlers demanding access to the Irish Box!
It is also worth noting that the same proposal for a Council regulation in Western Waters would burst open the 200 mile economic exclusion zone around the Azores.
Again this is an area of high sensitivity which has supported generations of local Portuguese fishermen, often braving the wild Atlantic gales in tiny, open wooden boats.
Simply to throw these waters open to giant trawlers from Spain or anywhere else would be catastrophic both for conservation of fish stocks and for the preservation of jobs in the fragile Azorean fleet.
We cannot allow this to happen.
I support my Spanish colleagues in many ways.
I have worked hard to find compensation for the damage caused by the oil tanker Prestige.
I have supported the international third-country agreements which are of such benefit and importance to the Andalucian and Galician fleets.
But I cannot stand idly by and watch the destruction of key conservation zones around the Azores and in the Irish Box, simply because our Spanish friends and only our Spanish friends wish to catch more fish in these waters.
To accept this argument would be to fly in the face of conservation policy.
Our job as parliamentarians, and my job as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, is to ensure that fish stocks are allowed to recover.
I therefore urge the House to accept the amendments tabled by the UEN Group and others to the Stevenson Report and in particular to support Amendment No 20, which calls upon the Irish Box to be maintained for a period of 10 years, with a review by ICES and STECF at the end of that period, to establish whether the policy of restricted access has assisted in meeting the objectives of the cod recovery plan in rebuilding endangered whitefish stocks.
Commissioner, like many of the Members, I believe that fisheries play a social and cultural role as well as an economic role, particularly small-scale fisheries, given their ability to contribute to social and economic cohesion processes, especially in the most remote, outermost regions.
We therefore welcomed the Commission's Action Plan seeking to avert the negative social effects of the fisheries reform and we endorse the idea of addressing these negative effects through a compensation programme.
That said, a number of points in the Commission's proposal give cause for concern in that, for example, the reference data put forward is obsolete, dating back to 2000.
Three years have passed since then, and the Commission itself acknowledges that the assessment is largely theoretical.
There is a need for a serious and detailed debate on the model to be adopted: whether to opt for industrial fisheries, involving a small number of large, modern economical vessels, or small-scale fisheries, involving a large number of small and medium-sized vessels, which may be less profitable but certainly employ more labour.
Lastly, there is a need for an updated version of the Commission's Action Plan, parts of which ought to have been updated in line with the conclusions of the Fisheries Council in December 2002.
Moreover, Commissioner, some parts of the proposal are unconvincing.
For example, the Mediterranean is completely disregarded.
The Commission does not take into consideration its specific nature but only a number of areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This amounts to cultural penalisation caused by historic long-sightedness in the process of European integration itself: our Europe continues to be purely north-facing.
This was the case during the many years when the common agricultural policy was being developed and it is the case now as well with regard to the common fisheries policy.
However, it is dangerous, first and foremost, because we are on the eve of the inauguration of the Mediterranean area of free trade in 2010, which will make the Mediterranean sea a major area of social, economic, human and political exchange for which we must be prepared.
Another key aspect is job losses.
The Commission appears to envisage the loss of 12 000 jobs, which are to be recouped over the space of four years.
We feel this prediction is optimistic, in that it underestimates the impact of the reform, failing to take into account the consequences for related sectors, dockyards and the processing industries.
It is estimated that the European processing industry alone employs at least 100 000 people.
Above all, the Commission's estimate fails to take into account the fact that it is unlikely that it will be possible to retrain workers, such as those in the fisheries sector, who, especially in some areas of Europe, have a low level of education and work in areas suffering from an extremely high unemployment rate.
If we think we can recoup them and retrain them to do other jobs we are deluding ourselves, particularly where Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal are concerned.
Then, in many countries, there are no welfare support provisions and fishermen would be in danger of becoming reject workers, superfluous citizens; another implicit risk is the social, cultural and economic desertification of many parts of the Union.
We need to focus aid on small-scale fisheries, seeing as they currently employ half the fishermen working in the sector and account for 75% of vessels.
It is true that the level of catches is very low, but in terms of employment small-scale fisheries play a vital role.
The Commission acknowledges that financial incentives to small-scale fisheries have not served much purpose, it acknowledges that further measures are needed, although they will be some time coming, and talks only of long-term perspectives.
These considerations call forth the question of what resources to invest to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of this reform.
We are opposed to reprogramming of the Structural Funds, considering, rather, that these funds should be reserved for other priorities.
The fact that 80% of the regions concerned are Objective 1 and 2 regions means that the Structural Funds are currently necessary and crucial for addressing priorities which cannot be confused with the project contained in this resolution.
In our opinion, we need to set up an ad hoc fund, a measure which could even be temporary for implementing recovery plans.
One last point, on the subject of women.
The fact that 22% of the labour force is made up of women is not reflected at all in the Commission's Action Plan.
Overall, we support the long-term conclusions, but we feel that it would be appropriate to reformulate some parts of the Action Plan and to analyse the socio-economic impact of the reform more carefully.
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Hudghton, Mr Stevenson and Mr Fava, for your reports on our proposals.
I will turn to Mr Hudghton's report first.
As you know, the Commission's proposal covers a substantial amount of the regulation on technical measures.
You said there is little interest because the proposal is so technical.
Yes, but there is no other option: a proposal on technical measures has to be very technical.
Furthermore, as a result of the problems with the cod and hake stocks, a number of Commission and Council regulations have been adopted which supplement or amend the regulation on technical measures.
One of the main objectives of our proposal is therefore to draw together all these provisions, which are contained in many separate regulations, into a single regulation and thus make them far more manageable.
We also used this proposal, however, to introduce a number of new elements.
There are three issues which arise here: firstly, we want to harmonise the provisions on the individual species of fish which are caught using trawl nets of various mesh sizes in all the Community waters in the north-east Atlantic.
We want to avoid a situation in future in which a fishing vessel, which has been fishing in the Bay of Biscay, for example, and wants to continue fishing south of Ireland, is subject to different catch conditions.
The harmonisation will also extend to the waters of the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, where separate provisions currently apply.
Secondly, the rules should also apply to ships of less than 12 metres in order to provide better protection for young hake.
Thirdly, we want to amend the provisions on grading the catches in order to reduce discards.
We also propose setting out the detailed rules in Commission regulations, such as the percentage composition of the catches if fishing vessels carry trawl nets with two different mesh sizes on board, or the physical dimensions and immersion times for static nets.
On your question regarding the regional advisory councils, Mr Hudghton: as you know, we have re-established these advisory councils as part of the reform and they are also included in the basic regulation.
This basic regulation states that the advisory councils can be consulted.
We cannot change this option envisaged in the basic regulation and make it a general obligation in a secondary regulation; there are legal obstacles to this.
However, I can tell you that we ourselves have a massive interest in ensuring that these advisory councils are consulted as far as possible.
Now, technical measures are certainly no longer enough on their own - as we all know - to achieve sustainability in fisheries.
For more than a decade, scientists have therefore been demanding the management of the fishing effort as well to enable a sustainable conservation policy to be pursued.
That is precisely what we are aiming for with our proposal on the western waters which is dealt with in the Stevenson report.
As you know, the special provisions on access by Spanish and Portuguese ships to the Irish Box and on access to the Portuguese coastal waters lost their legal basis from 1 January 2003.
However, as the relevant regulations from 1995 did not establish any time limit for the western waters, we must remove the legal uncertainty which exists here.
We are therefore proposing a new regulation to replace the existing regulations, containing the following provisions: we want to restrict the fishing effort in the ICES sub-areas of the western waters for all Member States in a non-discriminatory way.
We propose defining the fishing effort so that the reduction in fishing opportunities since 1995 and the actual fishing effort deployed between 1998 and 2002 are taken into account.
We want to limit the fishing effort for pelagic species as well and we want further restrictions on access to waters in the outermost regions.
I do not think anyone should create a threat scenario here and be alarmed about the prospect of a Spanish armada.
As we have seen in recent months, that is really not the case.
We must not forget that the aim is to restrict the fishing effort in general and the issue of relative stability comes into play here.
It is therefore inappropriate to act as if the Spanish fishing boats were fishing the waters dry.
Let me make one other thing clear: the proposal before us is based exclusively on scientific evidence, which was not the case with the old Irish Box.
Let me turn briefly to Mr Fava's report, which deals with the Action Plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry.
We have attempted, in consultation with the Member States, to assess the potential job losses and the need for financial resources to alleviate the socio-economic impacts.
We have held meetings in the Member States - one last September, and one this April - and we also consulted the fishing sector, the stakeholders, in January.
Your report, Mr Fava, contains fifteen recommendations which I can broadly endorse because they comply with the general guidelines of the common fisheries policy and support the long-term goals of our Action Plan.
That is an initial presentation and I will of course be pleased to answer your questions at the end.
.
(ES) Mr President, I am speaking as spokesperson for the Committee on Budgets on fisheries issues and it falls to me firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fava, whose report I am essentially going to comment on, on its excellence.
Allow me to point out that the Common Fisheries Policy is funded almost entirely by means of the Union's budget.
But it does not even represent 1% of the whole budget, and is funded by the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the regional fund and the social fund.
The action plan is intended to alleviate the short-term consequences for fishermen and the fishing industry resulting from the conservation and protection measures, by means of the reprogramming of the FIFG for social measures and a review of all the existing aid, but it also provides for the possible release of additional sums.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries which has incorporated the following points of the Committee on Budgets into the Resolution:
The first stresses that it is not probable that the Council's amendments to the Commission's package on the reform of the CFP, adopted at its meeting of 16 to 22 December 2002, will facilitate the application of this reform nor the scheduled reprogramming of 611 million from the FIFG.
The second points out that the financial resources available in heading 2 of the financial perspectives intended for the fisheries sector and the areas dependent on fishing can be calculated at EUR 28 000 million for the period 2000-2006.
Finally, it is stressed that additional European Union funding can only be allocated to fishing measures intended to compensate for losses if this is compatible with the maximum limit in heading 2 of the financial perspectives, or by employing the flexibility instrument laid down in Article 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the three reports we are dealing with tonight, Mr Fava, Mr Stevenson and Mr Hudghton, and I would also like to say to the latter, Mr Hudghton, that I agree with many of the comments he made in his speech.
I would also like to condemn the conceit of the Commission, which takes decisions behind the backs of the sector, the lack of communication between scientists and fishermen and I agree with him that none of this helps in promoting a credible image of Europe amongst our citizens.
The time available for this debate is limited, and the issues dealt with by these three reports are very important.
I will restrict myself to a brief comment on each of them.
I believe that these three reports, particularly when debated together in this way, demonstrate the contradictory way in which the Commission presents its proposals on reform of the CFP.
The report by Mr Fava on the action plan to counteract the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of this industry in the European Union raises the need for the Community to deal with the losses with sufficient financial resources and without so much uncertainty, particularly in terms of employment, which this reform of the CFP will cause in the regions dependent on fishing.
The Committee on Fisheries is requesting additional funding to alleviate the effects of this reform.
The Commission must ensure that the socio-economic structure of these areas is maintained.
It will be cheaper to support the maintenance of the existing socio-economic fabric than to stand back and watch it disappear and then try to create other replacement economic activities, with which these regions - and I agree with Mr Stevenson - would have great difficulties, since they are located in peripheral areas and suffer from a lack of professional training, new technologies, infrastructures and access to the markets.
The Commissioner is well aware that each job on a ship generates from 4 to 5 jobs on land, and therefore the disappearance of fishing would cause serious disruption to the socio-economic fabric of these regions.
With regard to the report on the management of fishing in relation to certain areas and resources, I believe that, when drawing up resolutions, we Members of Parliament must take account of reality.
And the reality is that the transitional period following the accession of Spain and Portugal has come to an end.
The CFP has quite enough exceptions already without restoring and perpetuating those which at one time were mere transitional mechanisms.
Mr Stevenson, this exception, which has come to an end, is not one favour which is being exchanged for another.
If anybody has led you to believe this, I am very sorry, because it has come to an end.
It is a problem of legal basis and it has come to an end, and it is not being exchanged for anything.
You helped us in Morocco; we will help you as much as we can, but the exception has ended.
Finally, my group supports the Commission's proposal on the protection of juveniles.
Correct and effective technical measures should be the basis for achieving the balance between fleet and resources.
The excessive scrapping which some people want to see is anti-economic and antisocial, and could lead us to a situation in a few years when we have created sufficient quantities of fish but do not have either the ships or the fishermen to catch them.
With regard specifically to the Irish Box, I believe that to use 1998-2002 to measure fishing is far too little, it is shameful.
With regard to the consultative committees, I support this measure, but quite frankly I would like the Commission to clarify whether all the Member States are currently in an equal position to implement this new element.
I would like to know whether we are all in an equal position, because, if we are not, we would be generating a new source of disparity, of unequal treatment and injustice, and I am told by the sector in my country that we are not all in an equal position.
Mr President, rapporteurs, thank you for your contributions and efforts, although I can imagine that Mr Stevenson is not altogether happy that his name has been associated with this report.
There is a reason for this.
With regard to the Hudghton report, I should like to say that it is crucial in future to really involve regional consultative committees in order to keep, and use, the mix of science and hands-on knowledge as closely to fishing as possible, thus giving us information and allowing the topic to be approached from a more European point of view.
I should like to make a few comments with regard to the Fava report.
These are tough times, of course.
There must be severe cut-backs, as the Fisheries Council decided in December 2002.
There is a plan to cushion the negative social and economic impact of restructuring, which is necessary and unavoidable.
It is particularly unfortunate and regrettable for people who are hit by it.
I set great store by implementing the plan as effectively as possible, and this should be backed up by the necessary resources.
It is important, in my view, for the sector itself to be involved in the plans that are required to offer these people new opportunities.
Money on its own cannot offer a structural, long-term solution.
In recent years, subsidies have been granted continuously to the small-scale sector that was facing difficult times, but this money has not led to a smoothly-running small-scale fishing industry.
Therefore, if resources are deployed, it should be with the intention that the sector can ultimately help itself and take its future into its own hands.
I have already tabled amendments to this effect in the past.
Structural change, offering alternatives, is what is crucial.
The Member States also have an important role to play, not only by handing out subsidies but also by changing policy, setting up new tasks and creating new opportunities for the sector in society.
I think that we should indeed learn from this experience, and I hope that we can maintain a balanced policy.
Mr President, this proposal for a regulation on managing the Atlantic waters suffered a major setback at the last Fisheries Council, with the presentation of a proposal for a compromise by the current Presidency of the Union. In the name of non-discrimination between Member States and on the pretext that the transitional period for fully integrating Portugal and Spain into the common fisheries policy has ended, this proposal seeks to eliminate the division between their fishing zones, making it difficult to adopt measures to control the fishing effort and calling into question the guarantee of the sustainability of resources in Portuguese waters.
This proposal would mean opening up access for Spanish vessels to the zone between 12 and 200 miles from the exclusive economic zone, thereby creating an enormous border-free fishing zone. Given the size of the Spanish fleet, this would not only have devastating effects on fisheries resources, with serious consequences for Portuguese fishermen, but it would also nullify the measures for resource conservation that Portugal has implemented.
Hence the importance of maintaining the division of the ICES statistical fishing sub-areas IX and X and the FCECA areas.
This cannot be called discrimination between states.
Discrimination exists when situations that are different and specific are considered to be equal, as is the case with Portuguese fishing.
We must therefore take account of the specific arrangements for access by Portuguese and Spanish vessels to the waters of Portugal and Spain respectively, without setting an end date.
Lastly, I would also like to mention the specific situation of the outermost regions and the need to preserve existing derogations for access to their exclusive economic zone, as laid down in this report.
Mr President, first of all on the technical measures.
Since 1985 there has been a provision in the technical measures regulation to allow Member States to impose stricter measures for their own fishermen in EU waters.
They could not do this for other fishermen, but only for their own.
Now the Commission has proposed the removal of this provision in the revised regulation.
We have raised this matter in the Committee on Fisheries many times and the Commission says that this provision is redundant, that Article 10 in the new basic regulation allows Member States to enact stricter measures for their vessels.
This right is limited to their own waters, at least so the Commission said in January when it more or less forced Sweden to exploit the depleted cod stocks in the Baltic and the North Sea.
So, if this provision is removed from the technical measures regulation, as the Commission is proposing, then Member States will not be able to impose stricter measures outside their own waters.
I would like to know from the Commission why it considers this undesirable now, after almost twenty years?
Does it not fly in the face of wanting to persuade Member States to be more responsible and, if they are more responsible, allow them to be?
There is a lot of hypocrisy here.
I would like to ask people to support Mr Hudghton's amendments, which would actually bring the regulation back to what he originally wanted.
On the Irish Box, it makes no sense whatsoever in an important nursery and spawning area to try and increase the number of vessels that are going in there, to open up the Irish Box.
If the Commission is being consistent in wanting to have a more ecological and sustainable approach to fishing, then surely it should not do that.
There is also hypocrisy in this Parliament in relation to ICES, because regarding the cod stocks, even the Commission would not go as far as ICES wanted.
Therefore some people want to accept the advice of ICES only when it suits.
You cannot allow what is going to happen to the Irish Box to go ahead.
It completely flies in the face of conservation and sustainable fishing and there is no justification for it.
We would like to see our amendment supported tomorrow during the vote.
Mr President, the Irish Box is a biologically sensitive box.
It is not a political one.
I regret that the Commission, from the outset, has chosen the political box option.
In my opinion, the Commission's approach to this whole problem is a negation of its responsibility on conservation and sustainability of stocks and a recipe for conflict.
Belligerence between Spanish and Irish fishermen and the destruction of fishing gear inside the Irish Box have recently been reported.
This must be seen as a new and worrying development.
Not only fishermen, but also the general public of Ireland see the Irish Box as being of serious concern to them.
It is perceived as one of the big Member States using bully-boy tactics to impose its will to the detriment of a small nation such as Ireland or Portugal.
The people of Ireland are asking if this is a foretaste of what is in store for the smaller nation in post-Convention Europe.
I concur with the people of Ireland.
Let me reiterate and emphasise that the area known as the Irish Box is a rich fishing area with a high concentration of juvenile fish and spawning grounds.
It is crucial that the EU applies restrictions on a fishing effort within this area.
It is vital that the Irish Box is maintained as a biologically sensitive zone.
It beggars belief that the Commission is unable to produce any specific scientific report it has used in preparing this proposal. It further beggars belief that the Commission omitted any reference to the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box in the current proposal.
We must ask why.
Let me remind the Commission that Council Regulation (EC) No 1275/94 specifically recognised the biological sensitivity of the Irish Box, and yet the Commission broke this important link.
In the Commission's revised proposal, diplomatically referred to as the Council's compromise - the one we are not being consulted on - the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box is back.
Today not only Irish but also Portuguese waters are under attack.
Tomorrow it will be the Shetland waters.
After that, God only knows.
I know that this Parliament is serious about fisheries conservation.
I know that it is serious about sustainability of stocks.
I have therefore tabled amendments for the plenary which address both of these issues.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of Ireland's entire fishing industry and the survival of all Ireland's coastal communities may depend on your support.
I ask you for your support for my amendments in plenary.
Mr President, the Irish fishermen both from the North and from the South whose home waters are those of the Irish sea are now staring in dismay at what is happening to their industry.
There is no doubt that this matter of the Irish Box is all-important.
All the sacrifices they made were argued about before, but now all those sacrifices were in vain, because the Commission now takes a different line and says the box has got to go.
The time has come when this House must face up to the fact that the fishermen from the North and the South of Ireland, for the first time in history, have come together to face this particular problem.
It is a serious problem, it is a problem that is causing people who were pro-European Parliament to turn against this Parliament.
