I am a product of adult education and am convinced that knowledge and information are the key instruments of active and responsible citizenship, so I can only welcome the excellent work carried out by the Info-Points Europe.
They are educational, they are innovative, they have a remarkable capacity for initiative and, above all, they enable us to raise awareness of Europe and to spread Europeâs messages to its citizens of all ages, all areas, and all cultures with a proximity that cannot be matched and that other institutions fail to match.
I would also like to point out that it is because we provide a financial contribution that this is possible.
In fact, we call on other powers to carry out this communication role for us.
These other powers are local powers that are sensitive to the European question, naturally, but that might, if we do not make more effort, wish to return to their initial role and perhaps abandon this vital aspect.
If the support we are going to be guaranteed for 2004 gave us the time to conceive arrangements for collaboration that enabled this system to continue on a permanent basis, that would indeed be effective.
It would also enable us, since the other partners also have budgetary contingencies, to continue to operate and to make plans for the coming years.
It would be insane to abandon these proposals at the risk of losing transparency and, thus, European democracy.
I believe that the solutions are simple: administrative simplification, respect for work and, what is perhaps also necessary, an audit.
Â Â  â Mr President, the decision made at the end of September by the Commissionâs Directorate-General for Press and Communication regarding the end to subsidies for the operation of the European Info-Points and Carrefours has given rise to significant disappointment and significant surprise among their managers and staff.
The citizens of the European Union will also be the losers as a result of this end to operating subsidies for 2004.
Let us be frank: at a time when Europe is facing enormous difficulties in moving closer to the citizens and raising its profile, an undeniable gap is opening up once again.
For example, the closure of the European Carrefours is a great loss as regards the information distributed in the most rural regions.
The decentralised structures are an essential asset and given the immense amount of communications work to be done, these structures must be maintained, or even receive additional funding enabling them to play their role to the full.
At a time when Europe is at an important turning point in its history, benefiting from a forthcoming enlargement and Constitution, it would be unacceptable to put an end to the necessary and vital aid of the Info-Points.
In light of this context, we must combine all of our efforts to find a fair solution because we are all worried.
The Info-Points are, and must continue to be, among the Communityâs communication tools.
Their activity and the efforts made by these structures have proved the effectiveness of their action.
The Info-Points have always made every effort to carry out the role entrusted to them, in this case acting as an interface for a dynamic platform.
Close to the citizens, they have made it possible to maintain a European social fabric.
So are we going to remain deaf and mute in the face of the expectations of the public, who constantly need to be informed of our interinstitutional activities?
Being aware of this need and convinced of the important role played by these structures, I call on the Commission to review its decision and to allow these European information networks to continue to perform the functions we have entrusted to them, which are more essential now then ever.
I thank the Commissioner for being here and, in response to his comments, I will say that it is all the better if there are other documentation centres and forums that have the Commissionâs support, but it does not disguise the fact that the information deficit is all too real and not appreciated by the public.
If a legal basis is required â and this may well be the case â one must be established.
However, a minimum amount of time is needed to resolve this type of problem and that does not mean four months, Commissioner.
That seems to be much too short and the Commissionâs methods far from courteous, so we hope that the proposal for a trialogue meets with a favourable response.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer, because I, too, am of the opinion that the abolition of the provincial Info-Points would signify a loss to the image of the European Union.
First of all, these information centres are close to the citizen, and this can be taken literally.
The information centres are physically present in the provinces.
The proximity of the centres ensures that those seeking information do not have to travel a long way, saving them time and money.
I think that this is the EUâs trump card, and a way of being customer friendly.
Secondly, the European Parliament has already stated its opinion on the European Unionâs information and communication strategy, and, in so doing, has expressed the desire to bring communications as close as possible to the citizen.
In its motion for a resolution, it expresses the desire to invest more in a well-functioning information network, includingInfo-Points.
The word is âinvestâ, not âabolishâ.
I quote: âThe European Parliament ... considers that there is a need to introduce measures for administrative adjustment, structuring and staff training, aimed at the effective operation of the external offices and the network of information centres ..., which could also be used by MEPs in their respective constituenciesâ.
When we talk about bringing the European Union closer to the citizen and bridging the gap with the citizen â because research reveals that that gap really exists â investing more in the Info-Points is part of the solution.
I should like to make a plea, then, that we by no means abolish theseInfo-Points, but, on the contrary, improve their functioning, particularly now, in the light of the elections and enlargement taking place in 2004.
We must not make savings on the promotion of the European Union, a Union that brings peace, security and prosperity to the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that it is Commissioner Kinnock who has to be here this afternoon to take this criticism on the chin, because I in no way regard him as personally responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves.
I shall put some simple questions to which we all know the answers and on which we are all agreed.
Is the average European citizen in need of extra information about the European Union?
Yes.
Is information needed in the Member States and locally rather than in Brussels?
Yes.
Do the Info-Points help meet that need?
Yes.
Is next year, with enlargement, with the new Constitution, with elections, a year when the information will be more necessary than usual?
Yes.
Has the Commission got its organisation and priorities right on information policy?
That is questionable.
Of course expenditure must meet legal requirements and if a legal base is necessary then it must be found.
We employ lawyers precisely to check on those points in good time, advise if there is a problem and indicate a solution.
We knew about the problem in January and the Commission's solution was to send the Info-Points a letter at the end of September.
That really is not good enough.
After all, the amount of expenditure is pretty minimal.
It has been allocated over a good many years.
If the Commission doubts the need for Info-Points and the more effective information programme, let me draw attention to statistics in recent polls.
90% of Spaniards have never heard of the Convention.
31% of Germans have never heard of the Commission and 25% of Britons do not even know that the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union but 7% of them think that America is!
The English language is rich in expressions.
Let me try and find some that fit this situation.
The tail is wagging the dog.
The Commission appears to be unable to see the wood for the trees.
Experts should be on tap, not on top.
I could carry on with vulgar expressions about breweries and organising parties in them.
There is not a major legal difficulty here, it is a technical problem.
If the Commission had clear and accepted priorities and could see the wood for the trees, we would not be having this debate this afternoon.
I welcome Commissioner Kinnock's statement, but he knows as well as we do that it has come far too late and it really should not have been necessary.
Sadly, this is another own goal by the Commission.
I hope that the letter that will be sent to the Info-Points will contain an apology.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to emphasise the importance of the networks and of the Info-Points, on which I think that we all â both the Commission and Parliament â agree.
For my part, I am going to consider a more financial aspect, that is, the Financial Regulation â the new Financial Regulation.
I believe that we all agree on that issue too.
We worked together, Parliament approved it and it has been accepted.
All that remains is to implement it.
We also all agree that the procedures under this Financial Regulation must be adhered to, including the procedures that allow for genuine transparency in the implementation of the budget.
Moreover, if we have understood correctly, the Commission has been given every resource required for this implementation.
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that this is a key element not only in this case, but also for the future.
For the implementation of the budget, however, it is also essential for the sums to arrive on time.
We talk in the industry of âjust on timeâ, and that is where the problem lies.
We are now in a situation where the Commission did not think far enough ahead and where, rather than coming to see us to explain that perhaps there was a problem or further difficulties, it waited until we were alerted by the public and by the networks, and are now extremely worried.
Not only was the Commission slow in warning us, MrÂ Kinnock; more important, several things have been covered up.
For example, when we are told that âseveral structures have agreed not to receive any moneyâ, I disagree!
Several structures have agreed to be provided with material resources, but have never said that they did not need any money.
I find this approach somewhat disagreeable in view of the need for us to be as sincere as possible in our joint work.
Today, we must find a solution for 2004 and I believe that we will find it on Monday.
In any event, I hope that we will, so that it can continue through to 2005.
However, what we need now is for the Commission to assure us that it is going to be able to implement the solution that I am sure we are going to find, without fail and in good time to enable the Info-Points to continue operating.
This is vital, as we have said, for Europe cannot withstand any further democratic breakdown.
Europe can continue to work at an administrative level, but without the citizens it will not do so for long, and the Info-Points are one of the key intermediaries in ensuring that we finally have a Europe of Citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Rocard, who is now absent, for raising this issue in the plenary of the European Parliament.
Commissioner, it often happens, as Mr Perry has already said, that the wrong people get criticised.
So, there is no legal basis; I do not believe there is any political will either, or, if there is, it is at least deficient.
And if the political will is lacking, then what happens â as it has done in this case â is that people try a partial solution of the problem for a short transitional period, without coming up with a proper arrangement for the future.
We, as politicians whose business is with Europe, know for a fact that national politicians have a very pronounced tendency to project their own defects, errors and inabilities onto Brussels and to heap curses upon it.
That is easily done, it goes down well, and there is as a rule no risk of them being put straight.
I believe that information agencies on the European Union counteract this sort of tendency.
They know how the media report things, and not only in their own country.
Reporting of the European Union is deficient in other countries too; there too, it needs to be counteracted, and those Info-Points and offices, which are in a position to supply objective information, are the offices that are working for Europe.
If Info-Points and likewise Carrefours are to be phased out and we now hear that there is the possibility of a transitional period of a year or perhaps even longer, that does nothing to counteract this tendency.
It is not that we need another year or two because we have elections next year; it is that we need a solution for the future!
Commissioner, it is for me a matter of profound conviction that if we talk in terms â as we have done several times today â of pooling strengths, then we must also consider the need to link up the offices of Parliament and the Commission in the Member States with the Info-Points and Carrefours, in order to build up our presence in the territory in question.
We have to embark on a general expansion of the information services, and we have to change our priorities.
It is a matter of absolute necessity that we involve the Member Statesâ voluntary sectors in these information offices and strive towards improving cooperation with local organisations and bodies, making for greater efficiency and better financial conditions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it so happens that the Commissioner saved himself with this excellent opening speech when he said what we actually wanted to hear.
This is how a clever and experienced Commissioner obviously operates, but thank you, Neil Kinnock, for what you just said.
Nevertheless, on that day, 29 September, when the Directorate-General for Press and Communication sent off a letter to all the Info-Points, it was as if a lump of ice had been dropped in the bath water. It rocked the boat and people panicked.
One obviously cannot act this way, and all of us here are proof of that.
These Info-Points have only been set up in recent years, and the Commission has itself made the excellent remark that these centres had an extremely valuable contribution to make as they had a good deal of experience and could work flexibly and very close to civil society and the people, and that they were a vital tool in the European Unionâs information and communication strategy, representing the EU in the field. Excellent.
You yourself provided evidence of this as the Commission, and I believe that in the future too you will ensure that there are information points in the field.
It has already been mentioned here that the need for information is growing.
The impact of enlargement will create a continuous need for information in all Member States.
People have to be informed about the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, in other words the Constitutional Treaty.
This is a document more than 300 pages long, which so far fewer than 2% of the citizens of the Union have read.
The parliamentary elections and in particular the attempt to increase peopleâs interest in voting in them are of course massive tasks, which the points may happily be saddled with.
Standards of monitoring have to be improved.
If it is a matter of some points operating slightly dubiously, I would like the Commissioner to comment, but clearly that cannot be allowed to affect the entire network â those sections which have acted properly.
I am very much in favour of the idea that next year the Commission will seek a better, more workable and more easily controllable solution.
The need for information is growing as more and more issues are decided upon here, Europeâs central point, and I therefore support the Commissioner in his reforms.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like to thank the Members that have tabled this oral question in the House, although I do find it too mild and vague given the seriousness and the complexity of the issue that is raised.
The very replies given by CommissionerÂ KinnockÂ âÂ which were actually too cautious, almost embarrassedÂ âÂ confirm that the instability which we are condemning is real and that the problems are genuine.
Furthermore, we have already tabled a written question, on 9Â October 2003: I was the first to put my name to it, but 48 MEPs signed it from all the political groups.
This question referred, in a much more detailed, specific way, to the concerns of those workingÂ âÂ some for many yearsÂ âÂ at Info Centres, Info-Points and Carrefours, all the European information points.
Now, given that we have still not received a written replyÂ âÂ at least not one that I have seenÂ âÂ I will take the liberty of quickly going over the points in this question.
It began by stressing how the European Parliament, exactly as it is doing today, has often drawn attention to the importance, as regards information and communication policy, of these networks created in more or less all the Member States.
The Commission, too, stressed a similar opinion, and did so in two official documents: Communication 354 of 2001 and Communication 350 of 2002, which concluded with more or less the same words, saying that Info-Points, Info Centres and Carrefours are invaluable heritage because of their experience, flexibility and immediate vicinity to the representatives of civil society and the citizens.
Even MrÂ Prodi specifically praised these institutions in a reply given to another question on 27Â September 2002.
Not least, he said that awareness of the measures proposed and the projects implemented by the European Union is increasing thanks to the information networks.
This is why we are even more bewildered and saddened to read the letter of 29Â September 2003, in which the DG Press, contrary to all these good promises, notified the national structures housing these networks that extending the agreement for 2004 would no longer include the right to a subsidy, whilst, as far as the future is concerned, the Commission will look intoÂ âÂ as the text statesÂ âÂ new forms of cooperation.
As Commissioner Kinnock mentioned, this is all because of the entry into force, on 1Â January 2003, of Financial Regulations No 1605 and No 2342.
This is a new and unprecedented situation which places a question mark over the very survival of these networks and, in any case, drastically reduces the capacity for dialogue with the citizens at precisely a time when, on the contrary, such dialogue should be increased.
There is a great need, Commissioner, an infinite thirst for knowledgeÂ âÂ as other Members have said, even from the opposite benchÂ âÂ at this time, as we are approaching the European elections, when the European Constitution is taking shape and when enlargement will soon be taking place, which will certainly mean that this need for information will be even more widespread.
I would like, however, to stress the need for an immediate reply to the queries contained in the written question.
What does the Commission intend to do to act in good time, for example to give legal personality to Carrefours and to Info-Points by applying Articles 54, 55 and 185 of Council Regulation NoÂ 1605 of 2002?
Above all, though, an immediate reply must be given for 2004: it is not enough to say âwe will guarantee it for a year but for any longer we are not sureâ.
In saying this I am thinking, above all, of the most disadvantaged areas, of these rural Carrefours, especially in mountain regions, that are often the only, irreplaceable sources of information and a sign that the European institution is close to the people, especially in these disadvantaged areas.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Rocard for raising this important subject.
The Info-Points Europe in the Member States are a natural and simple channel for the public to acquire information on the European Union.
Of course that has been said here several times but I feel I have to repeat it myself.
As a channel of communication they are perhaps not irreplaceable and their work is not absolutely dependent on Commission support.
They are none the less hugely important.
In my country the best thing about Info-Points Europe is that they are where the people are.
If the EU feels a long way off, they at least are not to blame.
On the contrary, it is these very Info-Points that ease the situation.
The EU Carrefours are in rural areas and the Info-Points Europe in regional libraries.
It is easy for people to look for the information they want and so they do.
For example, everyday in Finland people look for information on the draft EU Constitution in these places.
We, the Members of the European Parliament, are often the ones the public consults on different issues.
As, however, it is legislation that we deal with first and foremost, my own work has unquestionably been made easier by the fact that in many cases I can refer people with questions to the services of the Info-Points.
The turnout has been small at previous European Parliament elections.
In Finland last time it was only slightly greater than 31%.
Furthermore, many citizens of the European Union feel the new Constitution is a driving force behind a federalist-style Union and that the administration of the Union is drifting further and further away from grassroots level.
We have to be able to allay such fears by increasing the amount of relevant information we provide.
Consequently, I do not think it wise to reduce or announce an intention to reduce direct communication with the citizens of Europe.
It is absolutely essential that the European elections reach the people through involvement in the voting on the part of the public media as well as the Unionâs own organs of communication.
The combined effect of this will be to get support for the notion of the people experiencing their own election and their own Union, and to establish the idea of a human European Union that is subject to the influence of its citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall respond quickly, and I hope perceptively, to the main points made by several honourable Members.
In the course of this debate, the Commission has been described as discourteous, our action improvised, dysfunctional and laggardly.
I guess in some ways the Commission provides an open target on which people can vent their complaints, especially when there is cause to believe that some difficulties have been encountered because of accidental not malevolent omissions.
I would simply underline that there are those who will criticise the Commission when there is any doubt about our conforming as far as Union law is concerned.
That is a political criticism we have to face.
However, it becomes difficult to take when we make efforts to uphold the law and in response we are castigated for our inflexibility and dysfunctionality.
I know this House and certainly the people present at this debate understand the problems.
To ensure that there is complete clarity on the subject something that did not come through in all the speeches I repeat: taking, if you like, Mr Bayona de Perogordo's suggestion that there should be a transitional approach, I would simply say that we have done rather better than adopt a transitional approach.
We are not suggesting calls for proposals.
We have an interim solution which is, as I announced, the waiver for 2004 although, obviously, we will require Council understanding and consent.
The Info-Points do not depend on us for survival.
In most cases, and even under the original proposal to end subsidies, the Commission still offered to provide technical assistance in 2004 for those relays that wanted to avail themselves of it.
I hope no one will leave this debate with the idea that we are thoughtlessly and discourteously abandoning these critical information outlets, or the people who provide that service, to their fate.
We are certainly not doing that.
Finally, let me turn to Mr Perry's comments, put with his customary delicacy and charm and all the more forceful because they were wrapped in silk and polished with scented soap.
He could have quoted a number of other clichÃ©s, but they are only clichÃ©s because they are true.
He missed out 'keep off the grass' and 'a miss is as good as a mile'.
However, in this case it would have been quite legitimate and I fully understand that.
The whole experience has been a real lesson in the handling of the transitional requirement that arises automatically when we are making very necessary but quite sudden changes in our management and financing relationships.
I hope the lessons that we have learnt will be properly applied.
I also hope that the interim arrangements the Commission has suggested will commend themselves to the House.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the Rule of Law.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
- (B5-0490/2003) by Mr Cushnahan, Mr Van Orden, MrÂ Mann, Mr Bradbourn and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Sri Lanka
- (B5-0492/2003) by Mr van den Berg and Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Sri Lanka;
- (B5-0495/2003) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the threat to the peace process in Sri Lanka;
- (B5-0498/2003) by Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Sri Lanka;
- (B5-0505/2003) by Mr Messner and Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the peace process in Sri Lanka;
- (B5-0510/2003) by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Sri Lanka.
Â Â  Mr President, anyone who has had the privilege of visiting Sri Lanka is profoundly affected by the warmth and generous spirit of its people.
That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives, many thousands have been maimed, and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people.
In Tokyo in June 2003, the international community pledged USD 4.5 billion to underpin the peace process.
It is therefore tragic that a constitutional crisis has occurred between the President and the Prime Minister, threatening to derail the peace process.
I deeply regret the actions of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
I would appeal to her to pause and reflect on the consequences.
I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE, she courageously initiated moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative.
She invited the Norwegian Government to become involved as far back as 1997.
She presented a draft constitution with proposals for devolution in 2000.
I believe that history will justifiably acknowledge her contribution, if the present negotiations bring permanent peace.
Bi-partisanship in both the British and Irish Parliaments has been fundamental to the continuation of the Irish peace process, particularly when there were difficulties.
It is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart.
Through its actions today, the European Parliament, in sending once again a message of goodwill to Sri Lanka, is also expressing its wish for the President and the Prime Minister to work together in the national interest.
We remain willing to assist them in the search for permanent peace in their beautiful country.
Â Â  â Mr President, the current political crisis in Sri Lanka is having enormous repercussions on the peace process and the countryâs economic future.
The political divides and the rivalry between Sri Lankaâs President and its Prime Minister threaten the islandâs stability and prosperity.
Last week, in fact, three ministers were sacked, the parliament was suspended and a state of emergency was declared.
The conflict between these leaders is based in particular on the issue of the attitude to be adopted in relation to the Tamil separatists.
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga wishes to suspend the peace talks with the separatists, while the Sri Lankan Prime Minister wants to continue with them.
It is essential that some understanding be reached in order to put an end to the crisis of confidence that is rife among the population, who are already weary of the conflict involving the Tamil separatists, which has gone on for over twenty years.
The Sri Lankan people are suffering and have suffered a great deal as a result of the terrorist acts carried out in their country and the climate of insecurity to which these have led.
They hope for peace in their island and a stable future.
Those are the facts that the Sri Lankan authorities must consider.
While the Sri Lankans welcome the progress made in the peace process involving the Tamil separatists, the instability that the President has provoked leaves the country in the grip of a serious crisis of confidence, from both a political and an economic point of view.
At a political level, the departure of the Norwegian negotiators, who played a key role in the peace negotiations between the Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government, is extremely regrettable.
At an economic level, in the textile industry for example, numerous traders are complaining that many orders are being cancelled.
Another sector that drives the countryâs economy, the tourism industry, is unfortunately also in turmoil.
The fact is that travel agents are also reporting a number of cancellations.
Many Sri Lankans believe that the gravity of the situation is directly linked to the attitude of the President, who refuses to continue with the peace talks.
In light of this climate of hostility, we are calling on the Sri Lankan authorities to resolve these issues as quickly as possible so that they can finally offer their people the stability and the security they deserve.
Â Â  â Mr President, the conflict between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers has been going on for thirty years and has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
The negotiations having been suspended in April, the resumption of dialogue at the end of October with the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was a significant step forward on the road to peace.
Institutionally speaking, substantial progress had been made towards the resolution of the conflict.
The legal , however, by the President, Chandrika Kumaratunga, which interrupted the negotiations, was a giant leap backwards.
The proclamation of a state of emergency, the concentration of the most important State posts â Ministers for the Interior, Defence and Information â in the hands of the President, the intervention of the army and the suspension of parliamentary activities all show that the situation is getting worse.
It could deteriorate rapidly and even result in a resumption of the war and new elections with uncertain results.
The Presidentâs accusations against the government and the uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire are very worrying.
We support the efforts of the Prime Minister to engage in dialogue.
The President must resume contacts with the Prime Minister as soon as possible in order to find a constitutional solution.
At the same time, the cooperation must be extended to include all the political leaders and all interest groups.
Whatever happens, the immediate end to the state of emergency is essential if the peace process is to be resumed immediately.
In this respect, we fully support the Norwegian Government in its role as mediator and hope that it resumes its efforts as soon as possible.
The situation is particularly worrying in relation to the issue of human rights.
The emergency regime must not lead to an increase in infringements of fundamental freedoms.
We are especially concerned about the risk of a fresh upsurge of police and military interventions and, above all, the risk of torture or inhumane treatment.
In conclusion, we hope that the state of emergency does not slow down the distribution of the aid pledged at the Donor Conference in May.
It is because we know that the peace process cannot move forward until internal relations are eased that we are calling for an end to the emergency regime as soon as possible.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Sri Lanka has three population groups of differing origins.
In addition to the Sinhalese majority, Tamils â who are related to the inhabitants of southern India â predominate in the north-east, whilst descendents of Europeans from colonial times live in and around the capital, Colombo.
Following independence, left and right within the ethnic majority have been fiercely opposed to each other.
The two parties have alternated in government, and have lost face politically to a great extent in the meanwhile.
They have been outbidding each other in their aversion to minorities.
Sinhalese votes can be won by saying that the Tamils must move to India and that European cultural influences must be eliminated.
It is only after a long, hopeless war of secession that a government has emerged ready to talk seriously with the Tamil resistance movement, which wants its own State.
Norwegian assistance has played an indispensable part in this.
It is the quest for self-glorification of the President, who belongs to a party whose origins I find more pleasant in themselves than those of the ruling party, that is now threatening to ruin everything again.
Europe must give a clear signal that a lasting peace agreement is inescapable, and that resumption of the devastating war is unacceptable.
Without a lasting solution for the north-east, the country will suffer disruption and people will be uprooted.
Any illusions the ethnic majority, or the President, may have that things can continue without a solution to this problem will only lead to a repeat of the disasters of recent decades.
For that reason, the outside world should make it as clear as possible that this is an unacceptable situation and that a peaceful solution really is needed.
Â Â  â Mr President, in February 2001, a delegation from SAARC â the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation â travelled to Sri Lanka; I, as its Vice-President, was with them.
We met the former opposition leader, who is now the Head of Government.
We spoke with Buddhists, Hindus and Christians, including Bishop Dr Joseph, who had a mediating role.
We flew by helicopter to Jaffna, saw the villages that had been destroyed, and demonstrations by the people who wanted to go home.
The civil war had lasted twenty years, had claimed a toll of over 60Â 000 dead, and human rights organisations told us that âwar is an institutionâ.
A year later, though, there was a ceasefire, a triumph for the Norwegian peace mission, whose work has always enjoyed our support.
They are perfectly justified in now closing their operation down in response to the home-made crisis for which President Chandrika Kumaratunga must bear responsibility.
It was she who took control of three government ministries, she who dissolved the democratically-elected parliament and promptly declared the country to be in a state of emergency.
She charged the prime minister with making too many concessions to the Tamil Tigers.
Although the two rivals, meeting in Colombo, agreed two days ago to set up a commission to lay down rules on the basis of which they could cooperate in future, the conflict does not appear to have been resolved.
For that to happen, agreement is needed, enabling the initial favourable developments to be followed up.
My party of visitors is well aware of that.
Significantly fewer people are falling victim to violence.
The security situation has improved in many parts of the country.
More people are meeting across the line of demarcation, which was formerly hermetically sealed.
In economic terms, too, there are encouraging signs.
Growth stands at around 5% this year.
More support can be expected from the international community in the shape of USDÂ 4.5 million in reconstruction aid following the Tokyo conference, to which Mr Rod has just referred.
This is, however, dependent on a peace treaty soon being on the table.
Progress has also been made in that representatives of the LTTE have, for the first time, agreed to free elections in the North.
We wish the people of Sri Lanka a speedy end to private feuding in the interests of peace.
Â Â  â Mr President, Sri Lanka is in a situation of cohabitation, with a President and a Prime Minister belonging to two rival political formations.
For twenty years now, each political formation in power has sought to make peace with the Tamil Tigers and on each occasion the opposition has ruined the peace process.
Thus, when the current Prime Minister was in opposition, he ruined the Presidentâs plan to give greater autonomy to the Tamils in the north-east of the country, where they are in the majority.
Since he has been Prime Minister, he has made significant progress in the negotiations with the LTTE, with the assistance of the Norwegian mediators, finally achieving a ceasefire that lasted several months and changed the peopleâs lives while allowing a limited economic upturn.
For the first time since the movement came into being, the Tamil freedom fighters had just published concrete proposals for power-sharing in a region that, although run by the Tamils themselves, would continue to form part of Sri Lanka.
These proposals were negotiable, but then the President took upon herself the heavy responsibility of halting this peace process, making the most of the Prime Ministerâs trip to the United States and her constitutional prerogatives.
She thus dissolved the parliament and recalled the Ministers for Defence, the Interior and Information in order to sack them.
That was the situation up until a few days ago.
Today, the parliament has resumed its activities and the President is negotiating with her Prime Minister, which is why I feel that we must seize this opportunity.
A conciliation commission has even been set up between the two arms of the executive.
Our group sincerely believes that the European Parliament must send a very clear sign to the political leaders in Sri Lanka to encourage them to find a solution to the political crisis, but also, and above all, a constitutional solution that will allow for a lasting agreement with the Tamils. We also express our support for the Norwegian mediation team in its efforts to get the peace process back on track.
Â Â  . â I should like to thank MrÂ Cushnahan for raising this issue, together with other Members of this House who clearly take a close and committed interest in Sri Lankan affairs.
The Commission has closely followed developments in Sri Lanka and is greatly concerned by the grave setback inflicted on the peace process by recent events, including the deployment of troops in the capital and the decision to bring the cabinet portfolios of defence, interior, and communications under the remit of the President.
The Council presidency and the Commission have issued a joint statement with Norway, the United States and Japan expressing our common concern that recent developments in Sri Lanka may jeopardise the spirit of cohabitation between the President and the government, which has proved vital to efforts to sustain the momentum of the peace process.
The presidency and the Commission urged the two principal parties to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution to the longstanding conflict.
Commissioner Patten has repeatedly contacted the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe by telephone encouraging him to find a way to return to constructive and functional co-habitation with President Kumaratunga.
The Commission will continue its efforts motivated by the hope that the tension can be reduced.
The Commission is closely coordinating any action with Norway, as facilitator of the peace process, and with other co-chair countries.
Naturally, the Commission remains in daily contact with its delegation in Colombo in order to keep abreast of all developments.
Commissioner Patten will visit Sri Lanka on 25 and 26Â November 2003 as planned.
The visit will allow him to get a first-hand impression of the situation and discuss the significant issues with all relevant parties, and he will again be seeking to impress and reinforce the views of the Commission and indeed this House which have already been transmitted to all parties in Sri Lanka.
The Commission is working in a coordinated manner with the Council.
We welcome a resolution by this Parliament that encourages the Sri Lankan President and Government to return to the co-habitation that had prevailed since the last general election in Sri Lanka.
Mrs De Keyser talked of the hope for an incipient restoration of normal relations.
This is a hope that we share and are seeking to reinforce.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
- (B5-0491/2003) by Mr van den Berg and MrsÂ McAvan, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;
- (B5-0496/2003) by Mrs SandbÃŠk, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Aceh;
- (B5-0497/2003) by Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Indonesia/Aceh;
- (B5-0501/2003) by Mr Bowis, Mr Tannock and MrÂ Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;
- (B5-0507/2003) by Mr Wuori, Mrs Maes and MrsÂ McKenna, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;
- (B5-0508/2003) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Indonesia/Aceh.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate comes at a very timely moment in the history of Indonesia, given the very grave situation in the province of Aceh.
The decision by the Indonesian authorities to extend martial law and carry out a military crackdown is deeply regrettable, and there has been very heavy-handed military action.
An estimated 45 000 troops have been sent into the province against 5000 rebels.
As ever in these situations, it is the civilian population which is paying the price, with reports of disruption to food supplies, infrastructure and schools being destroyed.
Tens of thousands of civilians are reportedly displaced.
These are only estimates, of course, because the Indonesian authorities are not allowing observers in to monitor the situation.
This has to stop.
There is no point in the Indonesian Government complaining when the international community, the United States, the EU and Japan, draft a resolution expressing their concern if they in turn are not prepared to allow international monitors in and are not prepared to allow humanitarian organisations into their country to bring assistance to the civilian population.
Our joint resolution makes a series of demands on the Indonesian Government and I hope very much that it is listening and that it will heed those concerns.
It is vital to get both parties back to the negotiating table as quickly as possible.
Time and time again we hear people telling us that military action is the answer, that it will be a quick military action and that once it is over everything will be sorted out.
We have heard this so often, but often been disappointed.
So often we have seen a high price paid in human lives.
So both sides, the GAM and the Indonesian Government, must get back to the negotiating table, stop the fighting and resume the talking.
I am grateful to the Commission for what it is already doing as regards Indonesia, particularly Commissioner Patten, who has always taken up issues about Aceh when we have asked him to do so.
I hope the Council and the Commission will now do everything possible to assist Indonesia in getting back to the negotiating table with GAM and get those talks started as soon as possible.
This is a matter of some urgency and I am very grateful to colleagues in this Parliament for agreeing to have today's debate and for supporting this resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when President Megawati was a presidential candidate, she stated that the economic, social and political oppression of Aceh's people was the source of their dissatisfaction and the reason for the unrest.
She also pleaded with them not to let a single drop of the peopleâs blood stain the earth.
Today, Aceh is in a state of emergency.
Violent military operations are under way, and people are being displaced, killed and raped.
There is no access to the province, and emergency aid is being delivered, contrary to all international standards, by the military.
Concern about the population of Aceh should be growing for several reasons.
In May, the message was that the insurgents would be defeated before long.
After a six-monthsâ offensive, 40% of the people are living under the poverty line.
Now, the state of emergency has, moreover, been extended, and the government has begun to speak about a lengthy war, perhaps of another ten years.
The situation in Aceh is naturally complicated, involving as it does diametrically opposed political visions, competition for gas and oil resources and a population that, for a long time, has been denied the autonomy promised during the war of independence.
Support for the separatists cannot, now or in the future, be crushed by the military operations.
On the contrary, the militaryâs violent infringements of human rights will lead to still greater support for the insurgents.
I fear that both partiesâ armed forces believe that they can escape unpunished from their misdeeds when independent observers are unable to gain access to Aceh.
Especially worrying are the latest rumours that a military group suspected of having committed systematic human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, together with a group of soldiers from the Indonesian army charged with, or convicted or suspected of, serious human rights abuses are now also active in Aceh.
This is one of the most worrying signals for the Indonesian Government.
It is therefore crucially important that access to Aceh be given absolutely top priority internationally and in the EUâs dialogue with MrsÂ Megawati.
Â Â  â Mr President, in Aceh, in the extreme north of the island of Sumatra, since the imposition of martial law on 19 May after the breakdown of the ceasefire that had been signed a few months before, the number of arbitrary arrests of civilians by the military and the police has been increasing.
The situation is very worrying and this climate of violence throughout the province risks ending up in another diabolical spiral.
Since the end of May, the Indonesian military have arrested or killed almost two thousand people suspected of belonging to the GAM rebel group, a movement that demands autonomy for Aceh.
Faced with this spiral of violence, we call on the Indonesian Government and the pro-independence movement to resume negotiations in order to implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
The populations that are at risk must be protected and Indonesia must quickly re-establish genuine dialogue so as to put an end to this unnecessary fighting, which leads to serious injustices and paves the way for the death of innocent people and poverty.
In Aceh, where the security forces have for many years been present in large numbers and have been murdering citizens with complete impunity, the climate is getting worse every day and is further reducing the confidence of the provinceâs inhabitants.
The Indonesian Governmentâs passive attitude to the thousands of violations reported in Aceh, the majority of which have been committed by its own security forces as part of the anti-insurrectionist operations in recent years, has fuelled the peopleâs resentment and created conditions likely to strengthen violent opposition.
The hope of lasting peace in Aceh will never be fulfilled unless steps are taken to protect the civilian population from the human rights violations.
Today, we call on the Indonesian authorities, but also the ASEAN countries, the Council and the Commission to ensure that Jakarta makes every effort to defuse the situation in the region and that the flagrant human rights violations are strongly condemned.
Finally, we believe that the GAM will also have to cooperate in any investigation carried out into the human rights infringements attributed to its members.
Â Â  Mr President, for me this is not a debate on the rights and wrongs of those in Aceh who campaign for independence, nor is it a criticism of Indonesia's right to intervene to secure law and order, so long, of course, as that country does not permit human rights abuses to be committed by any of its forces.
It is a debate about the escalating humanitarian crisis.
As we know, most of Aceh's 4.2 million people live outside the two main towns.
For them food, water, electricity and communications have been disrupted.
Healthcare and education have become impossible.
Five hundred schools have been burnt down, thousands of people have fled from their homes and Governor Puteh has said that unemployment and poverty are now at alarming rates.
We worry about human rights and I raise two issues.
One is the fact that 77 community heads have been replaced by military personnel and the second is that active in Aceh are people like Major General Damiri, Brigadier General Suratman and others who have been convicted of crimes against humanity in East Timor.
They are on duty in Aceh.
Kofi Annan has appealed to Indonesia to ensure access to humanitarian aid and human rights organisations.
He is right.
The obstacles to this are in Presidential Decree 43/2003, which states that international and local NGOs are not allowed to conduct activities contrary to the objectives of the military emergency conditions.
That is a catch-all provision that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.
It is not acceptable that all aid has to be rooted through the Indonesian authorities, nor that NGOs are restricted to Banda Aceh.
Finally, we call on Indonesia to investigate with urgency the disappearance of the human rights defender Abdussalam Deli, and the killing of his colleague, Raja Ismail.
I hope the Commission and the Council will assist us in these aims.
Â Â  â Mr President, the conflict in the province of Atjeh (Aceh) has been going on for 27 years and has already resulted in thousands of deaths.
The situation deteriorated even further after the breakdown in May of the fragile Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the establishment of a state of emergency by the Indonesian Government and the closure of the province.
The imposition of martial law led this House to adopt, in June, an initial resolution, in which we denounced the lack of freedom for the people and of freedom of the press.
We expressed our concern regarding the fresh upsurge of violence, the daily murders and the increase in the number of arrests and disappearances.
This condemnation was not sufficient, as martial law has just been extended for six months.
We regard this decision as unacceptable.
Our main concern, however, relates to the closing-off of the region and the fact that it is impossible to gain access to the people, and particularly the victims of the conflict, because when there is a state of emergency the military governs the region and distributes the humanitarian aid.
We call on the Indonesian Government to respect international military law and to allow humanitarian organisations access to the area so that they can provide assistance to the refugees, displaced persons and prisoners.
We are also concerned about the radicalisation of the conflict and the marginalisation of civil society campaigners at a time when moderate critical voices are needed to move towards peace and reconstruction.
With the hope of re-establishing dialogue, on behalf of the human rights group of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I organised, in October, a discussion on the critical situation in Atjeh and Papua.
Unfortunately, the Indonesian Governmentâs failure to face the separatist movements and civil society representatives prevented us from making any progress in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
Sadly, it is all too clear that the fall of the Suharto dictatorship and the return to democracy in Indonesia have not been accompanied by a significant improvement in human rights.
In reality, the army is still in power.
Civil liberties, trade union freedom and the freedom of expression continue to be scorned.
The tragedy in East Timor does not appear to have served as an example for the Government in view of the demands for autonomy that are coming from Borneo, the Moluccas, Atjeh and Papua.
There is no doubt that the rise in fundamentalism and in the number of terrorist attacks that are in the headlines of the international press are of grave concern, but it is in the name of national unity and the fight against terrorism where, far from the view of the media, freedoms are treated with contempt every day and a savage repression rages, not only in Atjeh but also in Papua.
Even though we do not support the armed rebellions, we call on the Indonesian Government to engage in dialogue with the fighters in order to build peace, and we call on the European Union to promote the reconciliation process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during an earlier debate on Aceh, on 5Â June, I pointed out that the borders in the developing world are largely a product of European colonial administration.
In this case, we are now seeing the result of the conquest of Aceh by the Netherlands a century or more ago.
Peoples that have been assigned to large, powerful neighbours run the risk of becoming second- or third-class citizens for good, without access to leading positions, without the possibility of active political participation and without having their natural resources at their disposal.
These peoples can only be protected by a large degree of self-government or by secession.
The more armies are deployed to prevent such a possible secession by means of terror, the more hated they make themselves, and the more difficult reconciliation between the ruling and the other peoples becomes.
This is how the breeding ground for those secession movements grows.
In Indonesia, the failing government is striving for popularity among the Javanese by showing that it is dealing with other population groups firmly and giving the army free rein.
That is comparable with the situation in Sri Lanka we discussed in an earlier agenda item.
The President needs this war to keep herself in power.
Negotiations are alternated with forceful military intervention.
Refugees from Aceh have told me how hopeless the situation has become.
Anyone who was present at the peace talks in Japan can no longer safely enter Indonesia.
In East Timor, we saw the devastating consequences of this kind of policy on the part of a previous president.
Europe must not resign itself to the current hopeless situation, and it must not put trade relations with Indonesia, particularly the supplies of arms that were resumed inÂ 2001, above human rights.
This is an alarming situation, and must lead to our ensuring that the autonomy and emancipation of the peoples of Indonesia have their place, and that there is no military victory, oppression or uprooting of these peoples.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to express the Commission's gratitude to Mrs McAvan for raising this issue and indeed to the other Members of the House, who clearly have a close and continuing interest in and knowledge of Aceh.
The situation in the province is obviously a matter of concern for the Commission, and in a recent statement the European Union presidency and the Commission, as co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference on peace and reconstruction in Aceh, voiced their concern about the extension of the state of military emergency in the province.
We also expressed the hope that it will end as soon as possible.
The Commission is seeking to encourage the government of Indonesia to suspend martial law as soon as possible, and in the meantime has impressed upon it the need to carry out its activities with the minimum possible impact on the well-being of the people of Aceh.
In pursuing such a process we always include references to humanitarian aid, the restoration of civil institutions and respect for the law.
The Commission is also pressing for improvement in the transparency of the situation in Aceh and continues to call, as honourable Members have, for access to Aceh for international agencies and relevant non-governmental humanitarian organisations.
While the Commission reiterates its commitment to the territorial integrity of Indonesia, it is also firmly convinced that the conflict in Aceh can only be ended by political means.
Despite the difficulties of obtaining reliable and verifiable information, our delegation in Jakarta is closely monitoring developments in the province in coordination with Member State missions to Indonesia.
It regrets that a recently planned mission to Aceh by political councils from several embassies was cancelled at the last moment by the Indonesian authorities.
The Commission will monitor the situation very closely and continue its efforts to impress upon the Indonesian authorities that they should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and, in the meantime, allow independent humanitarian aid providers to operate in Aceh without hindrance.
The cause of decency and humanity is well served by the interest demonstrated by this House, especially in the way in which honourable Members were able to illustrate their concern and arguments by reference to the reality of the wretchedness inflicted on the people of Aceh.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
- (B5-0493/2003) by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;
- (B5-0494/2003) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;
- (B5-0499/2003) by Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the lack of religious freedoms in Vietnam;
- (B5-0502/2003) by Mr Nassauer, Mr Posselt and MrÂ Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;
- (B5-0503/2003) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the UEN Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;
- (B5-0506/2003) by Mrs McKenna, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the lack of religious freedoms in Vietnam and the deliberate elimination of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam;
- (B5-0509/2003) by Mr SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Vietnam.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to make an urgent request, as I did in May, for attention and action on the part of the Commission and the Council regarding the lack of rights of the indigenous Protestant population of Vietnamâs central highlands.
Tomorrowâs meeting of the Joint EU-Vietnam Committee in Brussels provides opportunity for this.
Just yesterday evening I had direct contact with Hanoi by telephone, from which extremely gloomy background information emerged.
The Vietnamese Government is conducting a vigorous campaign against the Protestant Montagnards via television.
They are called âseparatistsâ and are a âsocial evilâ: at least, that is how the authorities in Hanoi interpret the constant protests of these ethnic minorities against the unabated removal of their social and economic rights â land theft, simply â and the discrimination and religious persecution by the ethnic Vietnamese, the Kinh, who consider themselves superior.
Incidentally, this same government is screening off the central highlands to outsiders.
Even local NGOs, backed by foreign co-financing organisations, are saying that they will shortly have to discontinue their aid to the indigenous peoples.
Against this depressing background, I ask that both Commission and Council show their ability to act.
After all, they are investing a great deal of money in Vietnamese public-sector projects, so let them then ensure that that aid also benefits the oppressed ethnic minorities in the central highlands.
Call in foreign co-financing organisations for this purpose.
Urge strongly that the central highlands be opened up to foreign observers.
Demand observance of the constitutional principle of freedom of religion on the basis of the international commitments that Hanoi has entered into.
In the meanwhile, in spite of all the oppression, the number of Protestants in the central highlands is growing unmistakably.
This is an interesting point for the European Union and Vietnam to reflect on for tomorrowâs meeting.
Â Â  â Mr President, the recent events that have taken place in Vietnam demonstrate once again the repression suffered by the monks of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the UBCV.
The Vietnamese authorities have placed eleven dissident bonzes of the UBCV under house arrest for two years, including the Patriarch of the Buddhist Church, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, who has already spent twenty-one years in prison.
This repression followed the first extraordinary assembly of the UBCV since it was outlawed by the communist authorities in 1981.
The UBCV, which is an important religious grouping in Vietnam, and was founded decades ago, is still not allowed to exist.
The Hanoi Government has justified these detentions by using violations of national security legislation as an excuse.
Vietnamese law authorises local authorities to place individuals under administrative detention lasting between six months and two years, without trial, in cases of attacks on national security.
In actual fact, through their behaviour the Vietnamese authorities are contradicting their grand declarations in favour of reforms and democracy.
I should point out that religious freedom is a fundamental right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the European Union/Vietnam Cooperation Agreement is based precisely on fundamental respect for human rights.
This policy of repression, not only of the monks of the Unified Buddhist Church but also of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church, the Catholic Church and the Christian Montagnards must end.
In fact, all of these religions are outlawed and have no legal status.
Vietnam is a multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious country.
This diversity is a wealth that should not be squandered.
The Hanoi regime must show good will and implement a series of concrete reforms, beginning with those that guarantee complete freedom of religion, and in this way launch a real process of democratisation.
Then we will be able to have confidence in them once again.
Â Â  â Mr President, in Vietnam, there is a marked gulf between what is claimed to happen and what actually does as regards the freedom to practice a religion.
The freedom to believe in a religion, or not to do so, is guaranteed.
That is what Vietnamâs constitution claims; that is what the country has undertaken to do in a number of agreements, for example the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The reality, though, is something else.
Worshippers, priests, monks and eminent religious dignitaries are harassed, persecuted and locked up.
State recognition is denied to such faith communities as the Montagnard Christians or the Hoa Hao Buddhists.
Vietnamâs United Buddhist Church was banned in 1975; its Patriarch was interned for 21 years and was released only in 1998 following international pressure.
Much hope was kindled when he met the Prime Minister in April of this year, but, following these conversations, the authorities stepped up their action against the adherents of this church and of other religions.
In October, the Patriarch and his deputy were placed under house arrest, and many of their followers were sentenced to two-year terms of imprisonment.
Cooperation between the European Union and Vietnam is founded upon the absence of any restriction on the exercise of human rights, as is stated in our cooperation agreement of 1985.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns the latest acts of repression.
If the Hanoi Government does not want to jeopardise its cooperation with the EU, legal status must be granted to all churches, and people interned for their religious beliefs must be set at liberty.
We urge the Council and the Commission to use all diplomatic means to make religious freedom a reality in Vietnam.
I ask you, Commissioner Kinnock, to use your personal influence to make this issue central to tomorrowâs meeting in Brussels between the representatives of Hanoi and those of the EUâs Commission in the EU-Vietnam Joint Committee.
We believe that Parliament needs to send a delegation to Vietnam to examine the situation on the ground and have talks with office-holders of all religions.
Â Â  â Mr President, freedom of religion is an important indicator that human rights are being enforced: a sort of human rights litmus test.
If a countryâs human rights situation is poor, it is likely to be seen first among religious groups.
It is among these that we can test to see whether human rights concerning freedom of speech, freedom of association and assembly, and the freedom to practise a religion are in place or not.
The situation in Vietnam demands the attention of the international community.
The EU has to send a clear message that discrimination against, for example, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Protestant congregations and dissident groups must cease.
These members of communities practising a peaceful religion have suffered deprivation of freedom and house arrest.
Furthermore, the original mountain-dwelling minority Christian community has been continually harassed, arrested and imprisoned by the Vietnamese Government.
A precondition of economic cooperation between the EU and the communist republic of Vietnam has been a respect for fundamental rights and the principles of democracy.
In violating these principles Vietnam is violating and harming itself, and the EU must now clearly indicate that.
It is regrettable that criticism of the Vietnamese communist party is automatically viewed there as a threat to the state itself.
The practice of fundamental rights such as expressing oneâs opinion can even be loosely interpreted as espionage on the basis of specific law on national security.
From the point of view of human rights it is also worrying that those accused are considered guilty before commencement of trial, and that trials almost without exception are declared secret.
A state ruled by law needs clear and precise laws that guarantee equality and legal certainty for all.
In no case can a state ruled by law be built with laws that permit racial, religious or political discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by recalling that only recently, six months ago to be precise, we gathered here, in this Chamber, to address the situation of human rights in Vietnam.
I would also like to remind you that there was still some hope that the meeting that took place in April, to which MrÂ Mann has already referred, between the leaders of the Vietnamese State and the patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), could lead to greater understanding on the part of the State as regards religious freedom.
Today, we must clearly accept that these hopes have unfortunately proven to be quite unfounded.
The situation has not only failed to improve but has actually worsened from all points of view.
The Buddhist patriarch is under house arrest and, what is worse, the pagodas belonging to the Buddhist church have been locked up, in a blatant attack on the most important principle of the Buddhist church.
At the same time, the pace of death sentences handed down and of executions carried out by the regime has picked up, and is already more than twice that seen in 2002.
Given this situation, I wish to reiterate what has been said here and urge the Commission to make our voice, the voice of the European Union, heard loud and clear in Vietnam in order to ensure that religious freedom and the principles of universal human rights are respected.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome MrÂ Vo Van Ãi, president of the committee for democracy in Vietnam, who is in the official gallery with MrsÂ Volkner, vice-president of the same organisation.
I believeÂ âÂ and MrÂ Casaca said thisÂ âÂ that Parliament is tired of having to return to the issue of Vietnam, it is tired of lies and promises from the Hanoi Government, and I do not feel we can continue in this situation.
Yesterday, the US congress adopted a very similar resolution to that which we will vote on in a few moments, and I feel that is another demonstration of weariness from the other side of the Atlantic.
The issue is in the Commissionâs hands.
We are quite aware that there are problems in the Council, in which one State known as âthe birthplace of human rightsâ is cultivating some imperalistic nostalgia, is paying a great deal of attention to the sale of and harbours extremely bizarre anti-American opinions.
This is an established fact, which should be clarified.
I am sorry to say that the Council and the Member States are often absent from this House.
There is still the issue of the Commission: tomorrow the Joint Committee is meetingÂ âÂ the Commission and the Hanoi authoritiesÂ âÂ and it should be then that the Commission, which has a programme assigning tens of millions of euros in aid for legal reform in Vietnam, raises the issue of the legal status of the Unified Buddhist Church and other churches.
The Commission should make the Hanoi authorities understand that if there is no progress in this specific area then cooperation aid will be suspended immediately.
I believe that without a strong gesture from the Commission in the meeting tomorrow, this umpteenth Parliament resolution will be useless.
I expect a very specific reply from Commissioner Kinnock on the approach that the Commission is going to take tomorrow in Brussels.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few minutes ago, over in the Robert Schuman Room, we presented Otto von Habsburg and Raymond Barre with the Franco-German Paneuropa Prize, and we recalled how, for ten years under Otto von Habsburgâs leadership, this House took debates on topical and urgent matters like this one as an opportunity to fight for Greater Europe, for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and for human rights behind the Iron Curtain.
Even then, there were many who told us that the work we were doing had no prospect of success whatever, that it was pointless, and that what we were doing would get us nowhere.
Today, there are among us observers from various countries â Mr Landsbergis was also at the ceremony earlier â who can tell us that debates like the one we are having today changed the practical conditions under which they were held as political prisoners, and that, most of all, they gave them hope in political terms.
Today, too, we are on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union.
Let that give us courage when we debate Vietnam.
It is a topic that we have often discussed, and, alas, the people named in the resolution â some of them important religious leaders, are still in jail; human rights activists are still being suppressed, and peoples are still enslaved.
We should, however, recognise that the time is coming when the wind of freedom will blow through Vietnam.
We in this European Parliament must not relent in campaigning for human rights and for the freedom of religion, even if there are those who tell us that this is unrealistic and bid us talk business instead.
We are under the great obligation of living up to our tradition and our name as Europeâs Parliament.
We appeal to the Commission and the Council not to fail at this hour.
Vietnam is an important partner, both in political and in economic terms.
As a country, it has suffered appallingly through wars, intervention by outsiders such as Europeans, Americans and the Soviet Russians.
Like Germany, it was a divided country; it endured a Communist regime and suffers its effects to this day, but it will be able to become a stable partner to the European Union only when it has become, no longer merely an economic factor, but a free state under the rule of law, a democracy in which freedom of faith and conscience prevail, and we ask you, tomorrow in Brussels, to employ your energies without reserve so that it may become that!
Â Â  . I thank Mr Belder and his colleagues for again raising the issue of Vietnam in this House, at a particularly apposite time.
I also echo what Mr Posselt said, that no one in this House or anywhere else should fail to understand the critical importance of free people in free institutions, communicating their concern about those who are not free and who suffer because of their efforts to observe or assert their own opinions and beliefs.
Everyone in this House, myself included, has had many encounters with people who have suffered grievously for the beliefs they hold and for resisting oppression.
It always comes as a great inspiration to hear from them that, even in the darkest hours, in the deepest jails and in the worst conditions, they had their spirits lifted by messages from outside.
The admired Socialist philosopher Aneurin Bevan said that each freedom is only made safe by adding another to it.
So, when we strive for freedom in Vietnam, we are striving to secure our own freedoms and those of other people around the world.
It is always encouraging to see the enthusiasm and energy Members of this House devote to that cause.
The Commission has an overall policy towards Vietnam, with which the House is familiar.
It is to encourage and support continued progress, with respect for human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where the situation is evidently deteriorating.
The Commission works closely with the European Union Member States in monitoring human rights developments in Vietnam and participates in all EU Troika approaches to the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues.
I can assure the House that the Commission and the Member States have repeatedly urged the Vietnamese Government to respect political and religious freedoms and strengthen economic and social freedoms.
Article 1 of the European Commission-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation.
As we informed Parliament on 15 May, this allows the Commission to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam, for example in joint Commission meetings held under the agreement.
Since that debate six months ago, the Commission has proposed further reinforcement of the EU's human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government, in the light of the EU's experience with dialogues in other countries.
That proposal, which has been accepted by the Vietnamese side, aims to encourage and support the continued commitment of the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues.
So far agreement has been reached on the dialogue, which will include all departments with responsibility for human rights-related matters, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Prime Minister.
While the Commission cautions that sweeping changes cannot realistically be expected, we look forward to further incremental steps that start to meet our concerns.
The human rights dialogue with Vietnam is taking place on two different but complementary levels: the EU-Vietnam dialogue on human rights between EU Troika missions in Hanoi and the government, which will next convene on 26 November, and the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, which is to take place tomorrow.
We also note that Vietnamâs parliament, the National Assembly, has expressed an interest in entering into a constructive dialogue with this House on these and other issues.
Far be it from the Commission to suggest how Parliament should respond, but I know it will seize eagerly on any opportunity.
As regards the state of religious freedom in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Constitution as Mr Mann reminded us enshrines the freedom of religion as a basic freedom of the Republic.
However, that freedom is limited and some would say contradicted by other specific laws.
We hope that these restrictions will be relaxed and we have made that case explicitly and repeatedly to the Vietnamese authorities.
As Mr Belder mentioned, there are reports of increased harassment of some Christians especially Montagnards and Hmong Christians since the uprisings in the Central Highlands in 2001.
It is alleged that local authorities have tried to force highlanders to renounce their deeply held beliefs.
If they looked at history, they would see how fruitless such efforts have been throughout the centuries.
The House is aware of the renewed detention of some leaders and members of the unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.
The European Commission and Member States have expressed their concerns over these events, and have called upon the Vietnamese Government to resume the dialogue initiated earlier this year between the UBCV and important members of the Vietnamese administration, including the Prime Minister, to restore the hope of a solution acceptable to all parties.
I conclude by emphasising that it is clear to the Commission that Vietnam would be best served by continued and more rapid progress in the countryâs reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and appreciates the value of accommodating dissent.
Those vital elements of liberation still have to be secured in Vietnam.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think that there is ambiguity here.
We do not understand.
There is no progression; rather, there is regression in Vietnam.
The question is simple: is the Commission prepared to introduce tomorrow as âconditionalâ in the negotiations with Vietnam the issue of granting legal status to the churches that are not recognised?
There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam.
We must therefore take a stand.
You are encouraging the lack of reforms with millions of euro from European taxpayers.
We cannot continue like this.
Either money is provided for reforms, and the reforms are implemented, or else none is provided.
I think that that is the question to which the Commission must respond.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall respond very briefly.
I know that Mr Dupuis is, quite justifiably, passionate about this issue.
I would simply say to him, without softening the attitude of the Commission at all, that in our efforts to try and secure protection for human rights and progress towards greater democracy, the setting of litmus tests is not always well advised.
I can certainly see the direct and straightforward arguments for setting such tests.
What we have to evaluate is whether that would help achieve the greater objective of bringing about the advances we all want to see.
Meanwhile, European taxpayers' money is going into development and cooperation in Vietnam. That is because people's lives would be blighted and even endangered if that aid was not provided.
Consequently, whilst I understand the argument for conditionality and in many cases would take that to its logical conclusion, the Commission cannot be certain that that approach would, in these circumstances, lead to the outcome that Members of this House and of the Commission would want.
This requires very delicate judgment.
We have to continue to exercise it in the fashion familiar to the House.
Â Â  That ends the joint debate.
We will now proceed to the vote.(1)
Â Â  That completes the agenda.(1)
I declare this session of the European Parliament to be adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 20Â November 2003.
Â Â  I should like to inform the House that at the beginning of tomorrow's sitting, the President of Parliament would like to pay a personal tribute to the Spanish servicemen who were killed in Iraq last weekend.(1)
Â Â  A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 3 and 4 December, containing the proposals for changes made by the Groups, has been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday, the European press published the report on anti-Semitism commissioned by the European Monitoring Centre on Racist and Xenophobic Phenomena.
This is a report whose existence was, until yesterday, denied by the Monitoring Centre itself and the Commission.
Three weeks or so ago, we had the Eurobarometer, and now we have the extremely disturbing report on anti-Semitism, whose existence had been concealed.
I would ask you to avail yourself of your rights and demand an explanation from the Commission during the current part-session, or to ensure that a debate can be launched on the matter during the next part-session in December.
Â Â  That will be a matter for the next part-session.
An additional change to the agenda of Thursday 4Â December has been proposed: the inclusion in the vote of the report by Mr MacCormick (A5-0421/2003) on the request submitted by Giuseppe Gargani for the defence of his parliamentary immunity and privileges which was adopted under Rule 110a.
Â Â  â Mr President, the corrigendum to the agenda was originally meant to include the MacCormick report on the immunity of Mr Gargani, but the Secretaries-General agreed yesterday that we first, of course, had to have the opportunity of examining it.
We cannot now retrospectively alter the agenda without the groups also having the opportunity to discuss it.
I would therefore ask that it should not by some means be retrospectively put on the agenda, but that the groups should have the opportunity to talk the issue through, and I believe that other Members of this House feel the same way.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am a little uneasy about the proposal that my report on the immunity of Mr Gargani be brought forward.
The Secretary-General of my Group stated that she would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss that report, along with other reports, at our group meeting before the part-session.
We understood the report was being deferred until the second December sitting in Strasbourg, and so we did not have the opportunity to discuss it.
Furthermore, I learned that there was a defect in paragraph 2 of the report as it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but I have not seen any of the adjustments to it.
As I am the rapporteur, I would have liked to have seen such adjustments.
On these grounds, with the greatest respect and with regret to my colleague, Mr Gargani, I ask that this matter be deferred until the next Strasbourg sitting.
Â Â  That is a very sensible suggestion.
There is no dispute regarding the principle of this report, and it would thus be a shame if we ended up having a procedural dispute on it.
I suggest that we postpone it until the December Strasbourg sitting.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I seek your advice as to what redress I have against an inflammatory press release which has caused hate emails to be sent to my office.
Richard Howitt MEP claimed in a press release that I had directly accused the Turkish Prime Minister of supporting militant Islamist groups, following the atrocious bombing in Turkey last week.
In fact, I made reference to media reports of a former Turkish Government's alleged provision of covert support to Islamist groups in their fight against the Kurdish PKK, and made no reference to the current Prime Minister, MrÂ Erdogan.
Furthermore, Mr Howitt claimed I disregarded the plight of Turkish civilian victims.
My use of the word 'atrocious' shows this is patently untrue.
I regret any misunderstanding and extend all my sympathies to those who have suffered, irrespective of race or religion.
The Member, in his role as Labour's European Affairs spokesman, should have understood the sensitivities in this case.
I would be grateful for a correction from MrÂ Howitt, as otherwise legitimate debate on accelerated EU membership for Turkey will be stifled.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Tannock has expressed his regret at the offence caused by the remarks he made last week at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Indeed, I also regret his receiving hate mail, as he described.
Mr Tannock was very clear in his remarks that he did not regard Turkey as a victim of the terrorist attacks and that the victims were 'British and Jewish' - not Turks.
Not simply did Mr Tannock go on to criticise the Turkish Prime Minister directly, but I believe his remarks could be regarded as offensive to Muslims and in general to the Turkish victims of the attack, irrespective of their religion.
I am pleased that my statement has caused him to retract those original remarks.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 12 13 December 2003), including the Social Summit, and on the progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the European Parliament for allowing me this opportunity to illustrate the principal issues that will be discussed during the forthcoming European Council in Brussels on 12 and 13 December.
This Summit, which will mark the end of the Italian six-month Presidency, is an exceptionally important event for us, not only in terms of the importance of the matters to be dealt with, but also because the decisions adopted there will set the course for the future work of the Union on a number of matters of great importance on the European agenda.
The European Summit, as you know, will also have to leave sufficient room for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, as the Heads of State or Government, accompanied by their respective Foreign Ministers, meet for the final phase.
Given the importance of the matter, I would like to begin my speech with an update on the progress of the IGC, and then return to the preparations for the forthcoming European Summit.
Just a few weeks off the end of the six-month Italian Presidency I am pleased to report on the developments following the Naples Conclave.
Firstly, I would like to confirm that the overall stance of the Italian Presidency remains that which my government has often expressed before this House and in the context of the IGC.
In accordance with that stance, the comprehensive proposal presented reflects our intention to respect the constituent legacy of the Convention, confining ourselves to proposing clarifications or alterations to the Conventionâs draft in light of the comments made by the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission.
I believe I can safely say that many of the Presidencyâs proposals have been welcomed with broad appreciation, which has allowed us to bring the positions of Member States closer together with due regard for the overall balance of the Conventionâs draft.
In addition to the substantial progress made on a number of specific issues, it has become clear that some persisting divergences on specific provisions will be resolved when an agreement on the Unionâs future institutional framework is achieved.
Indeed this is the area in which the greatest disagreement remains, above all as regards the calculation of the qualified majority in the Council and the composition of the Commission.
Detailed analysis of the results of the Conclave reveals the progress achieved on the following points in our proposal package: the insertion of a reference to equality between men and women and to the protection of persons belonging to minority groups in the provision on the Unionâs values; the reaffirmation of the primacy of European Union law; the need to make the acts of the European Council subject to jurisdictional control insofar as the European Council is defined in the Constitutional Treaty as a Union institution.
Points of convergence have been recorded in the extremely sensitive area of justice and home affairs too, where, in the introduction of qualified-majority voting, the specific features of certain national legal systems will have to be taken into account and safeguard mechanisms considered.
The various proposals drawn up by the Presidency on the specific policies of the third part of the draft Constitutional Treaty have been the subject of in-depth discussion.
Differing positions persist in many cases between the Member States on the basis of well-known points of divergence.
Nevertheless, it is quite clear that various criticisms made in this regard will melt away at the point when agreement is reached on the major themes of the constitutional negotiations.
The following are issues that will require further debate: the persisting divergence between the countries intending not to make concessions as regards abandoning unanimity voting in matters such as foreign policy, taxation and social security and the Member States that consider the phasing-in of qualified-majority voting in those areas a key element of the future Constitutional Treaty; the manifold, and often divergent, requests of Member States for changes to the provisions concerning the budget, the multiannual financial framework, own resources and economic governance.
Here, the Presidency is seeking to preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the interinstitutional balance and voting rules proposed by the Convention.
The idea of a simplified revision procedure for Part III, Title III of the Constitutional Treaty continues to meet with resistance while greater convergence seems to have emerged on the âpasserelle clauseâ on the basis of formulas that involve national parliaments too.
The Presidency intends to propose further discussions on all these matters in the course of the final meetings of the IGC.
The Conclave has, moreover, led to significant progress in the definition of the ESDP in the future Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed, it has been possible to achieve a new draft of Article I-40, part 7 on the mutual assistance clause, a description of structured cooperation in Article III-213 and, most importantly, the presentation of a Protocol containing the criteria for participation in such cooperation.
This group of texts will be examined anew at the IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December.
Nevertheless, the exchange of views that took place during the Conclave has revealed the fact that there is convergence on an increasing number of points in this sensitive area.
The debate on the institutional framework of the future Union has confirmed that this remains the most sensitive subject in the entire negotiations.
The Conclave was useful for overcoming some points of divergence and, most importantly, for fostering calmer, more constructive dialogue.
The salient elements of the discussion can be summarised as follows.
The request by some Member States to raise the minimum threshold of national representatives to the European Parliament was received positively, on the condition that the total number of seats does not increase.
On the matter of the presidency of the Council formations, convergence was recorded along the lines recommended by the Convention, even though some Member States still have doubts regarding joint presidencies, to which they would prefer elected leaders.
On this matter, the Italian Presidency reserved the right to reflect on further changes.
The possible solution is to have three Member States holding the Presidency for 18 months.
The procedures for implementing these solutions could be the subject of a European Council decision rather than being regulated by a special protocol.
The reactions to the Presidencyâs proposal on an EU Minister for Foreign AffairsÂ âÂ aimed at clarifying several specific aspects of the functioning of the âdouble hatâ formula with due regard for the spirit of the Conventionâs draftÂ âÂ have confirmed that the arrangement we have chosen is the only feasible one.
Indeed, our proposals seek to overcome the criticisms of both those who fear that this new institutional figure may become the Councilâs âTrojan horseâ in the Commission, weakening the Commissionâs powers in matters of foreign policy, and the criticisms of those Member States which would like to free the Minister from the constraints of the Commissionâs collegiality by emphasising the Ministerâs role as Council representative.
The middle road we suggested appears to be the only one which can ensure that a compromise will be reached in the end, although it does leave two major issues still to be resolved: the persistent opposition of some countries to giving the Minister for Foreign Affairs presidency of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and the call from other Member States not to give the new institutional figure the title âMinisterâ but the more modest title âRepresentativeâ, which is a clear retreatÂ -Â and not just a symbolic retreatÂ -Â from the provisions of the Conventionâs draft.
The lengthy debate on the composition of the Commission after 2009 saw the renewed proposal of positions and arguments already known.
In the course of the negotiations, there will have to be reconciliation between those who advocate a streamlined, agile, efficient Commission unhampered by intergovernmental constraints and those who favour a Commission which is representative of all cultures and national viewpoints, and thus composed of one Commissioner with full voting rights for each Member State.
The proposals on the table will have to be examined in a long-term perspective with a view to the institutional needs of a Union that, in 10 to 15 yearsâ time, is likely to be even larger and will, therefore, have to be endowed with decision-making abilities that are adequate and easy for the citizens to understand.
The debate on the issue of the calculation of the qualified majority in the Council has made the range of positions in the field even clearer and more distinct: some States ardently defend the Nice system; others consider the transition to double-majority voting indispensable.
Of these, a number of countries would prefer a totally symmetrical double majority, in other words, 50% or 60% both of the Member States and of the Union population.
In the face of positions which still differ widely, we will need clear thinking and farsightedness.
To this end, to reiterate what I said before, I would underline the need for the various proposals to be examined with a view to the long term after 2009.
The IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December 2003 and the bilateral meetings which the Presidency will be stepping up in the coming weeks will therefore have to concentrate, first and foremost, on the institutional issues in order to make the best possible preparation for the final Conference meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government scheduled to open on 12 December 2003.
The success or failure of the constitutional negotiations will very likely determine the progress of the process of integration for the coming years as well as Europeâs ability to play an authoritative role on the world stage at a time of major political and economic challenges.
For this reason, and considering the importance of what is at stake, the approach to the constitutional negotiations will have to be characterised by ample flexibility on the part of all the actors called upon to lay the foundations of the Union for the twenty-first century.
With due regard for the principle of equal dignity of all Member StatesÂ âÂ also recognised at the Naples Conclaveand rightly soÂ âÂ it is necessary that we abandon all particularist behaviour and stop thinking in terms of âfair exchangeâ, where each individual concession is made in an attempt to gain something of equal value.
This approach is contrary to the very concept of European integration and, if systematically applied, would jeopardise the principles underpinning the Union.
Although fairness is an essential condition for any constitutional agreement, no one can now halt the current developments in the process of integration.
Anyone who wishes to do so will have to stand accountable before the European partners, before their citizens and before the history of the integration process.
Political systems are developed through dialogue and the actions of men and women, and those same men and women are fully accountable for what is said and done.
From this point on, we must be aware that the adoption of the new Constitution will be âa success for all or a failure for the Unionâ.
There is now, no longer, any substantial difference between national and European interests.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to focus, albeit briefly, on the issues that will be addressed by the European Council.
As far as the economic issues are concerned, in particular the objective of boosting sustainable economic growth, the European Council will mark the culmination of the long period of work that started with the Thessaloniki European Council and was further developed by the Heads of State or Government at the most recent Summit in October.
Indeed, the December European Council will be called upon to approve definitively the Growth Initiative, already endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 25 November, adopting specific decisions that will be able to make a substantial contribution to improving the competitiveness of the European economic system and to the full development of the Unionâs potential for growth by promoting higher levels of investment in physical capital and the development of human capital.
The principal objective in this context will be to createÂ âÂ including through the identification of a series of projects on which work can begin in the short space of two to three yearsÂ âÂ a political catalyst that will make it possible to increase sharply the pace of infrastructure creation and the implementation of advanced research projects in order to facilitate the deployment of essential resources from both the European Investment Bank and the private sector.
From a different and more general standpoint, but still in the context of consolidating the cohesion of the internal market and boosting growth, the Italian Presidency also nurtures strong hopes that the European Council will accept the political agreement achieved by the Transport Council on the Commissionâs proposal regarding the review of the TENsÂ âÂ which, as you will remember, provides the basic structure for the initiatives for the completion of the infrastructure network of the enlarged EuropeÂ âÂ in consideration, not least, of the recent decisions on the increase in EU subsidies from 10% to 20% for projects on cross-border stretches.
Moving on to issues related to the Lisbon agenda, with particular reference to points concerning structural reforms, to which the European Council next spring will need to devote its energies, I would point out that the Member States of the Union, whose efforts have been unceasing in this area, will now be presented with a major opportunity for open dialogue during the extraordinary meeting of the Trilateral Social Council, which will provide a highly significant opportunity to renew the commitment of the European Union to the implementation of the European Employment Strategy.
The Social Summit will be the occasion to begin an initial analysis of the results of the work carried out by the employment task force headed by Wim Kok, and to discuss the Growth Initiative, with particular regard to its effects on employment.
On these bases, the participants in the Social Summit will be able to develop the debate on the links between employment growth and productivity increases highlighted by Mr Kokâs task force, evaluating, in particular, the impactÂ âÂ not least in terms of employmentÂ -Â of policies seeking to improve the competitiveness of the economic system through the enhancement of human capital and the flexibility of European socio-economic systems.
The outcome of this SummitÂ âÂ on which Mr Berlusconi will be reporting to the European CouncilÂ -Â will also, of course, feed into the discussion at the Council itself.
The European Council will also be a good opportunity to take stock of the situation as regards a number of important issues connected with the creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice, with particular reference to European strategies on immigration, in the light of the recommendations that emerged from the recent Brussels and Thessaloniki Summits held in October and June respectively.
The Heads of State or Government will need, first and foremost, to take note of the agreements reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 and 28 November on the main elements of a European Border Management Agency, a programme of measures specifically devoted to immigration by sea, and the insertion of biometric data in visas and residence permits.
These initiatives have already been examined at the October Summit, and will now be rapidly implemented and, in some cases, finalised through the formal adoption of the relevant legislative provisions.
In this regard, I wish to underline, in particular, that the European Parliament, too, will be required to express its opinion on the regulations for the Agency and on biometric data.
I am afraid that the news on the subject of asylum is not so good.
In spite of the great effort made by the Italian Presidency, which has led to substantial progress in these difficult negotiations, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the directive on minimum standards for asylum procedures nor to break the deadlock that had already developed by the end of the Greek Presidency on the other directive on refugee status and subsidiary protection.
The European Council can only reiterate the political importance of this matter and invite the Council to reach an agreement at least before 1 May 2004, the fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
In the framework of the Unionâs migratory policy, the European Council will certainly discuss the key issue of the reception and integration of legal immigrants as well, and especially the importance of encouraging inter-faith dialogue as an element of social cohesion, a subject to which the Italian Presidency devoted a Conference of Home Affairs Ministers on 30 and 31 October 2003.
Migratory policy cannot, however, be effective without genuine, effective cooperation with the third countries of origin or transit of migratory flows, cooperation that needs to be developed in a constructive spirit of partnership.
In this connection, I feel I should mention the positive interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission, which should be formalised in the next few days, on the creation of a financial and technical assistance programme for third countries on the subject of asylum, and the introduction of a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating these countries in the fight against illegal immigration, requested by the Thessaloniki European Council.
Lastly, in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the European Council will express its satisfaction at the agreement reached following the Italian Presidencyâs tenacious brokerage of the framework decision on combating drug trafficking, an issue that is of particular concern to European public opinion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels takes place just a few months before the entry into force of the Accession Treaty.
The Heads of State or Government will be required to provide important directions for the completion of the enlargement process, especially in the light of the reports presented by the Commission on 5Â November 2003.
As you know, on 17 November 2003, the Council expressed its opinion on the Commissionâs monitoring reports on the accession countriesâ state of readiness.
The Foreign Ministers, in particular, expressed their satisfaction at the high degree of alignment achieved by these countries in the different areas of the ,and we therefore expect the Heads of State or Government to endorse these positive opinions.
The enlargement that will be taking place in 2004 can therefore be increasingly viewed as a complete success, confirming that the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at Copenhagen last December were the right ones.
Of course, as was to be expected in view of the immense effort required of the accession countries, there are areas of the where the preparatory process is not yet complete, with respect to which we need to urge our future partners to make the necessary endeavours.
The Commissionâs recent strategy document shows without a doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have made considerable progress towards their entry into the Union.
They are now ready to take the decisive steps that precede accession.
The European Council therefore has a responsibility to facilitate these steps by mapping out in sufficient detail the road that they need to follow.
This also applies to the timetable, especially the timeframe for the conclusion of the accession negotiations, the signing of the Treaty and, finally, entry into the Union.
Of course, the completion of these steps depends, first and foremost, on the efforts made by the Bulgarian and Romanian governments.
Precisely in order to facilitate these efforts, however, it will be necessary, in the Presidencyâs view, for the Heads of State or Government to provide clear directions on the next legs of the journey, confirming, therefore, the deadlines: 2004 for the conclusion of the negotiations, 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaties and 2007 for accession to the European Union.
The European Council will also have to provide guidance on the timeframe for drawing up the financial framework for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, in particular by acting promptly on the willingness already displayed by the Commission to present it before the end of January 2004, following the same resource-allocation criteria that were adopted for the accession countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that each one of us in this room has reason to welcome the considerable efforts made by Turkey in the area of institutional reform, and the additional progress it has made in respecting the Copenhagen political criteria.
These positive developments therefore deserve full recognition in the conclusions of the European Council.
We must not fail to provide Turkey with suggestions and encouragement to continue in this direction, nor must we fail to highlight those areas in which Ankara needs to make a particularly sustained effort.
In the medium term, our goal is still to ensure that Turkey is sufficiently ready for the decision that the European Council will be adopting in a yearâs time.
Lastly, as regards Cyprus, the Presidency feels that the Heads of State or Government must reiterate the appeal already addressed to the parties to achieve an agreed solution by the accession date, while pointing out at the same time that a solution to the Cyprus question would be a considerable step towards the achievement of Turkeyâs desire to become part of the European Union.
As always, the European Council will devote due attention to the Unionâs external relations and to the principal international issues.
I will not expand on this point as we are awaiting the latest developments on the ground, particularly where crisis areas are concerned.
I believe, moreover, that we will not be able to avoid dealing with matters such as the Middle East peace process, the situation in Iraq and developments in the critical dialogue with Iran.
The European Council will also bring to a close the debate on the European Security Strategy launched last June, with the adoption of an excellent document setting out the Unionâs security problems and how to address them, with the aim of both giving governments guidance on making practical decisions and increasing public awareness and public support for the greater security undertaking which is now necessary throughout the European Union.
The Heads of State or Government will also be called upon to examine the report on progress in the development of the ESDP with a view to giving the next presidency a detailed mandate on the matter.
Acquiring greater capacity remains our primary commitment.
For this reason as well, the European Council will particularly welcome the decision to create a European agency dedicated specifically to promoting the development and acquisition of new military capacity.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention that the forthcoming European Council will also be required to adopt the first Multiannual Strategic Programme, which will be the basis for the Councilâs work over the next three years.
Â Â  It is my pleasure to welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery the former Prime Minister of South Korea, Mr Nam, and his Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee.
They are here to participate in the European Parliament North-East Asia Forum meeting which takes place on 4 and 5 December 2003.
You are both most welcome to this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Antonione, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the last in a highly eventful year.
Indeed, almost every week brings with it developments and decisions that will have a major impact on our future.
Last week was no exception.
Before turning to the debate on the Constitution, I should like to focus briefly on another topical issue for the European Union.
The forthcoming European Council will be precededÂ âÂ as Mr Antonione saidÂ âÂ by an extraordinary Tripartite Social Summit, to be attended by the Heads of State of the troika and representatives of the social partners and the Commission.
Indeed, it is vital to involve the social partners at this stage of the constitutional process and it is essential that we listen to their points of view.
The involvement of trades union and employers is the best guarantee of success for any initiative promoting employment.
The meeting will address two issues which are at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy: our Growth Initiative and the European Employment Strategy.
The key moment will be the presentation of the task forceâs report on employment by Mr Wim Kok.
The report describes how we can respond to the major changes taking place in the economy and the labour market.
Its main points include the need for firms and workers to become more adaptable, for more investment in human capital and, lastly, for new social dynamics to sustain reforms and speed up their implementation.
The Commission will take account of the task forceâs report and recommendations when it drafts the Joint Employment Report for presentation to the Spring Council next year.
Mr President, I shall now turn to the central theme of my speech, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is entering its final stages and of which Mr Antonione has already given an extremely balanced, commendable overview.
The stakes will be high at the European Council in Brussels on 12 and 13 December.
In the decisions taken we will see the fruit of the new Convention method, proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission and approved by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken European Council in December 2001.
Any return to the method of intergovernmental bargaining we witnessed in the early hours of the Nice summit would represent a political failure for the European Union.
Public opinion would no longer accept it.
The key task for the Intergovernmental Conference is now to decide how the enlarged Union can achieve its goals and increase its decision-making capacity.
The European Union is faced with three major challenges.
Firstly, it needs strong policies and better European coordination aimed at economic growth, job-creation and social protection.
Then we have to give a common response to the international challenges related to security, freedom and justice.
Thirdly, we must join forces in order to shoulder our global responsibilities and promote our values and interests.
Article 3 of the draft Constitution solemnly sets out the Unionâs objectives along these lines.
The Convention did not, of course, produce a perfect Constitution to address these tasks.
All the same, the result matches the proposals contained in the Laeken Declaration, maybe even exceeding expectations.
The Intergovernmental Conference has clearly so far been more occupied with internal disputes between Member States than with creating the right instruments to respond to Europeâs needs and problems.
It is certainly disappointing that there was no progress whatsoever on adoption of a procedure making amendment of the policy part of the Constitution possible.
The Commission will support all the Presidencyâs efforts to achieve this objective.
Considering the new challenges that we will face, the Constitution cannot and must not become a constraint on future action.
The only significant progress made so far on the work of the Convention has been the definition of structured cooperation in the field of defence.
For all other issues, there is still a danger that the Intergovernmental Conference might take steps backwards towards the intergovernmental method.
This is also true of European cooperation on criminal law, at precisely a time when all the leaders are aware of the threat of international crime and terrorism.
Furthermore, some want to undermine the credibility of the Minister for Foreign AffairsÂ âÂ as Mr Antonione made clearÂ âÂ while paying lip service to the need for Europe to become stronger and play a leading role on the world stage.
Some ministers maintain that more intergovernmentalism would strengthen economic policy coordination, while what is really needed is a greater European ability to put economic governance at the service of the growth strategy.
Some countries would even like to reintroduce the right of veto in areas where the Convention has already abolished it, in trade policy for instance.
Clearly, therefore, there are only two options: a divided Europe that is only a spectator on the world political stage or a united Europe contributing to peace, growth and sustainable development.
With a choice between these two opposing options, Europe is in danger of being relegated to the sidelines in world affairs, surrounded by other powerful actors.
In its current form, the draft Constitution gives a united Europe the means to act more effectively.
Nothing less, but nothing more.
It does not create a political project for the future.
Hence, the key question facing national leaders at the Intergovernmental Conference summit is not whether to commit themselves to an ambitious European political project.
The key question is whether, in the future, they will find the collective ability to adopt the necessary instruments which any European project will need.
The Convention preserved and improved the balance of powers between the various European Union institutions.
A strong Commission is indispensable for impartial application of the Unionâs rules and so the Commissionâs powers in key areas such as state-aid control should not be watered down at the last minute.
Our goal of becoming a genuine Union of states and peoples finds expression in the double-majority system proposed for Council decision-making.
Democratic legitimacy has been reinforced by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in legislative, political and budgetary matters, and the Court of Justice's role in upholding the rule of law has, in part, been strengthened.
One thing is certain, ladies and gentlemen: the Commission will hold out against any attempt to weaken the powers of the European Parliament, especially in budgetary matters, right to the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.
How can the European Parliament and the Commission be expected to explain and promote to the citizens a Constitution which Parliament itself would have rejected?
There is no explanation that would stand up.
For its own part, the Commission welcomes the Presidencyâs acknowledgement that making a distinction between Commissioners with and without voting powers is too complex and, above all, will not work.
There is a simple solution which preserves the equality of all Commissioners: a Commission made up of one Commissioner per Member State, with a more decentralised decision-making structure, and a system of checks and balances to ensure total collegiality.
This is the solution that the Commission wants to see in the Constitution.
Lastly, the double-majority voting system proposed by the ConventionÂ Â 50% of the Member States representing 60% of the populationÂ -Â is simple and fair.
Any change should be aimed at facilitating the Collegeâs decision-making process.
Of course, the Commissionâs preference remains a system based on 50% of the Member States representing at least 50% of the population.
Under no circumstances should the Intergovernmental Conference decide on a voting system that would make decision-making in the Council even more difficult than under the Nice system.
There is simply no justification for a Constitution âworse than Niceâ.
Moreover, in Brussels, we must, at all costs, avoid the kind of last-minute bartering that would serve only to undermine the credibility of the Constitution before we have even had a chance to present it.
Remember that the first referendum on the Constitution will be held a mere six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before winding upÂ âÂ and without entering into a debate that will take place in this House at a later dateÂ âÂ I should like to make a few brief comments on last weekâs Ecofin Council meeting.
My assessment is based on both the substance of the decision and the procedure.
As regards the substance, the Council reached overall agreement on deficit reduction plans, which, moreover, are in line with those proposed by the two countries concerned.
The Council therefore accepted the commitments given by Germany and France that they would consolidate their 2005 budgets.
From a procedural standpoint, on the other hand, the affair has more serious implications because the Council has opted for an entirely intergovernmental course of action instead of that mapped out by the institutional procedures.
Here, I must repeat my basic criticism: we should not take short cuts whenever the rules of the Pact and the Treaty, rules that were agreed unanimously, become demanding or inconvenient.
The usefulness and value of the Treaty and the Pact depend on the certainty of the rules to which we allÂ âÂ Commission, Parliament, Council and Member StatesÂ âÂ must adhere.
This is such a serious matter that I do not wish to gloss over it.
My hope is, however, that, as has so often happened in the history of the Union, a serious crisis will give rise to the most innovative and lasting solutions.
I therefore believe we should look ahead, fixing our eyes on two objectives: one for the immediate term and one for the future.
In the immediate term, I am sure that the Member States will see the Council's final declaration as an indication of a greater, more resolute undertaking in the area of growth and stability, and that they will realise that the rules have to be applied systematically.
For our part, we shall continue to discharge our duty by applying the Treaty and the rules of the Pact.
It is our responsibility, particularly in this phase, to ensure absolute equality of treatment for all Member States.
Furthermore, budgetary discipline and stability are essential to Economic and Monetary Union.
In any case, the affair also teaches us a lesson for the future.
You will all remember the critical remarks I made a year ago.
I did not mean to condemn the Pact; my remarks were intended to be a strong appeal for the Pact to become a better thought-out instrument for coordinating budgetary policies at European level.
Now that the single currency is a practical reality, the markets and all the citizens need to be able to rely on proper economic governance, for which we need a genuine economic policy.
We have to embark on a new phase of consolidating and managing our achievements and fitting them to the new situation, but always in a disciplined manner and, above all, always treating everybody equally.
We must restore the credibility of our instruments of economic governance and of the rule of law now that we are in the midst of a debate on our new Constitution.
As early as a year ago, the Commission took an initial step in this direction by presenting specific proposals for strengthening and coordinating economic policies and interpreting the Pact in a way that would make it both more flexible and more rigorous.
This line of action proposed by the Commission was approved by the European Council.
Moreover, our contribution to the Convention already contained a section on strengthening and coordinating European economic policy, and parts of our proposals were taken up by the Intergovernmental Conference.
These tentative steps forward cannot be called into question now.
Ecofinâs decisions, however, show that the real problem still to be resolved is the genuine weakness of our present system of European economic governance.
The real challenge facing us is how to solve this problem.
The Commission will now take careful stock of the situation and prepare a forward-looking initiativeto take on that challenge.
Indeed, in my view, it is not enough to revise the rules for implementing the Pact.
We must have an in-depth debate on fiscal policy in the wider framework of the general monitoring and coordination of economic policy.
Above all, we need to link budgetary policy more closely to the more general objective of boosting growth potential without jeopardising the long-term sustainability of public finances.
To this end, we should be more proactive in using the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact together as instruments to coordinate economic policies in a way that will secure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union and ensure that we achieve the Lisbon objectives.
We need, therefore, to strike a new balance between these two instruments in order to preserve budgetary discipline while, at the same time, stimulating growth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the few days left before the Brussels European Council, we must act with determination and optimism if we are to achieve the major goals we have set ourselves.
If we do that, the Constitution now taking shape will clarify our basic objectives, define the European Unionâs area of action more precisely and make the working of our institutions simpler and more transparent.
I am confident that we shall pass on to future generations a Union that is not only larger and more influential but also more coherent, more democratic and closer to the European citizens.
We must not settle for less at this great, historic time.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, let me start by thanking the Italian Presidency of the Council for having so far kept its promise to stick as closely as possible to the Conventionâs draft.
On behalf of my group, I would encourage them to keep to this rule.
It must be apparent to us that what has happened with the Stability Pact has lost us credibility in some areas, with an effect on the relations between smaller and larger states in these negotiations and, as regards two states, it has certainly not led them to adopt a more conciliatory negotiating position.
Perhaps I may start by saying something that I think is important, namely that these negotiations must not interfere with the stability and strength of the European Central Bank, and that the attempts in various quarters to do so must be nipped in the bud.
It must be clear to us that there has been a great deal of progress in many areas, to which Mr Antonione has referred.
I am particularly pleased that Naples has seen such progress in the area of security policy with regard to structural cooperation and the mutual assistance clause, including the protocol, to such an extent that it can indeed be described as a breakthrough.
The Convention, I believe, always took the view that the door should be left open so that other countries could join, and that this should not be seen in opposition to trans-Atlantic relationships.
I just hope that the Foreign Minister can gain acceptance in the same way, and I think it extraordinarily important from the point of view of the Commission and of Parliament that the Foreign Minister should be a full member of the Commission, with all that follows from that, although there is no doubting that he will have particular duties of loyalty to the Council, and the clarification that the Italian Presidency of the Council has provided in this regard is also important.
I also think it crucially important that he should also chair the Council of Foreign Ministers â indeed, it makes no sense for him not to, and only then will the whole edifice make sense.
I am not sure that I can take seriously the idea that it is the foreign ministers, of all people, who find the title of âForeign Ministerâ problematic.
I do not quite understand what is so problematic about it.
If I am reading Naples the right way, it also seems to be important that the President of the European Council should not have the power to intervene in the General Council and in what it does.
I hope that the negotiations will leave this unchanged.
This is part of the institutional balance â President of the Commission, General Council and European Council â and we have accepted the idea of a President of the European Council only if he has no influence over the rest of what the Council does and over the lawmaking process.
I believe that this will prove resistant to the attempts about which we have heard.
I have to say that there are two points that leave me profoundly saddened.
Trying to solve the problem of voting procedures in the Council by setting a fixed date, in 2009, when it has to go back to taking decisions unanimously, is an escape route.
It is one that has never worked yet, and if we want the Council to function, it must be enabled to take decisions by dual majority, as proposed by the Convention, and I hope that this will not be too readily abandoned in the course of negotiations over the next ten days.
We took a critical line on Nice because it did not provide the capacity to act that enlargement demanded.
This of all points must not be the cause of the negotiationsâ failure.
The second point I would like to address is this: if Parliament is to lose out as a result of changes to budgetary law, then I regard that as the breaking point.
If â as the Ecofin ministers tell us â the intention is that Parliamentâs budgetary rights should revert to being what they were before the Inter-Institutional Agreement, or even pre-1978, then that is not acceptable.
What we have is a finely-tuned balance, including the fact that the Council alone has the last word when it comes to own resources.
In this context, this is a balance, one that is destroyed if any point of it is changed.
Although I have gone over time, I would like to say that approval of the Budget is Parliamentâs prerogative.
No parliament can agree to a constitution that violates this prerogative.
Â Â  Mr President, let me start by making a point relating to method, since the President of the Commission â quite rightly, in my opinion â has touched on the Stability Pact, which is the next item for debate.
The President-in-Office of the Council informs me that Minister Tremonti will deal with this subject, not him.
We will have to tell both of them what we think about this budgetary and economic issue.
Let us start at the beginning, however.
On the subject of the Social Summit, which will be covered in greater detail by other Members, I would like to start by saying that I hope the Summit will not just be a bolt-on extra.
The Lisbon Strategy has shown us what happens to good intentions in the absence of commitments.
We feel it is incredibly important at this time that we should devote ourselves to devising proactive policies for our most valuable asset: human resources.
We therefore support Wim Kokâs proposals and hope that the Council will draft policies which are more than just a list of good intentions.
Moving on to the outcome of the ministerial meeting in Naples â which apparently, although there was no black smoke issuing from Vesuvius, was marked by a storm that darkened the end of the meeting â I would like to state, in clear opposition to the position adopted by the Italian Government, that we still want to see an agreement on 13 December.
We want the Italian Presidency to be a success.
I have to admit that the Italian Presidency has maintained a constructive approach, often going much further than most governments.
Moving on to the issues under discussion today, I would like to draw the Council and the Italian Presidencyâs attention to the responsibilities of this Intergovernmental Conference, which is being held after the Union has opened its doors to democracy.
Those doors were opened, but have been shut again.
We cannot now accept last-minute deals and haggling that are not only against Parliament, but also against democracy and transparency.
Consequently, we in the PSE Group do not consider the question of the Legislative Council settled.
In the name of dignity and in order to maintain the ordinary legislative process, the Intergovernmental Conference ought to reconsider the matter.
On the subject of the Commissionâs composition, I would like to say that, in principle, the majority in my group feels a flexible solution is required.
We are not in favour of having one Commissioner per Member State, but whatever happens, we have to remember that we are thinking in terms of transition periods, when actually the Commission needs to be a responsible executive body for Europe.
We have noted the Italian Presidencyâs proposal regarding qualified majority voting, which is based on a double majority of citizens and States as in Article 1 of the Constitution.
There is room for fine-tuning, but what we must not do is go further, to the triple majority established at the Nice Summit, because this approach definitely does not work.
We welcome the progress made on structured cooperation on defence under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and we support the Italian Presidencyâs proposal on extending the use of qualified majority voting.
We are very disappointed with the current third pillar proposals, particularly those relating to judicial cooperation, criminal and civil matters, and the role of the European Public Prosecutor.
There is a very clear regression on these points compared with the draft Constitution.
I would like to conclude, Mr President, by commenting on the Councilâs all-out attack on Parliament, despite the fact that it has no authority to do so.
Let us be clear: Ecofin does not have authority over the powers of this House.
I would say that this is an offensive move on the part of the Council and also of their advisors, the , as they are called in Italian, since Coreper is the next level down from the Council, and it is in Coreper that the papers are prepared for the Council, as the Ministers are not usually experts in this field.
Let me say that this kind of proposal is wholly unacceptable to us.
There is a clear demarcation line that must not be crossed.
In fact, I would go further: there has been a harmonious balance of power between Parliament and the Council since 1975 and we are not going to take these changes lying down.
If the Council dismantles the budget system, we will respond in kind, and we will see who is willing to go furthest.
We are not just going to sit still and bemoan our lot.
We have powers, and we shall defend them to the bitter end.
Â Â  Mr President, all eyes are on efforts to agree a Constitutional Treaty before the year is out.
The irony of our leaders making new rules for the European Union only days after breaking the Stability Pact will not be lost on our citizens.
At the same time, we look to the European Council to shoulder its responsibility, to stand up for the rights of European citizens who continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay.
In Naples, our Foreign Ministers managed to move closer to agreement only by moving further away from the Convention text.
My group regrets that the tide of reform will not now rise to the high water mark set by the Convention.
The Convention's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the European Union more accountable and transparent.
No viable parliamentary democracy can exist without the power of the purse.
The obduracy of finance ministers on this matter is a battle pitting raw politics against the principle of reform.
I welcome the remarks of the President of the Commission.
We must not cede on this point.
We also have to resolve the issue of voting weights so that the efficiency and accountability gains promised by the Convention are not entirely lost.
To us, what really killed the Stability Pact was certain countries confusing their power to break the law with the right to do so.
In Guantanamo Bay, the United States has fallen victim to the same confusion.
America was founded on the principle that the free are governed by laws, not men.
Countries have borders, but principles do not.
There is no line on a map beyond which such values no longer hold.
The prison at Guantanamo Bay squanders a precious American legacy and surrenders vital high ground.
For two years the 660 men and boys in Camp Delta have been denied the rights of prisoners of war or of civilian criminals.
They have been charged with no crimes.
The military commissions that will judge them will grant no right of appeal and no access to an effective defence.
Dostoyevsky once wrote: 'You can only know the nature of a civilisation by visiting its prisons'.
Of all the tests that a civilisation can be handed, the responsible use of power over the powerless is the greatest.
Sadly, the standards of detention and justice at Guantanamo Bay are unworthy of a country with America's proud history of civil liberties.
While I welcome the news that some detainees may shortly be repatriated, winning a reprieve from this disgrace for a few Australians and a few Europeans renders more stark the injustice committed to those who will be left behind.
Europe must press for every man and boy in Guantanamo Bay to be either immediately charged, face justice in their home country or be released, regardless of nationality.
President-in-Office, I hope that will be high on your agenda.
I call upon this House to demand of the European Council an unequivocal statement of Europe's dismay, and I call upon our President to convey that message.
I call upon the European Unionâs leaders to ensure that bilateral deals do not silence Europe on the greater principles at stake.
The Liberal Group adds its support to calls for the European Parliament and for the Council to submit an Amicus Brief to the US Supreme Court on behalf of the detainees.
Two of our greatest enemies in the fight against terror are the fear that makes us cheapen our freedoms and the power that makes us cynical of them.
If you at the Council can find the will to do justice to our enemy, then we will already have won.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the wonderful speech that MrÂ Watson has just given is a hard act to follow.
I fully agree with the comments that my fellow Member made about the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and my group will also be appealing to the Presidency to stand firm on this matter at the next Council meeting.
I should also like to call for the Council meeting to express its support for the Geneva Initiative for peace in the Middle East, under which a number of courageous Palestinians and Israelis have now signed an agreement that may succeed in breaking down walls.
It may be our hope for peace in the region.
Returning to the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, when the Convention chose to draw up a whole treaty, that is what it was: a choice.
Laeken, of course, primarily called for answers to a number of different problems, and, since the Convention nevertheless chose to draw up a single, unified treaty, I also think that it has been party to risking the method of working somewhat.
Perhaps the Convention has raised the European banner so high that its feet do not touch the ground.
It is to be hoped not, but I should like to say that the product of this â the European Constitution â has several weaknesses and also several strengths.
Above all, however, it baffles me how we can sit in this House in a parliamentary assembly â an elected assembly â discussing a constitution which will possibly not be put to the vote, on which our citizens are not permitted to take a position, and to which European citizens are not given the opportunity to give their assent or dissent.
A number of Member States are to hold referendums, but the mere idea of introducing something resembling a constitution without consulting the citizens is too far removed from my understanding of democracy, at any rate, for words.
After all, democracy is more than just democratic institutions, although that is part of it.
Democracy is also more than just free, democratic elections between multiple candidates and multiple parties, although that is part of it.
Democracy also comprises the possibility for dialogue with the citizens in the process.
Citizens should not just cast their vote and go home.
They must also be consulted in the case of important events, such as the drafting of a European constitution.
I hope that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be such that it can be accepted by those citizens who are able to vote on it.
That will, however, be quite some task, for example on the subject of economic policy.
We have just had a little talk about EMU, and this will also be discussed a little later in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact, but the policies behind the Stability and Growth Pact have of course been incorporated into the draft Constitution, and, at the same time, as was said during the Danish referendum, we are now seeing how the small countries have to comply with the rules whilst the large ones are let off.
We do not care for this policy, and I also hope, therefore, that the Council meeting will find a solution to this problem, so that Germany is able to solve its economic problems and we do not just have to follow rigid requirements.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Intergovernmental Conference is not going well.
In my view, the result expected in Brussels at this stage appears to be dreadful.
I believe that one of the great capacities of politicians who want to say âyesâ is having the courage, when it comes down to it, to say ânoâ or to refuse to sign.
I feel that it is only right that the Presidency, the Commission and everyone involved should try to reach agreement in Brussels.
However, if reaching agreement in Brussels means replaying the palaver of the last night in Nice, the Intergovernmental Conference must not end in Brussels.
There must be no repeat of Nice!
You have heard of âDying for Danzigâ; now, the Poles have brought us âDying for Polandâ.
MrÂ Prodi said: âWe are going to die for the budgetâ.
I say: âI do not want to die for Brusselsâ.
No one is obliged to die and no one is obliged to sign if it is a poor Intergovernmental Conference.
That is the situation.
I know that the governments usually laugh because this Parliament does not have to say âyesâ.
I know that they say that in the end Parliament will be won over.
In fact, even the majority in this Parliament, against a minority, was won over in Nice and said âyesâ to Nice, while we said that Nice would make enlargement impossible or that it would be impossible for Europe to function.
You, ladies and gentlemen and Mr President-in-Office, can tell them that they will have to see to it that this Constitution is ratified, whether it be by Parliament or through a referendum.
Tell them, too, that if the vast majority of us, the Members of the European Parliament, do not agree with what they have signed, we are capable of swinging the referenda towards the ânoâ vote.
We can still be a nuisance even if you do not allow us to make the decision with you.
If you do not receive the support of the most European of Europeans, in other words, of this Parliament, you will not receive the support of the people of Europe.
You must get that into your head.
Therefore, if you revise the Conventionâs draft Constitution, if you do not want to talk about the legislative council any more, if you do not want to talk about institutional equality with regard to the budget and to Parliamentâs right, if you are unwilling to come up with the double majority, if you want to call into question the definition of the content of Europe as defined in the first part of the Conventionâs text, the most European of Europeans will fight against this text.
So I say to you that you must not sign, for if you do not reach agreement you must continue to talk.
You must talk to the Poles.
You must talk to the Spanish.
You must talk to my grandmother and to my grandfather and to anyone else.
As far as I am concerned, signing before doing this would be a crime against Europe.
That is what we will say to the people, and we will try to persuade our governments not to sign in Brussels if the result is not satisfactory and to leave it to the Irish Presidency or the Luxembourg Presidency to finish the job.
The fact is that it is never too late to finish but it is sometimes too early.
That is what I am afraid of and that is why I say to you that you must trust in Europe and must not sacrifice it to a signature of which you will be ashamed, just as you have been ashamed of Nice.
That, after all, is why you launched the Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it is fair to say that the meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers in Naples last weekend was a very productive one.
I say this because now the European Union governments are discussing what I would describe as the bottom-line issues relating to areas of concern with regard to the likely provisions of the new European Union Treaty.
The Italian Government needs to be commended for accelerating the pace of these negotiations, and the holding of this recent meeting in Naples was a very timely one.
EU leaders are now meeting next week, on 12 December 2003, to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the European Union.
I believe, in the light of the spirit of cooperation and determination that prevails at this moment, that an agreement can be reached at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of the European Union governments.
That is not to say that there are not problems or areas of dispute.
I have always believed it is very important that there is equality of representation with regard to the future composition of the European Commission.
Equally, there are different concerns from the perspectives of different Member State governments within the Union.
It is clear that the likely direction of the decision-making process within the Parliament and within the European Council is going to be based on codecision and majority voting procedures.
I believe that the citizens of Europe are demanding to know the exact responsibilities of the new political portfolios that are being created within the European Union.
They want to know exactly what the roles of a likely European Union Foreign Minister, and a possible President of the European Council, will be.
It is important that clarification be given to these questions and that there is no duplication of roles.
This would blur what the European Union should be doing at this time.
Furthermore, there is still a concern within Europe with regard to a few sensitive national concerns.
I very strongly take the view that taxation issues should remain the preserve of the individual Member State governments.
I do not believe that the European Union should be given powers to raise taxes by means of a procedure of qualified majority voting.
Equally, I believe that the qualified majority voting procedure should not apply to decisions concerning the operation of legal systems within the European Union.
This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe.
I have no doubt that over the next ten days there will be further intensification of dialogue between all contracting parties in an effort to broker an agreement for a new European Union Treaty.
The goodwill is there to reach an agreement at the forthcoming European Council.
While the Italian Government's timetable is certainly ambitious, it can be achieved under the right circumstances.
I wish it every success in doing so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is probably the last time we shall be meeting before the summit on 12â13Â December, and I should like to warn against the Constitution that is now on its way.
The Laeken Declaration set the task of bringing the EU closer to its citizens.
Now, a large number of new decisions is to be transferred from the national parliaments to officials behind closed doors in Brussels.
More decisions are to be transferred from open parliaments to semi-secret Council working parties than decisions in the Council are to be made open.
Overall openness will diminish.
Legislative power is essentially being turned into executive power.
In essence, the electorate is having its influence curtailed.
The democratic deficit will increase, although the task was to reduce it.
The federalists in this House are clapping their hands with glee, as they themselves will obtain more influence.
Instead, they should be opposing the fact that national parliaments are ceding much more power than the European Parliament is gaining.
The electorate and the elected representatives will be the losers.
Lobbyists and officials will gain legislative power if the present draft is adopted.
The Heads of State or Government will be given the right to appoint those who will hold power in the EU.
The President of the EU, the EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President of the Commission and his/her vice-president will all be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 Heads of State or Government.
Eight countries can be outvoted and their wishes disregarded.
Out of those 17, ten will probably be able to continue as leaders in their own countries.
The seven who do not hold on to power back home can then share jobs in Brussels.
When politicians lose the confidence of the people in their own country, they can have their rejected policies embalmed for five years.
The monopoly on making legislative proposals will rest with people who can no longer be elected.
The Commissioners are not elected and are not answerable to the electorate.
The Commission can only be unseated with a two-thirds majority, and doing so will at most create a crisis.
The European Parliament itself is undergoing a crisis, with ever falling voter turnout and an inability to make the Commissioners comply with a bookkeeping law applying to every book-seller in the EU, for example.
Effective means against fraud do, however, exist, namely openness and democracy.
Let the Commissioners be appointed by, and be answerable to, the national parliaments.
Thus, no Commissioner will get away with saying âI am not responsible; I did not know what was happeningâ.
Build Europe from the bottom up and not from the top down.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I am going to read some statements made after Naples.
Mr Fischer said: âI am leaving Naples more concerned than when I arrivedâ.
Commissioner de Palacio said: âIt is clear that only a minority of States support the Giscard dâEstaing project.
Mr Villepin said: âI will not accept watered-down compromisesâ.
The President-in-Office of the Council himself has stated that Austria, Estonia, Denmark and, to a certain extent, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom would, if they had to choose, currently opt for Nice rather than the new system.
No comment.
This is the picture.
In his excellent speech, which we all applauded with pleasure, Mr Cohn-Bendit stated that he did not want to die for Denmark, Europe or America nor from any illness.
Bravo.
Nor do I. However, this policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this lack of policy on the part of our, or your, Europe, is condemning tens of thousands of people to death in the Middle East and jeopardising the regionâs fate and future.
In my opinion, and I support the appeal made also by the former President, Mr Cossiga, on this matter â on the issue of war and peace â pacifists, the only thing you can say is that we must withdraw our troops.
Bravo.
You are no different from the people in 1939.
It is now necessary, and this is our specific proposal as radical members of the Bonino List, in compliance with international law and the rules of war, that experts be consulted as a matter of urgency.
We must act quickly to legalise the situation and, therefore, the UN, Europe, the Arab League, and, I believe, even the United States, must call for an official peace process.
The error committed in Italy by the Allies, who even at that time were liberators, is being repeated in the Middle East.
On 8 September 1943, when the Italian army disintegrated overnight like Saddam Husseinâs army, Italy could have been liberated in two months.
Instead, it took them months and months.
It took them six months just to set up the Republic of SalÃ².
There will be no territorial Republic of SalÃ², but we are clearly witnessing the clandestine reform of the Iraqi army, not least in that it remains unpaid.
Consequently, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, Italy, and now Europe, must take the initiative of convening a special Council meeting for the purpose of proposing a peace process to the UN, the United States and the international community.
In accordance with the rules of international war, Saddam Hussein is to be characterised as a clandestine fighter so that â as happened for instance in Cassibile in Italy â haggling can subsequently take place not over Saddam Husseinâs immunity, but over his exile and impunity.
