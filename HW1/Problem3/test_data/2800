As you know, that agreement was approved here in the House in July 2000 without our having an opportunity to debate it.
This framework agreement is driving a wedge between Members and is creating a two-tier Parliament.
It is encouraging a policy of divide et impera - divide and rule.
We can no more tolerate this than we can tolerate a lack of access to general documents.
I would also like to remind you that last December we agreed, by adopting the Morgan report, that in future we would defer discharge if the Commission had not made available all the documents requested.
We have actually found ourselves in that position sooner than many people expected.
One more comment on the FlÃ©chard case, and let me be clear about this: the Commission cannot in all honesty avoid making a clear admission that the procedure adopted at the time was wrong and that everything must be done to prevent such an unlawful decision ever being made again.
Mrs Schreyer, as the Commissioner responsible you have an opportunity to make a statement to that effect.
Please take that opportunity here today.
I will make no bones about it: my decision whether or not to vote for discharge will depend on what you say today.
Mr President, strangely enough, this is the first time in many years that the discharge is likely to be given on time.
Therefore, it will be a great moment, for Parliament as well as the Commission, when we put it to the vote tomorrow.
Has the Commission lived up to expectations, then?
Maybe not quite yet. However, I think a general change of attitude has taken place in the Commission.
A shock wave went through the system when the Santer Commission was removed in 1999.
The Commission is now aware that the threat is real.
Parliament can and will use the discharge to remove the Commission if it does not live up to expectations.
This year, there are certain MEPs who will refuse to grant discharge.
I believe that would be a very big mistake.
This is something we must only do in special circumstances when we have really good arguments for doing so.
If we do it every year, the threat, of course, loses its value.
We must cooperate with all those forces that wish to make European cooperation more efficient and open.
I think that this is what most MEPs want.
I have therefore collaborated with all the political groups represented in the Committee.
Undoubtedly, this has improved the report, as well as the atmosphere in the Committee.
The new Commission has initiated large-scale reform.
Mr Kinnock has promised us the best administration in the world.
We shall now see whether the fine words can be put into practice.
I have prepared a very critical, yet constructive report.
It also recognises the fact that the Commission is in the process of implementing large-scale reforms and, at the same time, addresses the sore points.
In 1999, things were simply a mess.
There was no overview of the internal and external audit reports, and the archive was also in something of a mess.
We must hope that the reforms will remedy this.
I have drawn up a 10-point plan which is largely based on the spirit of the reforms but which goes further in some areas.
I look forward to hearing the Commission' s response to my proposals.
We have received a lot of information this year.
We might have wished for more extensive and more timely information, but many of the delays can be attributed to the framework agreement.
In my experience, this is a poor framework agreement.
It is used to withhold documents and to keep documents confidential for, in the end, it is the Commission which decides whether a document should be deemed confidential.
I have respected the framework agreement because it is currently in force. However, I think it should be revised.
In my opinion, we should work towards a re-negotiation of the framework agreement.
One of the greatest dangers of this agreement is that ordinary committee members are reduced to second-rate members.
Considerable information is provided to the rapporteur and the committee chairman only, and so the taxpayers are not given the optimum guarantee that nothing is kept secret or swept under the carpet. It will never be discovered.
However, Parliament should certainly also 'look nearer home' .
Why have we not yet arranged for a secure archive to be set up to which Members may come to read confidential documents under proper conditions?
We must therefore ensure that the Commission can trust us.
I am delighted that the Commission has put its trust in me as rapporteur.
We have been provided with more information than ever before in the history of the discharge, and I should like to commend the Commission for that.
We could sense quite clearly that the Commission wanted a timely discharge . Some of us can surely confirm this.
All in all, the Commission has taken the discharge very seriously this year.
It is the first time that so many Commissioners have been present in the Committee. The Committee saw all 12 Commissioners.
This indicates that the new Commission is interested in, and respects, the discharge procedure.
However, I do not fully agree with the Commission' s view of what Parliament' s discharge should be based on.
Basically, the Commission believes that the discharge should be based on the various reports from the Court of Auditors.
That is something I do not agree with. Parliament should not be a detective agency.
We should concentrate on structural problems. However, we should have the same access to information as the Court of Auditors.
It is the Commission to which Parliament must grant discharge, and that is why we must hold the Commission primarily responsible.
However, there is a complex interplay between the Commission and the Council, Parliament, the Court of Auditors, OLAF and the Member States.
I therefore made a great effort to incorporate all the institutions in my report.
Both the Council and Parliament set limits upon the Commission' s work.
Agricultural policy is a good example.
The Commission has fought hard to reform agricultural policy.
Time and again, it has tabled proposals for countering malpractice, fraud and over- charging and, time and again, Parliament and the Council have voted against these.
Unfortunately, there are many such examples, for example in the flax, milk and butter sectors.
Every year, the Council has given the Commission the green light in its discharge, so I became curious.
What do they really discuss behind the closed doors of the Council?
I sent a letter to the Swedish presidency requesting permission to attend the Ecofin meeting where the discharge is adopted.
I was very disappointed in the Swedes, who normally boast about their openness.
They rejected my request.
But then I was very impressed to receive the rejection in all 11 Community languages.
I have other things to say, but I shall return to these at the end of the debate.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I say how delighted I am that my report concerning discharge of the European Parliament for the implementation of the 1999 budget was adopted unanimously in committee and has been tabled before the House today for debate and voting with no amendments, something which, I am told, has not happened for years.
I hope that this will be the procedure from now on.
We have endeavoured, with everybody' s help, to draft a constructive report based on two lines of approach: the quantitative and the qualitative.
On the quantitative side, we used the classic method of auditing the implementation of the budget and found things to our satisfaction and liking.
We identified a downward trend or, in fact, a constant reduction in the costs of missions between Luxembourg and Brussels.
We found that checks made to ascertain whether officials really have taken up residence where they are supposed to have taken up residence have, without any doubt, been stepped up. We found that the number of contracts awarded through open competition is gradually increasing and we hope that this positive development will be put to more frequent use in the future.
The inventory of Parliament' s property has been started, albeit somewhat late, and is making headway.
Of course, it is disappointing, as we have pointed out, that a price has still not been put on this building, which we have been using for about eighteen months now.
We still do not know what it is worth, what it cost or where we stand and everyone involved would do well to bear that in mind.
On the qualitative side, we found that the European Parliament administers a huge budget.
But what do we give out, what image does Parliament project to the outside world as it operates this huge, serious institution?
You know, it is tiresome to read nothing but critical comments and critical articles in the press, given the tremendous, fundamental job done in this House, which is precisely why what we have tried to do in this report is to help increase the transparency, acknowledgement and the understanding of what happens and what we do in this chamber of democracy.
What we want is to be able to quantify the European Parliament' s contribution to the legislative work of the European communities.
We want to start making use of the opinions expressed by the groups of visitors who come and visit Parliament.
It would be a good idea if we knew what these citizens, for whom a large sum of money is earmarked so that they can visit and get to know Parliament, feel about the European Parliament, and use them to show us a better way forward.
We want to improve the efficiency of the information offices in the various capitals of the fifteen Member States, so that is the direction we are moving in.
And we also want continuous support between the services of the European Parliament and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, so that we can implement what we decide and vote on.
Hence the proposal and the decision to create a standing committee consisting of the rapporteur for discharge and the person responsible for Parliament, together with parliamentary officials, to monitor progress in and the implementation of the measures which will be proposed and which we shall vote on here tomorrow.
This would turn discharge from a one-off issue into a continuous, constructive procedure.
Finally, we want the staff, the officials working on economic affairs here at the European Parliament, to receive continual training, additional training and reintegration into new technologies, so that we can achieve the best possible results.
Before closing, may I thank all my fellow members and all those who helped draft this report, because I think that we have done a fine job and I hope that it will be used as an example at all levels.
Mr President, the low turnout at the elections might well give people the impression that this Parliament has little say.
Nothing could be further from the truth, as is once again borne out in the annual discharge debate.
The dismissal of the Santer Commission was the turning point in the Union' s financial management.
Whilst the Council granted discharge to the same Santer Commission unthinkingly, this Parliament did take its responsibilities seriously.
Not only has this increased the political weight of discharge, at the same time, a U-turn has taken place from a bookkeeper' s mentality to one which is focused on content and effectiveness.
The representative body of the people should not only ensure that all receipts are in, but should also check whether the tax money has been spent wisely and whether a result has been achieved.
In this respect, assistance from the European Court of Auditors is at hand.
However, the Committee on Budgetary Control believes that the monitoring procedure could be far more effective still.
For that to happen, the Court of Auditors would need to embark on a consistent naming and shaming, in other words the public pillorying of those Member States who fail to get their act together.
In addition, we would like to see the percentage of errors at national and sectoral level clearly quantified in order to gain a better insight into the problems which spending entails.
Should this not be possible this year, then the Court of Auditors should in any case draw a distinction between major and minor errors when introducing a so-called Richter scale of errors.
Furthermore, the Court of Auditors must realise that it is not above the law itself.
It should stop resisting a true audit on itself and must publicise its financial interests on the Internet.
Unfortunately, we have to establish time and again that Europeans, whether they hail from north or south, east or west, have little faith in the European Union' s bookkeeping.
It is the costly duty of each and everyone who is involved in the financial monitoring of the European expenditure to win back the confidence of the European citizens.
This confidence is a pre-condition for the further political success of European integration, and that confidence can only be regained by maximum transparency.
The Europeans want certainty that their money is being spent in the best possible way, and where that is not the case, that the organisations and Member States involved are actually called to account.
There is another institution - quite a major one at that - which believes that it stands above the supervisory power of the EP: the Council of Ministers, which was once again of the opinion that its presence was not required today.
Via a so-called gentlemen' s agreement, Parliament and the Council have agreed not to monitor each other' s spending.
This was done in the spirit of 'If you do not check me out, then I will not cast a critical eye at you either' .
Needless to say, this hardly contributes to restoring public confidence.
As long as this approach involved purely administrative expenditure, this was perhaps justifiable to some extent.
However, we now see that the Council is assuming further operational responsibilities.
Not only does this undermine the position of the Commission, it is also subject to little democratic control.
This is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has reached the conclusion that the agreement is due for an overhaul.
The Court of Auditors must report on the Council' s spending in the same way as it does for other institutions.
The surreptitious manner in which the Council is drawing power towards itself without accounting for it contravenes all basic principles of democracy.
Budgetary legislation, and powers concerning budgetary control, have always been strong weapons for this Parliament when it came to plugging the different democratic holes.
We owe it to our electorate, where possible, to exercise democratic control.
Especially in the case of the Council, where the democratic hole is the biggest and is only threatening to get bigger, this form of control is crucial.
Also as a message from this Parliament to other institutions, this is, therefore, an important choice to make.
I can be brief about the committees and agencies.
Europe is still under construction and is, as all dynamic processes, subject to change.
It is thus no longer logical to scrutinise structures from time to time in the light of all the changes.
All European institutions must continue to demonstrate their added value.
They must ensure that the money of the European taxpayer is spent wisely.
How do they impact on legislation?
Do they operate efficiently?
It is, naturally, regrettable that the discharge of the Economic and Social Committee has been postponed for the fourth consecutive time due to deception involving non-existing airline tickets.
We should really close this chapter once and for all.
All that remains for me is to congratulate the many honourable Members who have been involved in the discharge, on their reports.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has mainly adopted a restrained and intelligent stance by granting discharge to the Commission, but under strict conditions.
We are stepping up the pressure to bring about reforms within this Parliament too.
Only if we subject our own actions to the same strict requirements which we impose on other institutions, will we remain a credible reform mechanism.
Mr President, the European Coal and Steel Community is being wound down.
In accordance with decisions taken earlier, it will cease in July 2002.
Preparations have been made for its expiry, and in the last few years, the ECSC has not collected tax payments from companies in the coal and steel industry to finance its operations.
Over the last decade, the way the ECSC has acted is reminiscent of banking.
It received credits, which it distributed in the form of loans to develop the coal and steel sector.
Borrowers received a sort of interest subsidy with these loans, and its importance to the development of the sector must not be overrated.
The importance of the interest benefit has not been examined closely, but it is probably so little that it is fully justifiable to end the work of the ECSC.
In 1999 new credits were no longer granted and the ECSC was mainly involved in the claw-back of credits, the repayment of credits it received itself, and the management of surplus funds.
The Commission has been responsible for the ECSC.
In recent years preparations have been under way to wind it down in July 2002.
Then the ECSC will still have amounts outstanding on credits it granted, but the money it borrowed itself should have been paid off.
After the repayment of credits it is estimated that the ECSC will still have more than a billion euros in surplus funds, to be transferred from its own balance sheet to the joint EU balance sheet.
In accordance with decisions taken earlier on, these will form a research fund, managed by the Commission.
The fund will provide support for activities related to the main ECSC areas of industry.
There is probably no lack of subjects for research.
In the opinion of the committee, some sort of research should be carried out on how subsidies to the coal industry in some Member States have an impact on the competition situation between different forms of energy.
The most striking observation made by the Committee on Budgetary Control on the accounts for 1999 is that it was impossible to assess how efficient the Commission had been in managing ECSC funds.
In any evaluation of how efficiently the ECSC has been managed, in its capacity as something akin to a bank, it is necessary to know the actual yield on cash investments and what the share of administrative costs was in attaining this figure.
The information is not now available.
The committee did receive from the Commission, however, an undertaking to produce this information for the year 2000, after which it will be possible to compare the market return the Commission received on investments with possible earnings received via other channels.
For decades, loans have also been granted to EU personnel out of ECSC funds.
When the ECSC Treaty expires these loans will be incorporated in the EU balance sheet and be managed by the Commission.
After that EU staff will be in debt to the EU.
It is not appropriate that the EU should act as a mortgage bank for its staff.
The committee believes these loans should be transferred to banks.
The committee offers this for the Commission to consider in connection with the granting of discharge.
The matter will be returned to in connection with the granting of discharge in the years to come.
The EU cannot be a mortgage lender for its personnel.
In connection with the granting of discharge the work of the Commission will thus be assessed also from the point of view of administrative rationalisation.
The minor irregularities discovered in the ECSC accounts from past years were corrected after 1999, and the committee has no special remarks to make with regard to granting discharge in the normal manner.
Mr President, I would particularly like to support what Mrs Theato said in her speech.
I too regard it as an enormous problem that the Council is not present for this debate.
When you look at the Council's report on the discharge, you really get the impression that in many areas the Council does not know what it is talking about.
For instance, when it comes to the Development Funds, you get the impression that the Council has simply dusted off the same opinions it delivered years ago, instead of really coming to grips with the subject.
I think this is particularly scandalous given that the Council is partly responsible for the fact that there are problems in this area in the first place.
There are still unresolved conflicts of responsibility between the Member States and the Commission here.
So I expect the Council to display a rather greater sense of responsibility and to accept more responsibility.
Parliament is making an effort in the case of this discharge to strike a very careful balance between the urgently required verification work needed, on the one hand, and on the other hand, and this is just as important, the issue of a further loss of confidence in the European institutions.
So as rapporteur for the Development Funds I have given considerable thought to whether I can really call for postponement of the discharge.
But this is a clear decision, and I have the full support of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
However, I would like to emphasise once again that we are not refusing to grant discharge, as it said in one newspaper today, but rather that we are postponing the discharge.
The reason we wish to postpone the discharge in this way is that we believe the Commission is most definitely heading in the right direction, but that it still needs some pressure if it is to go all the way.
So this is not a question of a lack of confidence in the relevant Commissioner, but rather an attempt to make it clear that the action plan he produced in conjunction with Parliament during the 1998 discharge one year ago is precisely the right answer to the problems before us, so that we as the Committee responsible and as Parliament wish to incorporate the first results from this action plan in our discharge procedure.
As the first results are due in April or May, we wish to postpone the discharge until then.
Another reason why we believe that this is undoubtedly necessary is that many improvements still have to be made regarding the Development Funds, or rather the management of the Development Funds, in terms of auditing and cooperation with the Member States.
In this context I would like to express my thanks once again for the excellent cooperation we have had with the European Court of Auditors, which was very helpful in its assessment of the management of the Development Funds.
I wish to point out that the positive DAS contained in the Court of Auditors' report has to be seen in relative terms, because the Court of Auditors has responded to oral and written questions by commenting that it naturally has some problems here, and that it cannot audit 77 countries and 205 projects itself, so that it is dependent in this area on cooperation with the countries in receipt of aid, and that a great deal of work still remains to be done in this field.
On the one hand, the local delegations have to be strengthened, and on the other administrative structures in these countries also have to be reinforced, and there must be joint projects through which those in positions of responsibility in those countries can obtain the information they need from the EU, that is from the Court of Auditors, and also exchange projects with the Court of Auditors for administrators in positions of authority in the ACP countries.
We urgently need to improve administrative structures so as to deal properly with the work required in the area of development aid.
But I must stress that I am also calling for postponement of the discharge because there has been a singular lack of transparency in my field.
The Commissioner responsible for my area seemed to be far too tentative and anxious, and in my capacity as rapporteur I received information late, after the deadline or not at all.
I also think that his staff's reference to the framework agreement with Parliament is not very helpful as a means of creating confidence on the part of the rapporteur and as a means of ensuring that we work together constructively on this.
The Commission must in future act in a more transparent and impressive way, and display greater confidence in its dealings with Parliament, so that we can jointly bring the discharge procedure to a satisfactory conclusion.
I would also like to stress once again that many things need to be improved in relation to the Development Funds.
The Commissioner has some difficult tasks before him.
There is a backlog of commitments that he has inherited from the old Commission.
The administrative structures are inappropriate and understaffed.
In the recipient countries themselves there are problems with wars and other crises, and we have taken all this into account.
We are certainly willing to admit that in this area control needs to be handled more carefully.
The control process in a developing country must take as its starting point the notion that there is always corruption with development aid and consideration needs to be given to what sort of action to take in a given country.
That means that we are certainly willing to meet the Commission half wayand recognise the major problems that exist.
But we would also like to stress again that if the EU and the Commission want to win the confidence of the public in the important field of development aid, they will, of course, also have to make appropriate adjustments to their management structure to reflect the regulations.
And it has to be said that the backlog of payment appropriations has certainly reached a worrying level now.
Thank you very much, Mrs RÃŒhle.
Given that voting is imminent, we shall suspend this joint debate until 3.00 p.m., and it will be resumed with the presence and intervention of Commissioner Schreyer.
VOTE
Does any Member wish to speak against this proposal?
As no one wishes to speak, I shall put to the vote the request to postpone the vote.

Before the vote on Amendment No 2
Madam President, we have made a further improvement to one part of the amendment, in agreement with the rapporteur.
It reads as follows: "Hopes that true to the rules of social dialogue the Commission will continue to consult with the parties concerned."
The change is in the word "continue".
This is the only change, and as I said it has been agreed with the rapporteur and so he accepts it.
Madam President, I also propose that when this amendment is adopted, it should be considered to be an appendix to paragraph 7 and not a paragraph in its own right.
(Parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment being tabled)
Before the vote on Amendment No 13
Madam President, I do support this amendment, but, for technical reasons, I would ask honourable Members to consider introducing a sub-title, which we would call the 'European Coal and Steel Community' , in order to ensure coherence within the text.
Mr Turchi tabled the amendment and since he has no objection to this, I shall put Amendment No 13, as amended by Mr Costa Neves, to the vote.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Roth-Behrendt Report (A5-0095/2001):
Madam President, I explained most of my considerations on this report yesterday, but, this morning, I would like to add that the desires and expectations of the left, of the Greens and of Mrs Roth-Behrendt are, in my opinion, destined to remain just desires and expectations.
Women must choose between make-up and consideration for animals.
Here, I am afraid to say that I am in no doubt: they prefer make-up, for that makes them look younger.
I would therefore draw the attention of the House to the fact that I abstained in the vote on this report, but that the lady pensioners have instructed me to say that they are willing to renounce all cosmetics if the national governments and Europe decide to take five years off their age, stating their dates of birth as five years later and thus making them five years younger without the need for cosmetic make-up.
Madam President, unlike the last speaker I do not think this is an issue that should be trivialised in this way.
Last night, I was astonished by Mr Fatuzzo's speech.
This is an issue which concentrates on cruelty towards, and inhumane abuse of, animals.
It is nothing to laugh about.
We should not be making jokes about these issues.
This is an extremely important issue.
There is a lot of hypocrisy in this House. Last night people were using the excuse that we need further testing but we have to be sure that we do not cause any damage to children, that we must protect them.
It is ironic that those same people voted against our amendment in committee in relation to the fact that fragrances are included in baby products.
If we really want to protect children then surely those people would have voted to ban the use of fragrances in baby products.
They are completely unnecessary.
They also expose babies to unnecessary risks.
I want to re-endorse the fact that this is not a trivial issue.
It is extremely serious.
The general public throughout the EU are very much opposed to the use of animals for something that is completely unnecessary.
This is basically cosmetics - things to boost people's egos, making a huge amount of money for the industry.
We really should take account of animal welfare.
It is unjustifiable in the twenty-first century that we are using such prehistoric practices.
Madam President, I should just like to briefly explain why I supported Amendment No 35, which could be described as a "wrecking amendment".
It was not the intention of this amendment to wreck the directive.
But because the changes Parliament wants to make to this directive are so fundamental, we would like to send it back to the Commission to allow them to rewrite it to take into account the marketing ban and take a more realistic view of the alternative testing methods that may be available, not using animals.
Therefore I would not like my vote and those of the others in my group who supported that amendment to be misconstrued.
The United Kingdom has already banned animal testing.
We would like to see that taken forward in a realistic and practical way.
Our group has decided to abstain from the vote for the following reasons:
Firstly, because an amendment has been tabled proposing that the Commission' s proposal be rejected by Parliament and because we do not believe that this proposal responds to this Parliament' s minimum expectations.
The PPE-DE' s amendment was rejected by a margin of 11 votes, and we therefore feel it is coherent with our initial position to abstain from the final vote on the text.
Secondly, our group considers it necessary to abstain because its two amendments on time limits for the end of marketing and for the end of experimentation have not been accepted.
Since our group is in favour of setting dates, both for the end of marketing and for the end of experimentation, we consider it appropriate to extend the deadlines proposed by the rapporteur in such a way that the prohibition of marketing will take place within ten years of the approval of the revision and the prohibition of experimentation will be delayed by two years, in the event that alternative available methods are not found for cases in which ingredients, or mixtures of ingredients, may cause serious dermatological or ocular damage
I welcome the adoption by the European Parliament of the report by German Socialist MEP Dagmar Roth-Berendt, which calls for a ban on the testing of animals and the introduction of proper labelling so that consumers can make an informed choice.
At a time when people are demanding higher standards from the food industry, the cosmetics industry continues to market products which contain potentially harmful ingredients.
Today's debate on a report on the use of animal testing and ingredients in cosmetics and toiletries raises concerns about the use of allergy-causing ingredients, as well as substances used in cosmetics which have been linked with cancer and hormonal problems.
While EU legislation provides for strict limits on the use of certain chemicals in cosmetics, this does not guarantee the user will be unaffected by their use.
The time has come to re-examine entirely the use of chemicals that are known or suspected to be harmful.
In Sweden and Japan the use of formaldehyde is completely banned because it is claimed to be carcinogenic.
However, in the EU it is commonly used as a preservative in "family" hair shampoos.
Not only is it not banned in the rest of Europe, but we are not even told it is present in the products we buy.
In addition to banning certain ingredients, there should be better labelling of cosmetics and toiletries so that the consumer can make an informed choice.
We wish to expand on our reasons for supporting the key principles of the Roth-Berendt report today.
We believe it does a singular service by demonstrating to the Commission and the Member States the scale of public exasperation at the delays in phasing out live animal testing for cosmetic products.
We are sure the Member States will note the emphatic majority expressed here.
It is a vote to ban animal-tested products where alternative tests exist, to phase out animal tests over a 4-year period and to phase in a marketing ban in an agreed period thereafter.
We hope the industry in general will heed these proposals.
Some of its leading practitioners already have.
We understand that, of the principal tests, roughly one-third can now be done by alternative methods, one-third are modified and one-third await effective resolution.
We believe our proposal will speed up the necessary research, if it is taken seriously.
The industry has everything to gain from using its considerable resources to advance alternative testing, and not for expensive campaigns of procrastination.
Similarly, its products will gain and not lose by being accurately labelled, so that the public is warned of possible allergens.
We are convinced that today's vote is, in the long run, good for the health and profitability of the European cosmetics industry, as well as the public it serves.
For centuries, many people considered animals to be objects that existed for their benefit, which they were allowed to hurt or abuse, there to provide for our comfort, to pull our carriages and ploughs, to supply our food and for us to experiment on.
We have now become slightly more civilised and animal-friendly, except if there is money to be made.
In Europe, 38 000 animals are used annually for testing new substances and end products of the cosmetics industry, after which they are systematically slaughtered.
As long ago as 1993, this Parliament decided to institute a sales ban on cosmetics tested on animals, but the introduction of this ban has been continually postponed under pressure from the industry.
The European Commission now wishes to tone down this sales ban and establish a ban on tests within the EU countries, as a result of which products will continue to be allowed on the market here which have been tested on animals elsewhere.
If that is the case, the tests will be transferred to other countries.
This begs the question whether there are really no standards other than the lowest possible production costs, free trade and WTO rules?
The downside of these are bad working conditions, low salaries, further destruction of the environment and an increase in animal suffering.
It is high time that the European market closed its doors to the import of all products obtained in an unacceptable manner.
I have based my vote on the recommendations of the "Eurogroup for Animal Welfare" .
Haug report (A5-0101/2001):
Madam President, in reply to Mrs McKenna's remarks, I would like to say that there are over 600 of us here, each of us different, over 600 brains, each of them different, and that I am never more serious than when I am joking and never more light-hearted than when I am serious.
Having said that, in relation to the Haug report, which I voted for, I have to say that the European Union needs greater financial resources.
The budget itself, as it stands, is too small.
The Member States must decide whether they want Europe or not, and if they want Europe and consider it useful, they must furnish it with the necessary means for it to run smoothly and properly.
Katiforis report (A5-0106/2001):
Madam President, I voted for Mr Katiforis' excellent, important report on the Commission's communication updating the directive on investment services.
My feeling is that we should continue with the Community regulation of the circulation of our currency and of the financial investment services until we succeed in establishing a single European Stock Exchange.
I know that such a Stock Exchange does not exist at present, but we have the European currency, the European flag and the European Parliament: we are already proceeding in that direction. Let us endeavour to create a European Stock Exchange as well.
It would certainly be greater than the New York Stock Exchange.
Kauppi report (A5-0105/2001):
Madam President, on this European Stock Exchange which I hope to see established - and I regret that Mrs Kauppi's report, which I voted in favour of, does not contain this proposal - I would also like to see European public pension funds quoted as well.
It would be important for those who work to see that the contributions that they pay, in the hope that they will be able to recoup them later on when they are elderly and live on their pensions without having to work, are contributions and funds which are invested well, invested in a European Stock Exchange which will generate a much better, much larger European pension than national pensions would be.
The June movement will not vote for rules which enable officials to legislate instead of elected representatives in open assemblies whose work can be monitored.
Sacconi report (A5-0092/2001):
Madam President, I voted against the Sacconi report on the environmental problems of PVC, which are therefore problems that also relate to differentiated waste collection as well.
I would like, if I may, to relate in this important parliamentary Chamber the suggestions of some pensioners of Bergamo, who were aware that we were due to deal with this important issue of differentiated waste collection.
They said to me: "If they double my pension, even though I am a pensioner, I will personally go round all the houses in all the villages around Bergamo to collect all the differentiated waste, including waste containing PVC and any other types of waste.
I will willingly contribute to this recycling on condition that my pension is increased".
Well then, I am putting these proposals to the House.
Madam President, the way in which this Parliament has passed its verdict on the PVC report fills me with great sadness.
Why am I sad?
Because the House has displayed little professional expertise in its voting behaviour.
Allow me to quote a few examples.
The first example is the banning of PVC in buildings.
Madam President, if PVC had been used in Dusseldorf airport, for example, the fire would not have been as fierce.
The claims made here are therefore nonsense.
The same applies to a number of observations regarding incineration.
It is not PVC, but particularly vegetable, fruit and garden waste which is generating the chlorine compounds.
What disappointed me greatly, is that the area where legislation could be put in place easily and promptly by means of self-regulation - the industry is keen on that - is the area which the majority of this Parliament voted against, especially the liberal group, where I had most certainly hoped to find supporters.
The outcome is disappointing, and I am holding on to what the Commission said yesterday, namely that it will not introduce further legislation, but only present a communication.
For the best part of the history of mankind, we have had to make our tools from wood, metal and stone.
The invention of plastics and the development of a chemical industry appeared to offer unknown opportunities for a long time.
We now know that all kinds of new substances which were valued by everyone initially, such as asbestos and polyvinyl chloride, are harmful.
The negative effects are not apparent until afterwards.
After a certain length of time, PVCs release chlorine, as well as phthalates or other plasticisers and, if stabilisers are used, lead or cadmium.
Toxins are released as early as at the production stage and also when substances are added.
When PVC is reused, toxic substances are released again and, for the time being, a qualitatively inferior product is made.
Chlorine and dioxins are released during incineration.
Consequently, the dumping of PVC waste seems to be the only solution, but polluting substances are released even then.
Both the European Commission and the rapporteur adopt the voluntary commitments with industry in order to curb the drawbacks.
For the time being, an import ban on PVC of a quality which does not meet these voluntary commitments is considered too bold, because it could contravene WTO rules.
The rapporteur is right to press for the reduction in the use of PVC and for more research into alternatives.
I support him in this view, but believe that these proposals are inadequate to actually solve the problem.
Costa Neves report (A5-0102/2001):
I voted against the Costa Neves report on the Commission's 2002 budget lines.
Madam President, I should be very pleased if the European Commission were given more money for its budget.
In the eyes of Mr Fatuzzo, however, what should the Commission do with this extra money that I hope to see made available in 2002?
I would like to see a new Directorate created, for the sole purpose of looking into and implementing ways of improving the living conditions of elderly people and pensioners throughout Europe and the States which will soon be joining the European Union.
There is a great deal to do, to propose and to achieve in Europe, particularly in terms of hospital and home medical treatments for elderly people, particularly elderly people who are not self-sufficient.
In our view, the reports on the main guidelines for the 2002 budget of the European institutions seem to be incomplete, or vague, in three main areas.
Firstly, agriculture.
Additional agricultural expenditure will be necessary, as a result of the BSE crisis, which will be substantial; however we quite rightly do not wish to revise the whole financial perspective adopted in 1999.
How can we reconcile these two requirements?
According to the reports, we would have to do our best to find the money through an internal readjustment of heading 1 (agriculture), which, in our view, is impossible in light of the commitments that have been given.
As we already stated during the recent debate in this House on the revision of the 2001 budget, we hope that a greater contribution to heading 2 (structural operations) might be considered.
Secondly, enlargement.
The 2002 budget guidelines seem too sketchy on the cost of enlargement.
The implications for agriculture or for the Structural Funds have not yet been determined, but will become clear in time.
On the other hand, we must now start to consider the financial consequences for the operations of the European institutions.
They should form part of a multiannual plan building up to enlargement, beginning in 2002.
The third area is the Treaty of Nice.
Political statements have been made in various quarters, claiming that the Treaty of Nice should be ratified by all Member States at the end of 2001.
Furthermore, the ECSC protocol, as an annex to the Treaty, is due to come into force in July 2002.
We are dubious as to whether this timetable will be respected, but since this commitment seems to have been made, the 2002 budget guidelines should at least contain an estimate of how much the new provisions of this Treaty will cost.
Yet, this is missing.
This expenditure is, however, likely to be substantial, whether it involves, for example, a unified statute for MEPs, funding of the so-called 'European political parties' from the Community budget, or even this very budget assuming the administrative costs of the rapid action force, pursuant to Article 28(2) of the EU Treaty.
As usual, we are going to make Member States ratify the new provisions, the cost of which we are trying hard to conceal.
We voted against the budget guidelines proposed in this report and in the following reports, since this is a budget that is entirely geared towards satisfying financial groups, industrial and agricultural lobbies and, incidentally, is designed to fund a foreign policy that the big investors in Europe deem to be in its interests.
Each Member State of the European Union is cutting the redistributed share of its expenditure in their budgets by sacrificing public services, hospitals, education, transport and by drastically limiting social expenditure so as to generate greater profits for large companies.
The European Union' s budget, using subsidiarity as a pretext, is pushing this tendency even further by cutting social expenditure to a negligible level.
This is one of the ways in which it is showing its refusal to work towards a levelling upwards of social protection and benefits and salaries throughout the European Union.
Since the funding of both Member States and the European Union is inextricably linked, we once again express our opposition to every type of budget revenue that primarily affects the working classes, such as tax on spending, such as VAT, etc., and our opposition to all expenditure that benefits large companies and the rich, such as subsidies, grants and tax breaks.
In line with the changes to the financial perspective, the 2002 budget will not exceed 1.1% of the Community GNP, which means that we will be able to stipulate a non-growth budget for the coming year.
As a matter of fact, the rapporteur has accepted this approach, to the extent that he sets the implementation and the quality of expenditure as major priorities for the coming year. This would relegate to the status of footnote issues such as employment and social issues or the budgetary effects of enlargement and the introduction of the euro.
Food safety is mentioned, in the light of the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease, and the report argues for a long-term strategy, but there is no assessment of the costs of these crises to spending on agriculture. Nor are any measures included for compensation to farmers, as we suggested there should be in our proposal to create a special reserve for BSE-related issues, and nor does the report provide for the essential adjustment and setting of upper limits for issues relating to CAP aid.
In the meantime, I feel that the rebudgeting of the Structural Funds should be carried out as a matter of urgency, in order to ensure that the sums budgeted for are properly applied.
As a matter of fact, I would point out that, in this context, we refused to undermine our post-2001 spending objectives in Agenda 2000.
Lastly, I think that it is of particular concern that, in his report, the rapporteur explicitly regrets the fact that decisions on the financial regulations will only be taken by qualified majority from 2007 onwards, 'forgetting' the fact that otherwise, the country would then be losing a fundamental instrument - unanimity - for setting the next financial framework, including the part concerned with the Structural Funds and the cohesion fund.
Paragraph 25 of the Resolution, concerning e-learning, calls upon the Commission to 'explore the possibilities of providing an adequate legal framework to complement the action taken by the Member States and to enhance it with a real European added value' .
I have voted against this request on the basis of the Swedish Christian Democrats' view of, and concern about, the principle of subsidiarity established in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, since it cannot be the European Union' s responsibility to legislate on issues concerning education, in this case e-learning.
Justifying this request for increased legislative powers for the EU in terms of 'European added value' is a traditional way of trying to gain understanding for the transfer of further power and legislative responsibilities to the EU and for a trend towards centralisation.
Nonetheless, this is an argument that does not hold water.
Instead, the EU' s task is to limit its responsibilities and to focus upon its core areas of concern.
Buitenweg report (A5-0103/2001):
Madam President, I also voted for the Buitenweg report on the European Parliament's estimates, also in relation to the 2002 budget, on the different areas of activity of Parliament and its bodies.
I voted for this report, but, I was thinking of something which is always on my mind when I am in Parliament, particularly when I hear some veiled criticism here and there - although very infrequently if the truth be known - that I might be wasting Parliament's time with my explanations of vote.
I am thinking of all those debates and votes which we hold - and which you direct so well, Madam President - on opinions, statements and Commission proposals, that is to say on all non-legislative measures.
In my opinion, we should decide to leave these debates of minor legal importance to the Parliamentary committees rather than holding them in the Parliamentary part-sessions.
During the debate on the 2002 budget guidelines, we heard some speakers welcome the fact that the steps to introduce the single currency would be of little cost to the European budget.
In our view, this comment seems somewhat cynical, since a relatively large part of the costs will be paid by small traders, who will reap hardly any of the benefits and who have no one to come to their rescue.
Many other small businesses are in the same situation.
On the other hand, large businesses based in Europe will reap the benefits, directly or indirectly, from the changeover to the single currency and thus will be able to offset the costs of reorganisation and investment that are involved.
What about the others though?
This particular view - but many others of a similar nature can be found - shows how much consideration has been given from the outset to resolving some of the problems facing large companies, but not those facing small businesses.
That is why, in our view, the European Union - or the Member States by delegation - must provide immediate financial support, at least to small traders, as a matter of urgency.
It is not acceptable for Member States and the European institutions to take decisions involving huge costs that others have to bear.
Lastly, the actual changeover to the euro, with the introduction of coins and notes, is at risk of being hampered by the very people who decided that it would go ahead.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Discharges (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on six reports on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge.
, Commission.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget process for any given budget year starts with priority setting, and this morning we debated the priorities for the 2002 budget. The conclusion of the budget process is the discharge granted by the European Parliament, which we have been debating today in respect of the 1999 budget.
The discharge decision is a vital moment for the Commission and Parliament, as Parliament's democratic control functions come into full play at this point.
This control extends to many areas, as the EU budget is very substantial - it amounted to EUR 84 billion in 1999 - and above all it covers a wide variety of activities, ranging from support for olive oil, nuts and school milk to student exchanges; from the development of petrol-saving cars to space research or information on the euro, from support for educating women in Africa to the restructuring of the fishing fleet or to food aid after an earthquake or after a civil war.
In view of this wide range, which I have just listed by way of example, control of the budget process covers nearly all the Commission's activities.
Mr Blak, the general rapporteur for the budget discharge, adopted exactly this approach to the wide-ranging control of a broad spectrum of policy areas in respect of which public money is spent.
This was hard work for everyone concerned.
This is demonstrated by the detailed questionnaires, but also and above all by the report before us.
Mr Blak, you have a reputation for being a very harsh critic of mismanagement.
Having worked with you over these past months, I can really confirm that and bear witness that you have lived up to your reputation.
At the same time, I would like to thank you for the balance and fairness of your report and for the clear approach that you adopted in it. The aim of that approach was to highlight both good and bad features in all areas, and to insist through your decisions and evaluations on achieving an improvement in Community policy.
The Commission will be taking measures in response to your most important findings.
As all good chefs know, the key to culinary success is to cook the right ingredients at the right temperature.
The committee has devoted many hours of meetings to the discharge process, and above all it has held various hearings with the Commissioners responsible.
I would also like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you for the excellent cooperation and work in the committee, and to extend those thanks to the chair of the committee, Mrs Theato.
The basis for the annual discharge procedure is the Court of Auditors' annual report.
For 1999, the Court gave the Commission a positive Statement of Assurance on the revenue side, for commitment appropriations and for administrative expenditure, but not for other payment transactions, as has also been the case in previous years.
The committee and the rapporteur have not only relied on the professional work of the Court for their reports, but also on material provided by the Commission, and on detailed replies, on several extensive questionnaires and on a summary of a great many audit reports and on the audit reports themselves.
The rapporteur, Mr Blak, examined over 60 of the documents provided by the Commission, running to several thousand pages.
One of the key documents for the whole discharge procedure is the Commission's discharge action plan.
In this document the Commission presents the precise measures it is taking in order to respond to the Court of Auditors' criticisms.
These are not vague promises - the plan specifies in precise terms what is to be done and when.
The same applies to the follow-up report - 48 pages in all - to the European Parliament's discharge decision for the 1998 budget.
This report gives a detailed response to the requests made in Mrs Stauner's report from last year.
Follow-up actions to this are presented such that they can be verified.
In order to implement the action plan for the European Development Fund the Commission last year undertook the necessary work in conjunction with Parliament.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs RÃŒhle, for her work and for making it clear that the discharge for the European Development Fund has not been rejected, but postponed.
The proposal to postpone the discharge is, of course, still a matter of regret for the Commission, because it unilaterally decided to considerably extend inquiries into macroeconomic aid in Africa, for example, in order to get to the bottom of some problems in that area.
Mrs RÃŒhle has recognised that these are steps in the right direction.
I can safely say that overall the administration of European Development Fund money is by no means worse than the administration of development aid from the EU budget.
But I can in any case assure the Mrs RÃŒhle as rapporteur that the Commission will make good use of this time to complete the outstanding documents without delay and to take the necessary steps here.
I would also like to thank two other rapporteurs, Mrs van der Laan and Mr SeppÃ€nen.
Although the ECSC Treaty expires next year, the relevant research activity will continue.
The audit findings here are also very important.
My personal objective and the Commission's objective is to improve financial management, to reduce fraud, to avoid errors, be they purely formal errors or errors with budgetary implications, and also to improve efficiency and ensure that public funds are used more effectively.
These are very important objectives which require a joint effort to achieve.
I have in mind above all the joint efforts of the Commission and the Member States, as 83% of the funds under the EU budget are administered by the Member States.
The primary duty of control falls to them.
We have also had detailed discussions in the Ecofin Council on these duties for the Member States.
However, I still cannot say that I am entirely satisfied with the Member States' responses to the Court of Auditors' report, but at least more detailed information is now available about what the Member States have done in recent years to combat fraud.
Some of the areas of Community policy implemented by the Member States are, as we all know, also very much prone to fraud.
One such area that I would like to mention here is that of agricultural export refunds.
In this area, it is necessary to continuously check not only the procedures themselves, but also the control mechanisms.
I say this because the control systems are not only weaker the further south you travel - which is a common perception - but also, in some regions which claim to have Prussian efficiency, there is in fact a somewhat laissez-faire approach to control systems.
In this case, the Commission relies not only on it own audits but it can also hit Member States' purses, by which I mean the use of financial sanctions by reducing payments to Member States.
This sometimes - relatively often even - leads to protracted disputes and sometimes actual litigation.
But I do not believe that that financial sanctions are discredited because of this, that is just how things are in a state bound by the rule of law.
However, what is important is that the Commission should also use legal means to secure its position.
Export refunds are also an example of the fact that the legal bases are sometimes so detailed and specific that they can almost act as an incentive to fraudulent behaviour.
For that reason it has also been agreed, under the administrative reform, that proposals for regulations put forward by the Commission should in future be scrutinised with regard to their susceptibility to fraud.
In this respect I would also like to request extra cooperation from Parliament in its legislative role and special support from the Committee on Budgets, because stricter control procedures are not always welcomed with open arms by the relevant specialist committees or even the countries affected.
Cooperation with the legislature is absolutely essential for good financial management.
Let me mention a very topical example of this: the Council recently decided in Stockholm - and this is actually supposed to be something positive, at least in the Council's eyes - that the Sixth Framework Programme on Research would be adopted in July 2002 but actually start as early as 1 January 2003.
However, that simply does not allow enough time to properly carry out the tendering process and the preparatory work.
If this timetable is not changed, we will quite consciously be embarking on a course leading to the kind of errors that the Court of Auditors and above all Parliament criticised with the last Framework Programme. I believe that we should not let history repeat itself.
We must learn from our mistakes.
The "FlÃ©chard case" started with the export of surplus intervention butter as aid to the former Soviet Union.
The decisions concerned were made by the previous Commission between 1991 and 1994.
Parliament investigated this case very thoroughly.
The Court of Auditors analysed this case in detail and UCLAF and OLAF carried out various investigations. The present Commission has also examined the case from all angles and it has made all the information in its possession available to you as discharge authority.
We all agree that it is not possible to undo what was done at that time.
That is why you as discharge authority are justified in asking what would happen now if a similar case arose.
Many of the arrangements have changed since 1994.
The regulation on the clearance of accounts procedure in the field of agricultural policy has been amended, and the division responsible for clearance of accounts in the relevant Directorate-General has been organisationally separated.
In 1995 the regulation on the protection of the Community's financial interests, the "black list", was introduced, which the Member States are supposed to use to list companies who have shown gross negligence or have deliberately acted against the financial interests of the EU.
Mr Blak is pressing here for an improvement in the procedure for drawing up this black list.
I can assure you that we are already working on this.
OLAF would then become the Community's independent investigatory authority, an important step.
As regards the future, not only have important changes been initiated through administrative reform, the new version of the Financial Regulation will provide a clearer framework, especially for the recovery of payments.
This means that the recovery of payments can only be waived in part or in full if the Director-General responsible so decides, and in particular the decision to forego recovery must be justified.
In case of doubt the Commission must decide.
During the debates the Commission has also given Parliament an assurance that it will base the application of the administrative and legal principle of proportionality on clear, solid and transparent guidelines.
That was the long answer to the question "Would the Commission handle a similar case in exactly the same way now?"
The short answer is "No!"
It would take a different approach in comparable cases today.
The clear objective of the administrative reform of the Commission is to improve financial management.
That is why the control functions of the individual Directorate-Generals have been beefed up, and why the Internal Audit Service has been strengthened, and that is why a central financial service has been created, the early warning system reinforced, and the recovery arrangements tightened up.
We are improving the implementation of programmes of expenditure and we are building up the network of controls, and will not hesitate to impose financial sanctions.
The 10-point black list in the report on reform will help us to take these further steps.
I can assure you on behalf of the Commission that a decision by Parliament to grant a budget discharge within the specified time will act as a great incentive for the Commission to implement the reforms and persevere in its efforts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has pointed out, this budget covers a broad spectrum of activities.
This broad spectrum of European funding tasks also includes foreign policy.
Europe is a major player on the foreign policy stage, especially in non-military crisis management, and the Committee knows that different problems arise with these budget headings than with funds administered within the European Union by the Member States.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs has therefore made it a priority to ensure that the decisions adopted by this House are also implemented.
It is unacceptable that year after year, billions of euro are not spent because the services, the cooperation with the Directorate-General, do not function effectively.
That is our criticism of this budgetary procedure.
There has been restructuring within the new Commission.
Europe Aid has been launched, and we expect that as a result, the programmes agreed by Parliament will be implemented more speedily in future.
But at the same time, we expect the Commission to refrain from setting up its own new implementing organisation and to draw instead on Member States' competencies, as they should be playing an active role in this area as well.
We want the political management of all these problems to be undertaken in Europe, but we also want the allocated funds to be drawn down.
In a year's time, we will measure your success in terms of what you have done with the many additional posts which have been created. So this issue will undoubtedly arise once again during the next budgetary procedure, including the discharge procedure.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would firstly like to express our admiration for Mr Blak' s outstanding and remarkable work and particularly because he has duly taken into account the work of the rapporteurs of the specialist committees.
In the justice and home affairs sector, Mr Blak' s report quite rightly focuses on three issues, as we ourselves have done in our opinion.
Firstly, the obvious poor management of some of the budget lines, where the rate of implementation of appropriations is below 50%.
Secondly, the need for the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia to update its techniques and to enforce stricter management. Thirdly, the need to understand what really is happening with the European Union Migrants' Forum - is it just downright negligence, is it basically poor management or is it fraud, pure and simple?
These three issues must be closely followed up by our committee and by Parliament.
We shall ensure that this happens.
. Mr President, I speak on behalf of our rapporteur, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, who is unable to be here today.
The committee took a common approach in its opinion on the need to improve the quality of action and performance as a way of achieving better value for taxpayers' money.
For example, we wish to remind the Commission of the need to achieve higher standards in auditing the research programmes, particularly in the context of the European research area proposals.
We also look to the Commission to improve the management of contracts by the Joint Research Centre. This is a theme continued from the past.
We are looking for improvement in the management of TACIS and other programmes in the field of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe.
We put forward the suggestion of creating a separate budget line for strengthening cooperation on nuclear safety in northern parts of Europe.
We observe that the SYNERGY programme seems to have lost some of its priority in the Commission and we wish to see this programme continued successfully.
We want more spending on SYNERGY.
I turn now to the other report on the coal and steel part of the budget.
The committee is very keen on seeing maximum transparency in the disclosure of data concerning the value of the ECSC's assets.
We note the Commission's undertaking on the provision of information about these assets and expect this information to be delivered.
Mr President, culture is certainly not a high priority for Parliament or the Commission.
We are very fortunate to get something like half of 1% of the budget and I only get one minute to present our concerns.
It is tremendously important that the very little amount of money we have should be spent efficiently and effectively.
Fortunately we tend not to suffer from the allegations of fraud and mismanagement that one sees elsewhere but we do have a problem about the very worthy organisations that want support from Parliament actually receiving the money.
Just to give three examples for the 1999 financial year we are looking at: the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation only received their grant from the European Commission in the last days of the year.
This causes real problems for those organisations.
We accepted it for 1999, but I hope it will not recur in the year 2000.
I would say to the Commissioner: please ensure that if we are going to give money, we do it efficiently and effectively so that it does good rather than damage to the European cause.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has focussed its work on the discharge on the single most important point of whether the Commission is achieving its stated aim of using the development assistance budget to combat poverty by shifting significant additional resources to the provision of basic health and education in developing countries.
I am sad to report that the figures for 1999 show that this was the first year ever when the least developed countries received under 50% of overseas development aid administered by the Commission.
This is a trend we desperately need to reverse.
As Mr Blak's resolution states in paragraph 8, point 19 - and I thank him for this - when 880 million people world-wide lack any access to health services, just 1% of the Commission's external assistance budget went to health in 1999 and we do not have any figures at all for education.
Is this a discharge issue?
Yes, quite clearly, when the Community Action Plan in response to our parliamentary resolution on the 1998 discharge said: "Since health and education will receive more emphasis, the implication is that a greater amount of financing than in the past would be dedicated to these sectors."
It goes on to say, "Adopting OECD standards on reporting should be feasible by 2001."
Mrs Schreyer, we insist that the Commission must fulfil these promises.
Your so-called reservation against the output targets properly voted by Parliament precisely to increase spending on basic health and education is contrary to the agreed budget.
Whatever happens this year, you cannot expect discharge for 2001 unless they are fulfilled.
On the essential reporting needed, using the OECD Development Assistance Committee methodology to enable us to achieve this poverty focus, we have more concern over whether this is achieved for Asia and Latin America as against our aid for the ACP countries.
That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation did not vote to postpone discharge for the European Development Fund.
We did not want to send the wrong signal against the strong support we wish to demonstrate for the reform process.
But if discharge is postponed, I thank Mrs RÃŒhle for her insistence that the latest figures using the DAC methodology are brought forward by May.
This will ensure that the poorest people actually receive the aid.
I defy anyone to disagree with that.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities considers that the implementation results of the budget-lines covering the promotion of equal opportunities between men and women were in general satisfactory.
However, we have no line for the horizontal policy of gender mainstreaming, i.e. incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities.
We therefore call upon you to continue to give high priority to this policy area and invite you to carry out a gender impact assessment of expenditure, especially as regards the Structural Funds, the research programme, and all investments in the information society.
I think it is important for us to obtain precise data on how the resource outflows are taking place, and so the Committee on Women's Rights calls upon the Court of Auditors to produce a special report on the financial implementation of gender mainstreaming.
This was done once before, in 1998, and the policy measures were clearly defined in the report.
This would enable us to target our policies more strongly on this area.
Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy effectively does not have much supervision over large parts of the budget.
However, over those lines that we do have supervision we express our concerns and have done so in the past.
I am pleased that as a result of our concerns about the LIFE programme the monies that are dispensed through the LIFE programme, both within the Union and externally, are going to be examined by the Court of Auditors.
I understand the Court of Auditors is looking at this budget line for this year and on that basis we would be happy, despite our reservations, to grant discharge or to recommend the granting of discharge.
Regarding the other lines, we do not have many concerns about the consumer lines where we see that the work is going on quite effectively, but I would draw the attention of the House and the Commission to the health programme and the health budget lines.
Although that programme is currently under review and is due to be reorganised, we felt when we examined it last year that there were a great number of small projects without a great deal of clarity or order to them.
Whilst we expressed some concerns about this, we are prepared to support the idea of discharge on the basis that the new head of the DG for Health will investigate these issues and bring forward a report to the House.
Mr President, I welcome the various reports, the Blak, Stauner, Folias, SeppÃ€nen, van der Laan and RÃŒhle reports, because I know so much work went into them.
I want to restrict my comments to Freddy Blak's excellent report on the Commission discharge for 1999.
1999 - what a year that was.
Not only was it the first year that I was elected - and hold back your cheers now - but in budgetary control terms it was fascinating.
It was the year of three types of Commission: two months of the old Commission that had a number of problems that we all know about; six months of no Commission whatsoever because they were not taking any management decisions; and then the rest of the year was with the new Commission who had no time to implement any of the reforms.
1999 - another year with an error rate of about 5% or roughly EUR 4.5 billion. 1999 - the sixth year running that the Court of Auditors refused to write off the accounts.
1999 - the year in which Freddy Blak found huge errors, fraud and problems in the accounts, scandals all of them including, for example, the wonderful Washington delegation that warranted a whole two paragraphs in the report.
I believe the Commissioner will be able to confirm that the building was bought for USD 0.5 million, refurbished to the tune of USD 2.2 million - that is four times what it was bought for - whilst renting somewhere else for about USD 18 000 per month which was cheaper than where the Commission's residence was beforehand because I believe it was in the Four Seasons Hotel.
There were other problems with IRELA, flax and FlÃ©chard, too, and all we have to do in this House is look at our previous reports.
We have consistently said that if the error rate does not improve in the 1999 year, then we could not and should not pass these accounts.
The error rate quite simply did not improve.
I checked with the Court of Auditors and they confirmed that the error rate was the same or marginally worse.
What conclusions should we draw from this?
It is fairly obvious: the error rate did not improve; EUR 4.5 billion lost, unaccounted for, mismanaged; we do not give discharge.
I hear that the Socialists and other Groups are actually thinking of granting discharge and I cannot think why.
How on earth are we going to explain that back home?
Please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this Commission to fall.
You simply will not.
There is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen.
1999 is not the year for which this Commission is responsible.
What you will be doing, however, is sending a message to this Commission and the public who elected us here - you remember them, some of them actually bother to visit us occasionally - that we are steadfastly against waste, fraud and mismanagement; that we are drawing a line in the sand, that what went before 1999 was completely unacceptable and what happens now and in the future must be better.
Commissioner, I would appreciate your answer on the Washington delegation because it is very odd that we do not get to see a number of these facts until we actually ask for them.
I also ask you to promise us that the error rate will improve.
Mr President, by my reckoning Mr Heaton-Harris's speech contained an error rate of about 50% and I hope he manages to bring it down in time for next year's debate on the discharge.
- Mr President, I endorse the proposal to grant discharge to the Commission for three reasons.
Firstly, things have improved.
Both the Court of Auditors and Parliament have been able to establish that.
The first results of the Commission reforms are now visible, especially in the field of financial management and control.
Secondly, the Commission has carried out some sterling work.
There has been effective consultation between the different rapporteurs and the Commission.
The Commission has taken us seriously.
As far as I am concerned, there is a break in the trend compared to the previous Commission, which did not take the discharge process and this Parliament sufficiently seriously.
Thirdly, I think that we should deploy the discharge tool, which this Parliament has at its disposal, selectively.
Instead of wielding the axe, as is sometimes referred to in this Parliament, we should use Mr Blak' s surgical filleting knife, which will yield us more results.
I would, however, like to draw your attention to a number of aspects.
Firstly, financial supervision will soon be divorced from internal audit within the European Commission.
This Parliament will be voting on this on Thursday.
It is one of the most important recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men have made.
It is also the first reform which is being enshrined in legislation.
This reform does not only apply to the European Commission, but also to the Council and Parliament.
I notice that the Secretary-General is present today, and I would call on him too to implement this reform in Parliament itself at the earliest opportunity.
The other institutions should take a long and hard look at this too.
Secondly, we need to further refine and further politicise the discharge instrument.
The DAS, the Statement of Assurance, must be improved.
We need to focus more on the different sectors so as to be able to draw a distinction between the different areas of policy.
We must single out Member States if they make mistakes - we will hopefully do this also by means of an amendment to Mr Blak' s report - and we should not only look at figures, but also at the quality of policy.
Mrs Van der Laan is right to make the first move in this connection in her report on other institutions, which I, by the way, congratulate on their policy.
We will postpone the discharge for the Economic and Social Committee, but I have a feeling that this will be granted soon.
Thirdly, officials who make mistakes within the Commission and within the other institutions must be disciplined if these mistakes involve financial problems.
We call for a committee on financial irregularities to be set up which can deal with this kind of matter and can make referrals to the disciplinary procedure.
Finally - and I would echo the opinion which Mrs Van der Laan expressed this morning in the debate - it is necessary for us to call the Council to account now.
The budget of the Council is taking on ever increasing proportions.
In areas such as justice, home affairs and foreign affairs, the Council has more or less exclusive rights.
It is no longer acceptable that in this discharge procedure, in which we not only verify the figures but also the quality of policy, the Council' s increasing budget is still not subject to proper democratic control.
Mr President, every year, the discharge is the highlight of the year in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I wish all rapporteurs every success in their work, and Mr Blak, in particular, who will probably ensure, for the first time in many years, that the Commission will be granted discharge on time.
I hope I can congratulate him on that tomorrow. In fact, I also hope that he has enjoyed reading the answers to his questions.
They turned out to be rather lengthy, and got the better of me at times.
The hallmark of this budget is the fact that the Statement of Assurance is still not positive.
This has to become positive, and Parliament must also be able to judge whether any progress is being made in that respect.
We as a group support every effort to secure this Statement of Assurance and we believe that it should be extended to include every sector, or maybe to include every Directorate-General.
I would like to make a few general points.
The figures which we are familiar with show that agriculture is in a considerably better position than the other sections of the budget.
That is very positive.
Compared to the other sectors, agriculture can afford to present the margin of error of 3%, although this is probably still far too high.
The Commission must apply this as soon as possible to the other sections of the policy, and other Commissioners must follow Mr Fischler' s lead.
I would like to comment on the superlevy in agriculture.
We all know the system of milk quota.
All farmers in Europe pay extra if they produce too much milk.
There is one country which forms an exception to this rule, namely Italy.
The Italian government pays the levy on behalf of the farmers.
Is this not a case of distortion of competition?
Should the Commission not do something about this promptly?
I am pleased with the Commissioner' s reply further to the FlÃ©chard affair.
Although we do not have all the facts of what happened between 1991-1994, there is every reason to believe that it was unacceptable.
We are pleased with the fact that the present Commission has dissociated itself from this and that it is submitting proposals as soon as possible, which pertain, among other things, to the way in which the proportionality principle can be applied.
What is the responsibility of the officials in this respect?
When should it be assessed by the Commission or Commissioner himself, etc.?
What are the exact procedures to be followed in those cases?
There are still many ambiguities surrounding flax.
What will be important for this Parliament is the question as to what will ultimately be the financial correction which the Commission will apply to the countries which are involved in this.
This will probably not only affect Spain.
My conclusion on behalf of the group is that we will be granting discharge.
We are aware that this is the last year for which the Commission can say that it was not responsible.
The real test for the current Commission will come with the examination of the accounts for 2000.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to concentrate on Mr Blak' s excellent report.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has worked very hard for the past four months, and held meetings in quick succession.
We are inclined to grant the Commission discharge for the 1999 budget.
Does this mean that everything is smelling of roses, or that nothing is going wrong?
No.
After all, the Court of Auditors is refusing to guarantee that the payments were, generally speaking, legitimate and regular.
Commissioner, we are extremely dissatisfied with this state of affairs.
We would therefore ask you to ensure that you will receive from the Court of Auditors a positive Statement of Assurance by no later than 2003.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should still be mindful of the fact that the Member States are responsible for more than 80% of all expenditure.
I would once again like to lodge a complaint against the Council for its absence, and against the Economic and Financial Affairs Council for the nonchalance which it is displaying in dealing with the discharge.
This is shoddy work and cannot be taken seriously.
The Member States are still insufficiently aware of the fraud issue.
I therefore urge the Irish, Luxembourg and Belgian parliaments to ratify the anti-fraud agreement, which was concluded in 1995, without delay.
I myself am starting a campaign today to convince my national counterparts to ratify this agreement in Belgium before July of this year.
As far as I am concerned, this is absolutely crucial if the Belgian Presidency is to build up any credibility with regard to anti-fraud policy.
The Blak report contains many positive statements with regard to the Commission.
As permanent rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, I can bear witness to the excellent work of our delegation in Sarajevo.
But we should also turn our attention to a few of the less attractive issues: the flax case, the latest developments of which, it is true, we are not yet fully conversant with, the mafia case involving adulterated butter, and, indeed, the FlÃ©chard case.
Commissioner, you were right in saying that we have spent a generous amount of time on this issue.
There is indeed something peculiar about it, and I have listened very carefully to your statement and pledges in this connection.
With an unqualified 'no' , you have told us that this will not happen in future.
You promised a solid basis for the application of the principle of proportionality.
You also promised to change tack as regards debt collection.
As far as my group is concerned, you herewith comply with the conditions contained in Paragraph 8, I d) of the Blak resolution, and I can inform you, on behalf of my group, that we will be granting you discharge.
Mr President, the Court of Auditors has not recommended that discharge be granted to the Commission for 1999, just as it did not for previous years either.
When Mr Santer' s Commission had to resign in connection with the debate on discharge in 1997, despite the support of the Social Democrat group, the GUE/NGL Group was consistently in favour of resignation.
There were too many irregularities and the administrative culture it represented was a spurious one.
The situation in 1999 was different.
Responsibility was unevenly divided between Mr Santer' s Commission that had resigned and the new Commission.
It was hard to say which of them was responsible for what.
Now it is harder to come up with detailed arguments as to why discharge should not be granted.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has not uncovered any instances of malpractice or unclear areas that are so major that they cannot be left until the discharge debate for 2000.
When deciding on discharge for 2000 it is known that the present Commission is responsible for everything, including those matters that were not brought to a conclusion for 1999.
The majority of our group on this occasion is in favour of granting the Commission discharge.
With regard to Parliament' s own discharge, attention should be paid to those abuses that the political groups were guilty of in connection with financing the Europarties.
These have been spoken of with unwarranted sensitivity.
I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Stauner: a framework agreement with regard to the supply of information from the Commission is not enough.
We now have to take stock of the experience we have gained and return to the matter in association with discharge for 2000.
Mr President, we carefully considered what position we would adopt on the discharge for 1999.
This is a year when the present Commission was only able to influence the final quarter of the year and so cannot be held responsible for a very great deal.
The reason why we decided to vote against the discharge was because, in 1999 too, there were so many instances of citizens' money being mismanaged that it would have been wrong to give the seal of approval constituted by the discharge.
I do not have enough speaking time to mention all the scandals but would refer to my good colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, and my other capable colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control who mentioned a number of the problems with which we have been confronted.
My good colleague, Freddy Blak, has written an excellent report, and I really only disagree with him about the actual conclusion, namely that discharge should be given.
Mr Blak has made a great effort to find answers to quite a few questions.
The more harmless questions have been answered, but the evasive or inadequate answers to other questions are unacceptable.
We are still waiting for a clear indication of responsibility and for those responsible for the mistakes to suffer the consequences.
Construction policy, development aid, modernisation and improved efficiency in both agriculture and structural funding are all areas in which the Commission has still not made sufficient progress.
Commissioner Schreyer stated that a black list of fraudulent businesses had been drawn up.
I cannot help noticing that the 'FlÃ©chard' company, which is now for the second time reported to have taken part in serious financial and health-related fraud, is missing from this list.
Mr President, Mr Blak has indicated that the granting of discharge is a political decision of the first order.
This almost creates the impression that the facts are irrelevant. That is, of course, not the case.
The Members of this Parliament do, however, reach different conclusions based on facts.
And this is all tied in with the interpretation of the facts and the trust in the Commission.
When it took up office in 1999, this Commission was facing a huge challenge, namely to carry out the necessary reforms in its official apparatus, clean up its image and handle old fraud cases.
With regard to the discharge for 1998 and 1999, I wonder to what extent we can hold the new Commission responsible for the mismanagement of the old one.
The facts are there for everyone to see: fraud involving subsidies for flax in Spain, artificial butter in Italy, and ESF funding in the Netherlands.
Interpreting these facts is a great deal harder.
The cited instances of fraud all took place before the eyes of the Member States, and they should be penalised for this aspect, in particular.
The fact that the Court of Auditors is refusing to issue a Statement of Assurance with regard to the Commission' s accounts weighs heavily upon the Commission.
Any other business would be threatened in its very existence.
In this respect, if the Commission were to give off the air of confidence that it was aware of its political accountability and would act accordingly, I would be in favour of discharge.
However, the Commission' s conduct left a great deal to be desired during the hearings of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Unfortunately, my confidence has taken a proportionate dive. That is why I would be in favour of postponing the discharge.
With the exception of Commissioner Patten, who has shown his political accountability by bringing the subsidies to IRELA to an end, Commissioner Schreyer and Lamy, in particular, have demonstrated that they excel at talking without saying anything.
Whilst Commissioner Fischler recognises that the Commission' s conduct in the FlÃ©chard affair is far from exemplary, Commissioner Schreyer refused to make a declaration that this kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated in future.
I appreciate what she said at the beginning of this afternoon' s session, but to make such a declaration under pressure of postponement of the discharge is hardly credible.
When it took up office, the Commission had the trust of this Parliament.
It is now high time that they proved to us - in word and deed - that they are worthy of this trust.
This may well mean that Commissioner de Palacio may need to stand down if it appears that she was actually aware of the flax fraud in Spain.
The entire Commission can start by addressing the ten points in the resolution with regard to the discharge.
Mr President, I also welcome the reports which have been submitted to us, particularly the excellent report by Mr Blak, who should be congratulated for his equally serious and positive approach to this task.
We must certainly accept the idea that the discharge is not a populist denunciation in itself. However, once we appointed the Commission and it therefore enjoyed our trust - until we censured it, that is - the discharge procedure was a joint process of negotiation between players working in good faith and seeking to improve the management of the European Union' s budget.
We must be aware that the discharge procedure is a specific task, carried out within a limited timescale - it is a financial task, which has well defined scope, we can grant the discharge or we can postpone it, but we can never reject it outright, because that would require upsetting the sequence of balances.
The aim of the discharge, at the end of the day, is not to repeat the act of authorising the budget.
The discharge is not an opportunistic step, but a step to punish irregularities and to punish a possible lack of optimal management.
The discharge is a framework which we must hold onto if we wish to avoid certain dramatic events being repeated.
Personally speaking, I welcome all of the above.
I shall make three comments on what has happened here this year.
First of all, I acknowledge that there is a serious problem, namely the imbalance between the Commission and Member States' responsibilities in relation to the discharge.
Eighty per cent of the appropriations are still spent by Member States and we grant discharge to the Commission.
That is why I believe it is difficult for us to demand in a suitably effective manner the improvement of a positive Statement of Assurance.
We are punishing those who are only partially responsible for what is happening to them.
Before imposing sanctions on the Commission, I would like the various pockets of Eurosceptics to allow more extensive monitoring in their own countries on the way in which spending is carried out in Member States.
My second comment - and I am hurrying through this - concerns relations between OLAF and the European Parliament, which have not yet settled.
In this case, the need for transparency must be reconciled with maintaining the confidentiality of certain information and of the individual' s right to protection.
That does not always happen.
Lastly, we are being very badly affected by an imbalance, on the issue of fraud, between a repressive and largely administrative unit and a judicial unit with powers of jurisdiction that is still in its infancy.
That is what constitutes the real scandal in the FlÃ©chard affair.
The misunderstandings of the FlÃ©chard case can be explained by the fact that we, the European Union and the Commission, were in a position to levy punishment in administrative terms, without showing consideration for the individual' s right to protection.
It is essential that we correct this imbalance by enhancing our powers of jurisdiction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was one sentence in Mr Blak's report which I particularly liked.
On page 34, in his Explanatory Statement, he says that the discharge procedure will ideally result in a win-win scenario.
In other words, everyone will win: the Commission as the auditee and Parliament as the auditor, and therefore, of course, the taxpayers as well, some of whom are sitting up in the public gallery.
But this means that a change of approach is sometimes required too.
Unfortunately, there are quite a number of areas in which the Commission has failed to do this - but it has done so, at least, in the field in which I am slightly more involved, namely the fight against fraud.
Less than three weeks have passed since we adopted a resolution here in Strasbourg demanding access to a whole series of reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Until then, we had been systematically denied access to these reports.
Mr BrÃŒner, the Director of the European Anti-Fraud Office, has now made all of them available to us.
He has thus asserted his position against those in the Commission whose motto when providing information to this House is 'as little and as late as possible' .
This has also been the stance of the Commission's apparently omnipotent Legal Service until now, and we can only hope that the forthcoming change-over at the head of this service will prompt a change of attitude in this respect.
So what information can we glean from these OLAF reports?
Even for someone who has worked on this material for a long time, it is staggering to witness the scale and sophistication with which cross-border Europe-wide fraud is orchestrated at the expense of the EU budget.
Let's take the example of adulterated butter.
This mixture of beef suet and chemical substances was produced under the control of the Mafia in Italy, but was marketed primarily by companies in France, and to some extent, and rather circuitously, through a firm in London, in order to conceal this major fraud even further and erase any leads.
This was the prerequisite, as it were, for the fraud - which was unprecedented in its scope and scale - to operate successfully for so many years.
Or let us take the case of flax.
At first, this focussed solely on Spain.
Then we found out that other Member States were affected as well and that ultimately, the fraud in Spain was only possible because a company in Belgium was issuing purchase certificates for non-existent deliveries.
I am pleased to say that despite the stormy political debates in Spain, the cooperation between the Spanish authorities and OLAF is apparently running smoothly and there is a great deal of determination to clear up the matter and bring those responsible to justice.
Even now, OLAF is often at its weakest - and it is important to say this loud and clear - when investigating internal irregularities.
This is most apparent in the case of the alleged disappearance of files in the FlÃ©chard affair.
This case was approached extremely tentatively.
I can understand that.
After all, a thorough investigation might reveal that senior and very senior officials have quite simply been telling lies.
This is one explanation, but it is no justification.
And when OLAF carries out its investigations quickly and efficiently, as in the case of the Stockholm representation, the Commission is remarkably slow to impose the necessary disciplinary measures.
This is why the call for a rapid entry into the first phase of a European public prosecution service is so important.
We need the "internal" public prosecutor so that the investigations within the institutions can be carried out as thoroughly as possible and the appropriate measures can be taken.
It is the Commission's credibility, not least, which is at stake here.
For this reason, I would ask you, Ms Schreyer, to present an appropriate report to this House as soon as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate Freddy Blak on an exceptionally good report and at the same time thank him for our fruitful cooperation during this process.
In the discharge, Denmark was subject to a critical comment which is a scathing criticism of the way in which the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries handles export aid payments.
It is quite extraordinary that, in Denmark, there are cases going right back to 1996. This means that Danish export businesses are severely hampered in their operations at the moment and that there is a considerable distortion of competition vis-Ã -vis other EU countries.
This is far and away the harshest criticism ever levelled at Denmark, and in this case, mind you, it is the central authorities who have failed.
I must therefore urge the Commission to ensure that the Danish rules on export aid are normalised as soon as possible.
Mr President, this week, the Commission should be granted discharge for the 1999 financial year.
That is what the Committee on Budgetary Control recommended by a clear majority last week, in line with the proposal put forward by our rapporteur, Freddy Blak, to whom I should like to pay tribute for his excellent work.
However, last week's recommendation was made in the expectation that the Commission would provide final clarification on a number of outstanding points.
I know that the decision of many of my colleagues - and indeed my own too - here in the House will depend on this taking place.
What are these issues?
Let me sum them up in four key phrases.
The first is the FlÃ©chard case.
Ms Schreyer, you have just stated clearly that the Commission would not proceed in this way today.
I am gratified to hear it.
But let me remind you that although you were all good enough to come to the Committee - and I thank you for that - it was rather irksome that you could not bring yourselves to respond in such unequivocal terms in the Committee.
It would have made things much easier for us - for both sides - if you had done so.
But I must say that we are looking to the future, and we will be able to boost confidence more effectively through openness than by wasting words and ultimately being none the wiser.
My second key phrase is the Statement of Assurance.
This is the sixth time in succession that a negative Statement of Assurance has been issued by the Court of Auditors, despite some improvements in a number of areas.
It is not enough for the Commission to respond to Parliament's repeated calls for the error rates to be reduced by saying that it will do its best.
No, we want tangible results.
The DAS must be positive by 2002.
This House is prepared to work with the Commission and the Court of Auditors to achieve this goal.
The third key phrase is access to information.
Many people's hopes of the Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament have been disappointed.
I was sceptical from the outset, but as the Chairman of the Committee, I ensured that the provisions of the Agreement were strictly adhered to.
Yet the Commission still failed to provide all the information requested.
The long list of reports requested but not received, contained in the Annex to Mr Blak's report, speaks for itself.
Ultimately, Ms Schreyer, the Commission is cutting off its nose to spite its face.
You cannot really expect that when in doubt, Parliament will intercede and defend you from unjustified attacks unless you provide us with the necessary information first.
And my last point: This House has called on the Commission repeatedly and with a broad majority to put forward proposals on the immediate introduction of a European Public Prosecutor's office.
Its first task should be to deal with fraud within the European institutions.
The previous speakers have also raised this issue.
On this basis, a European Public Prosecutor's office could be introduced immediately and without any amendment to the Treaties.
This was recommended by the five wise men in their report on reforming the Commission, as well as by OLAF's Supervisory Committee.
Parliament gave the Commission until the end of March to state its position on this issue.
Ms Schreyer, I asked you about this issue during the last part-session.
Will I finally get a clear statement from you today?
The Committee on Budgetary Control has submitted five other reports on discharge.
I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent work.
Ms Stauner's follow-up report on the 1998 discharge should be singled out in particular.
We must carefully verify whether our demands from last year have been fulfilled by the Commission, in order to strengthen mutual confidence, openness and responsibility.
Unfortunately, a number of points are still unresolved, especially the issue of a positive DAS, which I have already mentioned, as well as the issue of information for Parliament.
It is this weakness, not least, which led to the recommendation by the rapporteur, Ms RÃŒhle, that the discharge in respect of implementation of the European Development Funds be postponed - and quite rightly, in my view.
Mr Folias' report is considered and coherent.
It contains no proposed amendments.
I should like to express my great appreciation of, and agreement with, the content of his report.
The reports by Ms van der Laan and Mr SeppÃ€nen were approved and adopted by the Committee.
Mr President, the Framework Agreement on the provision of information to this House has been mentioned by several speakers.
I should like to make it clear that the Social Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control have a good result to show for the recorded vote on Parliament's freedom of information.
This may not apply to all the Groups here in this Chamber.
But I think it is appropriate to point this out.
A word to the Commission.
You should be aware that we are taking this seriously: we expect the Commission to do its utmost to ensure that a positive Statement of Assurance can be issued in 2003.
In anticipation of what I have heard about the content of some of tomorrow's proposed amendments - which had not been submitted in writing by the start of this afternoon's sitting - I say this: we will not support any attempt to introduce an automatic process which effectively requires us, as Parliament, to cede our own right as the decision-making body on the issue of discharge and makes us a kind of secretariat for the Court of Auditors.
In my view, the PPE-DE must clarify its own position on this issue too.
You cannot table motions which aim to introduce this kind of automatic process and at the same time, in the committee meetings, emphasise the scope for political discretion in the granting of discharge, as Ms Theato tends to do.
There is a clear contradiction here, and the group really must clarify its position.
In any event, we will certainly not hand in Parliament's right to make its own decision on discharge along with our hats and coats.
I have a number of responses to the points raised by Mr Heaton-Harris.
If the Court of Auditors does not provide any official error rates - as is the case - this is regrettable and is an issue which we can discuss with the Court of Auditors.
But the point of relevance to Parliament as an institution is that it has not done so.
As a Parliament, we are not the arbitrators for internal wrangling within the Court of Auditors, and it is not our task to judge what some members of the Court of Auditors may have told others in the corridor about the error rates.
If there are any error rates, we expect a clear statement from the Court of Auditors.
But Mr Heaton-Harris, you made one point on which I agree with you completely, and the Commission should take note.
The political nature of the discharge procedure, which I have just mentioned, does not mean that the Commission can simply collect broken promises and let them mount up endlessly.
Sooner or later, a stray spark will set the pile ablaze like a bonfire.
You are absolutely right on this point.
But I cannot agree with your little attempt to seduce Parliament: you say that we can simply refuse to grant discharge, as there are no legal consequences - there is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen.
Here, too, I must remind you that there are different views on this issue within your group.
I was given a great deal of support from within your group when I said that since the events of 1998/1999, this annual discharge procedure has acquired a political character.
It is, after all, an annual political vote of confidence in the Commission, so there is rather more at stake if we refuse to grant discharge than simply saying, go ahead, there are no legal consequences.
I think everyone in this Chamber is aware of the political consequences which would ensue if discharge were denied under the present circumstances.
And this is precisely the reason why, even after the explanations provided by the Commission, we will grant discharge tomorrow.
Mr President, I would first of all like to mention the Council' s absence from this debate, which our committee chairperson, Mrs Theato, has pointed out very effectively.
It is unacceptable that in this debate, in which we are going to talk about the Council, that that very Council is not represented.
Here we have our Secretary-General of Parliament, and here we have the Commissioner, who represents the Commission, but where is the Council?
I understand that this debate is taking place in parallel with a budgetary debate in Sweden and perhaps the Swedish Presidency has little to do with the exercise in question, but I believe that the Council also has a Secretary-General.
Mr Solana always tells us that he is not only Mr CFSP but also the Secretary-General of the Council.
Then he should come.
Or he should appoint a Mr CFSP so that he can be here and listen to what we have to say.
His absence is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr President, to communicate to Mr Solana, Secretary-General of the Council, that somebody should be here representing the Council, whether or not that duty falls to the Swedish Presidency.
Secondly, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and also Mr Blak - our good friend Freddy Blak - because he, as a good cyclist and an admirer of the five-times champion IndurÃ¡in - my compatriot - has been able to produce a successful report and employ great teamwork, given that his report has received a broad consensus in committee.
I agree with the report, which is serious, demanding and tough, and I also agree with the final section in which it discharges the budget, because, as has been said here from many different quarters, the Commission is making great efforts to improve things.
And also, in this 1999 financial year which, as Mr Heaton-Harris pointed out, has been rather unusual, an interregnum, the facts demonstrate that it is making improvements in the supervision of financial management and also in personnel policy.
However, I must say that, in my humble opinion, it is doing so very slowly and this creates insecurities and examples of improvisation and also creates a lack of motivation amongst staff.
I believe that you should move up a gear and carry out this very promising reform more quickly and more ambitiously because I very much fear that the reform is turning out, in almost all respects, to be unambitious and not the type of reform that was initially intended.
Mr President, fortunately, we are holding a debate this afternoon on the basis of a consensus, and Mr Blak' s excellent report goes hand in hand with the resulting enthusiasm on the part of our committee, which we are all very pleased about.
Commissioner, I intended to begin my speech with a question: does the Commission not have any self-criticism to make?
Having heard you say that the Commission' s behaviour would not now be the same as on previous occasions and that we have to seek, for the sake of cooperation in relation to good financial management, an improvement of the regulatory and commitological legal basis, I agree with Mr Van Hulten, because I believe that we are seeing an inflexion in the behaviour and attitude of the Commission.
I interpret your words as self-criticism on the part of the Commission.
I have approached this report via the flax issue.
The countless filtrations which have taken place lead me to request that this report be declassified, and as an MEP who has read it, I can assure you that there would not be any negative effect if it were declassified and made public.
We want a serious, independent and effective investigation, whether or not members of the Commission are responsible, because in Mr Blak' s report there is a very element, and that is that is asks for money which has been inappropriately and fraudulently received to be returned, as well as severe penalties in this regard.
We therefore have no problem whatsoever in arguing in favour of declassification.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, especially Mr Blak for his hard work on this report.
I can recall a time when this Committee on Budgetary Control was just a subcommittee of the Committee on Budgets.
Mr Aigner, as chairman, fought to have it made a full committee and he also fought to get a Court of Auditors, which we succeeded in getting.
Over the years we achieved real control and achieved the possibility to affect the management of the resources of the European Union.
But we are in danger of overplaying our hand.
The more we shout about fraud and corruption, the less seriously we will be taken unless it is absolutely necessary and unless we know exactly what we are talking about.
I want to warn against that because we in the Committee on Budgetary Control used to see ourselves as working with the Commission for the improvement of the management of our resources.
Too many people see us now as working against the Commission, and I want to warn that is not a healthy trend.
I also want to refer to the question of the Statement of Assurance and discharge.
The Court of Auditors was set up to apply accountancy procedures.
It looks at the way money is spent.
It looks at the figures and it comes to its conclusion that everything does not fit together and that it cannot give discharge.
We have an entirely different responsibility.
If you look through the lists which have been mentioned before - whether it be Italian milk quotas, whether it be olive oil in the Mediterranean, whether it be sheep in the United Kingdom and Ireland, whether it be the number of cattle in Corsica - you will find that in every single case it was the Member State that failed, not the European Commission.
I am not saying the Commission is perfect, but we cannot oblige the Commission to say "you must crack the whip and every Member State in the European Union will respond", because it will not happen.
Anyone who knows the short history of the European Union and the long history of Europe will know that proud states are not going to dance at the crack of a whip by the European Commission.
But we can work towards it and we are getting there.
We will achieve a cohesive Union but we must be responsible in our attitude to the whole question of what is intentionally fraudulent and what are simply mistakes and errors that cannot, in the short term, be avoided.
Mr President, I would like to spend my last three minutes talking about this year' s major issues.
I will start off with the Scandinavian countries.
The administration of the Stockholm office has proved to be scandalous.
We have to wait for the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry. However, I would like to ask the Commission when this will be concluded, and I should also like to know whether the Commission has taken measures to suspend staff after reading the OLAF report?
As Niels Busk stated, there have also been considerable problems in Denmark.
The problem with the guarantee payments in Denmark, which has not yet been settled, is an absolute disgrace.
Being a Danish rapporteur, it is embarrassing to say so, but it is a fact.
With regard to the flax issue in Spain, I am very delighted that a compromise was successfully reached.
I have tried not to get involved in an internal Spanish quarrel.
I examined whether the Commission had failed to fulfil its monitoring role, and I do not think this is the case here.
However, I should like to thank my Spanish colleagues on both sides for their willingness to cooperate and for the fact that they appreciate the different views.
I should like to mention the 'FlÃ©chard case' which has been at the centre of discussion this year.
We shall never discover more than we know now.
We have set up a special committee, we have sent out additional questionnaires to the Commission and we have invited five new and former Commissioners to a consultation in the committee.
OLAF, the expert committee and the Court of Auditors have looked at the case.
And what did we learn?
We learned that the Delors Commission made a decision for which there was no legal basis.
Under no circumstances was there a legal basis for reducing the penalty from six to three million. That was the conclusion of the Court of Auditors, the expert group and OLAF.
The Commission reacted, perhaps under pressure from the French government, and turned somersaults to save a company which had most likely even been involved in the fraudulent activities from the beginning.
This was just not discovered as there was no thorough investigation of the case.
The conclusions of the meeting at which the decisions were made were never put down in writing and cannot now be reconstructed.
OLAF has just completed a very thorough investigation, and its conclusions are clear: The files will never be found.
If OLAF cannot find them, then how should MEPs be able to?
Now we must look ahead, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer stated so clearly that there will be no repetition of the 'FlÃ©chard case' .
For the first time, the new Commission has admitted that the decision to reduce the penalty was perfectly open to criticism and that a more thorough investigation should have been carried out.
They have also promised to change the rules so that officials will not be able to make that type of decision in the future.
I therefore think we should consider closing the case and then devote our energy to holding the Commission to its promises.
Finally, I should like to thank everyone who has been involved in doing a really great job: the Commission, the staff of the Commission and our people in Parliament. Mr Asadbeg and Mrs Marina Buk Kristensen, in particular, have done an excellent job.
Thank you very much.
To my three colleagues, who do not wish to grant discharge, I would like to say that it would really have worried me if they had said that they wanted to grant discharge. That would have meant that my report was not good enough.
For some people it is a way of life to be at cross purposes and oppose everything.
That is fine, and I accept that, as I also accept them as very good colleagues.
It is quite all right that three groups should be voting against this report, in which case the rest of us will take responsibility.
Mr President, with just one minute, I must be absolutely specific.
I shall use my one minute to congratulate Mrs van der Laan on her report and mention CEDEFOP, which is headquartered in Thessaloniki.
I want to get the message across that, in voting in favour of this report tomorrow, we acknowledge that CEDEFOP is now operating as we would like it to operate, we acknowledge the positive aspects of how it is operating and performing and we confirm the fast job done in completing the CEDEFOP building, which was finished ahead of schedule and with savings of EUR 2 million.
I also want to point out that we must make ensure that the people working so hard at CEDEFOP can rest assured that there is no risk of their being moved from Thessaloniki somewhere else, just as they were recently moved from Berlin to Thessaloniki.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I should like to come back once again to a point of detail arising from the 1999 budget, which is now extended to 2000 and 2001 as well.
I am referring to the SYNERGY Programme.
This energy programme was discontinued in December 1999 by the new Director-General of DG Energy and Transport.
There is a difference of opinion over the Programme's minimum threshold.
The Director-General only wishes to approve programmes involving amounts of EUR 400 000 and above, whereas the Council's Energy Working Group has set a figure of EUR 200 000.
As a result of this dispute, the implementation of the SYNERGY Programme has now been blocked for a year and a half.
The whole situation is becoming farcical, for it even proved impossible to reach an agreement at Permanent Representative level and the issue actually ended up on the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting on 9 April.
Indeed, we risk losing the funds for 2001, which would mean that we would not have implemented two-thirds of an energy budget-line.
This House should therefore call upon the Commission to take issue with the incredibly obdurate attitude of the new Director-General, Mr Lamoureux, and ensure that an amicable agreement is reached.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is getting late, so I would just like to make a few brief comments to wind up this debate.
Firstly, how will the Commission deal with uncovered or suspected fraud?
Fortunately, we now have OLAF, which was set up in 1999, so today's approach is naturally very different from cases such as FlÃ©chard in 1991.
Let me re-emphasise this point: in a similar case, the approach adopted and the decisions taken in FlÃ©chard would not arise today.
Of course, the individual factors are also important.
We have just been talking about the blacklist.
Here, the current situation is that only companies which have been prosecuted successfully can be blacklisted, and only by the Member States.
This is a shortcoming, of course, so we are working on a proposal to grant the Commission the right to blacklist companies as well.
But I should mention at the same time that this is a Council regulation.
It remains to be seen how the debate on this issue will continue.
As to the question: if fraud is discovered and a prosecution takes place, how will the courts in the Member States proceed? Yes, we know about this.
Various procedures are applied which vary in their speed and thoroughness.
I am not implying anything about any Member State, this is simply an observation.
So the issue of a European public prosecutor is still on the agenda, of course.
Let me say again: we consider that we have no legal basis on which to appoint a European public prosecutor without an amendment to the Treaty.
We will present the green paper, and we will also try to exert greater pressure through a directive based on the regulation on the protection of financial interests. So we will keep this issue alive.
I am still quite optimistic: perhaps by the time the next Inter-Governmental Conference comes round - although hopefully it will have a different name by then, so perhaps I should say "at the next Convention" - this issue can be dealt with and decided in a different way.
Another important point in this context is that we have presented a communication for an amendment to the disciplinary procedure. I should point out yet again that as part of the budget discharge procedure, the Commission provides Parliament with a list of disciplinary proceedings which commenced or were concluded in a given year, together with their outcomes.
As far as I am aware, no Parliament in any Member State is as well-informed about problems and proposed solutions, even in countries which pride themselves on their transparency.
A further point which was raised was the execution of the budget.
A number of speakers highlighted the continuing shortcomings in the execution of the budget - i.e. the translation of the budgetary authorities' decisions into tangible policies - especially in the field of foreign policy.
Last year, for example, the budget for the Structural Funds was very poorly implemented.
I have to make this clear, because the new programme could not be approved and implemented in all areas.
In the area of foreign policy, a great deal has improved; one reason is that for the Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, a different administrative approach has been adopted in line with Parliament's resolutions, which has really proved its worth.
And that is also something which we must take into account when considering reforms.
As regards the execution of the budget, I should like to reiterate that we will be presenting budget management data to Parliament on a weekly basis from now on. Here, too, I am not aware of any Member State which furnishes its Parliament with such up-to-date information as is the case here.
On the issue of a positive DAS: as the Budget Commissioner, I am responsible for the discharge procedure as well, so I would naturally be delighted to have a positive DAS sooner rather than later.
That goes without saying.
But I also realise that a Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors - and it is the Court's decision, and the Court has not yet decided when it will produce the Statement - cannot be achieved through a single campaign or a few small-scale campaigns and improvements. Instead, we must plough a broad furrow, because each of the difficulties faced in combating fraud and mismanagement in the individual areas - the Structural Funds, agricultural policy, research policy, etc. demands highly diverse measures.
Mr Blak's report makes this very clear.
It really is a very broad field, and - to continue with the metaphor - improving the execution of the budget, reducing errors, and avoiding fraud sometimes turn it into a minefield.
The Commission's Action Plan and administrative reform are therefore also a mine-clearance programme, so that in future, the budget decisions fall on safe and fertile ground.
On behalf of the Commission, I can assure Parliament once again that we will not be downing tools once the discharge decision is taken. On the contrary, we intend to roll up our sleeves even further and continue our labours with renewed vigour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The next item is the Commission statement on foot-and-mouth disease.
Mr President, Members of Parliament, I am pleased to update you further on the current outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
To date, the outbreak remains largely confined to the UK, where almost 99% of cases recorded so far have occurred.
The outbreak started with two cases detected on 20 February.
Over the following weeks, however, the number of cases rose exponentially with daily totals sometimes 50 or more in number.
As we speak, the total number of cases in the UK stands at over 900.
The situation in the other affected Member States is fortunately not as serious.
There have been two cases in France, twelve in the Netherlands and one case in Ireland; however, we need to maintain a very high level of vigilance.
All Member States are putting huge resources into combating the current outbreak.
This is especially the case in the Member States which have recorded cases, and in the UK in particular.
There has been a very high level of solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the current difficult circumstances.
The Commission's strategy towards the crisis has been to act decisively and quickly.
Our aim is to assist the Member States to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease.
There is a consensus on this objective.
Other considerations - very important considerations - arising from the crisis will have to wait until this objective has been achieved.
We are maintaining a very high level of coordination and cooperation with the Member States: for example, there have been eight meetings of the Standing Veterinary Committee since the crisis broke; a ninth meeting is taking place in Brussels as we speak; and two further specialist meetings of laboratory experts on foot-and-mouth disease and on zoo animals have also taken place.
There are also innumerable daily contacts and information exchanges with and between the Member States.
We are acting urgently on all new information.
For example, the Commission has acted to impose restrictions on exports and animal movements from affected Member States and regions within 24 hours of confirmed outbreaks.
There have been no fewer than 18 decisions adopted by the Commission since the outbreak of this crisis.
We are acting with as much transparency as possible.
In addition to the meetings of the SVC, the crisis has been discussed twice in the agriculture council and five times in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in the European Council, in COPA or with professional organisations, and in countless press conferences and technical briefings.
This is my third appearance in Parliament to update you on developments.
I have also asked my officials to be available at all times to keep you informed on the progress of the outbreak.
Where possible, we are adopting a regionalised approach to any new outbreaks.
This is designed to allow trade to continue, with however very severe safeguards to prevent further spread of the disease.
The Commission has worked hard to convince third countries that exports from the Community are safe and are not a risk.
I met the new US Secretary for Agriculture, Ann Veneman, last week in Washington, and she has undertaken to regularly review the situation.
Our efforts are continuing to secure recognition for this regionalised approach by major export markets like Japan.
I remain satisfied that the protective measures in place are sufficient to safeguard against the export of the virus to third countries.
I repeat my call on them to lift unnecessary and unjustified restrictions.
I will now turn to the full range of Community measures in place.
As I noted earlier, there are no fewer than 18 decisions adopted by the Commission to date and there will, no doubt, be more.
They fall into two broad categories: first, measures with Community-wide effect; and second, measures which are specific to individual Member States.
On to the first category, Community-wide measures excluding the UK, there are still very important restrictions on movements of live and susceptible animals.
Essentially, with a few exceptions, movements are only possible from a holding to an abattoir, or to another holding with permission.
In both cases, movements have to be authorised by the competent authorities of the place of departure and of destination.
This has proven essential to avoid the possible further spread of the disease on the continent.
Another essential measure was the obligation to slaughter all sheep imported from the UK between 1 February and 21 February.
This has been proven by the epidemiology of the French outbreak two weeks later, as of 13 March, as the most crucial decision to avoid further spread on the continent of Europe.
There are also important safeguards to ensure that any such transports do not allow animals to come into contact with animals from other holdings except for direct slaughter.
Vehicles are cleaned and disinfected, adequate notice of movements of animals is given; movements of susceptible animals into the holding of dispatch within the previous 30 days have not taken place.
Finally, there is now a suspension in place on staging posts, while the maximum transport time is maintained.
These points are designed to provide facilities for the resting, watering and feeding of live animals in transport; however, they are also an opportunity for animals to be cross-contaminated by other animals.
I will now turn to Community measures in relation to individual Member States.
In relation to the UK, there is a total ban on exports of susceptible live animals, untreated meat and meat products.
However, Northern Ireland will be excluded from this measure with effect from today with two important exceptions.
There will be no exports of live susceptible animals, and there will be no change in the current restrictions in the area of Newry and Mourne where Northern Ireland's only case of foot-and-mouth disease was detected almost five weeks ago.
In relation to France, the Netherlands and Ireland, there is a ban on the export of live susceptible animals.
There is also a ban on the export of untreated meat and meat products, milk and milk products from the affected regions in Ireland (one county), in the Netherlands (four provinces), and in France (three dÃ©partements).
These restrictions are adapted as circumstances change.
Hence in France for example, the ban on exports of live susceptible animals will remain in force until 12 April.
However, the restrictions on exports of untreated meat and meat products will only apply to the three dÃ©partements where the second case was detected on 23 March, as of today and following detailed investigations of the epidemiological situation.
The existing restrictions in relation to Ireland remain in place until 19 April.
In the Netherlands, where there have been a total of 12 cases since the first case was detected on 21 March, the situation will be reviewed in the SVC today and tomorrow.
In both of these Member States, the restrictions on products are confined to the regions where the cases have been detected.
That summarises the situation insofar as restrictions on exports and movements of animals are concerned.
I would now like to turn to two other important measures adopted in recent days.
These concern the Commission decision to approve vaccination in clearly defined circumstances in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom.
The decision in relation to the Netherlands provides for suppressive vaccination.
This involves the vaccination of animals pending their pre-emptive killing and destruction to prevent the further spread of the virus.
It has a role to play where there is insufficient capacity to carry out this killing and slaughter with the speed necessary to prevent the further spread of the disease.
The Netherlands is in this unfortunate position and the Commission and the Member States in the SVC are sympathetic to the situation.
Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate to allow vaccination to take place in these circumstances.
