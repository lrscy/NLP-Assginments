Do you wish, therefore, to respond now to the statements made by the three speakers?
Â Â  . Mr President, I can answer the three questions, which concern the same basic issue.
I would like to thank MrÂ Bourlanges and the Members who took the floor.
The first reason why I am reasonably optimistic over the possibility of attaining a tangible result, namely the adoption of a European initiative, is that, with regard to 2001, it was the European Council â the very institution which in 2001 did not allow a similar measure to be adopted â which in November 2004 called on the Commission to adopt a European initiative by the end of 2005.
Within the framework of the Hague Programme, the Heads of State or Government, that is, those at the highest political level, asked the Commission to go ahead and to do so quickly.
That, in my view, demonstrates a new awareness of the fact that only Europe can provide the added value for a strategy on legal immigration.
The second reason is that with respect to the past, we have chosen what I would call a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach.
We have chosen to launch a debate with Parliament, with the European Economic and Social Committee, with employersâ associations and trade unions, so that we shall be ready to put forward a proposal only once we have gathered suggestions.
I am confident that this method will first of all enhance the transparency of the debate, secondly it will allow members of civil society to participate more actively in this debate than in the past, and thirdly it will enable Member States to approve or reject the proposal that the Commission will table, having the views of their employersâ associations, their trade unions and the European Parliament on hand.
These elements will consolidate the work.
I therefore cannot predict what tangible measures will be included in the Commissionâs initiative, precisely because today we are relaunching a European debate with the aim of gathering information and proposals which we shall submit to a public hearing in about the middle of this year, so that we can table a proposal by the end of 2005.
At that time we will be in a better position to understand what the tangible measures will be.
I can only tell you that we intend to adopt a framework of minimum rules, to enable those who wish to work legally to do so, and at the same time to give people a preview of the provisions with the minimum of bureaucracy â there are currently 25 different rules on the admission of migrant workers, one per country.
We intend to establish a European framework with which anyone outside Europe can familiarise themselves beforehand: that will also help, in our opinion, to prevent illegal immigration.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that it is certainly commendable that immigrants are at last no longer considered a problem, but a resource â as the Green Paper expressly states â and that we are aiming for a permanent multicultural and multireligious dialogue.
We are concerned, however, by the productivity approach, as, moreover, you yourself called it in an interview for an Italian newspaper: that is, the decision to make migratory flows conditional on the requirements of the European labour market.
The Green Paper inclines towards the possibility â just a possibility, but one which we intend to comment on â of making the admission of an immigrant conditional on a job vacancy which it has not otherwise been possible to fill with European Union workers, or on a Member Stateâs specific needs in particular employment sectors.
Commissioner, do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European immigration policy, as well as a step backwards from what many Member States have already achieved?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the Green Paper.
Since action was urgently required, and still is, I am delighted with it.
I have only just received the Green Paper, and so I have not had the chance to read the whole document, only the first few pages.
I was immediately struck by something on page 5, where as regards the form of future European legislation with a view to the planned harmonisation, three proposals have been made.
At least, the impression is created that three options are still open, namely the horizontal approach, the sectoral approach and the so-called common fast track procedure.
Is it not, though, the case that, thanks to years of indecision on the part of the Council, we have tacitly already decided in favour of the sectoral approach?
I think that the Peillon report about admitting third-country scientists and researchers is a case in point.
That is backed by the Council, and that may explain your optimism to some extent.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, many Members have not had sight of the Green Paper yet, but at this early stage we should set down for you some basic principles of what is a very welcome discussion.
First, as my colleague Mrs Roure said, integration policy must be a vital component of any proposed legislation.
We know that we want to share best practice, but we still have a very vague position on integration policy.
Secondly, managed migration means all things to all Members in this House.
For some it may mean control, for some it may mean the right to family unity.
This is a big gap and we must define in this discussion what managed migration actually means.
These are human beings coming from third countries to work in the European Union, they are not commodities.
We will have a set of principles and laws which will have to accommodate that.
Finally, I very much welcome that civil society will have a much greater say, but we must then listen to civil society, to the trade unions and to business.
They have some good ideas, and we must not just pay lip service to those ideas but create a managed migration policy which will benefit both the European Union and those people and their families who are coming to benefit our economies.
Â Â  . Mr President, the three interventions allow me to formulate one single comment.
Firstly â and I am referring in particular to MrÂ Fava, who already knows this full well â a recognised, common, widespread principle, commonly referred to as the principle of preference for Community workers over third-country workers, is not asserted for the first time, but merely repeated in the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union.
Precisely to avoid the indiscriminate and unbalanced application of this principle, we believe that we need to explore, with the help of civil society, trade unions and businesses, what job opportunities exist for which there is no direct issue of taking work away from the citizens of our countries.
Because, if this were the issue, clearly the impact of immigration on society would not be positive, whereas we must ensure that legal immigration leads to true integration.
This means workers being accepted into civil society and integrated into education, with real inclusion in society.
Obviously, this matter is not addressed by the Green Paper, but is the subject of integration policies which will be the focus of a Commission action in 2005.
These are areas that the Commission will be developing this year, in close cooperation with Parliament and the Presidency.
Integration is an absolutely vital part of the process.
In this forum we seek instead to listen to suggestions as to how we can make European policy on the reception of third-country workers uniform: that is our aim.
I would reiterate once more to those who asked again that today I cannot give any options or preferences among possible abstract solutions.
Somebody asked me whether we could introduce an American-style green card.
The answers will come from the public debate which will be starting, from Parliament and from the social actors to whom we shall listen.
With regard to one point I will, of course, confirm a commitment which you can already guess: the Commission will not confine itself to listening to advice, but will take into account the assessments and proposals that it gathers.
In conclusion, therefore, the Commission has two lines of action: turning what has until now been a national approach into a European approach, with the aim of promoting a more balanced policy, and above all, delimiting the phenomenon of legal immigration through a positive approach within our societies.
This approach is essential for true integration, which it will be difficult to achieve without it.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Commission for its initiative, which is extremely welcome.
Let me try to put a new twist on things.
There are tens of millions of Europeans living outside Europe who have benefited from the immigration policy of other countries â not only the United States, but also Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and many others.
These people â or a very interesting sample of them â met for the first time during the Greek presidency in June 2003 in Thessaloniki.
Some of the most remarkably successful Italians, Greeks, Czechs, Romanians and others living around the world came to tell us about their experiences.
Their experience, as European citizens, of being integrated into those countries could be extremely helpful to you, Commissioner.
I was involved in this and I would be happy to help your staff plan a meeting with these people.
I do not believe that any of us here feel that the relatives we have in third countries have harmed those countries, nor do the host countries feel that they have harmed them.
So for us as Europeans to fear the notion of legal migration so greatly goes against our personal experiences.
Let us hear the experiences of these people.
Their experiences might even enable us to make it easier for our own citizens â identifying as they will with them â to understand the benefits of legal migration to Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â I have an observation to make, or rather a question to ask of CommissionerÂ Frattini.
I am not familiar with the Green Paper, but I would like this document to contain provisions to ensure that in future Europe will not be suspected or accused, as has sometimes been the case with the United States, of causing a âbrain drainâ from poor countries.
We need to make sure that people who come to European universities or scientific institutes to study or train do not remain here for whatever reasons, whether working or not, as this represents a loss for their own countries.
The countries affected are frequently poor countries, whose development depends to a large extent on the education of such an elite.
A policy must be developed which ensures that on the one hand it is possible to work here for a certain length of time, but that on the other hand instruments also exist which would not so much force people to return as encourage them to do so, in order to put the knowledge and experience they have gained to use in developing their own cultures and societies.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a sense of here, having drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on a number of these issues.
I have a number of questions.
What attention is going to be paid to the work that Parliament has already done on these issues?
We have put forward a considerable number of proposals, which we discussed with civil society, trade unions and business.
The trade unions will demand parity of treatment for third country nationals coming to work in the European Union, so that they are not paid poorly to undercut workers here.
Business people will tell you that they want entry made easier so that they are not acting as a parallel immigration system.
One of the things that have changed since Parliament last looked at this is that we now have ten new Member States.
If we are looking at a hierarchy of movement for employment, presumably the Commission is looking at removing the transition periods for those new Member States as part of that change in the hierarchical system of entry for employment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am particularly keen to pick up on MrsÂ Lambertâs comments on transition periods.
We should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third-country nationals are invited to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place.
A balance of some kind must be found, and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter.
I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue, above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens, as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected.
On a slightly different note, I have noticed that the Green Paper is littered with a great many questions.
Given that the issue of labour migration is such a complex one, it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side, in line with the principle of âkeep it simple, stupidâ.
Â Â  . I thank all Members of Parliament for their suggestions and opinions.
The fundamental purpose of this proposal is that legal migration should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity for all of us and for Europe in particular.
In this period we will launch a public debate.
We will take into account the work already done by Parliament, particularly on equality of rights and opportunities for legal migrants.
We will take into account suggestions, concrete proposals, and we will consider all proposals as a very positive contribution in the spirit of open and frank cooperation.
I should like to mention the important issue of 'brain drain'.
This issue of brain drain and what to do about it will be one of the key subjects in the particular and specific communication on migration and development, which the Commission will present in Spring 2005.
I can already assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the acuteness of this problem, particularly in specific countries and sectors such as healthcare.
The Commission intends to propose a tailor-made approach where responses could be made that are commensurate with the magnitude of this very important and sensitive problem.
In this way, we will put emphasis on the positive impact that migration can have on countries of origin.
Finally, I can assure you that this problem will be taken fully into account by the Commission.
Â Â  That concludes the item on the Commission communication on the Green Paper on admission for employment.
I should like to thank CommissionerÂ Frattini and the speakers.
MrÂ OrtuondoÂ Larrea has asked to be given the floor in order to make a personal statement.
Â Â  Mr President, if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty, I would say, firstly, that it is integrationist; secondly, that it is based on free accession; thirdly, that it is respectful of different identities, cultures, languages and institutional structures and creates a European citizenship which does not exclude, but rather co-exists with, other citizens from the Member countries.
In the Basque country, our Parliament has just approved, by an absolute majority, a new Statute for co-existence with the Spanish State which, in fact, is inspired by the Community model, which maintains these same principles I have indicated and is respectful of the Constitutional Treaty.
Nevertheless, in this morningâs debate one Member has accused it of attacking the European Constitution and has said that the Basque President and the Basque Nationalist Party have allied themselves with the enemies of Europe.
That is entirely false.
We are going to support a âyesâ vote and we advocate a âyesâ to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum.
And we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the Spanish State, on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages, free accession and common work within a united Europe.
We Basques have supported European integration from the outset, and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time, with questions to the Commission (B6-0001/2005).
Â Â  Honourable Members, I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who is unable to be here today as he is currently on his way to India.
The WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing, which established a ten-year period for the elimination of the quotas, expired on 31Â DecemberÂ 2004, and trade in textile and clothing products is henceforth subject to the general WTO rules.
Quota removal is likely to reshape the export of textile and clothing and global outsourcing trends.
There may be a substitution effect among suppliers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products, economies of scale, competitive prices and efficient services.
The impact of abolishing quotas will indeed be considerable, though it is difficult to assess at this stage.
Moreover, it is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions, the ability to achieve competitive advantages in the higher value added production segment and domestic policy responses.
Sustained efforts are needed to help upgrade the skill levels of workers, improve the quality of their jobs and empower social partners at all levels to address the many challenges in the sector.
As far as Europe is concerned, this sector definitely has assets for the future.
Investment, a move upmarket and world leadership in the fashion industry have made Europe the world's biggest exporter of textiles and its second biggest exporter of clothing.
The Commission believes that this entails a three-pronged response: monitor the level of imports into the EU, help the sector strengthen its competitiveness and remain a key industry in the EU, and keep a special focus on the poorest and more vulnerable developing countries.
The Commission communication of 13 October 2004, entitled 'Textiles and Clothing after 2005', is a key element of this strategy.
This communication was a response to the set of recommendations by the High Level Group on Textiles and Clothing, in which trade unions were represented.
On structural funding and relocation processes, the participation of the textile and clothing sector in multisectoral programmes should provide an efficient framework for supporting the sector, allow for diversification of production and ultimately serve the economic interests of the regions in question.
In addition, the Commission proposes that in all future programmes, Member States should reserve an amount of 1% of the Structural Fundâs annual contribution for the 'Convergence' objective and 3% of the Structural Fundâs annual contribution for the 'Regional competitiveness and employment' objective, to cover unforeseen local or sectoral crises linked to economic and social restructuring or to the consequences of trade opening.
Â Â  Madam President, allow me to express to this House my heartfelt solidarity with the millions of employees who will see their lives shattered in the interests of satisfying, once again, a minority of affluent people.
Indeed, the economists of the International Federation of Trade Unions talk of what they, if not the Commission, know will be the destruction of thirty million jobs, a million of them in Europe, North Africa, SriÂ Lanka and Indonesia.
As if what a number of these countries have just experienced were not enough, they now find themselves in even deeper trouble.
It is, I strongly emphasise, the Commissionâs, the Councilâs and Parliamentâs responsibility and duty to put a stop to this social disaster.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Michel, who is unable to be here this afternoon, as he must attend the donors' conference on the tsunami disaster.
On this issue, the approach of the Commission is twofold.
Firstly, on the one hand, we support the initiatives and programmes of the ILO.
Secondly, we reinforce the capacity of the countries in the region to implement the relevant Cotonou provisions and different Economic Community of West African States protocols and initiatives in the area of child protection.
The International Labour Organisation, through its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, launched in 2000 a new initiative called 'Combating Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation in West and Central Africa'.
In 2003 a 'West Africa Cocoa/Commercial Agricultural Programme to Combat Hazardous and Exploitative Child Labour' was added, focusing in particular on cocoa farming.
The Commission has a strategic partnership with the ILO, in which the fight against child labour is a priority. In that context, a programme of EUR 15 million under the ACP funds is currently under consideration.
The objectives would be, , firstly, to establish a sustainable mechanism to prevent children from carrying out all sorts of labour in the agricultural and other sectors.
Secondly, to strengthen the capacity of national and community-level agencies and organisations in planning, initiating, implementing and evaluating action to prevent and progressively eliminate child labour. Thirdly, to remove all children involved in work in the cocoa sector, to prevent children at risk from entering such work, and to improve the income-earning capacity of adult family members, particularly women, through social protection schemes.
ECOWAS is active as a regional organisation in the fight against child labour.
In addition to the Cotonou provisions on trade and labour standards, the ECOWAS Heads of State have adopted a declaration and a plan of action to fight child exploitation, and ECOWAS has recently set up a child unit in its secretariat.
The 9th EDF Regional Indicative Programme will provide capacity-building to this new unit within ECOWAS, with a view to promoting the effectiveness of its work.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the ILO and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public domain.
I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making profits out of this at the moment, by perhaps insisting that unless European companies â and do not forget that Europeans and North Americans consume most of these cocoa products â can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and profits on the back of child labour, then they cannot import them into Europe.
Has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it?
Â Â  . The Commission believes that the framework of the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the 77 ACP countries gives real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice, as well as the corruption element that may be linked to it, through political dialogue and support for good governance in ACP countries.
Moreover, it considers that poverty and the lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for exploitative child labour and child trafficking.
The poverty- reduction approach through EU development cooperation is a sound basis for tackling the problem as it gives priority to equitable growth and to better access to education.
Finally, the Cotonou Agreement represents an important step forward in promoting CLS in bilateral agreements.
Article 50 includes a specific provision on trade and labour standards, which reaffirms the commitments of the Parties to international CLS as defined by the relevant ILO Conventions.
Â Â  Is the Commission aware of the fact that the world Chocolate Manufacturers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue?
Would the Commission therefore undertake to look at the report that is due in the middle of this year from the international chocolate manufacturers, commend them on the work that they have been doing and encourage them to continue to develop their certification programme?
I am at a loss as to why chocolate has been singled out in this respect because there are many other food products being sourced from Third World countries where the same issues pertain â labelling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector.
Â Â  . I will certainly bring Mr Harbour's comments to Mr Michel's attention.
Â Â  . I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Kyprianou, who is unable to be here today, as he is unwell.
The Commission has made all reasonable efforts to avoid disruption in exports of animal and plant products from the European Union to Russia.
This potential disruption arises from Russian insistence that EU exports meet its specific import requirements.
For animal products, there was the concrete concern that trade would be totally blocked from 1 January 2005.
From this date, in fact, Russia insists on a single set of sanitary certificates for imports.
However, negotiations led by the Commission on behalf of the EU have averted this risk.
As regards plant products, where a similar risk to exports could materialise from 1 April 2005, the Commission intended to start negotiations as soon as the risk emerged, and asked the Council to endorse this.
Following a debate among Member States on the basis of this request, the AGRI Council in December 2004 agreed and the Commission immediately started negotiations on these issues on behalf of the EU. The Commission is confident that this will lead to a successful outcome.
The honourable Member can be assured, therefore, that although the Commission has very little competence in relation to export requirements in third countries, it has expressed its willingness and has been proactive in view of helping to solve this kind of problem and, as soon as the Commission was given the green light from the Council, it engaged in timely negotiations.
In the course of negotiations, no distinction has been made between the new and former Member States.
However, Russia has insisted on inspecting all establishments in the new Member States which have requested approval for export.
The Commission has highlighted that these same establishments have been approved for intra-EU trade following the enlargement process.
It has also pressed for the inspection process to be carried out as quickly as possible.
Overall, this situation has undoubtedly led to disruption in the trade of these Member States with Russia, and it is not made easier by the fact that Russia is not a member of the WTO and does not therefore consider itself bound by the rules of the WTO.
The honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission has involved all Member States in the efforts to avoid trade disruption, in particular the new Member States.
These efforts are continuing and the Commission will continue to defend the Community interest.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the situation is more dramatic than might be supposed from the Commissionerâs reply.
Since 1Â May, Russia has been playing games and not accepting goods from Poland in retaliation for the refusal by certain countries, such as the Baltic countries, to accept Russian imports because they failed to meet the sanitary requirements laid down by the EU.
Member States do not, however, have the power to take independent decisions on veterinary matters relating to imports of products from third countries.
I would ask you to take urgent action on this matter.
Â Â  . As I stated in my reply, the Commission has treated this matter with considerable urgency, when we asked the Council to give us the go-ahead and when we engaged in negotiations.
The honourable Member is correct that it imposes certain major difficulties on some of these countries and the Commission will do its very best to achieve a satisfactory solution.
However, I must stress the limits of what we can achieve.
Hopefully, with goodwill on all sides, the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.
Â Â  . The Commission wishes to stress that removing internal market barriers is not tantamount to undermining the quality of services, or that the Services Directive will lead to social dumping â quite the contrary.
As regards the protection of workers, the proposed directive does not affect the existing Community , namely the Posted Workersâ Directive from 1996.
This directive provides that posted workers, including temporary workers, enjoy, irrespective of the law applicable to the employment relationship, a number of important protective provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the worker is posted.
Therefore, companies cannot use this proposal in order to establish themselves in low-wage countries to circumvent the social protection of the host Member State.
In addition, the proposed directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between Member States and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host Member State in the supervision of working conditions.
The proposed directive will thus help to prevent social dumping.
The Commission does not share the concern that the directive will lead to a 'race to the bottom' in service provision.
First, the country of origin principle only applies to the temporary cross-border provision of services.
For services provided via an establishment in another Member State â for example a hospital or a home for the elderly â the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State.
Second, the country of origin principle is embedded in harmonisation and enhanced administrative cooperation between Member States.
Moreover, a number of derogations from the country of origin principle cover, for instance, the applicable working conditions in the context of posting of workers, consumer contracts, health and safety on building sites and public health.
Finally, the Commission wishes to stress that the proposed directive does not require the liberalisation or privatisation of services which are currently provided at national, regional or local level by the public sector or public entities.
Neither does the proposal affect the freedom of the Member States to define what they consider to be services of general economic interest and how they should be organised or financed.
Furthermore, it does not affect Member States' ability to maintain appropriate regulations concerning the quality, availability and performance of services of general interest, or other regulations ensuring consumer and user rights.
It is also important to note that the proposal does not prejudge the work on, or the outcome of, specific Community initiatives, in particular the follow-up to the White Paper on services of general interest.
The Commission has committed to a genuine dialogue with both co-legislators and interested parties with a view to finding solutions to specific areas of concern.
To date, the need for a major step forward in opening the internal market has not yet been validly contested.
I am confident that also the honourable Member would like to see companies, consumers and workers enjoy the benefits of an open and competitive integrated services market.
We are all aware of the economic and social challenges facing the European Union.
Bearing in mind the importance of the services sector, the proposed directive will contribute significantly to addressing these challenges.
Â Â  Firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in Parliament.
I look forward to more.
I am a little bewildered by the Commissioner's reply.
His reply indicates that this directive will do nothing, that it is not going to affect any of the areas about which we have expressed concern.
He says it will only apply to temporary cross-border provision of services.
In what way, then, will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market?
If it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross-border provisions, how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market?
Â Â  . As I pointed out in my reply, the country of origin principle applies only to the temporary cross-border provision of services.
The rest of the directive deals with any other areas.
If services are provided via an establishment in another Member State, the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State.
I should like to point out to the honourable Member that I would accept that the Services Directive is very ambitious: it aims to provide an overarching framework.
I am aware of the concerns of many Members of this Parliament and people outside this Parliament.
I am very conscious that it has raised the political temperature in a number of Member States.
I have entered into an open and constructive dialogue with Members, and I will continue to do that.
I look forward to future communications from your rapporteur to assess parliamentarians' views within the committee responsible.
Â Â  Would the Commissioner agree that it is vitally important for Members of this House to understand the huge variety of discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that Member States currently apply against service providers?
It would be very helpful if you could explain these in more detail to Members of this Parliament who persist in describing this directive in the entirely unjustified terms you have so convincingly dismissed in your answer of 'social dumping' and a 'race to the bottom'.
There is no evidence whatsoever that either of those things will happen, and it would be helpful if the job creation facet inherent in this directive were properly communicated.
Â Â  . I certainly agree with the honourable Member that the opportunities for job creation from an opening-up of the services market throughout Europe are immense.
Various studies have been initiated, and there are great opportunities for job creation.
Given that services account for well over 60% of the Union's GDP, it is clear that any improvement in the services area is going to lead to an increase in wealth and jobs for people in the Union.
I agree with the honourable Member that many anti-competitive practices exist in lots of Member States that prevent the real opening-up of the services market.
The services directive is attempting to open up the services area to the benefit of everybody in Europe.
But having said that, and in reply to the earlier question from Mr De Rossa, I am also conscious of the specific concerns expressed by Members.
Hopefully, during the parliamentary process and other processes we will be able to tease these concerns out further.
Â Â  If you take the qualifications that the Commissioner expressed in his answer to the first question at face value, it is clear that this directive would not apply to the UK health service, which is based on care that is free at the point of use.
If we can take his reassurances at face value, why does he not simply exclude health from the scope of this directive?
Â Â  . The approach that I have adopted with the European Parliament and others who have raised concerns is to have those concerns and problems put on the table and into a document.
I would not wish to start with a list of the items I think should be removed.
That would not be the correct approach.
I accept that this is a very ambitious document, what we are trying to achieve is worth fighting for.
People come to various issues in this House from various perspectives, with their own experiences and political and economic philosophies.
What we all have to accept is that if Europe is to meet the challenges of the future and keep the social protection model and other things that we aspire to and want in Europe, we have to ensure that the European economy grows.
Standing still is not an option.
The Services Directive attempts to open up this particular market.
As I pointed out in reply to Mr Harbour, services make up the bulk of the European Union's economic activity, therefore it is a goal well worth fighting for.
Â Â  . As the honourable Member has pointed out, the proposed Directive on services in the internal market is at the heart of our efforts to reform the European economy.
Services account for approximately 70% of EU GDP and employment.
The removal of internal market barriers in the area of services, as foreseen by the proposal, is essential for meeting the growth and employment targets which lie at the heart of the Lisbon Agenda.
The potential economic opportunities arising from this proposal are indeed huge. This has been underlined by recent Dutch economic research which shows that implementation of the proposal in its current form could result in an increase in bilateral trade and direct foreign investment in commercial services by 15% to 35%.
The Commission has proposed a horizontal directive for several different reasons.
First, a broad range of services is dealt with because many of the barriers identified are common to various service activities.
The most efficient way to address these barriers is in a horizontal way.
Secondly, a large scale and detailed harmonisation process through sectoral directives would be unnecessary, unrealistic and inconsistent with better regulation and subsidiarity principles.
Thirdly, the services proposal takes into account the specificity of certain activities, proposes specific harmonisation where this is deemed necessary and adopts a phased approach to implementation.
It is clear that the proposal has provoked a great deal of discussion.
However, this is exactly what a proposal this ambitious and far-reaching can be expected to do.
It shows that the proposal is addressing some very important questions.
At the same time, this also means that there is a lot of work to be done to achieve a common goal.
The country of origin approach is a central element of the proposal, as far as the cross-border supply of services is concerned.
It eliminates the problem of cross-border services being subject to a multitude of different rules.
This will stimulate the offer of cross-border services and improve the competitiveness of the EU economy.
The country of origin approach is in particular essential for SMEs, who do not have the means to establish a subsidiary or an office in another Member State and therefore can export their know-how only by the temporary cross-border provision of services.
I wish to note, however, that the country of origin approach does not apply for services provided through a fixed commercial presence in the host country.
At the same time, I wish to reiterate that the country of origin approach does not operate in isolation.
Over and above the specific harmonisation foreseen for certain activities, the proposal also foresees the further development of administrative cooperation between Member State authorities and administrations.
This harmonisation and cooperation will generate the degree of confidence between Member States required for the effective application of the country of origin approach.
Finally, a number of derogations are foreseen for services demonstrating a particular sensitivity because of the need to protect consumers, public health or public security, or where the current divergence of Member States' legislation does not allow the application of the country of origin approach.
As pointed out in my earlier reply, the Commission is confident that the proposal is the best way to allow the economic potential of the services sector to materialise, in the interest of our workers, our consumers and our companies.
Â Â  I also wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy to his first Question Time in Parliament and to re-emphasise at the outset that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and objectives because they can create greater wealth and employment within the European Union.
However, turning to his reply, one of the biggest hindrances to cross-border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one-stop shop for registration of a company, that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State, it should be reciprocal in all other Member States, because the same basis for decision-making under the internal market rules should apply.
Â Â  . The country of origin approach which lies at the heart of the Services Directive will allow for the circumstances MrÂ Crowley has outlined.
As I said in my reply, it will allow companies to operate in another Member State without having to go through a multitude of further tests.
That is the basis of the country of origin principle as it would apply to the circumstances outlined.
Â Â  I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in this House.
I should like to ask him, in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity â aspects of the Lisbon Agenda â if he would confirm that he shares my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed, especially when Europe is compared to the United States?
In this regard, would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the workplace â which is greatly restricted in the EU compared to the situation in the US, in part because of the lack of affordable childcare facilities â needs to be addressed?
Will the Commission address this issue?
Â Â  . I welcome Mr Mitchell's contribution, but would like to point out that the matters referred to come under the remit of my colleague, Mr Spidla.
Mr Mitchell has gone into further problems relating to growth within the European Community.
The Lisbon process is about addressing these matters and, as you will be aware, Mr Barroso has made the Lisbon Agenda his top priority for our period in office.
I note what the honourable Member has said regarding access by women to the labour market and his comments about childcare.
I am sure other colleagues in the Commission will address these matters.
Â Â  I too wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy.
When it comes to the Services Directive, it is clear that not everyone has understood why it is needed.
I therefore think it would be appropriate, and shall also ask the Commissioner if it might not be appropriate, to produce a list of examples clearly showing how companies have, in practical terms, been prevented from contributing to economic development.
One example is the case of a French company that wishes to produce gravestones being prevented from doing so by Germans and exposed to threats of fines.
Can the Commissioner come back with a full and practical list of the host of problems we have seen in SOLVIT and in other contexts â problems to which companies are exposed and that prevent economic development?
Â Â  . We have produced such a document and I shall gladly send a copy of it to the honourable Member.
Â Â  Madam President, I know how hard it is to chair these sessions, but I wonder what relevance that supplementary had to Mr Mitchell's original question?
Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld seemed to have jumped back to the previous question.
I know my colleague Mr De Rossa had a genuine supplementary on the previous question and was refused the floor!
Â Â  MrÂ Martin, it is evident that the whole House takes a great deal of interest in this matter.
A great many Members had asked to speak, and there is no way for me to know in advance what Membersâ supplementary questions will relate to when I give them the floor.
Perhaps you should discuss the matter again with MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld.
The second part of Question Time has already overrun in any case, which means that Questions NosÂ 31 to 33 can no longer be taken, and will instead be answered in writing.
We shall now proceed to the next set of questions.
Â Â  . Madam President, I must admit that this is my first Question Time, but I am looking forward to it.
An opportunity to deal with specific issues should always be welcomed.
I shall now speak in English.
This was a question on education, which is indeed a very important sector in the framework of the Commission's relations with Latin America.
The importance of this sector has been stressed by the Heads of State and Government of both regions in Rio, in Madrid, in Guadalajara and at various different summits, calling in particular for the reinforcement of regional cooperation at the level of higher education.
The Commission is currently implementing cooperation programmes at national, subregional and regional levels in the field of education worth about EUR 300 million.
In particular the Commission is financing two regional programmes in the field of higher education.
One is the Alfa programme â , and the other is the Alban programme â .
The Alfa programme promotes cooperation between higher education institutions and other relevant organisations in the two regions with a view to human and institutional capacity-building, mobilising the civil society of both the EU and Latin America regions as a whole and therefore creating and reinforcing lasting bonds.
Alfa 1 covers the period 1994-1999 and AlfaÂ 2 the period 2000-2005.
Concerning allocations, Alfa 1 has a budget of EUR 32 million and Alfa 2 a budget of EUR 42 million.
The Alban programme was launched in 2002 at the EU-Latin America Madrid summit, thereby responding to the recommendations of the Rio de Janeiro summit.
The programme awards scholarships to Latin American nationals for education training at master and doctorate levels in institutions in the EU, as well as for higher training for professionals from Latin America in organisations in the Union.
At regional and national level, several education projects are being implemented, notably in basic education.
It is worth noting that the EURÂ 74.6 million programme is dedicated to education in the context of the programme for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Central America following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
In Nicaragua the Commission is contributing to the improvement of the education sector through budget support totalling EUR 62.5 million.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like first of all to welcome the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero, who, as well as having an adopted Hispanic surname, has a mastery of Spanish and is knowledgeable about Latin America.
Her reply has satisfied me.
She has told me what I wanted to know about the Commissionâs support for the education programmes and, in particular, for the instrument I referred to in my question, the Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State or Government, which is made up of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of Latin America, as well as Spain and Portugal.
I thank you once again, Commissioner.
We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues further in the future.
Â Â  . Since the answer has already been given, I have nothing to add.
Â Â  . As the Commission pointed out when it launched the poster campaign, the priorities of European Commission development cooperation are: to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty; promote sustainable development; build democracies; contribute to the integration of developing countries into the world economy; support good governance and promote respect for human rights.
The Commission is committed to helping developing countries achieve the development goals of the millennium.
However, there are important objectives and activities that go far beyond the millennium development goals.
For example, promoting peace and security and also supporting institution building.
A comprehensive, integrated approach is therefore essential in achieving sustainable development, as made clear also by the Treaty on European Union in Article 3, which emphasises the importance of assuring consistency of external policies and instruments in the context of external relations, security, development, economic and trade policy. This is also clearly stressed in the 2004 annual report on the Community's development policy.
The Community's external actions, including assistance, are further adapted to the diversity of our partner regions and countries.
The European neighbourhood policy is an expression of such a comprehensive and integrated partner strategy.
Similarly, our relations with the larger developing countries in Asia and Latin America in particular cover a broad range of objectives.
In this context, it is clear that bringing concrete benefits to our partners will make the world a better place, not only for the people directly benefiting from EC assistance but also for European citizens.
However, this does not change the overriding objective of the development policy of the European Commission, that is to eradicate poverty.
Â Â  Madam President, I am pleased with the Commissionerâs response, because I have to say that I was a little shocked when I read her statement of 2 December.
Indeed, one could have been forgiven for thinking that the objectives that she listed did not agree with the millennium objectives.
Commissioner, this issue has been discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control before.
In this respect too, you have encroached upon the area of development cooperation.
Mr Michel is the Commissioner for Development and I think that good agreements will need to be made, also in terms of statements made, to prevent what you said from being misinterpreted in the broader context of the millennium objectives.
I should like to ask you to consult with Mr Michel very carefully on this score.
Â Â  . Thank you for acknowledging that this campaign is going to the right development goals.
It underlines the key sectors of the external assistance policy, as defined in the development policy communication and in the development goals.
There are seven elements to the seven priorities of the European Commission intervention.
One is prosperity, achieved by trade and the private sector.
Second, security, which is being achieved via justice and regional cooperation.
Third is freedom, achieved by human rights and good governance. Fourth is food: food security and rural development.
Fifth, water: the water initiative protecting sustainable development.
Sixth, education: education systems and access to schools.
Lastly, the EuropeAid message â 'partnerships improving lives worldwide' â evokes the how and why of external assistance.
With regard to scope, the campaign is reaching out to over 150 countries worldwide.
It is establishing long-term partnerships, and its approach is to focus on ownership of projects in partner countries.
Priority areas results are also to be focused upon: there must be a demonstrable impact on people's lives.
This campaign has really gone to the heart of what we want to do and comes under the umbrella of the overall goals.
Â Â  .
In response to your call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, it is the Commission's judgement that measures such as sanctions would make the Israeli authorities less, rather than more, responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting solution. This is at a time when the EU is seeking to have a very constructive role in ensuring that the withdrawal from Gaza takes place in a positive climate, in cooperation with a new, and now democratically-elected, Palestinian leadership.
I fully recognise the frustrations of those seeking to promote the peace process when confronted by Israel's expansion of its settlement activities.
The European Commission has regularly expressed its concerns not only at the continuing terrorism and violence but also at the route of the separation barrier and the expansion of settlements.
Our wish is to address these issues through dialogue.
The Commission is seeking to develop relations with Israel and the Palestinians through the European Neighbourhood Policy, through support for Palestinian reforms and the development of political dialogue with Israel.
The action plan adopted for Israel includes measures to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on the importance of adherence to international law and the need to preserve the perspective of a viable, comprehensive settlement, which involves minimising the impact of security and counter-terrorism measures on the civilian population.
It is the Commission's view â and I believe this is shared by the Member States â that measures to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement would therefore be counterproductive.
Â Â  I fully accept what the Commissioner says about the changing circumstances.
Since I tabled this question, Mr Abbas has been elected as leader of the Palestinians and we have seen Mr Peres join the Israeli Government. That gives us some hope for dialogue between the two sides.
However, I would ask her, in her new role, to keep this Protocol under constant review and to keep the pressure on Israel to observe the contents of the Protocol.
I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
I ask her to continue to monitor the situation to ensure that products from those areas are not labelled as 'products of Israel'.
Â Â  . I can assure you that the Commission will certainly do that, because just before Christmas we had such a Council meeting.
This has of course been one of the important issues in the Council so we will try to do our best to get both parties to abide by their obligations.
Â Â  . The Commission underlines that the European Neighbourhood Policyframework is very important, and it wants to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged European Union and its neighbours, including Belarus.
A key principle of the 'Ring of Friends' is forging joint ownership.
The Union cannot impose its policy on anyone, but it is ready to convince its neighbours of the benefits of the ENP.
The Union is offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of its relations â from political dialogue to economic integration â on the basis of commitment to common values.
This offer is, in principle, also valid for Belarus.
Through the ENP, the Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus.
If and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place, it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP, with all the benefits that would bring.
Under current conditions, however, there can be no fully-fledged ENP action plan for Belarus.
The October 2004 parliamentary elections and the referendum were important milestones for Belarus under the ENP, but, unfortunately, Belarus failed to achieve them.
However, there remains a clear prospect for deepening relations, including under the framework of the ENP, provided that fundamental reforms are carried out.
At present, a key element â and this is also an issue in EU policy towards Belarus â is to support civil society and the process of democratisation.
In addition, Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from the relevant regional, cross-border and thematic programmes.
The Commission is stepping up its effort to coordinate assistance for democratisation and civil society.
Moreover, the Commission is also looking â and here I want go into detail â into the possibility of supporting civil society and the democratic process in a flexible manner.
In the first place, the assistance should be operational and managed in the country concerned. But the Commission does not exclude specific situations where a project would be implemented mainly outside Belarus.
The modalities for doing so need to be carefully considered in the light of the relevant rules and regulations.
Support for independent media and information dissemination is among the key priorities of EU assistance.
A radio or television station broadcasting to Belarus outside the country is an interesting idea, but requires further clarification as to whether such an initiative could be supported by EU funds under the existing rules and regulations.
As to the question of opening a delegation in Belarus, it must be borne in mind that the EU has limited resources for extending its network of fully-fledged delegations.
Belarus is covered by the European Commission delegation in Kiev, which has a technical assistance office in Minsk.
The Commission will look into the possibilities of allocating, within the existing structures, additional human resources for work in Belarus.
At the moment, opening a European Commission delegation in Minsk is not, however, being considered.
Â Â  Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate you on your first Question Time.
Your detailed replies would seem to indicate that the Commission will in fact be working very actively in Belarus.
I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belarussian authorities to be possible, even in the present circumstances?
Â Â  . Madam President, there can be no question of us cooperating with the authorities at present.
What we can do, however, and as I mentioned before, is to provide particular support for civil society, and also to focus efforts on working with the academic community.
I can tell you that we are planning to hold three workshops in order to identify exactly what we can do, involving non-governmental organisations and as many neighbouring countries as possible, as we share the view that support for civil society is the only opportunity available to us at present to bring about change in Belarus.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks.
Commissioner, it would seem that it is indeed essential to involve Belarusâs neighbours in efforts to support the development of civil society in that country.
Academic programmes and programmes relating to the independent media can only be implemented with the cooperation of neighbouring countries.
I believe that finding projects that might lead to additional funding for such measures would be the best way of ensuring that in future we will be able to establish cooperation with a genuine democratic government in Belarus.
Â Â  . First I should like to point out that I have already answered, in principle, the question of the media.
I clearly pointed out the Commission's opinion for the time being.
However, with regard to projects and money I can give you some examples: the EU's support for civil society is to be strengthened; the EU's TACIS programme â which amounts to EUR 10 million for Belarus in 2005 and 2006 â will focus on support for civil society, independent media â exactly what you wanted us to focus on; higher education cooperation including exchanges of students and professors; and alleviation of the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe.
The provision of information to the general public with regard to the European Union and the European Neighbourhood Policy will also be strengthened.
In addition, the Tempus Programme will finance exchanges of young Belarusian university students abroad, curriculum development on European studies and capacity-building in local universities.
As I said, Belarus is indeed eligible under the New Neighbourhood programmes.
It will therefore benefit from the European Neighbourhood Policy instrument as of 2007.
Finally, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights â the EIDHR â will have a more active role in Belarus in the years to come.
In 2005-2006 Belarusian applicants will be able to apply for support under two campaigns: 'fostering a culture of human rights' and 'promoting democratic processes'.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to know whether the European Commission is aware that these much-needed educational programmes are under the control of the Belarussian authorities, and therefore cannot be regarded as true support for the process of democratisation in Belarus.
I should also like to ask whether, in the light of the Commissionerâs comments, a sum of money will be earmarked under the EIDHR (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights) programme to support independent initiatives in Belarus, bearing in mind that over recent years not a single euro from the fund has yet been set aside for this purpose.
Â Â  . As I said before, we will have three workshops.
The last of them will be in Lithuania, which invited the Commission to work together with some neighbouring countries on new ideas and strategies; on what can be done with NGOs and others.
I will certainly take up this suggestion in those workshops to see what can be done, but it must fit into the framework of the regulations that are there.
However, we will certainly consider that.
Â Â  Questions NosÂ 38 to 41 will be answered in writing.
Questions NosÂ 39 and 40 lapse, as they are already on the agenda for this part-session.
Â Â  . The Commission has not been informed of any deposition by the Greek authorities concerning any of the facts mentioned by the honourable Member.
Since phone taps always require an assessment of the proportionality of the potential infringement of fundamental rights in relation to the public interest served by such measures, permitting phone taps as a means of conducting criminal investigations are in most cases subject to a court warrant.
When the competent authorities of one Member State in the course of criminal investigations in their own country need to carry out taps on phones or telecommunication services located in another Member State they must follow the procedures that have been put in place for that purpose.
The European Commission obviously does not have the means to judge the behaviour of independent judicial authorities.
The main European instrument providing for this situation is the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.
Until such time as this Convention enters into force, Member States can have recourse to the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and to Council of Europe Recommendation (85)10 concerning letters rogatory for the interception of telecommunications.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome you but you surprise me.
It is incomprehensible that the Commission should avoid commenting on a serious infringement of the basic rules of data protection.
We have had telephone tapping in Greece of Greek citizens by the Italian authorities in the absence of any Greek authorities.
Commissioner, a few weeks ago you were a minister in the Italian Government.
Why can you not pick up the telephone and ask both the Italian and the Greek Government what happened?
Â Â  . I would like to apologise to MrÂ Papadimoulis, but I can only repeat that the Commission has not received any information about this case.
At any rate, the Commission does not have the legal right to rule on a breach which, if committed, would have been committed by an independent judicial authority and not by a governmental authority of a Member State.
There are legal instruments available, which I pointed out: in particular, Council of Europe recommendations and the Council of Europeâs Convention on Mutual Assistance.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I think there has been another mistake here or something has escaped you.
Last December, the and newspapers reported extensively on telephone tapping; they even had special diagrams of a device which perpetrates this crime, in or out of inverted commas.
This device exists somewhere in Milan or southern Italy.
I wonder, therefore, how is it that you too have not yet found out about it, so that you can make the relevant observations today.
Â Â  . Of course, what MrÂ Mavrommatis said is correct.
The Italian newspapers have reported certain facts; nevertheless the Commission can and must remain within the scope of its legal powers, which do not include the power to subject the behaviour of judicial authorities to investigations or actions.
There are instruments, including within the national states, which allow a judge who has carried out an illegal activity to be prosecuted, but that clearly cannot happen at the request of the Commission.
Â Â  Commissioner, regardless of the facts of this case, when you next meet the justice ministers, will you make it clear to them that, under the various international conventions you mention and in the spirit of membership of the European Union, it is unacceptable for the authorities of one Member State â be they political or judicial â to carry out phone tapping in another Member State, without the express approval of that Member State?
Â Â  . MrÂ Martin, you are absolutely correct and this is certainly the right path to take.
As you are probably aware, in Italy it falls on the one hand to the Minister for Justice and, on the other, to the judiciaryâs self-governing body to take action against judges who commit illegal acts.
I have naturally passed this request on to the Italian Minister for Justice.
Â Â  . It is certainly true that there are different approaches to integration represented in the Member States.
Concept and practice varies due to a number of factors: different immigration histories and variations in the roles of government and civil society with respect to integration policies are just two examples.
The Commission consistently stressed that integration policy was by definition an area where subsidiarity is at stake.
On the other hand, all Member States adhere to human rights standards and shared values such as equality anti-discrimination, solidarity, tolerance, etc..
Through the ongoing exchange of information and experience, particularly through the work of national contact points for integration, we are now seeing a certain degree of convergence with respect to policy approaches, goals and targets. This was confirmed in December with the adoption by the Council of common basic principles on integration.
The publication by the Commission in November 2004 of a handbook on integration for policy makers and practitioners, which brings together examples of good practice from throughout the Union on introduction programmes, civic participation and integration indicators, illustrates that there are many common problems and shows how much we can learn from each other.
Best practice must be taken for what it is: ideas, lessons to be learned and suggestions which can inspire and inform policy makers in the definition of the policies required.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that clear answer.
I know from the previous debate that you take the issue of integration seriously.
The Commission has a real impact on integration policy and a direct role, for example, in the enforcement of existing directives, which are crucial to integration â I refer explicitly to the Employment Directive and the Race Equality Directive.
The Commission has played a strong role in trying to enforce these directives. They remain unimplemented in at least two Member States that I am aware of.
Will you use your powers in office to enforce such directives, which play such an important part in the integration process?
You have that power.
Â Â  . Yes, of course the Commission has such power, and I can reassure you that the Commission will use all its power to guarantee, stimulate and encourage Member States to fully implement all directives in the common European interest.
Â Â  Commissioner, I shall speak in your mother tongue in order to be forthright with regard to an old question: illegal immigration.
The landings of illegal immigrants will certainly not wait for us to come up with a common strategy before they resume in the Mediterranean.
Certainly, the only reason they are not continuing at the moment as well is because the poor wretches are lying on the seabed.
So I would like to ask, what is the Commission doing and what has been planned for the near future to help countries on the borders of the European Union â I am referring in particular to my country, Malta â in order to provide aid and to receive illegal immigrants in a proper manner?
What level of funding will be allocated for this?
Â Â  . The question of illegal immigration is one which the Commission considers to be a priority.
While we are preparing political actions and common European solutions, as you pointed out, we must also address the daily tragedy of desperate people.
The Commission can and must take action, and it will, in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of persons entering European territory are respected, obviously including those who enter illegally: the right to respect for human life and dignity is not a question of legal differences.
Having said that, we must speed up the strategic policies.
We cannot take advantage of a delay and thereby continue to allow an illegal influx, but we must immediately respect the fundamental rights of individuals and at the same time prepare common policies on reception, on the one hand, and the prevention of illegal activities, on the other.
Â Â  . According to Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, framework decisions are binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.
However, framework decisions 'shall not entail direct effect'.
Whereas, within the first pillar, the Commission has the authority to initiate an infringement procedure against a Member State, this possibility does not exist within the Treaty on European Union.
The situation described by the honourable Member certainly does not facilitate the Commission's role, but it does not prevent it from producing a broad range of policy initiatives, which have been the basis for the policy definition of the Union in the important area of the fight against terrorism.
The Commission has been playing this role very actively in establishing in June 2004 the revised action plan on combating terrorism, in updating it in December 2004 and in implementing more than half of the respective measures.
This is also evident from the submission, in October 2004, of four communications covering different aspects of the prevention, preparedness and response to terrorist attacks and from the adoption, in the same year, of a communication on mutual access to data relevant to the fight against terrorism and of several classified documents in the field of consequence management and the protection of critical infrastructures.
The Commission in general and President Barroso and I in particular are determined to work in close cooperation with Council presidencies to maintain the fight against terrorism.
This is very high on the agenda of the Council, including that of the JHA Council and the European Council comprising the Heads of State and Government.
Â Â  I am well aware of the legal framework in which the European anti-terrorism policy can operate as far as the Commission is concerned and you described it very well.
If, however, we do not wish to demonstrate collective hypocrisy, we need to say how things stand.
And the way they stand is that we have major conferences, with all the Heads of Government present, and afterwards they have a press conference, set out a decision and following this decision nothing happens.
The Commission itself admitted as much on 8 June 2004.
The question is, therefore: what is the Commission going to do in political terms to put the policy into practice?
Â Â  . The Commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implementation of the Hague Programme at the informal meeting of the Ministers for Internal Affairs and for Justice at the end of the month.
The action plan will be presented in May this year and I hope that it will be adopted by the European Council in June.
The action plan on combating terrorism will contain tangible measures and guidelines, precise deadlines for the Member States and binding obligations for a common policy to enhance cooperation, information exchange and protection for the victims of terrorist attacks.
These are the measures that the Commission initially intends to put before Parliament, something which we shall do at the beginning of February, that is, well before we draw up our proposal, and we shall then listen to Parliamentâs opinion on the concrete proposals.
Â Â  . The Commission agrees that the absence of comparable crime statistics makes the development of an effective EU law enforcement policy more difficult.
The Commission is working on a draft action plan on EU crime statistics. Member State crime statistics experts are being consulted on this draft action plan, which will be presented in the form of a Commission communication in the spring of 2005.
The two main blocks of the draft action plan are: first, the setting up of appropriate coordination machinery to ensure that Member States, the Commission and other key actors are part of the process of working towards common data-gathering methods and harmonised definition; the second element concerns the implementation of developing comparable statistics.
This will include many different components, to be developed over a period of time, such as definitions of crime types and an inventory of definitions where there is already EU-level agreement.
The Commission, in close cooperation with Europol and other providers and users of EU crime statistics, is developing this project on a step-by-step basis in accordance with Member States' ability to provide relevant data.
The Commission's draft action plan was discussed with European directors of social statistics in September 2004.
It was agreed to set up a task force to examine appropriate statistical methods for monitoring crime.
This task force will begin its work in May 2005.
I should also mention that the Commission is providing support for work being undertaken to measure statistically the quality and effectiveness of the judicial process.
A seminar on this subject, co-financed by the EU's AGIS Programme, was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Justice in Rome in October 2004.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for staying to answer the question.
I am very grateful that you recognise the urgency of this problem because with open borders across the Union, organised crime is free to operate and to prosper, while our police forces are national and cannot cross the frontiers.
So we have a real problem.
I am glad that you are treating this with considerable urgency.
Could you tell us who will be responsible for the coordinating machinery?
Will this be done by Europol or will it be done by the Commission â or maybe a new agency?
Â Â  . I do not think that we can or should create new bodies; I think that on the one hand the Commission should give strategic, or rather political direction to this sector and, on the other hand, the sector should have the chance to find different ways to use Europol, which as we all know is trying to extend its duties and its remit.
The Commission intends to encourage this progression, this expansion of Europolâs duties.
This is undoubtedly one of the sectors where work can be done.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks: some of my fellow Members, like myself, have been here since the start of the sitting, have submitted written questions and have not had the opportunity of receiving a reply in the Chamber which they could then counter with a further question, whether they were satisfied or not.
The Bureau and the legal departments should better consider the matter of Question Time and give proper thought as to the time allotted and how many questions can be answered in that time, because we cannot oblige a Member to stay in the Chamber all this time and then not have the satisfaction of receiving an immediate, direct reply from the competent Commissioner.
The situation deserves to be looked into by Parliamentâs administration.
It is absolutely intolerable for a situation of this kind to arise.
Â Â  MrsÂ Sbarbati, the Rules of Procedure lay down quite clear rules for the holding of Question Time.
A great many Members asked to speak on a certain topic earlier, and I could not give the floor to everyone.
In my opinion, the main problem is that many Members spend a long time asking supplementary questions, and do not abide by the 30-second time limit, which of course means that we are often delayed.
I will, however, bear your comments in mind.
I should like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone, and especially to Commissioner Frattini again for being prepared to remain so long in the Chamber with us for Question Time.
Questions Nos 46 to 76 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure.
We saw this House spied on in a disgraceful manner during the last election period, and it appears that this is already happening again, in that I heard yesterday that at least one attendance list from December 2004 was given â I stress given â to a Member in order that he might make a copy of it.
There are two questions I would like to ask about this.
Firstly, is there any basis in fact for what I have been told?
Secondly, if there is, is there any basis in law for this being done?
Â Â  I am not sure whether this is exactly a point of order, but, in any event, I can reply by saying that the Bureau has already looked into this issue, which has been communicated to the legal services, and we are awaiting a report from those services so that we can act accordingly.
Â Â  The next item is the Council Statement on the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, has the floor, and I would like once again to express Parliamentâs sadness at the death of her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, Princess of Belgium.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must say, it is always a pleasure to come to Strasbourg, the very embodiment of the European city, a city that symbolises the reconciliation between France and Germany, a meeting point for so many European ambitions and an intersection of so many continental dreams.
In addition to my pleasure at being here, I have the honour today to present to Parliament â the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe â the priorities for the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union.
The Luxembourg Presidency follows that of our Dutch friends.
I must pay heartfelt tribute to their hard work, their tenacity and their undeniable successes.
The EU made significant progress under the Dutch Presidency.
When it comes to an end, I hope to be able to say the same of the eleventh Luxembourg Presidency, which began a few days ago.
The experience of our previous presidencies might indeed prove to be valuable, but presidencies come and go and have different characteristics.
When I was President of the Council of Ministers for the first time, in 1985, there were ten Members of the European Communities; when I was President in 1991, there were 12 ministers around the table; when I took over the Presidency in 1997, there were fifteen of us, and now there are 25 Member States.
In 20 years the number of Member States has more than doubled.
The decision-making system has naturally become more complicated.
What a joy and a pleasure, however, to see the countries of Eastern and Central Europe take their place in the EU, in view of the fateful decree that sought to drive a wedge between us for ever.
The experience of our various presidencies and of observing the successive presidencies of other countries has taught me two things.
Firstly, the EU will not genuinely move forward if those holding the Presidency place their own national interests at the heart of their concerns rather than replacing them with the common interest, the best definition of the interests of everyone.
It follows that the EU will not find genuine coherence, let alone harmony, unless we all respect the spirit and the letter of the Community method and the balance between the three institutions.
The Commission is not a touch judge solely in charge of monitoring compliance with the rules of the internal market.
It should be the playmaker, the inspiration and the driving force of the team.
The Council, for its part, is not the field of play of exclusively national interests, however justified those may be, but rather a workshop of understanding.
The place of Parliament, for its part, is not that of a spectator watching from the stands.
It is an actor with privileged status because it is legitimised by universal suffrage.
You will, therefore, see me regularly in your offices, in your meetings and in your corridors in Brussels and Strasbourg.
I say this for myself, for my ministers and for all those who work in the service of Parliament, and thus in your service.
Together we must oversee the ratification of the new Constitutional Treaty in the right conditions.
It is true that the draft Constitution is not perfect, but we must not benchmark it against perfection; we must benchmark it against what Europe will need in order to remain an example to the world in the future.
Let us do now what must be done in order for this to be the case in the future and let us ratify the Treaty.
Let us not forget that the Treaty is a text that is of neither the left nor the right.
Its content will be the fruit of our convictions, of our will and of our ambition.
If our will and our ambition are perfect, the implementation of the new Treaty, which may be imperfect in theory, will probably be perfectly successful in practice.
The ratification of the Treaty will not be an easy task everywhere, and I have one major concern in this regard: let us not use the potential difficulties of the parliamentary ratifications and referendums as an excuse to slacken the pace of action or to avoid making decisions.
Let us not put off the most difficult decisions until the day after the first referendum, then until the day after the second referendum, then until the day after the third referendum, and so on.
When we ask for the approval of the peoples and the parliaments of Europe, let us show them that Europe works, that Europe is on the move, that Europe is decisive and that Europe is capable of fulfilling its responsibilities.
If the EU takes decisive action it can win over the doubters; if it is inactive it can put doubts in the minds of those previously convinced.
Mr President, when the new Presidency takes up its duties there is usually a solemn atmosphere, but that has been overshadowed this year by the terrible tragedy of the seaquake in South-east Asia.
The deeply distressing pictures of the dead, the injured and the devastation cast a giant shadow over the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005.
This tragedy will linger long in the memory and I hope that, in addition to the immediate emergency aid, we shall show lasting solidarity with the devastated peoples and regions of Asia.
I should also like us to ensure that the misery that we are seeing in Asia today does not make us turn our backs on the poverty, the underdevelopment, the hunger and the death of innocent people elsewhere.
Our hearts should be in places where the television cameras are no longer or have never been.
Mr President, the European security strategy encourages us to promote peace, democracy and stability in the fight against the root causes of insecurity in the world.
It is absolutely crucial that, in a coherent and coordinated fashion, we use the entire range of EU instruments in the Western Balkans, in the Middle East, in our relations with Russia and Ukraine and in our transatlantic relations.
The future of the Balkans, a region still traumatised by its recent past, must form part of Europeâs outlook.
The opening of accession negotiations with Croatia in March 2005, provided that there has been confirmation of complete cooperation with the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, will demonstrate to all Balkan countries that their efforts towards democracy will be rewarded and might bear more fruit.
For the other countries in the region, the EUâs general action framework will continue to fall under the guidelines of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which sets out the European perspective presented to the Balkan countries.
The Presidency will hold talks with Albania on a stabilisation and association agreement.
A further crucial milestone in the region will be a review in mid-2005 of the implementation of the standards policy in Kosovo.
We shall be paying close attention to the developing situation in Kosovo.
I am of the opinion that, whatever its status, Kosovoâs future rests within the EU.
The Russian Federation is a strategic partner of the EU and remains a major factor in European security and stability.
Admittedly, the state of our relations is not satisfactory at the moment.
I shall do all that I can to remedy this state of affairs, whilst remaining firm on our core demands.
I trust I can count on your support in this endeavour.
At the EU-Russia Summit in Moscow on 10Â May, the Presidency will strive for a balanced package as regards the Four Common Spaces set out at the St Petersburg Summit, which are based on common values and shared interests.
The EU will forge close ties with the new President of Ukraine, not least in areas such as the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
We have every interest in having a stable and prosperous Ukraine as a neighbour, a Ukraine that is strongly rooted in democracy, a Ukraine that is committed to the path of modernisation.
The Presidency will prepare thoroughly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place during the United Kingdom Presidency.
I shall now turn to transatlantic relations.
For the world to be a stable place, it needs a transatlantic partnership that works.
At the moment, transatlantic relations are not bad, but nor are they particularly good. Leaving matters as they are, however, is not an option that will satisfy expectations on both sides of the Atlantic.
Consequently, we must improve the quality of relations in the best interests of both parties.
We shall do this at the two Summits with President Bush â the first in February, at the US Presidentâs request, and the second in June.
We shall not focus on the differences of opinion that some of us may have had with the United States in the recent past, but we shall try to put the emphasis on a series of practical questions to which we must give equally practical answers.
Transatlantic relations would not be complete without Canada, and I am delighted that there is to be a summit with Canada during my Presidency, in which we shall be discussing matters of shared importance between friends.
The same applies, on the other side of the world, to our Japanese friends.
At this point, Mr President, I should like to say a word about the Middle East.
With the election of President Abbas on 9Â January as head of the Palestinian Authority, and with the prospect of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a window of opportunity has opened up to relaunch the peace process and to speed up the implementation of the road map.
That opportunity must now be seized.
Against this backdrop, I should like to offer my support to the Middle East conference due to take place in London in MarchÂ 2005.
This, I am sure, will represent an essential step towards consolidating the peace process.
Under the Luxembourg Presidency, the process of EU enlargement will be guided by the decisions taken by the European Council of last December.
We shall be opening accession negotiations with Turkey in March.
As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I hope that Parliament will issue its assent in April on the accession of those two countries, which will enable us to sign accession Treaties, also in April.
Mr President, we cannot bring the EU closer to its citizens if we remain incapable of meeting their justifiable expectations as regards internal security.
The new Constitutional Treaty paves the way towards definitively abolishing the âJustice and Home Affairs exceptionâ, in other words the complete integration of this field into the European Project by means of the rigorous application of the Community method.
Under our Presidency, justice and home affairs activities will be in line with this perspective, and our working basis will fall within the framework of the excellent Hague Programme, adopted by the Council in November of last year.
In order to ensure that the area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality, we must think European before we think national.
We must ensure that a European security culture is developed.
This is a particularly important requirement as regards the fight against serious and organised crime.
Driving forward the area of freedom, security and justice is in our view an essential, even existential, task.
We must first, however, optimise operational cooperation between the Member States; for example, we must ensure that information can be exchanged quickly and smoothly between Member Statesâ police forces and judiciaries.
This principle of availability will constitute a major step forward in cooperation between police forces and the Presidency will set about this task at the earliest opportunity.
We also wish to strengthen the European judicial area, which is based on both mutual recognition and the approximation of laws.
We shall ensure, in particular, that negotiations are driven forward on the European evidence warrant and on the possible establishment of a European criminal record.
This will make European security stronger and will not be to the detriment of public freedoms, nor must it be, since those freedoms form part of the European way of coexistence.
The fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority.
In this regard, I wish to salute the Spanish initiative to host a meeting of the Heads of State or Government in Madrid in March.
The Presidency, for its part, will place particular emphasis on combating the financing of terrorism.
As far as the strand of asylum and immigration is concerned, the Presidency will focus on three elements: strengthening partnerships with countries of origin and of transit; establishing a harmonised approach with regard to the policy of return and readmission; and the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders begins its duties on 1Â May.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we often refer â and rightly so â to the Europe of the citizens.
Let us not be under any illusions.
If we do not succeed in making the EU an area of work and well-being for all, the citizens will become alienated from Europe, from its Union and from the political project that underpins it.
In order to stave off that risk and to give Europe back its economic and social place, we launched the Lisbon Strategy almost five years ago.
We wanted â and we still want â to make the EU the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustained economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and one that respects the environment and natural resources.
After five years of qualified success, the time has come for a mid-term review, which we shall draw up for the spring European Council.
The first task will be to clarify the aim of the strategy that we are to pursue.
The Lisbon Strategy â a name that, to my mind, means absolutely nothing to most people â is in fact a strategy for competitiveness, growth, social cohesion and the protection of the environment.
It should be based on solid foundations of sustainable well-being for Europeans. We must act now in order, in the future, to guarantee access for all to the European social model, which must not be turned into a myth, but should remain, or rather, should return to being, a living reality for all.
If we want to keep the European social model intact, it must be reformed so that it can provide a response to the growth crisis, to under-employment, to the weakening of the fabric of society, to the loss of competitiveness and productivity, to the falling birth-rate and to the ageing of our populations.
Naturally, Europeans do not like reforms; they are scared by them and do not understand the reasons behind them.
We must explain to them that the reforms that we are proposing are intended to guarantee the survival and the viability of the European social model.
We must convince them that putting off those reforms would prove more expensive. We must prove to them that we are right to act and would be wrong to do nothing.
The bottom line is that we need to reinvigorate Europe.
The next step, when we draw up the mid-term review, is to keep together the three pillars of the Strategy â the economic, the social and the environmental.
I am well aware that Europe has a competitiveness problem, which largely explains its mediocre performance in terms of growth and jobs.
Of course competitiveness must be stepped up.
It is not, however, an end in itself, nor some neutral, self-sufficient benefit.
No, the competitiveness that we must seek should provide us with stronger and more sustainable growth and should be aimed at greater social cohesion and a more harmoniously-balanced environment.
Please let us not start a foolish and pointless debate over whether we should have more competitiveness and thus less social cohesion, or more social, and less environmental, cohesion.
If Europe wishes to be strong, it needs three things, and those three things go together: greater competitiveness, greater social cohesion and a better-balanced natural environment.
I say yes to competitiveness; I say no to giving up our social and ecological ambitions.
I say yes, for example, to opening up service markets, but I say no to social dumping, an element that some people would like to promote.
The bottom line, Mr President, is that we must find the right way of ensuring that the strategy is successful.
After five years of charting a rudderless course between success and failure, it is not so much a matter of knowing what we must do â because after all we do know â it is more a matter of knowing how we are to go about it.
It is essential that we make the European learning area a reality, step up the research effort, improve our education systems and foster lifelong learning.
This is what we must do, but how do we go about it?
We have far too many processes in Europe.
We have the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines, the sustainable development strategy, the internal market strategy, the small and medium-sized business charter, the Cologne process, the Cardiff process, and many others.
All too often, these processes become bogged down in bureaucratic procedures that lead nowhere.
The EU is more like a research unit âÂ a unit of unused research, at that â than a factory of ideas that are practical and are put into practice.
We must change this by streamlining our strategy.
Our strategy is essentially European, but its implementation must first be national.
We should like this strategy to remain essentially European.
It must be subject to a broad review every two years, or preferably every three years.
We cannot change strategy every six months, from Council to Council, according to the whims of the presidencies and to what is inspiring them at the time.
The strategy must be there for the long haul.
We should like implementation at national level to be speeded up and stepped up.
We are proposing that Member States should set up action programmes at national level. These should be designed in conjunction with the social partners and must be presented to national parliaments, which, along with the Community bodies, would monitor their implementation.
These national programmes would take account of the particular national and regional characteristics and should provide the possibility for assessing the pace and intensity of the respective national reforms separately and should make it easier to gauge the level of performance achieved up to a given point.
So much for the strategy and the way in which it is to be implemented.
We shall discuss this matter again together, Parliament, the Council and both of us with the Commission, which will soon present its summary report to us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partial reorientation of the Lisbon Strategy also invites us to reflect on the Growth and Stability Pact.
I beg your pardon, the Stability and Growth Pact!
Actually, I would have preferred it the other way round.
Yet as Europe was governed in 1996 by our old friends âÂ and not the ones you would think!Â â the second order was the one that was kept.
We began a review of the Pact under the Dutch Presidency and we should like to conclude it under the Luxembourg Presidency.
We are going to reform the Pact, or rather, to adjust its implementing measures.
Let me explain this by first detailing what we are not going to do.
Economic and Monetary Union needs stability.
We therefore have no intention of driving stability away, neither in what we say nor in what we do.
Stability is a founding element of the pact that forms the basis of the euro.
We promised a stable currency.
It will remain stable and it will remain strong.
It follows â let me say right away â that the Presidency will not propose to neutralise or immunise certain categories of budgetary spending applicable under the Pact.
It follows that the basic criteria âÂ 3% for the deficit, 60% for the debtÂ â will remain applicable.
It is clear to me, however, that changes must be made, not least in order that the Pact can take better account of the economic cycle.
During times of strong economic growth, Member States in the euro zone must, as a matter of priority, be required to allocate budget surpluses to reducing the debt and the deficit.
We shall enrich the preventative element of the Pact by means of a strong dose of extra stability.
During times of weak growth, on the other hand, Member States in the euro zone should be given more reactive room for manoeuvre as regards the budget.
The greater the efforts to reduce the deficit and the debt during periods of economic expansion, the wider that room for manoeuvre.
If, during periods of weak growth, a Member State incurs an excessive deficit, this situation and the consequences arising from it, not least in terms of the timing of correction, will be judged by means of objective measures of assessment.
We must avoid at all costs arbitrary political judgments that might lead to differing assessments based on the size of the country.
From this perspective, Luxembourg is always the loser.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, we shall have a proper debate when the time comes, in committee, without too many witnesses, on the comparison that could be made between France, Germany and Luxembourg as regards taxation.
It is a debate that will be interesting and informative for those who, I must say, view Luxembourg in a somewhat superficial manner.
Let me invite you to a calm debate about the Pact.
I am wary of extreme solutions.
I say no to those who seek to replace stability with brazen, unbridled flexibility, as well as to those who seek to set the Pact, as it is now, in the cement of dogma.
We need greater stability and greater flexibility to take account of the economic cycle.
Mr President, you would no doubt be surprised if I failed to mention the debate that we are to hold on the financial perspectives.
In front of you, I would not wish to detail the component parts of this â it must be said â difficult dossier, because your grasp of them is better than mine.
I shall simply say that the Luxembourg Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June.
I am not under any illusions, however.
The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time, by which I mean now!
If we do not reach an agreement on a common position under the Luxembourg Presidency, by 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, it will be politically, legislatively and technically impossible to meet the challenge of the enlarged EU.
Consequently, no institution or Member State will have any interest in playing extra time.
The absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidencyâs failure, which is only of very minor interest to me, but Europeâs failure.
Let us decide.
Let us decide quickly. Let us decide now.
We must spare Europe a long, drawn-out debate lasting 18 months or even more.
That would cause even more disputes and exacerbate the conflicts between the Member States and the institutions.
Mr President, I am relying on Parliament to drive forward the decision-making process on the financial perspectives.
We shall work with you, because your agreement is necessary.
You will not be handed a , I guarantee you that.
That, Mr President, is the thrust of our programme.
Presidencies come and go, but fortunately Europe remains.
We want to serve Europe with determination and passion, with the determination and the passion that long distances and grand ambitions require.
Â Â  Given the applause you have received, we can expect the Luxembourg Presidency to be very positive.
That is what Parliament wants to see.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the half-year that has just begun will feature a series of important landmarks that will determine whether the EU will be able to meet the objective of achieving a higher level of prosperity, solidarity and security for the citizens.
Much of what the Commission may accomplish during the coming years will be determined by the initial decisions taken during this term and by our capacity to resolve difficult questions and to achieve practical results.
I should therefore like to highlight, from the Commissionâs perspective, the particular importance of this Luxembourg Presidency in this first half-year of 2005.
Accordingly, the Commission will table the programme for the period 2004-2009 as early as 26Â January.
We hope that the other institutions can agree to this programme so that it can become not just part of the Commission's programme, but part of the programme for the entire Union, thus anticipating the provisions of the European Constitution, and we can then begin right away to work within the spirit of the Constitution.
Luxembourg has the responsibility of chairing the Council during this crucial period.
I feel that it is a privilege for us to have Prime Minister Juncker as President of the Council during this period, given his invaluable experience as Head of Government, his deeply-held European conviction and his well-known ability to resolve tricky situations.
From a personal point of view, it is a pleasure for me to work with my friend Jean-Claude Juncker.
Mr President, we have heard from the Presidency about its expectations and priorities.
Let me comment briefly on just three of the main issues that will be on the agenda of the Luxembourg Presidency; there are many others, but I wish to concentrate on three.
The first is the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
Europe is facing very important challenges, most of which were already identified at Lisbon 2000.
But we could say today that the challenges from globalisation and the ageing of the population make even clearer the need to adapt to increasingly difficult situations.
Europe's prosperity is under threat.
To tackle this threat we need more growth and more jobs.
If we continue on the path of low, diminishing economic growth, we put all our policies at risk, but in particular our capacity to ensure solidarity and security and to preserve and improve the European model.
As outlined in the Kok report, to be more effective the Lisbon priorities need to be refocused, streamlined and prioritised.
Too many priorities means no priority at all.
Growth and jobs must be our priorities.
The Commission is working on a report which will present its views on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and propose guidelines for future action.
At this point in the preparation of this report, two elements strike me as particularly consensual.
The first is the knowledge economy.
Returning to growth will require considerable investment in knowledge.
Companies cannot become more competitive without a better-prepared labour force.
Only well-trained people can ensure high productivity.
This requires unprecedented effort in the areas of research, development, education and training.
Particular effort will be required to involve young people in this investment for knowledge.
Higher productivity should lead to higher growth, which, in turn, would create more jobs.
I do not see knowledge purely as an instrument for other objectives: knowledge in itself is an important goal and a vehicle for self-realisation.
The second consensual point I can underline at this stage is about coherence in implementation, the delivery problem.
The coherence between national actions and European action is a critical factor for success.
This means better implementation of the objectives agreed in common, which, in turn, means more responsibility and more empowerment at national level to deliver the common objectives.
In this vein, the Commission report will also highlight clearly the importance of ensuring ownership of the revised Lisbon Strategy by the Member States.
All in all, I must stress that the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy is, first, an agenda for modernisation.
Whether we will succeed depends on our ability to establish an effective partnership between our institutions and citizens to deliver this reform.
I should now like to present to you our view of the financial perspectives.
The Luxembourg Presidency has rightly decided to put everything into striving to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June 2005.
It is right to do so, because failure to reach an agreement in time will lead to significant difficulties for the preparation of the programmes concerned.
It strikes me as important, however â at a time when a final negotiation might get underway â to point out certain salient facts.
We cannot have more Europe with fewer financial resources.
The Commissionâs proposal has not fallen out of the sky; it is the result of commitments agreed by the EU during the European Councils.
Nowadays, the Commission does not ask that the Union be granted funding for new projects, but usually that it be granted funding for commitments already made; Member States must honour the commitments that they have already made.
I should like, if I may, to point out certain issues on which I feel that the Union must not compromise.
The first of these is cohesion. Ladies and gentlemen, without solidarity there is no Union.
There might be something else, but not a Union.
Enlargement has had a far-reaching impact on solidarity.
The Union has new regions lagging behind in development, and some of the less prosperous old regions still need support. Financial solidarity is therefore all the more necessary given that regions lagging behind in development have the greatest scope for growth in competitiveness and job creation.
We must not disappoint the new EU Members, which have the right to active solidarity from the entire Union.
Secondly, we must not forget the question of competitiveness.
With regard to the Lisbon Strategy, I said that massive investment in research and education was essential. Indeed, European level expenditure very often brings more reward than national level expenditure without coherence.
I should also add trans-European networks to the list of priorities, given that the infrastructure that connects Europe is still in decline.
The third crucial aspect of the financial perspectives is that of security.
The action programme agreed at the European Council has major financial implications.
The programme known as the âHague Programmeâ has financial implications.
This means more action at European level so that the financial burden and collective security can be shared better among the Member States.
The citizens of Europe expect us to have the ability to work together. One Member State on its own, even the most powerful, cannot guarantee the best possible security if it does not form part of a joint, European-level effort.
The bottom line is that we cannot have more Europe with less money.
I hear people from time to time calling for a freeze on Community budgets below the level of the 2006 budget.
Let us be clear on this matter: that would be a Europe that reneges on its commitments.
I wish to state clearly that the Commission would wish to have nothing to do with a Europe of backtracking, a Europe of mediocrity, a Europe of reduced aims.
This is why I am delighted that the Luxembourg Presidency will do everything in its power to reach a compromise agreement this term.
Some people will say that this will be difficult, even unlikely.
I honestly believe that the longer we leave this, the more difficult it will be.
We therefore support the Luxembourg Presidency in this difficult, yet extremely important, task.
As for the Stability and Growth Pact, we welcome the fact that one of the Luxembourg Presidencyâs priorities is to ensure that multilateral budgetary monitoring will make a greater contribution to a strong, healthy and successful economic and monetary Union.
These principles underpin the Stability and Growth Pact and this Pact must be respected and must function properly.
Let us not forget that the single currency is one of Europeâs great achievements.
I remember before the euro came into force, certain experts, economists and professors, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, were saying that Europe would never be able to have a strong currency because of its lack of solidarity and political cohesion.
Nowadays, some are saying that our currency might be too strong, but not too weak.
The single currency is therefore an historic European success story.
We must not now jeopardise that great success.
At the end of 2003, the Commission initiated a reflection process on the experience that has been gained, in order to identify possible changes and improvements that might help us to implement the Pact more efficiently.
Convinced that the common interest commands that everybody comply with every rule, the Commission has been in contact with the various European bodies responsible for thinking together and for exploring together the most promising avenues, such as those tabled in our Communication of September 2004.
The Presidencyâs contribution will be instrumental in engendering a consensus of opinion.
We are already expecting such a consensus at the Ecofin Council on 18Â January.
The Commission will thus be able to put forward practical proposals to improve the implementation of the Pact and this in time for the discussions at the European Council in March.
In the next six months, the ability of the European Union to return to growth will be put to the test.
It will have to provide the financial means necessary to match its political choices.
It must work closer to citizens and regain their trust.
It must strengthen its role on the international scene and relaunch its strategic partnerships.
There is now a special opportunity for relaunching the Middle East peace process.
The European Union can and should give a greater contribution in this field.
I believe that the European Union will play a stronger role on the international scene.
The Commission strongly supports the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency on this path.
The Commission believes that this period is critical and that our institutions will need to work together even more closely to achieve results.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome to the House today the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission, and I gather that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission unveils its programme in Brussels on 26 January.
I see that as a splendid symbol for the ever-growing cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Future presidencies should take that as an example to follow.
Although we were very pleased to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia, visiting Jakarta as an expression of the European Unionâs solidarity, I would like to emphasise that, however necessary solidarity with the stricken areas might be, we must not overlook the great problems in Africa and in other parts of the world.
We have to consider how we can, in so far as we are able, take preventive measures, in the shape of an early warning system, in Europe too, for example in the Mediterranean.
We are very much behind you, Mr President of the Council, in what you had to say about the Community method.
Luxembourg may well be small in geographical terms, but it is a Grand Duchy and hence a great country, and the Benelux statesâ presidencies have always been excellent ones.
We wish you great success; for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats too, the Constitution is of the utmost priority.
In Brussels, we will have in-depth discussions on the Lisbon strategy, even though making the European economy competitive is not an end in itself, for the fact is that a strong economy is the best guarantee of good social policy.
We see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in Europe by way of growth and better conditions for European businesses.
For us, that is social policy in the true sense of the word.
Rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy, we need a sensible balance between them.
We also wish you and your presidency success in handling the financial perspective.
To those ladies and gentlemen â in this instance, no doubt, only gentlemen â who wrote letters arguing in favour of the 1% limit, we would say that you cannot enlarge Europe and then refuse the EUâs new Member States the money that is an expression of our solidarity, and which they need in order to be brought up to our standards.
To do that, we in the European Union need the necessary funding to be made available.
You have mentioned the treaties that are to be signed, but how, in the absence of any agreement by June and of any success in medium-term financial planning, are we to cope with the accession of new states to the European Union?
We are very glad that it is Reimer BÃ¶ge, a very competent member of our group, who will be writing the report for this House.
You also made reference to the Stability Pact.
I am very grateful to you for what you said, and I can agree with every word of it.
What you said boils down, in essence, to the need for more flexibility.
The thing about flexibility is that it is those states that have made provisions that have more of it.
To come to the point, then, the less indebted a state is, the more flexible it can be when times are hard for the economy, which also means that we have to do what has to be done to reduce deficits when things are going well for the economy, for we know that todayâs debts always end up being tomorrowâs taxes, and a burden on the public as a whole, particularly on the younger generation.
Let me just say something briefly about foreign policy issues, a number of which you have addressed, and â as I understand it â the President of the Commission is in full agreement with what you said.
Our support for Ukraine is only just beginning and will have to be an ongoing responsibility.
If I may turn to Palestine, where elections have just taken place, we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state.
The European Unionâs role must not â contrary to what we are told by not a few high-ranking representatives from the Middle East â be merely a matter of providing financial support, but should involve us, as an honest broker, making our contribution to bringing peace to the Middle East.
Turning to trans-Atlantic relations, I wish you, and of course the President of the Commission, great success with President Bushâs visit, which will usher in a new era of good relations with the United States of America.
We cannot have two groups of states in the European Union, each with its own way of maintaining relations with the USA.
We Europeans must unite in taking up a position founded upon partnership with our American friends, and so, as you, Mr President of the Council, have said, we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, bring determination and passion to supporting you, and wish you great success in your presidency.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the socialists are striving for a Europe of excellence.
For us, the Lisbon policy constitutes the best route towards European competitiveness, the basis of a good life, indeed a better life, for our citizens.
That is what is known as social cohesion.
The EU must stop complaining that Europe is said to be falling behind other regions of the world.
If Europe were no longer competitive, then how on earth could the Union account for the lionâs share of world trade?
In 2003, for example, the Union accounted for 40% of the trade in goods and 45% of the trade in services throughout the world, more than the United States, Japan and China put together.
Of course some of our industries are suffering from competition from countries in which salaries are low, but we will not make better products by dismantling our social model.
I should like to address the following remarks to some conservative and liberal Members of this House: protecting the right to work will provide workers with a sense of security and even well-being.
In other words, this is an important factor in workersâ productivity, and, in turn, in companiesâ competitiveness.
There is no conflict, but complementarity.
That is a quote from MrÂ Biltgen, the chairman of the Luxembourg Christian Social Party, an eminent member of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party ...
President Juncker leads a coalition government of the Christian Social Party and the Socialists, which is a benchmark by which to reinvigorate the Union on the basis of broad political consensus.
The European Socialists have high hopes for this Luxembourg Presidency, primarily from the point of view of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy and of turning it into a genuine instrument of progress, particularly at the level of the 25.
To this end, the macroeconomic framework must be redirected towards a policy of growth and stability.
Stability is a public good that must be defended in the interests of our poorest citizens.
There will never be stability, however, without strong economic growth.
The Stability and Growth Pact must become an instrument that provides a means of both combating public deficit and fashioning an economic policy in tune with the economic cycles.
Fiscal discipline is required in times of strong economic growth and more flexibility during periods of recession.
When it assesses each countryâs public finances, the Commission must also assess the quality of spending.
The practice of borrowing to finance running costs must be banned; borrowing must be confined to investment to prepare for the future.
There cannot be more Europe with less money.
A Union of 455Â million inhabitants cannot develop with a budget in 2005 limited to 1.004% of Europeâs GNP.
Relaunching Lisbon, the âintelligentâ Stability and Growth Pact, financial perspectives that actually offer new perspectives for Europe: these are the Herculean tasks facing the Luxembourg Presidency.
At the same time, we ask the Union not to forget the neglected people of the world.
If the international community is capable of offering debt relief to Iraq of some 80%, and if it wishes to offer debt relief to those countries hit by the tsunami, it must also be capable of cancelling the debt that wipes out any development in developing world countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is the eleventh Luxembourg presidency.
Mr President-in-Office, your presidency has high standards of its own to live up to and the high expectations of others to meet.
Simultaneously President-in-Office of the European Council and of the Economic and Finance Council, you are in a unique position from which to reach agreement on one of your biggest and most delicate objectives â the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.
Liberals and Democrats are pleased to note that in your presidency programme you say that 'all progress towards European construction requires adequate financial resources'.
We hope you will not be limited by dogmatic demands to cap the Union's budget at 1% for the next decade.
We are not profligate with European citizens' taxes and we insist that every euro be well spent and properly accounted for.
Nonetheless, we, too, recognise that the European Union has justifiable ambitions, whether to run a coherent security strategy, generous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion.
These all have a cost, and we should not limit our political ambitions by penny-pinching over what is, after all, a relatively modest budget.
I wish you every success in securing agreement in June, for I fear the approach of your successors in this, as in other matters, is unlikely to command a consensus.
My Group will call upon you to specify new arrangements for the Stability and Growth Pact, which underpins the single currency.
As 'Mr Euro', it is your right and duty to speak out for the euro and the euro zone.
If France and Germany are allowed to escape with a mild rebuke for exceeding the deficit limits for several consecutive years, if Greece is absolved from misrepresenting its true fiscal state to gain fast-track entry to the euro, and if Italy continues to be reckless with its budget while harbouring a public debt of over 100%, who will have confidence in those rules?
The Stability Pact needs adjusting but it also needs enforcing, with proper monitoring arrangements like those used by the IMF.
We will look to you and your Council colleagues to be vigilant and true to your commitments.
Your term in office will coincide with the mid-term review of the much vaunted and little respected Lisbon Agenda.
It is in serious danger of stalling.
Your commitment to a relaunch at this halfway mark will bear fruit if you succeed in completing the single market, in finding more funding for research and in promoting a favourable climate for entrepreneurship.
But do not try to be all things to all people.
Structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon.
Neither should you underestimate the challenge of enforcing existing directives.
Your proposal to make national governments accountable to their peers, as well as to national parliaments and public opinion, is a good one and the Commission must be entrusted to monitor the measures needed and not be afraid to name and shame the laggards.
My Group also welcomes your commitment to move to the Community method in matters of justice and home affairs so important to our citizens.
We also share your ambitions for enlargement.
New arrivals are on the horizon.
Bulgaria and Romania will shortly be joining us.
Croatia is a candidate country with which you must open negotiations.
Let us be clear, as regards Croatia, that we expect General Gotovina to hand himself over or be turned over to The Hague to answer the case against him.
Croatia cannot duck that issue.
As Mr Poettering said, we cannot ignore the momentous events in Ukraine in the last two months.
As a collective body of institutions, we must encourage the opening-up of that country and review bilateral relations in the light of new circumstances.
That is a task for your presidency.
In conclusion, as the Constitution enters its ratification phase, you may have three referenda on your watch, and you must do all in your power to make sure they succeed.
If political forces in Spain are allowed to raise the ghost of regional autonomy, if, in France, the debate is muddied by Turkish membership, if, in Britain, EU financing becomes an issue in the Constitutional Treaty debate, the whole thing will come crashing down around Europe's ears.
Leave those issues where they belong and make sure Europe gets the Constitution it needs.
Â Â  . â Mr President, today I have just discovered once again that Christian Democrat in one country does not mean the same thing as Christian Democrat in another country, I congratulate you ...
The same goes for the Greens, but at the moment, I am addressing the President of the Union and not the President of the European Greens.
That is the difference, Mr Poettering!
You said something very interesting.
If you are actually setting up a working group with MrÂ Barroso to look at the Lisbon process, I shall be very interested in taking part, in order to try and have everybody singing from the same hymn-sheet.
In fact, we agree with you and disagree with Mr Barroso; competitiveness must go hand in hand with sustainable growth, with social solidarity and environmental responsibility.
Mr Barroso forgot three of these four elements and this is why we need a working group between the Commission and the Council to have everybody singing from the same hymn-sheet.
We are on your side, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
As regards the financial perspectives, everybody is once again in agreement.
Paraphrasing Victor Hugo, I should like to tell you that letting stingy countries govern Europe is tantamount to letting a hurricane govern the ocean.
That is something we do not want.
It is apparent that when the hurricane governs the ocean, everything collapses.
If the stingy countries â by which I mean countries and governments that are very close to me â prevail with their 1%, Europe will be the loser.
We are therefore on your side, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the fight against any attempts at reducing the European budget.
Reducing the European budget is in fact tantamount to letting Europe collapse.
I should like to say one other thing â and this is very important â about education.
I refer to the debate initiated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development with the Programme for International Student Assessment.
When discussing education, it is important to have the courage to say what works and what does not work in the Member States. It is not enough to speak of the need to educate, one must also say that there are education systems, teaching systems in Europe that are counter-productive, reactionary and ideological.
To conclude, I should like to say that the tenth anniversary of the Dayton agreement and of Srebrenica falls during your Presidency.
I therefore ask Europe to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement, which might have been a necessary measure in its time, but which is unacceptable in view of the Constitution now in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Consequently, on the occasion of ten years since Srebrenica, I ask you, on Europeâs behalf, to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement.
Â Â  . Mr Juncker, I should first of all like to thank you for your introduction.
I would like to wish the Luxembourg Presidency success, and I wish it more wisdom than its Dutch predecessor had, although you have already made a little with your remark about the Constitution.
I urge you to give the public the opportunity to make up their own minds in a fair-minded manner.
My first question to you is a short one.
It was six years ago that the euro was introduced.
At the time, in 1999, European unemployment stood at 9%, and has remained at that level to this day, while economic growth has slowed down.
My question to you is: do you not consider it high time we submitted the euro to a thorough overhaul, in which you, in fact, could take the lead?
I regret the absence from your agenda of the continuation of the debate, initiated under the Dutch Presidency, on the control of animal diseases.
Had this slipped your mind?
According to your list of priorities, there are many misunderstandings surrounding the services directive.
Exactly what kind of misunderstandings do you mean, and who, in your view, is labouring under them?
Is it the Commission, Parliament or the thousands of workers who have already voiced their disapproval of this services directive?
From your wish to reassess the proposal in a more objective light, as you describe it, can I deduce that you share my view that the services directive is an extremely vague document that my fellow-countryman, Commissioner Bolkestein, should never even have tabled?
Does the Luxembourg Presidency have concrete proposals for amending the Commission proposal on the services directive?
If not, I would invite you to travel with me through the Netherlands.
You would be able to get to know those important public services, such as education and health care, that the directive puts in jeopardy.
I could also introduce you to those commercial service providers, including the coffee shop 'De Tevreden Roker' [The Satisfied Smoker] and the 'Picobello Escort Service' club, which would certainly be keen to become active in Luxembourg, or elsewhere for that matter.
To my mind, services of that kind are expressions of Dutch culture and thanks to the services directive, we will be able to inflict them on everyone.
You will gather that these last words were meant as a provocation, but I should like to ask you in all seriousness to take me up on my invitation.
We may then be able to have the desperately needed debate about the services directive, which seems to be absent in too many crucial places in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Juncker's speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise.
Mr Juncker, you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority, but your past statements serve to illustrate only the inconsistencies.
Whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the pact's original rules, you recently said that the credibility of the pact had been buried and that the pact was dead.
Is that still your opinion?
You also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate of some EUR 4 billion a year.
Is that so, MrÂ Juncker?
The rebate took to negotiate.
If your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June, then Mr Blair must have agreed in principle to surrender the rebate.
Is that the case?
With whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating?
Will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election, probably in May?
Finally, the UK Independence Party, and in particular my colleague Mr Farage, has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner.
More details will follow shortly and regularly.
Are you to be tainted by association with them, or will you be expressing your concerns and the pressing need for change?
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the Luxembourg Presidencyâs programme is packed with crucial issues for the future of Europe, including the priorities on the economic front: the Lisbon strategy, reform of the Stability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 2013.
My first point is that it will soon be time for the mid-term review of the level of implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
To give it a greater chance of success, the programme needs to make the individual Member States responsible for achieving the targets that were set.
To that end, I consider the proposal to specify an individual at national level to be responsible for putting the strategy into practice to be a very useful idea.
Secondly, with regard to the review of the Stability Pact, it has also been emphasised this morning that a reform is needed which can propose a more flexible interpretation of the Pact during times of recession, without bypassing the Maastricht criteria and without giving up the commitment to reduce the debt.
I am also convinced that steps could be taken to exclude certain specific types of investment from the calculation of the deficit in order to give a new boost to Europeâs growth and competitiveness.
Thirdly, I hope that we can really succeed in approving the financial perspective up to 2013 by June, so that the resources can be used to the full from the very beginning of the period in question.
I especially hope that the proposals â the Councilâs and the Commissionâs proposals on those important topics â are adequately discussed in advance by Parliament which, let us recall, is the only European institution that directly represents the sovereignty of the people.
Lastly, I hope that a European civil protection agency will at last be set up during the Luxembourg Presidency so that natural disasters can be dealt with in an appropriate manner, with particular emphasis on prevention.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, there are many in this House who have, for some time, been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now, and I am one of them.
The work programme you have presented is enormous, but you also have a reputation for working wonders, and it is to the wonder-worker in you that I would like to appeal, asking you also to give attention to the Membersâ statute.
We urgently need a fair and credible statute of this kind.
Somewhere between your country and mine is to be found not only the problem, but also the solution to it.
We are told that the German Government does not want one before the next elections, but, at the same time, the German model â as regards Membersâ remuneration rather than additional earnings and lobbyists â could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind.
We have to put a stop to the unworthy greed in this place.
This House must cease to be a parliament of the insatiable, or else serious damage will be done to democracy, which is what this place is all about.
Â Â  If the President-in-Office of the Council does not wish to reply to the very specific and precise questions that have just been put to him, we shall continue with the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Luxembourgâs Presidency of the Council in this first half of 2005 is very probably the last of its kind that we shall see.
Under the European Constitution, by the time my country is next in line to take its turn in the presidency, the presidency of the Council of Heads of State or Government will have been permanently reformed.
It follows that a last presidency â which is what this one is â must be a good one, and one whose successes will stand the test of time.
The biggest and most difficult tasks for our 2005 presidency have to do with finance policy; its agenda is dominated by the determination of the financial framework for the period from 2007 to 2013 and by a more flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The financial framework for the enlarged Union must be negotiated in such a way that an ambitious approach to the shaping of European policy is not obstructed by budgetary constraints at national level.
Europeâs 450 million inhabitants expect the European Union to be able to take effective action, and we will not be meeting their expectations by disputing over tenths and hundredths of percentage points, so it is vital that the Luxembourg Presidency should make a success of the tricky feat of giving the EUâs financial planning a European dimension.
In so doing, it will be acting in the interests of every European and of a Union that is not only enlarging itself but also, and at the same time, benefiting its citizens by putting its policies on an adequate and appropriate financial footing, failing which further rounds of enlargement will be quite beyond its capacities.
During the coming six months, Europeâs Stability and Growth Pact is to be reinterpreted in line with the economic situation.
It is in fact economic good sense, as well as the demands of a dynamic employment policy in Europe, that require that it be adapted to take account of the realities of the growth cycle.
The fact is that the Pact is about growth as well as stability, and excessive rigidity must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than promote it.
The Lisbon strategy faces its mid-term review on 22Â March of this year, when what has been achieved so far will be assessed and new priorities set.
The Luxembourg Presidency of the Council proposes that, by 2010, every Member State should have set in motion tangible and demonstrable reforms in every one of the areas in which the Lisbon strategy requires action.
That having been said, the EUâs economic environment will also undergo changes over the next five years.
Europe is not alone in the world in striving to improve its performance and become more competitive, and so the Lisbon reform agenda will have to be successfully implemented by 2010.
The Luxembourg Presidency is well aware of that, and will endeavour to ensure that its announcement is followed up by a stage in which progress is actually made.
Finally, it matters a great deal to me that something should be said, in this debate, on the epoch-making events in Ukraine, which is a European state, one that has, in the last month, demonstrated its desire to be one of us, and its ability to enrich the European family with its convictions and its experience.
If it should be under Luxembourgâs Presidency that a start is made on completing the map of Europe, we should bear in mind that Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania have a neighbour whose people see their future as being alongside all of us in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me just start with a brief comment.
I see the statute as too important an issue to be a plaything for demagogues, and so I would ask you to ignore the rabble-rousing utterances that have been made and go ahead with what you plan to do with all your strength and in earnest, addressing this issue and finding a solution to it.
Your speech, Mr President-in-Office, was a very good one, and I would like to congratulate you on getting the right balance between the economy and society and particularly on giving priority to employment and growth.
If I may be frank, that is an example to many, and not just to Christian Democrat Heads of Government.
I would, though, also like to endorse what you said about the foreign policy aspects.
Two countries in our vicinity â Ukraine and Palestine â have held important elections in recent weeks.
In both instances, the European Union played a very active part in bringing about change through democratic, open and transparent elections, and Europe must, as you said, hang on in there.
We must not disappoint the people whom we have, to some degree, motivated to summon up the courage to bring about changes, and whom we have helped to do so in a transparent manner.
Do not let yourself be discouraged, Mr President-in-Office, for you are quite right to say that the development we are promoting and supporting in Ukraine is not a development in opposition to Russia, but we must nevertheless try to work together with Russia towards finding solutions.
Ukraine must not become the ball in a game of power politics played by the European Union and Russia.
Russia must of course acknowledge that there have been changes that it may find disagreeable, but which the people themselves have chosen.
Were these changes now to be pursued to some degree in opposition to Russia, it would not be in Ukraineâs interests, for it is too varied and too diversified, and we know that it is those parts that are to some extent aligned with Russia that are Ukraineâs economic powerhouses.
Similarly, in Palestine, we need to remain involved and to continue giving political moral and financial support, as we have done for years, whilst always taking a critical line when it could not be clearly shown where the money was flowing.
We have brought about many changes and introduced a degree of transparency, including in the way Palestine is administered.
That is what we have achieved, and we will continue to do so if we get stuck in and, as has been said, do not limit ourselves to supplying funds but also help the Palestinian people to gain a state of their own.
The only way to guarantee security in the Middle East is for there to be both an Israel that is secure within its own borders and also a new Palestinian state.
Even if foreign policy is not one of your presidencyâs priorities from the word go, we cannot desert the people whom we have helped to bring about change; it is also in our own interest, in the interests of stability and our own continent, that we should help them towards the real political goal.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the presidency and congratulate it on its priorities.
I have four questions.
The EU faces very considerable challenges during the next six months.
Naturally, the half-term reviewof theLisbon process is one of the overriding issues.
It is time for European leaders to begin to act.
I much appreciate the presidencyâs statement that economic growth is important but that the other two pillars of stability are also needed, namely social and environmental development.
What, nonetheless, needs to be explained is not merely the fact that you intend to improve the Lisbon process, but the way in which you intend to do this.
The other issue concerns the energy area.
A better environment and improved self-sufficiency are naturally very important and bring about economic growth.
The production of biomass creates jobs in districts and regions with low economic growth and can contribute to a better environment and to more stable energy production.
How do you intend to combine the half-term reform of agricultural policy with energy policy and industrial policy?
Mark Twain once said that âAll you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sureâ.
Obviously, that is not the case.
Research policy needs to be strengthened, and we need a knowledge-based economy.
What will the presidency do to ensure faster achievement of the 3% target where grants for research are concerned?
Finally, the fourth area.
Nothing was mentioned about what is perhaps the most important legislative process under way, namely the Chemicals Directive, REACH.
We have the opportunity to create a global standard if we combine the Commissionâs proposal with better workability.
Uncertainty is very expensive both for industry and the environment.
How do you intend to work with REACH?
Finally, I should like to congratulate you on a very good presentation of the priorities and hope that, during the next six months, you will be able to achieve the objectives you have established.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted at the clear and courageous statements that have been made by the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to sustainable development policy.
The Luxembourg Presidency, to a greater extent than its predecessors, is attempting to maintain a balance between economic, social and environmental policies.
It is calling for something quite simple, namely that social and environmental policies be a starting point and not an end goal as far as growth policy is concerned.
I hope that this will be the line followed by the Luxembourg Presidency at the European Council and within the respective sectoral Councils, and I am sure that your proposals on the main areas of work, namely the Financial Perspectives, the reform of the Stability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process, will be guided by this spirit of sustainable development.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also hope that you will find the energy to convince the European Council that Europe should continue to act as the driving force behind the Kyoto process.
After the European Unionâs success with Kyoto, it is essential that it now set out a long-term framework for climate change policy, with objectives for the period 2020-2050.
This is what both our citizens and our economic players expect.
What guidelines will economic players in Europe follow when investing in key sectors such as energy and transport, if we have not laid down a clear framework for future policies in this field?
Turning to the Lisbon strategy, you noted that it related to three areas, namely environmental, social and economic issues.
It is the ambitious environmental policies of recent decades that have made Europe a global leader in environmental technologies and renewable energies.
I hope that you will revise Chapter V of the Koch report to ensure that the European economy can benefit from these ambitious policies.
The Lisbon agenda should also include an ambitious social policy.
The Commission is pressing for extensive liberalisation, in particular as proposed in the Bolkenstein directive, and I am glad that you have expressed criticism of this directive, Mr Juncker.
I hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will also take advantage of criticisms from within the Competitiveness Council to hold a debate on this directive, and, if necessary, to check its progress, as well as to force the Commission to table a directive on services of general interest.
I believe that confusion will reign over the Bolkenstein directive until the issue of services of general interest has been clarified.
I very much welcome the fact that this presidency aims to harmonise social, environmental and economic policies, as this is good news for Europe.

Â Â  â Mr President, the tsunami tragedy should be no less significant to the worldâs leaders and to Europe than 11Â September.
The Asian tsunami should act as a turning point for the most pressing of the worldâs priorities â that of preventing and combating hunger and disease.
I therefore wish to ask four questions.
Firstly, do you believe that the EURÂ 450Â million announced for reconstruction might undermine programmes already planned for Asia (as is the case of EURÂ 150Â million of the EURÂ 450Â million announced)?
Secondly, do you intend to back the cancellation of the debt of countries affected by the tsunami or do you advocate just a moratorium?
Thirdly, will they be treated the same as Iraq, or worse than Iraq?
Lastly, Commissioner Michel proposed to the last Council a more ambitious target than 0.7% for development.
Will you reconsider this proposal, or will it be jettisoned for good?
Â Â  My dear MrÂ Juncker, Luxembourgâs presidencies of the EU are usually among the best, perhaps because a small country knows that it cannot monopolise the agenda but that it must be of service to everyone.
I am sure that you will continue that tradition, and would also call upon you and the Council to treat supporters and opponents of the Constitution exactly the same.
Our buildings here are full of expressions of commitment to a âyesâ vote: âyesâ signs, badges and balloons, their presence decided upon â and paid for out of our common budget â before Parliament has voted.
It will not, however, be until this afternoon that we know the result, and it is certain that there will be votes both in favour of, and against, the Constitution.
Those in favour cannot steal taxpayersâ contributions to promote a definite view.
