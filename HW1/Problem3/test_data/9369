They will participate at meetings at the interparliamentary conference that will take place in Hong Kong.
I look forward to regular daily contact with parliamentarians, so that together we get this meeting right.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â Mr Mandelson, who is leading the âDoha Roundâ talks at the World Trade Organisation on behalf of the Council and the Commission, has succeeded in keeping his ambitions to liberalise international trade intact, in spite of the lowering of expectations regarding the conclusions of the Hong Kong summit.
The ambitions that he expresses â or rather, those laid down in the negotiating mandate â are identical to those that the captains of industry trotted out yet again in their statement of 21Â November, which called for greater liberalisation in agriculture and in access to the market for industrial products and services, and offered guarantees that the round of talks will be concluded by the end of 2006.
This liberalisation has only served to exacerbate inequality, a fact confirmed in the latest United Nations Development Programme report.
What they are looking to do is to control international trade within the framework of capitalist competition, in such a way that the large economic and financial groups would be in control of a countryâs economy, its agriculture, its industrial production, its services and its natural resources.
The reality emerging from the capitalist onslaught is a terrible tragedy.
What is needed is a new international order based on cooperation, solidarity, development, respect for the sovereignty of all nations, including their right to respond to their peopleâs needs and to manage their own resources.
Â Â  The EU could be a massive force for good in the world in the Hong Kong talks, yet we still cannot speak with anything approaching one voice.
As we in Scotland saw just this summer when hundreds of thousands marched through the streets of Edinburgh in advance of the G8 summit in Scotland, the people of Europe expect action, not more warm words.
Sadly, it becomes clearer and clearer that where the EU could contribute so much, we will continue our schizophrenic policies which only cheapen the image of the EU in the eyes of the developing world.
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is perhaps a coincidence that I am not only UK Trade Minister but also the UK foreign minister with responsibility for human rights.
It is a great pleasure to be present here at the European Parliament, and to speak to you as the representative of the UK Presidency and on behalf of the Council, on this important subject.
I welcome the European Parliament's interest in this topic â as shown by the public hearing here on 12Â September â and by the various resolutions you have passed on the matter.
I know from my own position as a UK Minister that there is a great deal of Parliamentary and public concern about human rights in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
This year, for example, I and my colleagues have so far received over 100 letters from UK Members of Parliament about the human rights situation in Vietnam alone and it is an issue that is debated on a regular basis within the UK Parliament.
We have a duty to respond to this concern.
Human rights must be an important feature of the European Union's relations with those countries.
This is right, not just because it is a matter of concern to people in the European Union; it is also right in itself, because we have a duty to help improve, where we can, the conditions under which the people live in these countries.
We must engage with these countries in an honest dialogue about human rights, being frank where performance falls below international standards, but also recognising improvements where they occur.
If we are to have such an honest dialogue with these countries, we must base it on an accurate picture of what is happening.
We harm our own case if we do not base it on accurate information.
All this also means that we must do all we can to work with these countries for tangible improvements in human rights.
It means giving practical support to ordinary people, alleviating where we can the impact of poverty, corruption and unemployment.
I realise some honourable Members believe strongly that the human rights situation in these countries is so bad that the Council must take punitive action â through blanket EU sanctions or through a cut or even a complete abandonment of EU aid.
Let me say right away that, while we recognise the strength of feeling on this matter, there is no support in the Council for such drastic action, because we believe this would risk harming the very people we are trying to help â the poorest and most vulnerable people.
We believe that a critical dialogue with the governments of these countries is the best approach â and that this engagement can and does bring some results.
Let me take Cambodia first.
The tragic history of Cambodia requires special measures to ensure the protection of human rights, and to ensure that we never again see the terrible scale of murder and devastation inflicted on the people of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge era.
I am pleased to note here that a number of EU Member States, and the European Commission, have contributed financial and practical support for the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
We look forward to the early start of the Tribunal's proceedings.
The Council shares honourable Members' concerns over the current political and human rights situation in Cambodia, and is following the situation closely.
We have particular concerns over the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, human trafficking, violence against civil and political activists, impunity and corruption.
We want to see real democratic development in Cambodia.
This means that government, political parties and civil society must work together to build an environment conducive to legitimate political activity.
Frankly, that is not happening in Cambodia today.
The Council is concerned over recent developments affecting the democratic opposition.
I appreciate that you also share that concern, judging from your resolution on Cambodia in March and the briefing Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian opposition leader, delivered to the public hearing here on 12 September.
Mr Rainsy has visited a number of EU countries, including my own.
The Council has expressed its concern over this issue several times recently; for example, on 15 February, over the suspension of the Parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition; and again on 19 August over the jail sentences imposed on members of the Sam Rainsy Party.
We are particularly concerned over the situation of Cheam Channy, who is in prison; the EU Troika raised its concerns over his case directly with the Government of Cambodia most recently on 11 November, during a demarche over freedom of expression.
We urge the political leadership of Cambodia to allow all political parties to operate free of hindrance or intimidation and to allow NGOs and all civil society to play a full part in Cambodia's democratic development.
In Laos, the Council has a number of concerns over the human rights situation.
We again share honourable Members' concern in particular over freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and the situation of the Hmong people.
We are aware that a number of Hmong people have emerged from remote areas in recent months to re-join Lao society and we are encouraged by reports that these people are being treated humanely.
We call on the Government of Laos to continue to do so, to ensure they are secure and free from intimidation, and to continue to provide them with the necessary humanitarian assistance.
The Council's contacts with the Lao authorities are limited.
However, I can assure honourable Members that every opportunity is taken to raise our concerns over human rights and governance issues; for example, the EU Heads of Mission did so with the Foreign Minister of Laos on 10 November.
We are encouraged by some recent positive signs, for example in the field of freedom of religion and in the creation of a Human Rights Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Laos.
The Council's relations with Vietnam are more substantial; and here too we work hard to ensure proper priority is given in our relationship to the issue of human rights.
We hold a regular Human Rights Dialogue with the Vietnamese Government, covering all key areas of concern, for example, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the use of the death penalty, and the situation in the Central Highlands.
The next meeting will be held on 12 December, but we use other opportunities to raise human rights concerns as well. For example, the EU Troika Heads of Mission did so during their visit to the Central Highlands last week.
Such visits are very important: they enable Heads of Mission to see the situation of the ethnic minorities there at first hand, including those who have chosen to return to the Central Highlands from Cambodia.
That is why the Council will continue to press for free access for diplomats and international organisations.
We welcome Vietnam's increasing cooperation with the UNHCR, including in the context of the tripartite agreement with Cambodia; and we welcome too signs that those Montagnard refugees returning from Cambodia have been well treated.
We will continue to monitor this issue very closely; and to work hard through development aid activities to improve living conditions for ethnic minorities in the region.
We use our contacts with the Vietnamese authorities also to raise issues of individual concern.
The EU maintains a list of prisoners and detainees of concern, and takes every opportunity to raise the issue of detention and treatment of people on the list.
I am pleased to report some tangible progress here.
The Council welcomes the release, so far in 2005, of 12 persons on the list.
These are positive steps and we hope the trend continues.
We also welcome Vietnam's agreement for the EU to visit two individuals on the list â Thich Quang Do and Than Van Truong â so that we can assess their situation.
However, 22 people remain on the list and we will continue to call for their early release.
The Council regrets, though, that none of those on the EU's list imprisoned in violation of their right to freedom of expression have been released so far.
While there are some encouraging signs, the fact remains that in practice freedom of expression is not respected in Vietnam.
This is a fundamental human right and a vital element of good governance; so the Council will continue to call on Vietnam to ensure protection of freedom of expression.
We recognise too that many of Vietnam's people are suffering for their religious beliefs.
There is particular harassment of members of unrecognised religious groups and house churches.
Freedom of religion should not be subject to licensing or state permission: it should be a matter for individual conscience.
Here too there have been some recent grounds for cautious optimism.
We welcome the 2004 Ordinance on Belief and Religion and this year's Prime Minister's Instructions on Protestantism as modest steps forward.
We want to see now a speeding-up of implementation of this legislation, an easing of restrictions on unrecognised religious groups allowing them to register themselves.
Vietnam must end official harassment of non-recognised religious groups.
To conclude, the Council shares honourable Members' concern over the human rights situation in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
Human rights remains an important part of the EU's relationship with these countries.
We will continue to raise these issues directly with the governments concerned, and will continue to press them to meet their international human rights standards.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to start by assuring you that the Commission in all its activities in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is committed to the principles of human rights, democracy and good governance.
The Commission has stated on several occasions that it agrees with Parliament that there are issues of concern in the area of human rights in these countries.
First as regards Laos, freedom of speech, assembly and association remain restricted and independent local civil-society-based organisations are not allowed.
The conditions in prisons are particularly harsh and a smaller number of prisoners of conscience are still in prison, for example, the remaining four leaders of the 26Â October 1999 movement.
On the other hand, in the last two years and in particular during 2005, the situation has improved.
Arbitrary arrests of Laos citizens seem to be less frequent and since mid-2004 no cases of religious persecution have been reported.
Turning to the situation of the monks in Laos, the Commission would like to reiterate that in Laos there is not a minority problem of the monks per se.
There are approximately 350Â 000 monks in Laos and they are represented at all levels of society including in the National Assembly and the government.
However, there are a number of insurgent groups consisting of between 1000 and 3000 people and composed mainly of monks which continue to oppose the Laos Government.
Regarding these groups, the situation has improved significantly during the last month following direct negotiations between the Laos army and insurgent groups.
Since March 2004 more than 1300 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, have come out from the jungle and been reintegrated and resettled.
According to reliable local intelligence there were no killings, mistreatments or persecutions.
As regards Vietnam, restrictions on the six recognised religious organisations and the lack of religious freedom for non-recognised groups continue to be a major concern.
The situation is particularly difficult for ethnic minority Protestants in the central highlands and northern uplands and for non-recognised Buddhists, Hoa Hao and Cao Dai organisations.
New legislation relating to religious freedom which has been adopted in the last two years has softened some of the tools used by the state to control religious organisations and allows hitherto non-recognised groups to seek official recognition.
It also explicitly prohibits forced renunciation of faith.
Having said this, much will depend on how the new legislation is translated in practice across the country.
In the case of Cambodia, the trends as regards human rights and democracy are more worrying.
Recent events like the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and the sentencing of two Sam Rainsy Party members undoubtedly raise scepticism about the commitment of the two parties in power in the coalition government to a genuinely pluralistic democratic system.
It also highlights concerns about the competence and independence of the Cambodian judiciary.
They constitute a further weakening of the opposition and risk stalling the continued development of the democratic process in the country.
As honourable Members might be aware, a strong EU declaration has been issued on this subject and I can assure you that EU concerns have been brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the European Union Presidency.
These trends are very serious and deserve our full attention.
The Commission, together with representatives of the European Union Member States, will therefore continue to monitor the situation very closely and remain ready to take further action should the situation deteriorate further.
On a general level, the Commission raises human rights concerns regularly and consistently with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
This is done through ad hoc EU troika demarches and in political and expert level meetings, including the joint committees which are established under the European Community Agreements with these countries.
In Vietnam and Laos, specific working groups on cooperation in the areas of institutional strengthening, administrative reform, governance and human rights have been established under the cooperation agreements.
These working groups complement and reinforce the dialogue on human rights by sharing experiences and conducting longer-term policy dialogue in areas of mutual interest, as well as identifying suitable areas for cooperation projects and cooperation programmes.
The Commission is of the view that the ongoing dialogue and cooperation at a number of levels and in various fora have proven to be conducive in building confidence and engaging the three countries on sensitive human rights issues.
It allows the Commission to channel EU concerns directly to the authorities in an open and constructive atmosphere, putting steady pressure on them to be more transparent and more accountable in human rights policies.
The Commission is convinced that engagement on human rights issues through dialogue and cooperation will continue to lead to improvements of the human rights situation on the ground.
Â Â  . Madam President, all three countries of former Indochina have been ravaged by war and now, sadly, they suffer from political oppression.
Over the past several years, they have begun to integrate themselves into the global economic community.
However, in Vietnam, for instance, citizens are still being persecuted for their religious beliefs and practices.
Whilst in theory the Vietnamese Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief, the countryâs courts rarely interpret the laws to protect a personâs right to religious freedom.
At the same time as the Communist government cries âpoorâ and seeks EU aid, its embassy in Canberra, for instance, allegedly spent almost one million Australian dollars celebrating 60Â years of communist tyranny.
Recently the US State Department decided to keep the country on the âcountry of particular concernâ list, as Vietnam started a campaign against religious communities this summer.
Police and the military have destroyed ten houses of Catholics in Quang Ngai Province.
Moreover, local officials also oppressed in particular the Montagnard, or hill tribe people.
People in the Central Highlands are suffering badly as well as the Catholic Hmong people and the Mennonite followers in the country.
Vietnam still restricts the press and tightly oversees internet users.
Cambodia, which suffered enormously under blanket bombing during the war and indescribable, murderous Khmer Rouge brutality, is now sadly suffering increasing authoritarian rule by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has arrested and issued defamation suits against critics who accuse him of selling territory to Vietnam in recent border negotiations as a way, of course, of silencing the political opposition in Cambodia.
I call on Thailand not to extradite those who are seeking refuge on its territory.
In Laos, members of the Student Democracy Movement have been in jail since 1999.
There is total control of written and broadcast media and attempts to put a stop to the internet with problems of human trafficking and forced prostitution.
The Hmong people are living in constant fear of being attacked by Lao soldiers.
I welcome the presence of the Royal Family of Laos, who are here in the distinguished visitorsâ gallery today.
Â Â  . Madam President, the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said that a rigorous assessment must be carried out.
The problem is that the assessment is never the same for the persecuted, for the imprisoned and, especially, for the families of the people condemned to death, as it is for those of us who, technically, are in a position to do this work.
The Commission has committed itself to continuing to work with full respect for human rights in the case of these three countries.
Of course, Commissioner.
In these three countries we are faced with three different situations, but in all three cases we can say that there has been less progress than we would have liked in terms of civil freedoms and rights.
In Cambodia, despite the fact that there has been some progress, we are still very far from being able to talk about political freedoms, particularly in the case of women and girls, who are victims of sexual trafficking, sexual tourism and of one of the most abject situations of slavery that any woman or girl can experience.
In Laos, as the Council and the Commission have said quite rightly, there are still prisoners of conscience and the entire hmong population is still being persecuted in the forests in an entirely sub-human situation.
In Vietnam â as has also been said â we are seriously concerned about religious freedom, which, according to the information we have received from human rights organisations, may in some cases be being increasingly repressed.
Finally, this Parliament can provide a voice for those places where human rights are being violated.
This Parliamentâs Human Rights Sub-Committee has worked hard to highlight the situation of these three countries and I believe that it is very important that any improvements or deterioration of the situation be communicated to this Parliament.
As always, the rest of the world, the world that is suffering, is waiting for us to act.
Â Â  . Madam President, on 3 February 2005, the parliamentary immunity of Sam Rainsy and two members of his party, Chea Poch and Cheam Channy, was lifted in Cambodia.
Sam Rainsy has since lived in exile in France and Chea Poch has also escaped the country.
Cheam Channy was arrested on that same day by military police.
Recent arrests, not only of politicians, but also of journalists, trade union leaders and other members of civil society, bear witness to a worsening situation in terms of civil and political freedoms in that country.
I call on the Commission and the Council to continue to bring the plight of the members of Sam Rainsyâs party to the attention of the Cambodian authorities.
A country in which an opposition party is thwarted in its activities to this extent must be called to account in respect of its responsibilities.
I should also, though, like to urge the Commission and Council to mount an independent inquiry into the implementation of the Paris Peace Accord.
Next year, it will be 15 years since the Paris Accord called a halt to the political conflict in Cambodia.
It provided, among other things, for a constitution containing basic principles, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Accord also put in place effective measures to prevent former policy and practices from ever returning to that country.
In Vietnam, there are positive reports about economic progress in that country, which is to be welcomed.
It is also positive that in November 2004, Vietnam provided the facilities for an EU seminar on the death penalty.
Nevertheless, in 2004, at least 82 people were executed and 115 sentenced to death, and the real numbers are probably higher, because Vietnam treats numerical data on the death penalty as a state secret.
In 2005, 24 actual executions have been reported so far, while 78 people have been sentenced to death.
In this connection, I would also like to mention the persecution of Vietnamâs Unified Buddhist Church, which is of direct concern to my colleague Marco Pannella.
I would call on the Commission and the Council to plead with the Vietnamese authorities for the total abolition of the death penalty, but in any event, in anticipation of this, the European Union must plead for the ban on executions and reducing the number of offences that lead to the death penalty.
In Laos, although no executions have been reported over the past 11 years, the death penalty is still in force and in 2005, at least seven people, including one woman, have been sentenced to death.
In general, I should like to ask the Council also to incorporate human rights in the broader framework of relations between Europe and the ASEAN countries, although it goes without saying that our relations with them have to do with more than just that.
We have economic and political relations; together, we fight terrorism, the drugs trade; there are scientific exchanges, and all kinds of other things. In my view, we should be doing more with the ASEAN countries rather than less.
Not least in view of China and India arriving on the scene, Vietnam is the linchpin in our relations with Asia, but human rights should form an integral part of this.
I am pleased that the Commission and Council have also hammered this message home, and we must without a doubt continue down this path.
I wholly endorse my groupâs policy in this matter.
Â Â  . Madam President, a few weeks ago we heard the testimonies of several people from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
Their testimonies were truly worrying, particularly in terms of fundamental rights violations.
In Cambodia, as has been said, it is not just the attacks on democratic plurality â arbitrary persecutions and detentions of several leaders â that are alarming, but also, as Mrs Valenciano has pointed out, the doubly worrying situation of women and children in that country.
In Laos, the humanitarian situation is becoming increasingly serious and it does not just affect the hmong population, but also many other ethnic and national communities; and what is more, local authorities are denying humanitarian organisations access.
In Vietnam, many people are still in prison for having defended the right to free expression or to be members of certain communities, peacefully or by means of Internet activism.
For all of these reasons, it seems to me to be reasonable, timely and necessary to call upon the Commission once again, and the Council too, to monitor these events closely and to promote the human rights working groups already in place in Laos and Vietnam.
I am pleased to hear from the Commission that they are operating, but we would insist not just that they must operate properly, but that they must also report back.
And one of the institutions to which they must report is this very House.
We have been asking this for some time and we are also doing so within the context of the debate on another report: the Agnoletto report on the democratic clause.
The important thing, therefore, is not just â I would insist â to work to deal with these issues, to work in favour of research and the monitoring of the policy implemented in those countries, but also â and this is the most important thing as far as I am concerned â to report on how this work is being carried out.
To report â I insist â to the European organisations, but also to the population in question.
Too often it is only those of us on the outside who know what is happening and how to solve it; sometimes it is also necessary for those on the inside to have access to that information.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have made tremendous economic progress over the past 10Â years.
We very much welcome this fact, but it is a shame that to date, these reforms have not been accompanied by corresponding reforms in terms of politics and civil liberties, as noted in the motion for a resolution.
Greater economic freedom is good news, but a serious lack of freedom of expression and of political and religious freedoms is quite the opposite.
The religious persecution suffered by Buddhists and Christians in Vietnam is particularly alarming.
Buddhist and Christian leaders are being held in re-education camps, and this month alone has seen the arrest of 84Â monks.
The monks belong to the Unified Buddhist Church, which has been banned for 24Â years and whose property has been confiscated.
The Catholic priest Pham Minh Tri has been in prison for many years.
A new law on faith and religion came into force a year ago.
It did not grant any real religious freedom, however, since the schools and universities that had been destroyed were not returned to the Buddhist community, to cite but one example.
We are also all aware of the fact that âprisoners of conscienceâ, if I may put it that way, are being held in Laos and Cambodia.
To sum up, greater economic freedom in this region is an admirable and commendable development.
Yet the same does not apply to the ongoing violations of human rights, by which I also mean the right to practice oneâs religion freely.
Mutual relations between the European Union and Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should be founded not only on greater economic freedom, but also on human rights, as noted by previous speakers.
These should include the right to practice oneâs own religion.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome this debate.
On 12Â September 2005, Parliamentâs Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing on Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, as has been pointed out by previous speakers.
For the ill-informed it was an eye-opener as to current human rights abuses, restrictions of freedoms and political and religious repression, with different accounts coming from each country.
This motion follows previous resolutions and strongly worded paragraphs of the annual report on human rights produced by Parliament last year.
The motion calls on the authorities of all three countries to make progress in specific areas.
In relation to Cambodia, the motion calls on the authorities to engage in political and institutional reforms, to release political prisoners, to combat corruption, deforestation and displacement of people and to take measures to combat the sex tourism industry.
In relation to Laos, we call on the authorities to release political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, develop a multi-party system where all views and opinions can be taken into account, respect religious minorities and their rights and allow UN agencies unrestricted access to all parts of the country.
In relation to Vietnam, we call on the authorities to promote and to allow a multi-party system to reflect different viewpoints, to end all repression of religious minority groups such as the unified Buddhist church and to release Vietnamese political prisoners of conscience.
At the same time, we recognise that there has been some movement in this area.
We also call for the safe repatriation under the Cambodia/Vietnam UNHCR agreement.
These are not unreasonable requests to make.
They are consistent with the value system of the EU in relation to the promotion of human rights and democracy.
The EU has formal ties with all three countries, with cooperation agreements on Cambodia and Laos in 1997 and Vietnam in 1995.
All of these agreements have human rights clauses.
They should mean something and there should be consequences if they are repeatedly breached.
Â Â  Madam President, I find this debate a bit of a curateâs egg: it is a bit of a mixed bag, as the situation in the three countries is very different.
Cambodia â where I was the chief election observer for the European Parliament in the last elections â is clearly a flawed democracy.
It is very clear that the Cambodian Peopleâs Party won that election.
However, their treatment of Sam Rainsy and other members of his party is clearly unacceptable and the Council and the Commission should continue to press that message.
In Vietnam, there is a market-Leninist state with a strong reformist movement leading to gradual improvements.
Nevertheless, the restriction on freedom of expression is something we should be pressing the country about, as well as the discrimination against the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam.
The treatment of the indigenous minorities, particularly in the Central Highlands and in the north is unacceptable by any international standards, even if one allows for their negative role in the national liberation struggle in Vietnam in decades past.
The real problem, in my view, is in Laos, which is an authoritarian and essentially unreformed regime, where there are limits on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association and freedom of religion and there is no effective political opposition.
I recall my colleague Olivier Dupuis, a former Member of the European Parliament, being arrested in Laos and going on hunger strike because of the inability to distribute material in that country.
Later on, my colleague, Ms Morgan, will talk about the situation of the Lao-Hmong people in Laos, which is particularly appalling.
We call on the Commission and the Council to continue to put pressure on all these countries to alleviate the human rights problems, which are different, but still exist in all three countries.
Â Â  Madam President, is there really much point in our debating human rights in these countries unless the EU is prepared to act on the stipulation in its bilateral agreements with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam that respect for human rights is a condition for the continuance of EU aid?
That stipulation continues to be breached on a daily basis, but we still pump in aid as if all was well.
All is very far from well.
I have time only to refer to abuses of religious freedom.
In Vietnam, persecution of Christians is rampant, being particularly dire in respect of minority Protestant Christian churches in Vietnamâs central highlands and the north.
The Reverend Quang and his associates have been relentlessly hounded by the Communist authorities.
When the President of the Vietnamese Committee on Human Rights addressed Parliament in December, he described Vietnam as a prison for its people, governed by a red mafia financed by the European taxpayer.
He may have overstated our generosity, but that was a stinging indictment of the EUâs attitude to countries such as this.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the human rights situation in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is particularly worrying.
The purpose of todayâs debate is to support strong and assertive action by all of us â Parliament, the Commission and the Council â in order to uphold fundamental human rights: the right to life and the promotion of freedom.
Since the end of military conflict â 30 years ago the war in Vietnam was coming to a close â and the fall of bloody communist regimes â such as that of Pol Pot â or violent anti-government â as in Laos â the international community has been actively cooperating towards supporting former Indochina in terms of development and democracy within the international forum.
Yet 30 years on from events that were so terrible and tragic for part of the human race, what is the state of play today?
Much has certainly been done, but not enough.
Fundamental guarantees of human rights are still not being respected: the right to life and to freedom of assembly, expression and opinion, to say nothing of the right to religious worship and the restrictions placed on Christians and Catholics, as well as on the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam.
What, furthermore, can one say of the squalid, shameful sex tourism which goes unchecked and through which young women â children, almost â are thrown onto the streets like so much butcherâs meat?
It is a disgrace which must be prevented and stopped.
It must be recognised that some progress has been made with regard to the right to religious expression: several dozen priests were ordained in Vietnam a few days ago.
It is necessary, however, to do more to win the battle for democracy and human rights.
In three yearsâ time we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
I hope that between now and then we can â via greater use of the instruments available to us, starting with financial instruments â achieve a genuine policy of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Madam President, I believe that to achieve this objective it is vital to involve the European Parliament in the work of the EU-Laos and EU-Vietnam working parties of the Council and Commission, with regard to administrative reforms, governance and human rights.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to talk about human rights in Laos.
In the middle of the last European elections, I watched a documentary about the plight of the Hmong people.
I told myself then that I would take the first opportunity I had in this House to raise the plight of those people.
I am glad to have this opportunity here today.
The Hmong people are an ethnic group that has been persecuted for many years for supporting the US during the Vietnam War.
When the Communist Party took over in 1975, thousands of Hmong people died because they supported the US at the time.
Many fled the country, but many others fled to the mountain jungles and are still there today, several decades on.
The documentary I watched showed a whole village â young children and old women and men â crying when the camera crew arrived because they believed that at last their plight would be shown to the world.
The Hmong people of Laos have been attacked using helicopters and ground troops.
They live a very basic existence and sometimes go without food for days on end despite being surrounded by edible berries: they would rather starve than give away any clues to the Laos authorities of their whereabouts.
This is fear that women and children, in particular, should not have to put up with in the 21st century.
I therefore urge the Commission and Council to consider very seriously what aid, if any, should go to Laos without seeing considerable improvements, in particular with regard to the rights of the Hmong people.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years after the end of the Vietnam war, which dragged Cambodia and Laos into its vortex, the position as regards human rights in these three South-East Asian countries still leaves much to be desired.
That we are repeating ourselves is irrelevant, for we cannot put the spotlight on these problems too often.
Laos is under single-party rule, and any kind of opposition is out of the question.
The country is cut off from the international community, without any freedom of opinion or belief, not to mention its being a centre of opium production and of the illegal trade in wood, and the mistreatment of juveniles that goes on there.
In Cambodia, the rights of women and children are disregarded, and the opposition and its supporters are suppressed.
The law courts have no independence, parliamentarians lose their immunity from prosecution, and journalists end up behind bars.
Despite economic progress and a certain willingness to take human rights issues seriously, Vietnam, too, imposes the most stringent restrictions on the expression of opinion and the freedom of the press, and is still, lamentably, suppressing the practice of religions, whether that means persecuting Buddhists or Roman Catholic priests.
For as long as people are ending up in jail for their opinions and beliefs, this is a problem that should be addressed not only in a resolution by the European Parliament; the Council and the Commission, too, should help promote good governance, the development of institutions and the implementation of administrative reforms.
Aid from the EU must only be given subject to these political conditions being met.
It is with this in mind that the joint motion for a resolution expresses not merely a pious wish, but an appeal to all the institutions of the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, the resolution now being debated is gaining wide support here in Parliament, just as it should.
In the area of human dignity and fundamental human rights we, as European politicians, have an opportunity and an obligation to defend these principles still more vehemently.
This resolution, as has been said, is a good indication of how we can bring committee business to plenary level.
The Subcommittee on Human Rights heard how there is real concern about the non-implementation of human rights in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
Perhaps with regard to Cambodia, there was formerly the desire to give the country time to normalise and recover from the Khmer Rouge era, but the time limit is now fast approaching.
When even the oppressed continue with the oppression, the rest of the world has to intervene in the issue of human rights.
This inevitably means that we must consider imposing conditions to put pressure on governments.
News, for example, of the detention of opposition politicians and reporters does not suggest that things are going the right way.
The international community needs to pay very special attention to the status of women.
It is a priority to promote the rights of groups that are all too easily discriminated against, such as women, children, and more especially girls, minorities, aboriginal peoples and the disabled, and it is excellent that the resolution should have focused attention on this.
We do not even have precise knowledge concerning the situation in Laos, as foreign human rights organisations are not allowed into the country.
We do know, however, that we can hardly say that fundamental rights have been implemented there.
As Parliament is now giving its broad political support to the resolution, whilst at the same time pointing out the existence of earlier resolutions, we will obviously monitor developments in these countries closely, and if the situation does not improve we will certainly return to this issue.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Members have stressed in their speeches, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are three countries where human rights are being flagrantly and persistently violated while the international community stands idly by.
Although these countries are making economic reforms that are necessary for their development, they are forgetting the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens, especially those of ethnic and religious minorities.
I would like more particularly to draw your attention to the situation of the Hmong population in Laos.
These people have been persecuted by the peopleâs army continuously for 30 years because their parents or grandparents fought on the side of the United States in the Vietnam war.
There are said to be nearly 20Â 000 of them surviving in the jungle under appalling conditions, conditions that fly in the face of the human rights principles we all support.
They live off leaves and roots and are so insecure they are forced to move their villages regularly.
Their children receive no education and suffer from malnutrition.
Several hundred of them surrendered to the authorities, but they were arrested or disappeared.
The central government denies the facts.
The international community learned their story recently thanks to the media.
It is time we opened our eyes and in particular strongly condemned this campaign of repression, extermination even, that is being conducted with complete impunity.
We must call on the Laotian Government to allow international and non-governmental organisations free access to the areas concerned â that is the only way those people will get the food and care they need â and, above all, press the government to integrate these populations into Laotian society with the fundamental rights and freedoms they have been denied until today.
We know that the Laotian economy depends on aid from foreign donors, much of it from the European Union; the international community and the European Union therefore have means of bringing pressure to bear on the countryâs authorities.
We hope, Madam President, that the Commission and the Council will heed these calls and help the populations of South-East Asia.
Â Â  . Madam President, I listened with great interest to Honourable Members' views in the debate and I very much welcome the strength of feeling that there is on human rights issues.
The governments of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam can be under no illusion that the Council takes human rights seriously.
These governments are fully aware of the strength of feeling within the Council, within the EU Member States and within the European Parliament.
In July, I visited Cambodia and Laos where I attended the ASEAN Regional Forum.
I went and saw a project in Cambodia which was taking vulnerable young people off the streets and doing absolutely terrific work.
I also saw a project being supported by the UK Government, which is providing training for police officers in Cambodia to crack down on child sex tourism.
I know that a lot of other EU Member States are funding similar projects in other countries that are doing good work.
I believe it is very important that we should be open and frank with governments where human rights abuses exist, but we should also offer words of encouragement where positive progress is made.
I note that today in the media, there is a report that sixty new Roman Catholic priests were ordained in a mass ceremony in Vietnam yesterday.
That is a welcome development, but we should not forget that human rights abuses still exist in that country, as they do also in Cambodia and in Laos.
We have had some very eloquent contributions explaining and cataloguing those human rights abuses.
I hope that Honourable Members here today continue to take every opportunity to visit these countries to find out the situation for themselves and to raise directly their human rights concerns within the governments of those countries.
When I was in Cambodia, I certainly raised the issue of Sam Rainsy and his party directly with Prime Minister Hun Sen. At the ASEAN Regional Forum, Javier Solana and I also discussed human rights issues.
The Council will continue to raise its concerns with these governments.
This means being open, honest and frank where those governments are failing to live up to international standards.
But we must base our concerns on authoritative information; we have to get our facts right.
We must also recognise and encourage progress where it is made.
Â Â  I would like to thank you for the discussion and particularly for the political emphasis and for the commitment shown by individual MEPs and the European Parliament in expressing adherence to the values and principles that underpin not only the European society, but also any free civilisation wishing to secure progress, human dignity and all lifeâs necessities.
I firmly believe that through this approach we are placing ourselves not only on the right side, but also on the winning side, the side of gradual change.
It is clear that a very different situation pertains in the three countries that have been discussed in detail.
We must not forget, however, that this situation is the product of a tragic history.
The developments of the last few decades clearly show that the situation has substantially improved, although it is still far from satisfactory.
Against this background, the European Commission, together with the Presidency and the Council, will continue to engage in constructive dialogue and apply political pressure for the democratisation in these three South-East Asian countries.
I would like to respond to the question on the provision of information and reports.
The Commission is prepared to make available the details of discussions held by the EU joint working group on these countries, and I firmly believe that the drafting and/or approving the clause on human rights and democracy in our cooperation agreements will also make an important contribution to these principles and values in international relations.
I would like to put forward one example that is important from the perspective of people to people communication.
Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of the second meeting of EU and ASEAN university rectors held in Leuven near Brussels.
It was a truly inspiring event that included a discussion on how to create the conditions for improving not only the dialogue but also the environment for freedom and democracy in these countries.
Through continuing such relations, for example by inviting students from these countries onto programmes and projects such as Erasmus Mundus, I firmly believe that we may help to bring about better conditions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the oral question to the Council by Nikolaos Sifunakis, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Olympic truce (O-0084/2005 â B6-0335/2005),
- the oral question to the Council by Maria Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on development and sport (O-0078/2005 â B6-0340/2005) and
- the oral question to the Commission by Maria Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on development and sport (O-0079/2005 â B6-0341/2005).
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education, the committee responsible for young people and sport, I particularly welcome today's debate in plenary on the recent motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture on the Olympic Truce, in the run-up to the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin next February.
The European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Culture and Education, as during the previous Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens, is expressing its support today for the idea of the Olympic Truce and is calling on the Council to take specific measures so that it will be adhered to during the games in Turin.
As you all know, the idea of the Olympic Truce dates back to the Olympic Games in ancient Greece.
In ancient times, the Greek city states which took part in the games ceased all hostilities from the seventh day before the start of the games until the seventh day after they had ended, so that the athletes, artists and spectators could travel without fear to Olympia in order to take part in the games and return home in safety.
From the ninth century B.C., when the institution of the Olympic Truce was born with the signature of a peace treaty between the kings of Sparta, Elis and Pisa, until 393 A.D., the year in which the Olympic Games were abolished, the Olympic Truce was observed for 12 successive centuries to the degree which it deserves and contributed to respect for the institution of the Olympic Games.
Today, on the threshold of the 21st century, the idea of the Olympic Truce is reviving, forming â we might say â the bridge between the ancient tradition and the modern world because, beyond the noble ideal which the Olympic Games profess, it is extremely important that we give this major sporting and cultural event additional momentum with the objective of establishing global peace.
In this way, not only are we reviving the overall idea of the Olympic Games, of which the Olympic Truce forms an integral part, but we are also giving new impetus and prospects to the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should like to reiterate, briefly, the steps which we have made over recent years in order to establish the idea of the Olympic Truce throughout the world.
In 1992, the International Olympic Committee called on the international community to cease all hostilities during the 1992 Olympic Games.
In 1994, during the Olympic Games in Lillehammer, weapons were quiet in Sarajevo and, four years later, in February 1998 during the Olympic Games in Nagano, the conflict in the Gulf was averted thanks to the intervention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Annan.
The General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted a series of resolutions since 1993, calling on the states to respect the Olympic Truce.
These resolutions have been accepted by all the Member States, which is a rare occurrence at the United Nations and proves that the idea of the Olympic Truce is an objective for the entire global community.
In July 2000, following the proposal of the Greek Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Georgios Papandreou, who was also the inspiration behind it, we safeguarded the Olympic Truce institutionally with the foundation by the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Government of an International Olympic Truce Centre and an International Olympic Truce Foundation, as a platform for debate with the objective of resolving conflicts and establishing the culture of peace through sport and the Olympic ideal and galvanising people, especially young people, into action.
It is worth pointing out that our honourable friend, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, was the first director of the International Olympic Truce Centre and coordinator of this endeavour.
The idea of the Olympic Truce comes from a deep conviction that sport and the sporting ideal can help to create a peaceful and better world.
It is the longest lasting condition for peace in the history of mankind and it is an exceptionally valuable tool for diplomacy, offering a vitally important opportunity for the peaceful settlement of crises through dialogue and education.
This achievement will constitute a small revolution in today's world.
I therefore believe that we too should contribute both with our words and our actions to making this a reality.
Â Â  . Madam President, the United Nations has declared 2005 to be the International Year of sport and physical education.
The year is also intended as an incentive to create conditions for more and better sports projects in developing countries.
Countries and NGOs are encouraged to do more in the framework of development cooperation and sport.
The UN is convinced that sport can make a significant contribution to achieving the Millennium Objectives.
This is the first time that development cooperation and sport have appeared together on our agenda, and it is something that I welcome.
Sport brings people of different races, classes, levels of education and cultures together.
Sport can make a positive contribution to social cohesion, teamwork, health, intercultural dialogue, and many other things.
It is also the perfect tool to reach the more vulnerable groups in society, such as people with a disability and children, and appears to be a marvellous tool whereby traumatised children â child soldiers spring to mind âmay come to terms with their traumas and be reintegrated into society.
That is why sport can play a vital role in terms of development.
It benefits those who like to indulge in healthy activities, both as individuals and as communities, because it can help create better relations between different groups of people.
Large organisations, such as UNICEF or Olympic committees in various countries, but also national governments, such as those of Norway, Canada, Great Britain and the Netherlands, international sports umbrella organisations, such as FIFA, are all carrying out projects in this area.
In the Netherlands, not just the government is active, but also NGOs, such as the NKS, the Dutch Catholic Sports Federation, have been working on sports projects in developing countries for years.
These projects have turned out to be low cost high impact projects.
Interesting examples can also be found, for example, in the area of education and health care and also in the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
Where development and sport are concerned, the position of women deserves a special mention.
In many cases, women are hindered in practising sports, for example, because of dress code or because they cannot simply leave the home.
Everyone should be entitled to practise a sport.
I am therefore pleased with the oral amendment that is being prepared to this effect in order to stress this point.
The question to the Commission and the Council is intended to raise awareness in Europe about the opportunities that sport can offer in the area of development cooperation.
I would like to hear from the Commission about the experience the Commission has of programmes of this kind, and also whether the Commission can, and indeed wants to, make a contribution to broadening the knowledge of the possibilities and to encouraging Member States to promote projects in this area, for example organised by sports organisation NGOs in their own country.
The Commission might even consider freeing up some funding.
In any event, I sincerely hope that this UN year of development cooperation and sport will be seized to take advantage of opportunities to do more in terms of development cooperation.
Â Â  . Madam President, in reply to Mr Sifunakis, the Council confirms its continuing commitment to the promotion of the ideals of peace and human understanding through sport.
Heads of State and Government at the Brussels European Council of 12 December 2003 supported the idea of an Olympic truce and welcomed the United Nations' resolution on this.
In addition, the Troika of Education and Sports Ministers stressed, during the launch of the European Year of Education through Sport on 29 January 2004, the importance of the Olympic truce and its message of peace, tolerance and friendship, its unique place in the lives of citizens and its positive role in the promotion of friendship and the breaking down of social and cultural barriers.
In reply to Mrs Martens, the Council would initially like to point out to the Honourable Member that activities relating purely to sport do not fall within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community and that the Community has no specific competence in the field of sport.
The Council considers, however, that measures and events related to sports can be a great help in promoting education, health, social cohesion, and in combating discrimination and ensuring an inclusive society.
The Council would also like to note that the educational values of sport were acknowledged by the Nice European Council of December 2000.
This acknowledgement confirmed previous declarations â in particular that attached to the Amsterdam Treaty â which emphasised the social significance of sport and its role in forging identity and bringing people together, and the Council's resolution of 17 December 1999, in which sporting activities were shown to have educational value, which can help strengthen civil society.
On 5 May 2003, the Council subsequently adopted a resolution on the social value of sport for young people.
The Council firmly believes in the valuable role that sport has to play in developing countries in promoting education, health and community cohesion.
It therefore supports the designation of 2005 as the UN International Year of Sport and Physical Education and welcomes the efforts made to promote the use of sport as a tool for development.
Poverty eradication and sustainable development are the overarching objectives of both the 2000 EC development policy statement and the revised European Consensus on Development, agreed by Development Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22Â November 2005.
Although education and health did not feature in the 2000 DPS, the revised European Consensus on Development Policy highlighted human development as an area for Community action.
We recognise the value of sport in promoting a healthy lifestyle and in preventing many lifestyle-associated diseases.
We support country efforts that use sport as an entry point to Community education on better health and HIV prevention.
In particular, the Cotonou ACP-EU Partnership Agreement foresees cooperation and self-support policies, measures and operations aimed at helping community-based institutions to give children the opportunity to develop their physical potential.
Sport and physical education should mainly be considered in the context of Millennium Development Goal Two to achieve universal primary education by 2015 and Millennium Development Goal Three to eliminate gender disparity in all levels of education, no later than 2015.
For the second Millennium Development Goal, the first priority for the EU in education for development is basic education, in particular primary education.
The EU is firmly committed towards achieving universal primary education and gender equality in education by 2015.
This is implemented at three levels.
Firstly, through international institutions, the EU supports actively the UN initiatives 'Education for All' and the 'Fast-Track Initiative', in partnership with other donors â UNESCO and the World Bank â as well as UNICEF in this field.
Secondly, through interventions at country level, increasingly linked to national education programmes and based on funding and policy dialogue with national authorities.
Thirdly, through supporting NGOs for projects oriented towards basic education.
The EU also supports non-formal education of young people in the framework of the Youth Programme.
As regards Millennium Development Goal Three, the EU is also very active in international fora, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Conference on Population and Development.
One of the key priorities in policy terms in promoting gender equality is granting access for girls and women to education, including physical education.
Many EU Member States support girls' education programmes, such as UNICEF's Accelerated Girls' Education Strategy.
In this context, the Council welcomes and strongly supports the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 60th session in September 2005, which emphasises the role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals.
The Council reaffirms the commitment to support developing country efforts to ensure that all children have access to completely free and compulsory primary education of good quality, to eliminate gender inequality and imbalance and to renew efforts to improve girls' education.
Lastly, it sets out the commitment to promote education for peace and human development.
Â Â  Madam President, I rise on a point of order under the Rules of Procedure which concern the possibility for Members of the House to ask the President-in-Office whether he would give way.
I believe the Rule in question used to be Rule 46, though it may have changed.
The Minister gave a long and interesting speech, but he has not answered the question about an Olympic truce.
He said this it not within the competence of the EU Treaty, but we have British members of the Olympic Council.
Perhaps he might be able to confirm to the House that he would be delighted to speak with his colleagues, including Her Royal Highness Princess Anne, to suggest that we take the resolution of this House seriously and that we press for what we are calling for, which is 16Â days of peace.
Â Â  Mr Beazley, you are wrong about the Rules of Procedure.
As you have already taken the floor to raise a point of order, despite not being on the list of speakers, I suggest that Mr Pearson may well wish to reply to your comment at the end of the debate.
Â Â  . Madam President, I have both an easier and more difficult task owing to lack of time.
Minister Pearson described many reasons why sport, education and social development are so important in our policies in the Union, but also vis-Ã -vis third countries and with regard to our developing goals, especially the Millennium Goals.
I fully agree with Mrs Martens.
Sport and physical education can contribute to attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
We welcome the work done by the United Nations in this field, in particular the creation of a special international platform on sport and development.
We also welcome the proclamation of 2005 as the International Year of Sport and Physical Education.
The Commission is, and will be, further involved in these activities.
In particular, we will now participate in the closing conference of this initiative, which will focus precisely on the issue of sport and development.
As you have mentioned already, this year was preceded by the European Year of Education through Sport 2004, which was a very important year for our area of cooperation.
I will officially report to the Parliament by the end of this year on these activities and on subsequent recommendations or conclusions.
I therefore believe there will be more time and space to deal with the results of this initiative.
Naturally, we are working on the basis of the Nice Treaty and the Declaration annexed thereto.
This limits the possibilities for the Commission but, in close cooperation with Member States, a lot has been done and a lot is on the rolling agenda of our Sport Ministers.
Nevertheless, when it comes to funding projects in the field of sport and development, the European Unionâs support for such initiatives could only be channelled through the existing programmes in the field of development cooperation.
This is already the case.
Projects using sport as a means for development have been co-financed, for example, in the field of non-formal education, social integration or to encourage women from disadvantaged communities to participate in sport.
I would like to confirm to honourable Members, and especially to Mr Sifunakis, our unconditional support for the Olympic truce.
On several occasions sport has been shown to achieve results where other means have failed.
The joint parade of the North and South Korean delegations under the flag of the Korean peninsula during the opening ceremony of the games in Sydney was an outstanding and very strong example.
In this context, I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament in view of the Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006, which is very near.
This follows a similar initiative on the occasion of the Summer Olympics in Athens in 2004.
The European Union should indeed take the lead in lending support to initiatives promoting peace around the world.
Let me nevertheless stress that it is for Member States to take the final decision.
I would like to assure you, however, that within my portfolio I will do my best to promote the Olympic truce.
To conclude, I would like to say that there is a strong and growing engagement in Parliament and the Committee on Culture and Education in the sports area.
I congratulate you for this, because it is important for the overall development not only of sport, but also of our European spirit.
Â Â  . â Madam President, sport is a human right.
Under this slogan, the United Nations is promoting sport as a means of avoiding conflict, as a factor for reducing poverty and as a means for broader development.
As we approach the end of 2005, of the international year of sport and physical education, it is important that we take stock in order to evaluate what we have achieved at European and international level.
The Committee on Development chose to carry out this review from the point of view of the contribution of sport to the promotion of education, health, development and peace.
Within the same framework, on Thursday 3 November 2005, 190 of the 191 Members States went to the headquarters of the United Nations and signed, in the presence of Kofi Annan, the text of the truce which would apply for the duration of the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin in February 2006.
The defence of democracy and freedom and the safeguarding of peace between peoples, the defence of human dignity and the protection of young athletes is the responsibility of all of us.
The Olympic Games, therefore, are a huge opportunity for the European Union to promote these ideals in its turn too, by calling on all nations on earth to respect the truce for the duration of the winter games in Turin.
At the same time, in the sector of development, support through continuing training programmes of physical education instructors and sports journalists may have positive results on combating racism and xenophobia and in safeguarding equal opportunities for both sexes.
Famous sports personalities such as Pele, Ronaldo, Zidane and many others are using their names, as goodwill ambassadors of the United Nations, to highlight the importance of the fight against racism and poverty.
Sport could also have an economic impact, in that a country that invests in the good physical condition of its citizens, starting with young people in school, may over the long term reduce health expenditure, given that, according to a United Nations report, 40% of illnesses on a global scale are linked to a lack of exercise and poor physical condition.
To close, the twentieth winter Olympic Games in Turin are a huge opportunity for the whole of mankind to respect the truce and, at the same time, to defend, in the name of sport, health and development within the framework of healthy competition.
In addition, the European Union will be the main winner with the efforts it is making to establish peace and progress in the world.
Good luck Turin, with a truce and development!
Â Â  . Madam President, sport can be the cause of war, Honduras being a case in point, but it can also bring people together.
North and South Korea, united in one Olympic team, spring to mind.
Sport can help societies heal their wounds; one thinks of the Rwandan football teams made up of Hutus and Tutsis, for example.
Sport can be a positive way of expressing rivalry between peoples without this ending up in bad behaviour or use of violence â just think of the Netherlands and Germany, but is also a tough business.
Children are taken out of developing countries and tried out on the pitch as child slaves in big European clubs and if they are deemed not to be up to scratch, we find them lost in Belgian forests, bemused, without a visa or money.
2005 is the Year of Sport and that is why I urge the Council and the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, to seize the UN Year of Sport and Development as an opportunity to make much firmer agreements on banning the recruitment and abuse of very young footballers.
That is only possible by means of long-term training and a visa requirement, with the club not only taking on responsibility for these children, but also, refraining from treating them later on as their property, but instead paying them fairly.
The Commission could mount the same campaign against racism on European pitches.
Here too, a European level playing field with European agreements between European clubs is imminent.
Commissioner, you are undoubtedly familiar with the Fair Network and all the good work they do and the support that you give them.
What I find objectionable, particularly since â as the Council spelled out clearly a moment ago â we have only just set up the frameworks for the European development policy with priorities for the Millennium Objectives and good governance, is that yet another â in this case UN â Christmas bauble will be added to the aid tree.
It is the wrong reflex at the wrong level.
I applaud the fact that games and sport in education will be linked up to developing countries.
I also applaud the fact that a number of Member States are actively throwing their weight behind this sports project.
I respect subsidiarity, but let the EU focus, via the Commissioner for Sport, on a number of agreements with European sports clubs, such as UEFA, on a ban on young football slaves and a clampdown on racism on European pitches.
It is better that we have cohesive policy such as this one than that development policy should become fragmented.
Â Â  . Madam President, I warmly welcome this proposal steered by the Committee on Culture and Education and its Chairman, MrÂ Sifunakis, for an Olympic truce.
It is true that the Olympic Games have a long tradition going back to Ancient Greece, just as MrÂ Sifunakis described so well in his speech.
It has also been part of that tradition that, during the Olympics, during those 16 days, there is an attempt to suspend all hostilities and allow nations to come together.
Then nations have also showed, and I hope they will continue to do so, that they can live in peaceful coexistence.
Sport is an excellent tool for this.
We would do well to remember that, unfortunately, we have not always been able to keep the peace during the Olympics.
Europe is well aware of that black day in September 1972 when Palestinian terrorists struck in the Olympic village in Munich.
In all, 16 people were killed, mainly Israelis.
Let this serve as a warning that never again should such an incident occur in international sport and when sports events are taking place.
On the contrary, sport, whose purpose it is to bring people together to compete in a spirit of fair play, should unite nations: this could be that source of wealth, that source of growth, which in the future we act to support.
It has to be said that sport is an excellent way of building a better world.
Now, as we speak of an Olympic truce, the word truce would appear to mean some sort of temporary peace.
Let it be our goal to achieve permanent peace between nations and countries, and let sport be instrumental in building this peace.
Â Â  . â Madam President, a major European intellectual of the last century said that the world had inherited three things from Greece: the Olympic Games, philosophical thought from Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and theatre from Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes and all those great Greeks.
I consider the most important of these to be the Olympic Games.
Greece started them in 776 B.C., when we all know what the framework of organised life was in Europe.
Greece therefore imposed the truce at that time. It said, 'There will be no Olympic Games while there is war'.
In the sixth century, when Alexander I, King of Macedonia, came to compete in person at ancient Olympia, two things were asked of him: first, the judges wanted to establish that he was Greek, which they did immediately, and secondly, they called on him to stop certain skirmishes in the north of his country, which term was respected.
The Olympic Games stopped in 393 for purely political reasons which we all know.
The Olympic Games started in 1896 and we saw war stop.
They were not held in 1940 or in 1944, due to the war with the Nazis.
In 1972, we had the tragic events in Munich.
The other two Olympic Games, in Los Angeles and Moscow, were sullied because the teams of the two big countries did not take part for political reasons.
We must therefore protect the Olympic Truce.
It is a proposal which comes from the depths of time.
Let us therefore call on the IOC for certain Olympic sports to be held in the country of origin of the Olympic Games, in ancient Olympia; for the marathon to be held there, on the classic route run for the first time by Philippides.
Only then will we give meaning again to the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Truce must come today into our lives, we must convince the big not to wage war on the small.
Â Â  . Madam President, 2005 is the United Nations International Year of Sport and Physical Education.
One of the goals of the international year is to create the right conditions for more sports-based development programmes and projects.
Sports transcends all boundaries.
Ethnic, religious, social and national differences play no role in sport.
Sport can play a vital role in encouraging development and sports projects can contribute to reaching the Millennium Development Goals, especially under themes such as health, education, gender, environment, peace and human rights.
However, the scourge of AIDS is robbing many developing countries of their finest young people.
I ask you to consider the World AIDS Day tomorrow, 1Â December.
There are 38Â million adults and 2.3 million children living with HIV.
During 2005, some 4.9Â million people became newly infected with the virus.
Around half of the people who become infected with HIV do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35.
These people would be at the height of their sports careers if they were not ill or had they not died.
Africa itself is one of the centres of the best footballers in the world.
At the moment, it is the continent most affected by AIDS.
I would ask people to remain committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Â Â  The fourth principle of the Olympic Charta, the most significant constitution of international sport, unambiguously states that sport constitutes a basic and inalienable human right.
Accordingly, a few European constitutions â such as the Greek, Portuguese or Swiss â directly grant the right to physical education and sport.
If the right to sport is granted by constitution, then the responsibility of the state in respect of sport, as well as its participation in and support of physical education and sport are unquestionable.
The Draft Constitution of the European Union, too, contains direct regulations concerning sport, declaring the importance of sport and acknowledging its significance in European societies.
However, as the ratification process has slowed down and is stalling, the inclusion of sport in the European Constitution â which would define the future of European sport â may be jeopardised.
Europe is the centre of international sport.
No other continent has such a significant participation in sports.
Public opinion polls indicate that 70% of European citizens come into daily contact with sport in some form.
There is not one family in Europe without at least one family member being affected.
Sport has a tremendous potential for bringing together and integrating cultures, nations and ethnic groups, as demonstrated by peaceful world competitions, Olympic games and world championships.
This is reflected in the fact that the UN and the European Union dedicated last year and this year to sport and education through sport.
It is unfortunate that in spite of the above, the importance of sport is not widely acknowledged within the European Union.
Sport is seldom mentioned in budgetary debates, if mentioned at all, as an individual budget item or heading.
Appropriate financial support has not been provided to enable the European Union to treat sport in the deserved manner.
I believe it is erroneous to take into account only the commercial aspects of sport.
The social role of sport far outweighs its commercial nature.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome the Olympic truce movement and the Olympic Truce Foundation and believe that the European Union should be involved in its work.
I support this resolution.
The Olympics and other global sporting events should be a time when all enmities are put aside between sportsmen and women.
All participants should be free to participate.
The visit to Middlesbrough by the North Korean football team during the 1966 World Cup and their recent return was graphically portrayed in a documentary, .
Yet I have a warning: this should not be used by the unsavoury regimes around the world as an excuse to evade EU sanctions â smart or otherwise.
If Robert Mugabe is metamorphosed into the coach of the Zimbabwean bobsleigh team, he should not be allowed to travel to Turin.
If Khin Nyunt is transferred to chief administrator of the Burmese windsurfing squad to visit my own constituency in Weymouth in 2012, he should not be given a visa.
I would make an exception if either were to compete, as nothing undermines dictators around the world as effectively as the worldâs laughter.
I also welcome the increasing role of the UN Taskforce for Sport for Development.
Djibril Diallo, the head of the taskforce, will be in Brussels on 10 and 11Â January.
He will meet Commissioner FigeÄŸ and the coordinators of the Committee on Culture and Education, and will address a meeting of the Sports Intergroup.
I hope we can build on this and that Members will participate.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian and an elected Member for Piedmont, I have recently taken part in numerous meetings and events in connection with the forthcoming Winter Olympics due to take place in Turin.
On the third floor of our building at the moment an event is taking place to present the Olympic truce.
Much has been said about the economic and tourism benefits that the Olympics will bring to Turin, but not as much â or at any rate too little âabout the social dimension and the role sport can play in promoting development, health, education and peace, as has been mentioned in this House.
Sport is a means of educating people and of setting up low-cost, high-impact projects, which should be vigorously supported and promoted.
We must, however, remain vigilant that sport is not used as a vehicle for propaganda â I refer, for example, to Cuba and to totalitarian regimes in general â or for spreading hatred or racism â I refer to the recent unpleasant incidents we have seen in certain Italian stadiums or the instances when the fundamental values of sport and competition are betrayed by athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs.
Â Â  Madam President, as has already been said, the tradition of the Olympic truce was established in Ancient Greece in the ninth century BC.
During that period, athletes, artists and their families, as well as pilgrims, could travel safely to participate in the Games and return to their homes unharmed.
Today, the proliferation of armed conflicts is a reality; the International Olympic Committee decided, quite rightly, to restore this notion from the Ancient World in order to protect the interests of the athletes and of sport in general, thereby contributing to the creation of a window of opportunity for dialogue, reconciliation and peace through sport.
As a Catalan, I must tell you that I am very proud that it was in 1992, on the occasion of the Barcelona Olympics, that the then Mayor of Barcelona, Pascual Maragall, called upon the United Nations to restore the tradition of the Olympic truce and to negotiate a ceasefire in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
It was not possible to stop the war in the Balkans, but it did ensure that its athletes could take part in those Games.
We must remind the international community of the importance of complying with this truce and appeal to the conscience and commitment of the governments to peace, mobilising young people in favour of Olympic ideals and taking advantage of the Games to make it possible to establish contacts between communities in conflict.
Finally, I support the present resolution in the hope that the 20th Winter Olympics will promote respect for and the continuity of the Olympic truce, which is beneficial to peace, sport and human and cultural exchanges at world level.
Â Â  Madam President, it is true that sport is so much more than just a game.
It is indeed an ideal tool to achieve a great deal in education and in a social context.
Obviously, arguments included in the draft resolution are just as valid for sport in Europe.
Sport promotes common values and should therefore not be treated in any way as a purely economic interest.
I know, as you know, that a great deal of money is involved in sport and that football clubs are often powerful businesses that are also run as such.
That should surely not be an argument for remaining blind to the enormous social role sports organisations play.
Many large and small clubs in the European football competition are socially active in community projects.
They involve young people from socially disadvantaged families, often with migrant backgrounds and with learning difficulties, in their clubs and they thus prevent the young people from slipping away and losing their way in society.
We must nurture and encourage this function of sport.
Projects in which local governments and football clubs work closely together for more social cohesion â as it is known â deserve support.
At the very moment that this debate is going on, a hearing is being held elsewhere in this building on football as an instrument against racism.
There you go.
I sincerely hope, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be on our side when we come to develop European sports policy â one that will, over the next few months and years, focus first and foremost on this undeniable social role both within the European Union â with or without a constitution â and outside it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of an Olympic truce or âekecheiriaâ, meaning âraise your handsâ â the Greek language is still extraordinarily relevant when it comes to conveying political activity â is as ancient as the Olympics themselves, when, in order that the games could take place, the inviolability of Olympia was guaranteed, so that those who went to watch or participate in the contests remained unharmed.
I believe that the Olympic truce is more than a mere call for an interruption of conflicts.
It is certainly more: it is a special opportunity to use sport as a message to build genuine lasting peace on a global scale and promote social harmony.
On the occasion of the 20th Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, which take place in Turin between 10 and 26Â February 2006, the Organising Committee of the Games and the city of Turin â in collaboration with the province of Turin, the region of Piedmont and the Italian National Olympic Committee â have also been involved in laying on a rich programme of initiatives to support and promote the Olympic truce.
These include numerous events at national and international levels on the subjects of peace, justice and solidarity.
We believe that the European Parliament should also vigorously support this initiative in order to bolster the spirit of peace and mutual respect.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the city of Turin has, on the occasion of the Olympic Games, promoted an initiative of international cooperation among cities in order to support and promote the Olympic truce.
In Ancient Greece the Olympic truce signalled an interruption of hostilities: all the then known world came to a stop.
On the occasion of the forthcoming Olympic Games, Turin has sent out a message of hope and peace, presenting itself as a sacred and safe city and supporting the Olympic truce even in modern times.
Turin is trying, in fact, to make cities the protagonists in building peace between nations.
As a great Italian, Giorgio La Pira, used to say: âUnite cities to unite nationsâ.
The first initiative of the modern era dates from 1992 when, following a call from the International Olympic Committee, the athletes of the former Yugoslavia were allowed to take part in the Barcelona Games.
On 3Â November 2005 the United Nations General Assembly approved the resolution for the Olympic truce for Turin 2006, a resolution presented to Italy and signed by 190 nations.
Today the Olympic Games are showing their true value.
The truce is a call for peace that ignores all political persuasions and, as such, cannot be exploited by anyone in any circumstances ...
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Sifunakis and Mr Berlinguer for this wonderful initiative.
It would be really nice to have peace or at least a ceasefire all over the world during the next Olympic Games.
Perhaps, according to some critics, this initiative could seem to be a naive approach.
However, sometimes we have to show that our assembly is not only a legislation factory: we are also a moral forum distributing European values and the message of peace.
If only some of the countries in the world follow our initiative, we shall save many lives.
The sportsmen from countries with troubles will know that their loved ones are safe at home, which will inspire them to move faster, higher and stronger, as Baron de Coubertin said.
If we are speaking about naivety, the fall of the Berlin wall seemed to be a naive dream for decades and then it became a reality.
Perhaps the Olympic truce will also become a reality for us and the coming generations.
Â Â  â Mr President, you cannot play and wage war at the same time.
You cannot send some of your young people to a sports ground to compete in peace and some of your young people to a battle field to be killed.
That is the simple message of the Olympic Truce: the Olympic Truce is not a magic wand for resolving wars; it is a window of opportunity.
Six years ago, in view of the forthcoming Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and the International Olympic Committee, represented at the time by Samarand and Papandreou, reinstituted this institution.
Today, this romantic idea now has weight.
The United Nations have approved it unanimously.
No other resolution in the history of the United Nations has ever had unanimous support.
Leaders from all over the world have signed it.
In 1994, ten thousand children in Bosnia were vaccinated because there was a day's truce.
Was this a romantic move?
Surely not for the children.
In 2004, in Athens, North and South Korea paraded in the stadium under one flag.
Romantic?
Only the Olympic Games managed it.
May we Europeans, in a European Union which was born of war, send out a similar symbolic message.
May we all parade at the Olympic Games with our own flag in one hand and the European flag in the other.
There is no reason why we should not.
It could happen and we should request it.
Â Â  Very good, I let you have a little more time because you are a Greek.
Â Â  . Mr President, I fully subscribe to many important positive messages on the two motions for resolutions on which you will vote tomorrow.
If I were a Member of the Parliament I would vote the same way.
I am sure that sport can bring a lot of values or fruits for our other policies in and around the Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am an unashamed sports fan.
I believe that sport has the power to transform lives.
It can give people life chances that they may never have imagined they could have in their lives.
It can improve peopleâs lifestyles, their health and wellbeing; it can lift up the spirits and it can be just great fun.
For somebody who played rugby for the best part of 30Â years, I know just how much fun playing sport actively can be.
I just want to make it very clear that the Presidency very much supports the Olympic truce initiative. We believe it is a very important and significant initiative.
All the UN countries agreed a resolution on the Olympic truce at their general assembly on 3Â November, so this truce is supported by all EU Member States.
We agree, of course, with Mr Takkula that our long-term aim should be for permanent peace, rather than just during the Olympic Games.
However, to see peace during the period of the Turin Games will be a step forward.
If that can continue to Beijing in the Summer Olympics in 2008 and to London in 2012, nobody would be more delighted than myself, the Council and I am sure everybody listening to this debate here today.
I would like to agree with Mr van den Berg that is very important to tackle racism in football.
In fact, this was one of the issues that sports ministers discussed when they looked at how to promote diversity and equal opportunities at a meeting in Liverpool in the UK in September.
As part of that discussion, ministers heard from UEFA about the work that it is doing to tackle racism in football.
The motions for resolutions on this subject that will be put to the vote here tomorrow are very important.
On behalf of the Council, I can say that we certainly welcome the questions; we encourage the Olympic truce initiative and support the motions for resolutions before you.
Â Â  I have received two motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2)/108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â This resolution concerns a policy area that should fall outside the competence of the EU.
The resolution emphasises the social significance of sports organisations and their importance in producing tolerance, cooperation, team spirit and solidarity.
It may certainly be the case that they give rise to these qualities, but why should the EU make efforts in this area?
There is no reason for the EU to create a budget heading for sports-based development programmes and projects.
Nor is there any cause for it to set up programmes aimed at increasing physical education teachersâ knowledge and experience of development and sport.
These are national, or even regional, issues.
The resolution advocates that sports journalists be trained using EU funds so that they might learn to avoid stereotyping, discriminatory phraseology and racist expressions.
It is important to combat racism and discrimination, but it is not necessary to take action at EU level in connection with this kind of programme.
These are issues on which each country should decide for itself and on which the EU should have absolutely no say.
The EU should work on truly cross-border issues that are not being dealt with satisfactorily by existing international organisations.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  October 27â28 marked the renewal of negotiations on the Trans-Dniester region, which are now being carried out under the âfive plus twoâ principle: Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE, Moldova and the Trans-Dniester region, the five previous participants in the negotiations, were joined by the USA and the European Union, both taking part as observers.
Moldova has more than once declared its intentions for European integration, but the most acute obstacle the country is facing is the Trans-Dniester issue.
Admittedly, one cannot expect immediate important results right at the beginning of the renewed negotiations.
However, I would like to point out that the biggest concern lies in the fact that the USA and the European Union have signed a document treating the two parts of Moldova as equal parties to the conflict, with Russia being an intermediary.
I am convinced that the EU has failed to take a well-considered position in this particular case.
Its position is flawed because the Trans-Dniester issue amounts to a conflict between Russia and Moldova, i.e. Russia should not be considered as an intermediary.
Â Â  Mr President, there are certain matters to which I beg you, or the President of this House, to give your attention, and they are as follows.
There are major problems in this Parliamentâs delegation in the EU/FYROM â that is to say, Macedonia â Joint Parliamentary Committee, and, while I do not wish to criticise the personal qualities of its chairman, Mr Georgios Papastamkos, it has to be said that it is he â particularly on the occasion of the committeeâs meeting on 29Â November â who has often been the cause of them.
On that occasion, he not only criticised and interrupted the ambassador of FYROM â a man with whom we are on good terms â but even, and in the course of the meeting, shouted at him.
It is quite impossible for us to instruct an ambassador as to how to describe his own country.
He calls it Macedonia, as indeed do many Members of this House, and that is something that even the chairman of this delegation must accept.
The members of my group will find it quite utterly impossible to work with the delegationâs present chairman unless he mends his ways and affirms his willingness to abide by the customs of this House and maintain a respectful and courteous attitude.
I ask you, Mr President, to ensure that he does so, failing which we will have to ask the representatives of the European Peopleâs Party to find another chairman, and, as a matter of urgency, that we may be enabled to uphold diplomacy and the customs of this House, and continue to show to a country with which we are on friendly terms the respect that is its rightful due.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to use this short speech to call for the immediate reactivation of the Ferries Directive, which was allowed to lapse after the Council of Ministers failed to agree on its implementation.
I believe that Ireland was one of a number of countries who opposed the directive after it passed through Parliament in 1999 on the grounds that it might make ferry services to peripheral regions uneconomic to run.
The short-sighted and narrow economic outlook of the Irish Government, which disregarded workersâ rights and entitlements in favour of maximising profits has led to a situation in which 543Â workers on Irish Ferries face redundancy and replacement by workers earning less than 50% of the Irish minimum wage.
Their only alternative is to remain working with Irish Ferries and earn approximately 50% of their current salary.
That is totally unacceptable.
If the Ferries Directive were in place, it would have prevented this situation.
If European citizens are to support the EU, they must be assured that the EU will deliver for them and their families.
The reactivation of the Ferries Directive, whereby ferry workers would have the same working conditions irrespective of their nationality, would be a step in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, unfortunately there is no Olympic truce for the Susa valley, a valley close to Turin.
Over recent days I have been there as part of an official delegation from this Parliament and I was horrified that all the fundamental human rights of an Italian population of more than one hundred thousand people have been suspended.
We have not been free to carry out our work as a delegation charged with investigating the complaints from thousands of citizens against work being funded by the European Union.
I would ask the Commission whether it is happy to be carrying out work with a large amount of European funding despite the complete opposition of the local population and in a situation of military occupation affecting an entirely peaceful population, which is something that should not happen in Europe.
I would like to ask the Commission whether it is going to take any notice of the recommendations of this delegation from the Committee on Petitions.
We are talking about a truly extraordinary situation imposed by the Italian Government of Mr Berlusconi.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to speak on this subject, seeing that â as was reported by the delegation from Parliamentâs Committee on Petitions, which recently travelled to the Susa Valley in Piedmont, Italy â the valley has been occupied by the military in order to force the members of the community to accept the construction of a 54Â km railway tunnel, although they are all against it.
These inhabitants fear for the environment and for their health, quite rightly, given the presence of asbestos.
They have put forward some serious, valid, well-documented alternative proposals.
Rather than listen to them, though, the authorities are resorting to force, as was also demonstrated by the mistreatment suffered by my colleague, MrÂ Agnoletto.
The parliamentary delegation has deemed this situation to be an insult to the population and has declared that an independent inquiry is needed to verify possible violations of European regulations, which would be even less acceptable in the case of a project that was supposed to be a Community project.
I believe that the European Parliament should take on board the proposals of the delegation from the Committee on Petitions, since it is only fair that the Susa Valley benefit from an Olympic truce as well.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the events in France over the past few weeks have been unprecedented.
Some people have referred to them as a revolution, and others as civil war.
Yet the European Parliament is still saying nothing, and acting as though nothing had happened.
It has been suggested in certain quarters that the riots were caused by unemployment, but it is questionable whether this factor could in reality have triggered such a coordinated outbreak.
Only 100 of the 2Â 000Â people arrested were foreigners, while most of the rest were immigrants with French passports.
I am not trying to say that the main problem lies with people of non-European origin.
It is hardly surprising that people prefer to remain part of the civilisation of their ancestors, and there is every indication that Europe no longer holds such an attraction.
The problem in fact lies with us, and it relates to demographic issues.
The prevailing trend is to act as though we had reached the end of history, or in other words as though the world were peaceful and could be ruled by means of an ever greater number of directives.
We are forgetting that it is not only pieces of paper that determine the political and economic situation.
We should not delude ourselves that the current events are merely a result of the economic downturn.
What we are seeing is a dumbing down, and the consequences of nations choosing to reduce their numbers.
If we carry on like this, Europeans will become a minority in their own continent.
Â Â  Mr President, in recent days my small country of Northern Ireland has lost its most prodigious sporting talent ever.
I refer, of course, to the death of George Best.
Regardless of his much-documented lifestyle off the field, on the soccer field he had a world stature.
His dazzling and electrifying skills put him in a league of his own.
In consequence, he was much loved and admired across the world.
Accordingly, it is fitting that the passing of such a sporting colossus should be noted in this international parliament.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity, I am sure on behalf of us all, to salute his sporting memory and to express condolences to his son, his aged father, his brother and his sisters.
Â Â  I am sure the entire House would share your sentiments and indeed the applause that has just been expressed for the life of George Best.
Â Â  Mr President, we recently received new information about the key figures in the notorious Russian Yukos trial of MrÂ Khodorkovsky and MrÂ Lebedev.
Having observed their trial in Moscow last May, our colleague, MrÂ HorÃ¡Äek, concluded that this trial did not follow rules that could provide a fair verdict.
Both Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev have now been sent to serve their sentences thousands of kilometres away from their homes.
Yesterday, Mr Lebedev had to spend his 49th birthday in a prison situated beyond the Arctic Circle, isolated from his children and grandchildren, in conditions that are detrimental to his current state of health.
Last week, more than thirty MEPs signed a letter expressing the hope that both MrÂ Khodorkovsky and MrÂ Lebedev could have a new and fair trial, and that the conditions of their detention could be normalised.
I would like to ask both the Commission and the Council to convince the Russian authorities of the need for a new and fair trial for both men.
Russia has yet to prove that it shares our European values.
Â Â  I should just like to bring it to colleaguesâ attention that these one-minute speeches are addressed to the Chair, not to the Commission or the Council.
You may therefore invite the President of Parliament to write in such a manner.
Â Â  Mr President, Scotland is playing a full part in the UK Presidency of the Council of Ministers and, in recognition of this, Scotlandâs seven MEPs, who come from four different political groups, have collectively been hosting a âBest of Scotland Weekâ here in Parliament.
It has featured films from Scotland â with world-famous actors such as Ewan McGregor â and lectures by people like Alexander McCall Smith, the world-famous author of the series.
There is a also display in the foyer of the work of John Bellany, Scotlandâs greatest living artist.
But what would a celebration of Scotland be without good food and drink?
So tonight, to mark St Andrewâs Day, Scotlandâs national day, we are hosting a reception in the restaurant, where Scottish beef will be available in the European Parliament for the first time in ten years.
Mr President, through you I should like to thank the whole House for its participation in the Best of Scotland Week.
We have had magnificent support from Members of Parliament, and I hope Members have enjoyed seeing just how good Scotland is and what great produce we have to offer the rest of the world.
Â Â  Well, as a fellow âScottâ, Mr Martin, I should like to endorse everything you said.
The unsteady walks of some of the Members of Parliament are I think a tribute to the whisky that you have been serving up.
My only regret is that you did not invite me to repeat my performance of the Ode to Joy on the bagpipes.
Perhaps there will be another occasion.
Â Â  Mr President, I understand that the Commission is to require the British Merchant Navy to fly the European flag instead of the Red Ensign, which is known affectionately throughout Britain as the âRed Dusterâ and is a symbol of Britainâs identity.
So much for the repeated statement that membership of the EU does not mean a loss of national identity!
I have already advised the chairman of the Merchant Navy Association â a captain in the Merchant Navy in his own right â that should this come into force, it should be disregarded and the European flag thrown overboard.
What then?
An attempt to board British merchant ships?
I think not.
Why not pick an easy target, one that does not move about?
Just a few minutes from here, a great Belgian flag was proudly flying this very day â and rightly so â under the Cinquantenaire.
Why not tear that one down, replace it with the European flag and see what the Belgian people say?
Â Â  Mr President, our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety held talks with Parliamentâs administration on 14 June to make an ecological review and see how we might operate more economically.
I took advantage of the occasion to ask about the occupancy rate of Parliamentâs buildings.
I asked whether Parliament, the Commission and the Council discussed their accommodation needs with each other.
I asked whether there were any standard dimensions for offices, conference rooms, interpreting booths and other accommodation with a view to future building work.
Mr President, so far I have received no reply.
I hope you will see to it that I get one.
Â Â  Thank you, I am sure we shall follow that up.
Â Â  I would like to call attention to the condition of a beautiful Hungarian river, the RÃ¡ba.
Since 2003, the Austrian section of the river has been polluted by three leather factories using naphthalene sulfonate for tanning, and discharging it into the RÃ¡ba at the end of the tanning process.
This makes the living water foam and it has quite a strong odour, thus having a negative effect on aquatic life and keeping tourists and sportspeople away from the river.
The problem has already elicited complaints from the population even on the Austrian side.
In Hungary it is constantly mentioned in the press, and the pollution is particularly damaging to the population living along the upper section of the RÃ¡ba, an area of wild beauty attracting a significant level of fishing and water tourism.
As this is a cross-border problem, I ask my honourable Austrian colleagues to help speed up the process and help protect our common treasure, the river RÃ¡ba, in our border areas, in the spirit of the traditional friendship between the two countries.
Â Â  Â  Mr President, I am outraged at the fact that Polish flags have once again been stolen from Membersâ desks in Parliamentâs Chamber in Strasbourg.
Given that this is not the first time that such incidents have occurred, I must protest most strongly at this.
I should also like to make it known that it merely confirms us in our belief that we Polish Members were right to emphasise our allegiance to our homeland.
We do not believe that such incidents should take place in the current climate.
I can assure the Members of this House and its President that the flags will reappear, and that they will stay there as long as members of the League of Polish Families are represented in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to speak on the immoral behaviour of the company Irish Ferries.
I know my colleague, Mr De Rossa, will be speaking on this issue as well.
This week that company sacked 550Â Irish and Welsh seafarers and took on Latvians at a much cheaper rate â less than half the minimum wage.
That is because Irish Ferries has a new flag of convenience â the Cyprus flag â which means that it can skirt around the minimum wage laws of Ireland.
This is bad for Irish workers and it is also bad for Latvian workers, because they are being exploited.
I hope that this is not the shape of things to come under the Services Directive.
The approach adopted by Irish Ferries has been positively Victorian.
It smuggled security men on board the ships to force the staff to accept this switchover.
Obviously there are serious safety issues here.
We clearly need to revisit the 1998 Manning Directive.
I should like to ask you, Mr President, to ensure that the Council puts this on the agenda for Mondayâs Transport Council meeting.
This is something that my colleague, Mr De Rossa, is also very keen to see.
Â Â  Mr President, during last weekâs meeting of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee here in Parliament, the chief Turkish accession negotiator, Mr Ali Babacan, accused Parliament of having terrorist supporters in its corridors.
I find that accusation unacceptable and offensive.
It undermines the resolve of our Parliament to fight terrorism.
I therefore call upon the President of this House to take up the matter with the Turkish Government and ask Mr Babacan to withdraw such an insulting statement.
Since I am talking about terrorists, may I bring to the attention of my fellow MEPs the fact that the Turkish occupation army in Cyprus has continued to terrorise the people of Cyprus.
On this occasion, and for the second time in the last two months, it has extended its military presence in the buffer zone, this time in the town of Nicosia at the Ledra Street level.
I call upon you, Mr President, to write to the Turkish Government and ask it to end the division of Cyprus as soon as possible.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the right of NGOs to operate freely provides a guarantee that civil liberties will be respected and that political systems will adhere to democratic principles.
Unfortunately, there have recently been alarming developments in the Russian Federation that have met with international opposition.
The Russian Duma passed a bill imposing restrictions on NGOs at first reading last week.
This bill will make it more difficult or even impossible for Russian NGOs to obtain foreign funding, and the new restrictions will apply to as many as 450Â 000Â organisations in Russia.
One of the arguments in favour of passing the new bill is that these organisations are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia.
This is an absurd accusation, which makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.
We are being confronted with incomprehensible practices that are alien to the European tradition.
Europe should rid itself of the notion that the changes taking place in Russia are taking the country closer to democracy.
Russia is moving ever further away from democratic standards, and we should not stand idly by and watch fundamental rights be denied in a country that has a privileged relationship with the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in the 18Â months since the Eastern European countries joined the European Union, we have seen an increasing number of measures taken by certain old EU Member States and by Russia that strike at the economic heart of the new Member States, instead of providing genuine support that would allow these latter to catch up with the old Member States in terms of development.
The following are merely a few examples from recent months.
An agreement to build a gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been signed by Russia and Germany, an EU Member State, even though it will harm the economic interests of Poland and the Baltic States.
Russia is refusing to allow imports of Polish meat into the country, yet the EU has failed to provide any real assistance in this regard.
The reform of the sugar market currently underway will hit the new EU Member States hardest, and put even more people out of work.
Huge cuts have been proposed to the EU budget for the development of poor regions located in the new EU Member States.
I should therefore like to issue a warning.
If the new EU Member States are not granted subjective rights, the public in these countries will soon make known its opposition to the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to comment on what was said by some of the earlier speakers here.
Those colleagues who are concerned about flags should bear in mind that if you could eat flags, there would not be a hungry child in the world.
We have too many flags as far as I am concerned.
Mr President, I should like to ask you to inform the Commission that the Irish Ferries company is looking to fire its entire workforce and replace it with cheaper labour using the device of reflagging in Cyprus in order to avoid Irish, British and French labour law.
Last weekend the company placed security men on board its vessels as a bullyboy tactic seeking to force the changeover of staff.
Contrary to IMO conventions, the company refused to allow trade union representatives to visit the crew on board.
This issue has grave implications for every maritime state in the EU and it has resulted in the cancellation in Ireland of social partnership negotiations.
There is real fear among workers of a race to the bottom in Europe.
They have heard with alarm the attack by Commissioner McCreevy on the Swedish social model, they are deeply concerned about the country of origin principle in the Services Directive and now they see a profitable company pushing wages down to EURÂ 3.60 per hour: half the legal minimum wage in Ireland.
In this crisis the European Commission must move immediately to reintroduce to Parliament and Council the draft directive on manning conditions for ferries, which this Parliament approved in its first stage in 1999 and which has since been blocked by the Council.
They should do this next Tuesday at the meeting of the Transport Council.
It is really an important issue and, unless the Commission deals with it as a matter of priority, we are going to see a deepening crisis in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, it is always a pleasure to see you in the Chair, because one knows things will run smoothly.
That is more than could be said about Britainâs six-month Presidency of the Council, which will soon come to an end, and what an ignominious end it will be.
Mr Blair started out with a sweeping agenda for reform of the common agricultural policy and cutting-back on overregulation.
What exactly has he achieved?
Nothing!
The CAP is as unreformed as ever and rules, regulations and directives have increased, not decreased.
That is not to say that the British Presidency will not be significant.
Mr Blair has been under intense pressure to surrender the British rebate of GBPÂ 3Â billion per annum in order to prevent the collapse of the EU budget talks for 2007 to 2013.
In the tradition of British governments since 1972, it is almost certain that Mr Blair will surrender the British national interest â in this case the budget rebate â while no doubt still finding a way of trumpeting it as a triumph of diplomacy.
Â Â  I would not be at all surprised!
Â Â  There has been considerable confusion in Hungarian public opinion recently, because new Member States are still taking the European Commission and its criticism seriously.
We all know that an Excessive Deficit Procedure has been instituted against eleven states, including Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Greece, for exceeding budget deficit criteria.
At the same time, MrÂ Almunia, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, chooses to honour only Hungary with his continuous criticism.
It would be really good if the Commission could do away with this discrimination.
So far they have been trying to punish poor Portugal, and Mr Almunia is now criticising poor Hungary.
Why does he not criticise any of the large Member States?
We ask the President of Parliament to ensure equal treatment, to put a stop to discrimination, and to act in this respect against the Commission.
Â Â  My colleagues from the PPE-DE Group and I have symbolically adopted political prisoner Antonio DÃ­az SÃ¡nchez sentenced to twenty years of incarceration by Cuban totalitarian regime.
I recently received a letter from Mrs Gisela SÃ¡nchez, wife of Antonio SÃ¡nchez, who will be awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize during the December session in Strasbourg together with other members of the movement âWomen in Whiteâ.
In her letter she writes about serious health problems of her husband who continues to be denied necessary health care.
We should endeavour to make the totalitarian regime in Cuba take steps to immediately improve the conditions of imprisonment for all political prisoners that fail to meet minimum UN standards for the treatment of prisoners.
The European Commission must continue pursuing constructive engagement policy through a political dialogue with Cuban authorities, accompanied by the strengthening of contacts with Cuban dissidents and members of civil society.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are 25 countries here, next year there will be 27, soon there will be 30; how shall we communicate if we do not respect institutions; the institution of the European Parliament, UN resolutions, Security Council decisions and the decisions of the European Union?
Whichever way you look at it, if we ourselves do not respect the institutions, visitors will not respect them either.
In any case, the European Union, the UN and Parliament have recognised Macedonia as the FYROM.
Everyone cannot therefore just engage in personal politics here.
We are complicating things, not facilitating them.
The matter is under negotiation.
When everyone, irrespective of motives, plays their own political game, we will not arrive at the right result.
Let us protect the institutions.
If we ourselves do not respect the institutions, no citizen in Europe will respect them.
If, therefore, we want results and logical processes and real democracy, there must be respect for the institutions and I call on you to issue the relevant instructions to the MEPs also to respect the institutions.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I have risen to speak about discrimination against Polish workers who are legally employed in Belgium.
I repeat, who are legally employed.
I am not talking about people working on the black market, but about people who are officially entitled to work, and who had contracts of employment with well-known companies in Flanders.
These contracts have been terminated, and all because of pressure from trade unions.
This demonstrates that both the law and peopleâs mindsets need changing in this European Union of ours, which I almost referred to as a common European Union.
Access to the labour and services market is not the only element that needs changing.
I repeat, peopleâs ways of thinking must also be changed.
The idea of a common European Union and a common Europe has not yet become a reality for everyone.
I would hope that the concept of European solidarity becomes more than just an empty platitude bandied about in order to drown out a very different reality.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- the report by Neil Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council decision on Community measures for the control of Avian Influenza (COM(2005)0171 â C6-0195/2005 â 2005/0062(CNS)) (A6-0327/2005), and
- the report by Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field (COM(2005)0171 â C6-0196/2005 â 2005/0063(CNS)) (A6-0326/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Parish and Mrs Figueiredo, for the excellent work they have done and the very swift time in which they have done it.
This does credit to all the institutions and I am very confident this directive will be adopted before the end of the year.
The concerns of European citizens over avian flu and the fact that we have had the first outbreaks in Europe have made it even more important to adopt this new, updated and more effective legislation as soon as possible.
We all know â and we had an opportunity to discuss the threat of a pandemic in this House some weeks ago â that avian flu is an animal disease.
We have to take all possible measures to ensure that it remains so.
It is very important to deal with this threat at source â i.e. birds â and this is the aim of this new, updated version of the directive.
This directive is also of great importance for international cooperation.
As I have informed Parliament in the past, I have visited South-East Asia, and in fact have just returned from there.
The message there is very encouraging, because there is a political will and a strategy for dealing with this threat.
However, there is also a need for international support and cooperation.
We will offer that support, but we will also participate.
The Commission is co-hosting the conference in Beijing with three international organisations, the OIE, FAO and WHO, as well as the World Bank, which will aim to coordinate international assistance.
We must all distinguish between avian flu, which is an animal disease, and the possible threat of a pandemic.
They are two separate issues.
I know that in peopleâs minds there is confusion.
They even confuse this with seasonal flu, which is another version of flu, but it is very important for people to distinguish between the two.
However, that does not mean one should not take all the necessary precautions and steps to deal with the public health threat as well.
Avian flu is an existing situation, an existing threat.
We have had cases in Europe, though fortunately not in the European Union, but these cases have been dealt with very effectively and efficiently by the countries involved.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Romania, Turkey and Croatia for cooperating very closely with us.
As you know, the suspected cases in Greece proved to be false alarms, so I am pleased to say that at this point we have not had any outbreaks in poultry in the European Union itself.
Nevertheless, Member States have taken very strong measures and effective preventive measures which are constantly being updated and reviewed to ensure that they reflect current needs and circumstances.
This revised directive aims for better prevention and eradication of outbreaks and to reduce health risks, costs and losses.
It covers the low pathogenic version as well as the N2 pathogenic strain, but also introduces effective eradication measures, including vaccination, taking into account scientific evidence and experiences in Europe in recent years â I could mention the Netherlands case two years ago â and elsewhere in the world, and of course the need to avoid the large-scale slaughter and destruction of animals.
The Commission proposal recognises that the avian influenza virus is largely unpredictable, and therefore that we must be able to take the appropriate proportionate measures to deal with this real situation as circumstances evolve.
We also take into account animal welfare and ethical concerns, especially regarding the mass slaughter of animals.
You will know that has caused understandable public reaction during past animal health crises.
That is why we allow Member States, through this new proposal, the option of not applying a stamping-out policy in the event of an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza in poultry.
This is why the co-financing for outbreaks of disease caused by low pathogenic virus is only 30%.
This provision is aimed at discouraging Member States, whenever possible, from opting for stamping-out.
As I have mentioned, avian flu is public health concern and we are therefore taking all the necessary measures.
The most effective way of doing this, as I have said already, is to tackle this virus at source.
Although we are taking these measures and accept, and are responding to, the input of the European Parliament with regard to improving pandemic preparedness, we feel it inappropriate to introduce into the text of this directive those amendments that fall outside its scope â i.e. those concerning public and human health.
This directive deals with animal health.
I would also like to inform you that two days ago the Commission adopted two plans with regard to public health, one on generic pandemic preparedness and the other on influenza pandemic preparedness.
We also held the Common Ground joint simulation exercise last week to test our plans and those of the Member States.
Introducing an effective animal health strategy will directly protect and benefit the poultry industry, but it will also indirectly protect human and public health.
I will now turn to the amendments.
Later I shall circulate a list of those amendments we accept and those which we do not.
There are amendments in the report which we will be happy to accept, whereas others warrant full consideration as a matter of principle but in a different context, such as those on the financial aspects, research and support to third countries.
As regards research in particular, we are working with my colleague, MrÂ PotoÄnik, towards a proposal for research into this virus, about which we know little.
I shall try to speed up this process.
I hope that Parliament will support us in this.
It is important to get the results of this research as soon as possible so that we can plan our response.
I would be very interested to hear what Members here think.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased that the Council has dealt with this item as a matter of urgency.
I wish to thank the Commissioner and his staff for their cooperation and help. I also wish to thank the Council for its cooperation and help.
I would stress, as the Commissioner did, that this proposal deals with animal health.
The aim of the Commission proposal is to improve the control of low pathogenic avian influenza so as to prevent an outbreak of the high pathogenic type.
Once mutation into high pathogenic has occurred, the virus is extremely difficult to control.
There is now a clear need to update current legislation to reflect new advances and our recent experiences in Europe and beyond, and I support the Commissionâs attempt to do this.
It is very important to get this legislation right in order to protect EU poultry and ensure that legislation is proportionate to the risk posed.
We must be well prepared and not fall down the same traps as with the foot-and-mouth outbreak, when there was no proper contingency planning in many Member States.
The Commission proposal aims to introduce compulsory surveillance for low pathogen avian influenza in all Member States.
It spells out the measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak or suspected outbreak, allows new and more flexible provisions on vaccination â and I welcome that â and brings in a more flexible provision for domestic birds other than poultry, which will help in the case of zoos and endangered species.
It also introduces new provisions to ensure cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities.
My report on the Commission proposal has added, I believe, some important new aspects that were not necessarily considered by the Commission.
I have called on the Commission to assist in the development of a cost-efficient oral, multi-strain vaccine.
Parliament has agreed to put money into the budget for this, and I welcome that.
If an oral vaccine can be produced it will be far better for the welfare of the poultry.
I would like a study to be conducted on the impact of migratory birds on the spread of the disease.
I want to ensure that any outbreak or suspected outbreak is contained, notably by stopping the movements of poultry and other birds.
Member States must keep all poultry farmers fully informed of contingency plans which, again, was not the case with foot-and-mouth disease.
We must monitor flocks on the flight paths of wild birds.
I have amended the proposal to make the disease control measures tougher, notably where avian influenza is only suspected, and with respect to the movement of table and hatching eggs.
I have also asked for risk-based flexibility in the application of certain measures so as to avoid unnecessary consequences for the poultry industry.
I successfully introduced amendments to allow establishments such as zoos and wildlife parks to remain open, provided there is no threat to disease control.
Finally, I very much support the Commissionâs proposal as regards monitoring for low pathogenic avian influenza and the slaughtering of these birds.
However, despite the fact that it is scientifically proven that meat from chickens infected with low pathogenic avian influenza is safe for humans to eat, in practice it will almost be impossible to market such meat.
We must maintain European consumersâ complete confidence in poultry meat and products.
I fear that if meat potentially contaminated with low pathogenic avian influenza were to reach the food chain, it would damage consumer confidence in poultry meat and products in general.
I have retabled the amendments excluding LPAI-infected meat from the food chain, because I believe that this must be destroyed at this point.
I urge the Commissioner to look at this carefully and see if we cannot adopt these measures that would take meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza out of the circuit and have it destroyed.
I should make it clear to the House that I am talking about meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza, not about vaccinated meat, in case there is any confusion on that matter.
Finally, I would call upon all Members of this House to support these amendments and to get this regulation on the statute book as soon as possible so that we can put a proper contingency plan in place in the unfortunate event of an outbreak of avian influenza hitting Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fresh outbreaks of avian influenza in Asian countries and in some European countries, following the slaughter of millions of birds in Italy and the Netherlands, give ample grounds for more effective preventative measures to be taken, and for appropriate steps to be taken to support Member States in the event of an outbreak.
That way, action can be taken promptly and the disease can be isolated and stopped from spreading.
It is crucial, bearing in mind the potential consequences of an epidemic, that preventative action be taken effectively and promptly â albeit without causing public alarm â both here in the EU and in third countries, in particular Asian ones.
Avian influenza is a worldwide phenomenon and affects most domesticated birds, yet its distribution is influenced by the relationship between domesticated birds and wild birds, the location of poultry farms, the routes taken by migratory birds and the time of year.
We now know that vigilance and prevention are of the utmost importance, even in the case of low pathogenic viruses, which can mutate into the highly pathogenic strain after circulation for short periods in a poultry population.
Furthermore, although it is rare for human beings to be infected, there have nonetheless been outbreaks among the human population in recent years caused by certain avian-influenza viruses, leading to dozens of fatalities in Asia.
For these reasons, and taking account of the opinions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Budgets, whose rapporteurs, Mr Sturdy and Mr Mulder, I wish to thank, the Committee on Agriculture emphasises the need to strengthen the Commissionâs proposal on five crucial points.
Firstly, greater emphasis should be placed on prevention and monitoring, beginning with a survey of risk areas in each country, to head off the potential impact of an avian-influenza epidemic on public health.
Secondly, greater Community support is needed to develop research into an oral vaccine to combat the various strains and to promote the use thereof should the need arise; the total cost of vaccines should be borne by the Community.
Thirdly, Community support must be given to the Member States to develop a system for monitoring the disease, including laboratory diagnosis and research (particularly into suitable vaccines).
Fourthly, measures should be taken involving cooperation and technical support for third countries, in particular Asian ones, in order to enable preventative and screening action to be taken in the countries in which avian influenza originates.
Fifthly, aid must be made available to breeders facing a loss of income should the need arise to slaughter birds, the destruction of eggs, the cleaning and disinfection of holdings and equipment, the destruction of contaminated foodstuffs.
The EU will partly cover the costs incurred by the Member States.
As far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned, the amount of financial assistance should total 50% of the costs borne by the Member States, in cases both of high and low pathogenic avian influenza, because if action needs to be taken and animals need to be slaughtered, the losses incurred are the same.
I believe, however, that in this case it is right to increase Community assistance to 60%, in line with my proposal, because if a Member State faces a situation of this nature having taken the necessary prevention measures, it deserves solidarity from the Community, and this may indeed help to prevent the disease from spreading.
I have also tabled a further proposal for which I am seeking your backing, ladies and gentlemen.
I feel that social justice will be served if support is granted to poultry breeders whose holdings are affected by the disease, not only in respect of the costs and losses incurred, but also 50% in respect of loss of income until a new holding is up and running; this without of course undermining the workings of the market.
Lastly, I should like to express my gratitude for all the help I received in drawing up this report, and I trust that the Commission and the Council will take due heed of Parliamentâs proposals.
If so, all possible measures can be taken to prevent and fight any outbreaks, and to ensure that the disease does not spread and affect public health.
Â Â  . Mr President, if there is one country in the European Union that knows what bird flu is, then I think it is the Netherlands.
I am encouraged by what the Commissioner had to say.
I think that they have learnt a great deal.
I should like to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Parish and Mrs Figueiredo, for the hard work they have done.
Needless to say, the Committee on Budgets is mainly concerned with the financial side of things, but that has not stopped it from mainly speaking out in favour of the first option that would take effect in the event of an outbreak, namely to give priority to renewed vaccination.
In that respect, the Budgetary Committee has tabled two amendments for the 2006 budget relating to studies into the development of better vaccines and better testing methods and into the role of migratory birds in the spread of bird flu.
We hope that the Commission will launch these studies as soon as possible and will not wait until the end of the year.
One of the major budgetary problems is that the agricultural budget will, in future, be stretched.
Not that we would wish it, but it is to be expected that one day, we will face another outbreak of an infectious disease, whether it be bird flu or foot and mouth disease or some other, and money from the European budget will need to be made available to deal with it.
The question is whether there is money in the kitty; there may well not be any, and so we think the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, continue looking into the possibility of a European animal health fund.
The Budgetary Committeeâs second concern is that at the moment, half of compensation is accounted for by the European budget, while the other half is made up by the Member States.
The way in which this latter 50% is raised varies from country to country.
In some countries, the farmers pay; in others, they do not.
This is not what we would call a level playing field, and the Commission should look into this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for what he said and I agree with him.
I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner on his openness with Parliament â that is a great attribute and very much appreciated by Members â as well as on his urgency and on the fact that he has not panicked.
This has been a great attribute right the way through.
On a number of occasions he has asked Members to help him spread the word.
I noticed that when he last visited Parliament, he asked MEPs to try to find out and spread the word in their Member States to gain awareness of what was happening.
We are all happy to do this.
Of course, we will need full information to continue to spread the word.
The Health Council meets on 9Â December 2005 and I hope this will make the situation clearer.
We also need to know what the situation is right across the board with Member States.
I ask this because I understand that 21Â Member States are already fully prepared and in a state of readiness.
Could the Commissioner tell us which four Member States are not in that situation?
This is not a party political issue.
We want the Commission and the governments to come out of this looking good: we do not want to be accused of stupid, irresponsible measures.
It is a great opportunity.
We have seen what happened in France and the Netherlands and the fact that people do not trust the European Union, Parliament and the Commission.
If we get this right â and I think the Commission is getting it right, but we need more information â we will do a very good job for promoting the European Union.
This is about transparency and making sure that everyone understands it.
At the moment, a number of half-truths seem to be circulating.
For example, I hear a lot about the European migratory system â the birds that migrate into the European Union.
I recently visited one of those sites in the United Kingdom.
In fact, all the migratory birds in the United Kingdom come from the north, not from an area where avian flu is present.
It is this kind of information that, in my opinion, people are getting slightly wrong.
The Commissioner mentioned the disease and I would like to ask him another question.
Avian flu â to the best of my knowledge â is an infection of the gut, not of the respiratory tract.
I believe that is correct and I shall be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about it.
Is it correct that a child has already died â admittedly in the Far East â from eating infected meat?
What are we going to do about the risk of that?
To return to migratory birds, I think hunters have a great opportunity to be used in this situation to keep us informed of the way things are.
We must recognise that the way in which we are selling food in the European Union is a problem: supermarkets force down prices, thereby increasing the risk of a dangerous virus spread.
We had a situation where foot-and-mouth came into the European Union.
We do not know how it came in, but the Commissionâs staff was very good at sorting it out.
Swine vesicular disease came into the European Union, as did Newcastle Disease.
Where did that come from and why did it come into the European Union?
How are these diseases getting in?
It is important to understand â wherever we import food from anywhere in the world â that there is always a risk of bringing a disease into the European Union.
We must look at that very closely.
Â Â  I should like to thank all the speakers in the debate so far.
We are now going to suspend the sitting for our chicken dinner.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the reports on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will in any event stick to the time allocated to me.
I would have thanked both rapporteurs, but I notice that neither of them is here.
Their absence is an illustration of the fact that there is room for some improvement in Parliamentâs working method.
When we have a debate, we should have it without any interruptions.
Sadly, that is how it is.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the gist of the Figueiredo report, and particularly the costs and prevention for the control of animal diseases, as approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Prevention must be improved, and there must be more control, but what is much more important, and far more effective, is to deploy the vaccine as a control product and preventive measure.
For the rest, it is essential that we apply the same standards in Europe in terms of cofinancing under the motto âwhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the ganderâ.
I am in favour of a 50/50 split between the Commission and Member States, but in terms of Member State contributions, it should slowly become clear who is footing the bill: the Member States or, as is the case in some other Member States, the farmers.
Clearly, these discrepancies are unacceptable.
I welcome some of the points of the Parish report.
I am pleased by the adoption of our and Mr Bermanâs amendment, which states that, in the event of a serious threat of bird flu, the vaccine can be used as a preventive measure without this affecting the market position â and I would like to stress this, also looking at the Commissioner, without this affecting the market position.
My group is delighted with this, because it is crucial that we should start to deploy animal disease control products more effectively.
Non-vaccination policy has, in fact, run its course.
In a world where markets are becoming more open, where people travel, it is no longer appropriate that vaccination should not be used effectively and, above all, that the use of vaccination should lead to restrictions on the market of the products.
It is essential for us to go down this route in Europe.
That is the only answer to controlling infectious animal diseases worldwide as much as possible and as effectively as possible.
It has come to my notice that Mrs Figueiredo has now entered the Chamber.
I would like to thank her again for the contribution to her report, and I shall thank MrÂ Parish in person.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, todayâs debate on avian influenza, the current pace of work and the document adopted by Parliament and the Commission are all excellent examples of good cooperation between the two institutions.
Influenza is not a problem faced by individual Member States or by Europe as a whole, but a global problem.
Asia has been the starting point for nearly every influenza epidemic.
A dozen or so virus strains that could mutate at any moment and pose a threat to Europe have been circulating there for years.
Cooperation between organisations such as the WHO, the FAO, the World Bank and leading poultry producers in the USA, Brazil and the European Union is now essential in order to eradicate these hotbeds.
We have until the end of the year in Europe to draw up a road map and an action plan with a view to preventing an influenza epidemic.
What should we do during these few winter months?
Firstly, we should ensure that funding is available under the 2006 budget and future budgets for preventive actions.
More money should be spent on veterinary measures and on purchasing vaccines for the entire poultry population of Europe, and appropriate quantities of antiviral drugs such as tamiflu should be stockpiled.
A single blueprint for European veterinary services and authorities responsible for public health should be drawn up.
We must develop a strategy for funding and ordering the production of antiviral drugs.
A single set of guidelines should be published for the diagnosis of avian influenza and for laboratory diagnostic tests, and a scientific assessment of the epidemiological risk posed to humans by avian influenza should be commissioned.
We should facilitate the setting up and funding of several new reference laboratories in other Member States.
In summary, it is my belief that any future epidemic and panic could be prevented if a road map along these lines were implemented, and if Parliament were to adopt the report tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, avian flu is clearly a major fatal threat to birds and humans.
Millions of avian deaths have recently been caused by the virus responsible and many human conditions are being attributed directly to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, HPAI.
However, avian flu is not a new disease.
In fact, it is thought to have been around ever since viruses themselves were discovered and it is most likely to be just as old as the common flu virus itself, i.e. probably many thousands of years old.
The threat to humans is not new either.
Studies using molecular biology techniques indicate that the influenza pandemic which erupted at the end of the First World War was in fact caused by an avian flu virus.
