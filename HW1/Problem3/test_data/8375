Therefore, we need to assess the situation and possible scenarios thoroughly before moving.
In conclusion, I wish to underline the importance of maintaining a common EU approach towards the universal abolition of the death penalty.
The Commission will spare no efforts to work with the Presidency and Parliament to this end.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) I believe that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's words clearly indicate the model of Europe we want to see: a Europe of values.
If I had briefly to paint a picture illustrating what the European dream has been over the years, I would have no hesitation in stating at this sitting, Madam President, that the idea of Europe represents a permanent call for peace, understanding, harmony and solidarity; and that, in addition to a legitimate vision of Europe, such as the Europe of financial perspectives, the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of net balance and net contributor, I believe that there is a higher vision of Europe, which is the Europe of values.
It is precisely within this context and in accordance with this vision of a Europe of values that this initiative is seeking a universal moratorium on the application of the death penalty.
It must be of a universal nature, because fundamental rights, and the right to life in particular, must not be preached for one region, one country or one continent, but they must clearly be of a universal global nature.
We must therefore celebrate the fact that, in 2005 and 2006, a whole series of countries, such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova, have decided formally to abolish the death penalty.
I believe that we must continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the seventy countries that still apply the death penalty join the 128 countries that no longer apply it.
Madam President, I would like to say that, if the European Union is to preserve that moral and ethical leadership that it has been exercising, it is essential that we fight to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights, and in particular the right to life, prevail in all regions of the world, this year and over the years to come.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evening's debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium, which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country.
As has been said, we would like the Council of Ministers to actively commit itself to achieving this objective; the Presidency is very committed, and we hope that this point remains one of the priorities of its term of office.
The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission.
From what she has said, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner does not actually seem to me to be very convinced of the fact that, as a first step, we need to go through a moratorium.
I, on the other hand, would emphasise this point, and I would ask Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: Would not going through a moratorium bring abolition any closer?
I do not think so: this could therefore be a first step, not least because the European Union, in its international relations, could bring to bear the extensive relations it enjoys in the context of the neighbourhood policy, the association agreements and the strategic partnership, and, in my opinion, Europe's political parties could also do their best within international forums to ensure that their organisations put pressure on the participating countries.
I believe that the aim is to banish the death penalty from the statute books of every State, an act that would, among other things, help to ensure that the United Nations enjoys a reputation for being an institution that safeguards universally recognised rights.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my speech to a statement and a note issued this morning by the German Presidency. Word for word, the note reads: 'the German Presidency calls on the governments concerned to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty with immediate effect'.
I am reading the note from the German Presidency. This is precisely our position.
I think I am right in saying that Mr Barroso also issued a statement fully supporting the Italian initiative, the aim of which is to have a proposal for a moratorium drafted within the current UN General Assembly. This proposal will undoubtedly win through: as far back as 1999 there was an absolute majority in favour of a resolution, which was not tabled.
Faced with the enthusiasm that we are seeing throughout the world right now for our initiative - that of the European Parliament, of the chairmen of our groups, the initiative that was pre-announced very specifically in Strasbourg by Mr Watson and other Members - I therefore do not understand - or, rather, I understand only too well - how it is possible to stall, at a time when France is taking the incredible step of highlighting the abolition of the death penalty with a change to its Constitution; when Rwanda is also doing so; and when, just yesterday, Kyrgyzstan did so.
Statements are coming in from everywhere - from Syria, from Lebanon - in support of our position.
I believe that, in the future, the European Parliament, like the Council of Europe before it, will lead this movement.
To conclude my speech, Madam President, I should like to point out that, 60 years ago, there was a Rome-Berlin axis.
I was 10 years old, and I remember it well.
It happens today that, with the coming-together of the German Presidency, the Italian initiative and the very recent French initiatives, a new situation is emerging: I believe that it is historically important that in a certain way Berlin and Rome are now taking a definite stand, with no hypocrisy or fear of winning, because there are too many people here who are scared of winning, not losing.
Madam President, last week, during the debate on the Benghazi case, we stated our total opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances.
It is now important to reaffirm this principle, which is enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Union has always advocated the abolition of the death penalty, and has even gone so far as to make it a condition of accession and a key principle of its foreign policy.
Moreover, guidelines were adopted in 1998, and civil society projects are regularly funded under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
This effort has been rewarded: the number of executions in the United States has gone down, and in countries like Mexico, Liberia, the Philippines and Moldova, the death penalty has been abolished.
The same is not true everywhere, however.
Some US States have extended the scope of the death penalty to other crimes apart from murder; in Singapore, a person is still automatically sentenced to death for carrying 15 grams of heroin, and China still executes more people than any other country.
In addition, there are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have reinstated the death penalty.
Peru almost did likewise in the name of combating terrorism, but fortunately this did not happen.
Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress [against the death penalty], the EU must be extra vigilant.
The international groundswell of opinion in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty should be addressed within the framework of a pro-abolition policy.
Ensuring the ratification of the second protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty should therefore be one of the Union's priorities.
It is crucial that France, Latvia and Poland, which have yet to ratify the protocol, do so at the earliest opportunity.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 'No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.
No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'
This is what is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and this is what makes me - indeed, I believe, makes us - proud to be part of the European Union.
It is the upholding of human dignity; it is realising that no one can rule another person's life and that there should be no revenge, only justice.
This should be true for all courts, including military ones.
Too many countries still have the death penalty, and they include not only large countries such as China, but also the most important military and democratic power - the United States - which has still not been able to leave its Wild West culture behind.
I hope that the Congress against the Death Penalty being held in Paris, in which we, as Parliament, will take part, will be a further step on from the moratorium on the way to abolishing the death penalty and eradicating poverty around the world.
I also hope that the people who take to the streets of Paris will be a warning to all those who, even in Europe, are thinking of bringing back the death penalty.
In any event, it is these street protests that will lead to the UN's approving the moratorium in full.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, countries where capital punishment still exists do not deserve to be part of the civilised world, no matter whether these countries are Islamic, where adulterous women are stoned, the America of Bush, India, the world's largest democracy, or Communist China.
I will therefore not hesitate to back the plea for a worldwide moratorium.
One judicial error, the life of one innocent, is enough to write capital punishment off as barbaric.
Allow me, though, to add two observations.
Respect for life should not stop a constitutional state from giving serious offenders effective and irreducible penalties of 30 years, or lifelong imprisonment for that matter.
This condition must, and indeed can, underpin the public's consensus against the death penalty.
This consensus will not come about unless our citizens, who are increasingly faced with the most brutal forms of crime, add their voice to the worldwide abolition of capital punishment.
Secondly, some opponents of capital punishment should display a certain degree of consistency.
For example, on a recent friendly visit to China, which is a single-party state, the French Socialist Presidential candidate sang the praises of the efficiency of the Chinese justice system. This efficiency involves the families of the thousands of people who have been sentenced to death every year being presented with the bill for the bullets that killed the victims, but SÃ©golÃšne Royal did not spare a thought for them.
After all, they do not bring in the contracts, because the commercial interests of major enterprises in China must be protected, and that is when some European opponents of capital punishment go all quiet all of a sudden.
If Europe wants to retain its credibility, it should exert pressure on countries such as China, whatever the political or commercial cost.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
The execution of Saddam Hussein has put the spotlight back on the debate on the death penalty, a debate that is absolutely timely, although it must not be used for tactical purposes and, above all, it must not be a subject that is raised on and off.
This is first and foremost a battle of civilisation and progress.
We do not just have here an essential guarantee for individuals, a request for the inviolability of individuals to be further strengthened; we are also faced with an historic and universal need, a global milestone and focal point for 21st-century civilisation.
It has been said, and I agree, that, after the abolition of slavery in previous centuries and the ban on torture, the right not to be killed following a court ruling should be another common denominator, a new and inalienable dimension of humankind that makes a community of us all.
Today, this Parliament is sending out the first clear message along these lines.
Mr President, I want to support the strong calls from this Parliament today - and the campaign outside Parliament - for a worldwide moratorium on executions to be established unconditionally through a resolution of the UN General Assembly.
For many years, the EU has maintained as a main pillar of foreign affairs and human rights policy the objective of ending the use of the death penalty globally.
We have had some success, particularly as part of our neighbourhood strategy.
Today's initiative is an ambitious attempt to raise the profile of the debate on the death penalty to a UN level and to have an impact on the 66 countries that have already been referred to that still use the death penalty.
It is important to note that working towards achieving a moratorium on the death penalty should always be linked to achieving an eventual abolition through legislation, as previous speakers have pointed out.
The pragmatic first step is a call for a moratorium, but we must always look at ways to promote abolition where possible.
Looking at what we can do here in the EU from a policy perspective, I would urge the Council to review and update the guidelines on the death penalty, which date back to 1998, so that new elements and strategies that have developed since then can be taken into consideration.
The Third World Congress on the Death Penalty, which is to be held soon in Paris, may be a good opportunity to do just that.
To date, the EU's proactive policy on the death penalty has produced some positive results.
For example, recently, the success of strong EU representations in Peru to recent proposals to extend the death penalty to that country, in violation of the Peruvian Constitution and the American Convention on Human Rights, needs to be acknowledged and welcomed.
The EU stance did have an impact on the Peruvian Congress in its rejection of draft legislation.
So the EU has shown that it can be a key influence on national policy towards the death penalty, and we should not be afraid to use that influence.
(ES) Madam President, yesterday, Robert Wilson, of 24 years of age, was sentenced to death by a jury in New York.
This is the first death sentence to be handed down in that State for 50 years.
This is another tragic example of the current threat to the universal values that we are all defending here today, despite the very significant progress that has been made in countries such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova.
We must, however, continue to fight to ensure that others, such as China, with around two thousand official executions per year - eight thousand, according to unofficial data - join the global moratorium and suspend their executions.
We must support Iranian civil society, which is rising up against the death penalty. Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions: 177 in 2006.
Furthermore, it has broken the moratorium on stonings and it currently has six women sentenced to death by stoning.
Above all, we appeal to the United States, a country whose decisions have an immense impact on global politics, to support the Italian initiative to establish a universal moratorium on the death penalty which will be approved - with this Parliament's support, I hope - in the United Nations General Assembly.
As other speakers have said here today, the moratorium is a first essential step towards abolition. This is probably one of the most important challenges facing the human race at the beginning of this century.
Madam President, worldwide, 20 000 people are on death row waiting to be killed by their own governments.
Sadly, over 3000 of these are in the United States.
I do not single the US out because it is the worst - that is China, with 80% of executions - but because we have hope of the Americans.
The great prize would be for a change of mind in the United States and the signs are there.
The number of executions in the states of the US has dropped dramatically since 1999: there were 277 in that year, and 128 in 2005.
Twelve states have now abolished the death penalty, not including Texas, which clocks up an unimpressive one-third of the 1100 executions in the US in the last 30 years.
I think the Commission and the Presidency need to be more proactive and less hesitant in seeking a moratorium and abolition worldwide through a UN General Assembly resolution.
As in some other areas of human rights policy, like extraordinary rendition and war-on-terror abuses, the EU is not always as effective in putting its principles into practice as Parliament would wish.
(EL) Madam President, as we speak, all the Member States of the Union have ratified the sixth protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty.
We also nourish the hope that it will be abolished both by law and in practice in all the countries of the world - be it in times of peace or in times of war - with the result that there will be an improvement in respect for human rights and human dignity will be reinforced, as the Council and the Commission emphasised today.
Allow me, however, to ask you if you were concerned about the human rights and dignity of the dictator Saddam Hussein and his fellow detainees, who became food for the entire world's voyeurs.
Is this the role of the European Union as a global stability factor?
What can you say about the statements by the British foreign secretary, Mrs Becket, who emphasised that Hussein simply got what he deserved and that justice was done?
What are European citizens supposed to believe when they read the condemnatory statements by the Council, on the one hand, and hear the derisory comments by the ministers in it, on the other?
We need to get our act together, because we are ultimately just fooling ourselves.
Madam President, I must say that the arrogance of this EU knows no bounds.
Not satisfied with dictating to Member States that they must not avail of the ultimate deterrent - the death penalty - it now wishes to dictate to the rest of the world.
Awful as the fate of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya is, and while this House should be vigorous in protesting against their situation, it does not justify us demanding a global ban on the death penalty.
Wrongful imprisonment is intolerable, but it does not lead rational people to oppose all imprisonment.
No, I say that if there is a fair, transparent, human rights compliant judicial system, with a reliable appeal process, then a sovereign nation state is perfectly entitled to deploy the death penalty for capital crimes, if that is the democratically expressed wish of its people.
They, not we, have the right to choose what is right for them.
(IT) Madam President, I am delighted to take the floor because, among other things, I come from Tuscany where, for the first time in history, on 30 November 1786, capital punishment was abolished.
I am also moved to point out that, in 1987, I, together with Amnesty International and the Italian Movement for Life, succeeded in having the death penalty of Paula Cooper, a 16-year-old black girl, commuted in the United States. She later came to thank me.
I am also pleased to point out that, as an Italian Member, I proposed and achieved the legal abolition of the death penalty in the military code of war, which is the reason for my in-depth thoughts on the matter.
I take an optimistic view of human history which, in spite of everything, is a struggle for goodness, a struggle that is spurred on by an ever more obvious and decisive value: the dignity of each and every human being.
So great is this dignity that it cannot be graded, and thus it determines the equal status of everybody, no matter what kind of life they lead.
Dignity is also indestructible: not even the hands of a criminal can wipe away the traces of dignity from the face of the very man who has committed the crime.
No one can take away a person's life and dignity, not even individual States.
That is the real reason why the death penalty must be abolished.
All the other practical reasons, of which I am only too aware, may meet with objections, but not this one.
A Europe that seeks to base its identity not only on competition and the market, but also on dignity and human rights, cannot keep quiet.
Right now, I do not want to talk about inconsistencies.
The time will come when human dignity and the associated right to life extend their persuasive powers to other areas of human life where they are now sadly being overshadowed, even within our Union: the most symbolic areas of poverty and human alienation, which are to be born and to die.
(ES) Madam President, rejecting the death penalty is not a question of moral superiority, nor of lecturing anybody, nor of collective pomposity on the part of Europe.
It is consistent with a basic belief in human dignity, many years' experience of the utter pointlessness of capital punishment and fear of the serious and perfectly well-documented risk of its being applied unjustly, even if in only one specific case (and there have been many of them, regrettably).
Europe must apply itself to what is possible, without forgetting the ultimate objective.
What is possible is to demand a moratorium courageously, throughout the world, beginning with our closest partners, without forgetting - I would insist - the ultimate objective, which would be the global abolition of the death penalty.
We must protest against the death penalty, but that must include the death penalty on Saddam Hussein as well as the death penalty on the person sentenced in the United States, following a trial with practically no defence, for a crime he committed when he was under-age.
Those death sentences, Commissioner, must be condemned just as vigorously as the death sentence on Saddam Hussein; we must not have double standards, because if what we are advocating is to fight the death penalty, those more or less anonymous prisoners who have had practically no right to defence deserve our support even more than a criminal such as Saddam Hussein.
(PL) Madam President, the political, religious and legal debate on whether or not to apply the death penalty has been under way for decades and will continue into the future.
The famous writer Albert Camus spoke out against it in his time, and Robert Badinter, a former French Justice Minister, led a legal battle at European level for many years.
As a rule, strong ethical arguments are adduced in heated debates of this nature, and references are made to the inalienable right to life.
Horrifying statistics about the number of sentences carried out in countries such as China or India are also quoted.
The largest democracy in the world, the United States, is placed in the dock.
Catholics opposed to the death penalty and those in favour of it contrive to base entirely contradictory arguments on the same sources, namely the Gospels, the Catechism and Papal encyclicals.
It is very difficult to justify to the families and loved ones of people, often children, who have been cruelly murdered that the death penalty should not be applied to those responsible for the crimes.
At such times, people's emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome.
I hail from a country that suffered under the iron rule of Hitler's totalitarian Nazi regime and later under Soviet Communism.
I would like to point out that use of the death penalty is a key feature of each and every dictatorship.
When I look back at events in my country, Poland, during the period to which I previously referred, I see how whole legions of Poland's finest sons and daughters were murdered, following sentences handed down by Communist kangaroo courts.
Having considered both sides of the argument concerning the death penalty, I am bound to say that its abolition is essential in order to curb the madness of fanatics prepared to use the legal system to eliminate their opponents.
The most the fellow citizens of these murdered heroes can do years later, once freedom has been restored, is to put up monuments in their honour.
This is what I have learnt from the history of my parents' and grandparents' generations and also of my own.
Only one of the 1 500 death sentences carried out in Poland during the Stalinist period involved a common criminal.
The price of restricting the actions of dictators of various political hues may well be that, instead of being guillotined, offenders who deserve this ultimate punishment will have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, without the opportunity of parole.
If that is the case, I believe it is a price worth paying, however painful it may be to do so.
(LT) - 'The death penalty is the most offensive method of killing, because it is done with the approval of the community.'
These words of George Bernard Shaw, pronounced almost a century ago, are being endorsed by an ever-increasing number of people and a majority of countries.
Unfortunately, the natural human right to life is still ignored by 68 countries.
The death penalty is most often implemented not only in Asia, but also in the United States.
The execution of Saddam Hussein, I would say, has become a display of impotence.
We are now presented with an exceptional opportunity to work hand in hand with the Italian Government to seek abolition of the death penalty in every country of the world.
Opposition to the death penalty is one of the values that unites EU countries; therefore, the Union's voice carries weight.
The United Nations General Assembly will, I hope, support the proposed moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, and its abolition should be the ultimate goal.
At the same time, it is essential to condemn the statements of some official representatives of the new EU countries about the possibility of legitimation of the death penalty.
World public opinion needs to be channelled in the European direction.
(PL) Madam President, Article 1 of Additional Protocol No VI to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms reads: 'The death penalty shall be abolished.
No one shall be condemned to such a penalty or executed'.
This protocol was laid down back in 1983, and underpins the thinking and actions of the Member States of the Union.
It is also the stance adopted by most Members of the Council of Europe.
Essentially, these are European standards for the protection of human rights.
The question as to whether the abolition of the death penalty is only relevant to Europe is a rhetorical one.
Clearly, the answer is no.
Every individual has but one life and that life deserves to be protected.
We must therefore support a UN moratorium on the death penalty.
We are aware that the death penalty is rooted in a culture of revenge and retribution from which mankind needs to break free.
It is very easy to delete the death penalty from criminal codes.
All that is required is the legislators' will to do so.
It will be much more difficult for us to detach ourselves from it at an emotional level, to recognise it as an unethical penalty and banish it forever from human consciousness.
However, we must be aware that if we fail to do so, we shall have to go on asking ourselves whether, in the 21st century, man can continue to kill his fellow man in the name of the law.
(PL) Madam President, the European Union has consistently advocated a ban on the application of the death penalty since 1998.
In October 2003, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European institutions and Member States of the Union to put pressure on the UN General Assembly to declare a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty.
The European institutions and Member States of the Union must ensure that the issue of the death penalty is dealt with again at the current UN General Assembly.
Acting on behalf of the European Union, the Member States must aim at tabling a draft resolution on a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, with a view to its abolition. They should garner maximum support for this resolution amongst the Member States of the UN.
The European institutions and Member States of the Union should do all in their power to secure, as soon as possible, a favourable outcome in a vote at the current UN General Assembly.
(EL) Madam President, the fact that broad agreement between the political party has prevailed in today's debate confirms that the European Parliament can act as the guarantor of European democratic civilisation and for the protection of human rights, human dignity and the right to life.
It has been proven that the death penalty not only does not prevent crime, but also feeds hatred and violence.
The civilised world cannot respond to the barbarity of a criminal act with the barbarity of death.
We welcome the initiative by Mr Prodi's Italian Government and the backing being given to it by the president of the Socialist International, Georgos Papandreou.
All the Member States of the European Union should certainly ratify the voluntary UN protocol, the 13th protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.
I would say, however, that the Member States should incorporate a provision abolishing the death penalty in their internal constitutional order.
To close, I should like to say that we should not overlook the fact that today in European society there is a large percentage of citizens who are still in favour of the death penalty and, as such, we must also work in this direction, together with the European Commission, with programmes working through democratic consultation to convince European society.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, what has become apparent from this debate is how great a consensus exists as regards what is one of the most fundamental objectives of the European Union's policy on human rights.
Frequent reference was made in it to the Italian initiative, about which there must be no misunderstanding.
When talking about this initiative, we are not talking about the 'whether' of it, or about what it is intended to achieve, but rather about the 'how', 'where', and, of course, the 'when' of it, in other words about the procedure rather than the substance.
You, Commissioner, made that very clear earlier on.
At the General Assembly on 19 December last year, a unilateral declaration was read out, and 85 states endorsed it; encouraging though that is, we must also, on the other hand, consider and bear in mind the question of whether our objective is capable of being achieved at all in view of the fact that, to date, this declaration has gained the support of only 21 out of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council in Geneva.
To put it bluntly, we do not yet have a majority for it.
The situation in the United Nations' third committee is similar.
As I said in my statement earlier, there are now various fronts on which we have to take the initiative.
The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council, too, has come up with a strategy for achieving the goal to which all of you, in your interventions, have referred, and, although we do not at present know when we will be able to implement it, I can assure you that we will support you in your efforts; that is something on which we, the Commission and the Presidency are agreed, for we too are endeavouring to do away with capital punishment for ever.
Madam President, I endorse what the President-in-Office Council has just said.
I think there is widespread consensus in this House and between all the EU institutions on the substance of today's debate and where we want to go, but sometimes we have to see what the next tactical step is.
I want to clarify that the Commission is certainly favourable to the introduction of a moratorium as an important intermediate step towards the complete abolition of the death penalty.
We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliament's motion for a resolution, but we have to see - and this is at stake - the tactical nature.
How can we ensure that the planned UN General Assembly initiative will be successful?
We need to ensure very good preparation.
We have to reach out to all the UN members, and we need pertinent timing for the launch of the initiative of such a worldwide moratorium.
We are also quite active not only at UN level, but also at bilateral level; we try to do that be it in China or Peru.
I have, for instance, written to the Peruvian President to express our deep concerns, and hopefully there is still a chance to block it.
I would also like to thank Parliament, because it also has possibilities. It has used them in the past, and maybe it can use them even more by talking to the different delegations.
Very often, as I said before, it is a domestic issue, and the more Parliament can talk to parliaments, the better we can influence this.
I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 p.m.

Climate change (continuation of debate)
The next item is the debate on climate change.
Mr President, I will try again.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Dimas and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Gabriel, warmly on their proposals and their inspirational speeches.
It is particularly thanks to the Al Gore campaign and Sir Nicholas Stern's report that climate change has been in the spotlight so much in recent months.
This means that now is a good time to make some solid headway.
Europe must indeed take the lead in the climate debate and in the measures to be taken.
What matters now is for the Commission's recent proposals to be taken up not only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but also by the Heads of Government of the Member States.
The climate problem is so extensive that it will be necessary to keep it on the agenda for decades to come.
Since climate change, and hence global warming, cannot simply be slowed down, only rigorous steps will have an adequate effect.
These will involve a shift towards carbon-free and low-carbon fuels as a necessary measure.
In specific terms, this means that we need to say goodbye to fossil fuels.
The European Parliament has already indicated that by 2020, Europe should have achieved a 30% reduction in CO2.
The Commission, however, has proposed a 20% reduction in order to allow room for negotiations in a bid to achieve global agreement, which would then involve a 30% reduction in emissions in Europe.
I should like Commissioner Dimas to explain to us why he thinks this tactic will work.
Mr President, I should like to ask you for a little more time as I was unable to speak at my normal speed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a fairly common desire in this House, and certainly among the public, to combat climate change.
However, allow me to make a remark, which will be useful in highlighting the intellectual honesty that we owe those citizens who are less acquainted with this subject: namely, when we talk about combating climate change, it is worth specifying that we are referring only to the influence that man and his activities have on the environment, an influence that, as has been scientifically proven, is far less significant than that of geophysical and astronomical determinants.
True, it is useful to have an energy policy that not only is as environmentally friendly as possible but also guarantees the energy supply that is crucial to our development, something that, in Europe, with all our political independence from non-European countries, has so far been a distant prospect.
I obviously agree on the emissions reduction targets, just as I do on the efforts to develop renewable energy sources.
All of that is, of course, right, and the idea of encouraging people to use less-polluting vehicles seems to be a good one.
Is it not the case, though, that the situation will end up as it has in Italy, where the 2007 budget law favours those who are in a position to buy new vehicles and actually condemns precisely those who are least well-off, who cannot afford to change their vehicles, to a lack of mobility and heavy costs?
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, while I am not being Sinophobic - please believe me when I say that - I would ask once again: is there any sense in all of our unilateral efforts regarding sustainability when, in one year, China and the Asian economic tigers emit as much climate-changing gas into the atmosphere as is produced in ten years by EU countries?
Mr President, I rise once more in order to respond in strong terms to an attack by Mrs Harms on the German Presidency of the Council, in relation to the question as to where the German Council Presidency stands on the involvement of the motor industry in dealing with climate change.
The first thing I want to say to Mrs Harms is that the Council Presidency cannot as yet have a position on this issue, since the Commission has produced no proposal, nor has there been as yet any deliberation at Council level.
On the assumption that you mean the position of the German Federal Government, Mrs Harms, I suggest that there are a number of things of which you need to take note, the first of which is that your assertion that the German Federal Government is opposed to a legislative proposal and to Europe-wide legislation laying down CO2 emissions of 120 gram per kilometre is very definitely wrong.
There is agreement within the German Government that, if the voluntary undertaking on the part of the European motor industry should prove ineffective, there will of course have to be European legislation with the aim of enforcing an output of 120 gram per kilometre of CO2.
Secondly, though, the German Federal Government does take the view that ...
(Heckling)
... if the European motor industry has set itself this target for 2012, it should be taken at its word.
There, too, the German Government is not taking up an opposing position.
Secondly, though, the German Federal Government is persuaded that we must achieve this 120-gram target together and through two things, the first being vehicle technology and the second, the inclusion of some biofuels.
(Heckling)

I have no idea what you mean by that not working; that is something we will have to debate when the time comes, but the point I am trying to make is this: do we want - and I really would prefer it if we could carry on this debate calmly - do we want the effect of the development of the first generation of biofuels to be more competition among foodstuffs, the consequence of which has already been seen in Mexico, where maize bread, the staple food of the poorest of the poor, has become some 60% more expensive, or do we want to invest in synthetic fuels, in the second generation of biofuels?
Yes or no?
If that is what we want, we have to get the market interested in it.
It goes without saying that the motor industry and the oil industry have an interest in developing synthetic fuels that will obviate this competition in the food sector, if we make it possible for them to achieve some of this 120-gram target by taking biofuels into account, and, while we will have to argue about the substance of that, I would ask Mrs Harms not to act as if the German Government had some sort of objection to the 120 gram target being enforced by legislation.
Thirdly, I hope we agree on the need to achieve this target as an average taken across the whole range of motor vehicles, by reducing consumption and the output of CO2 by all motor vehicles, from the top of the range to the smaller ones, and including middle of the range models.
If, though, what the European motor industry has undertaken to do has to be enforced by law, it will be done in the manner intended, that being across all classes of motor vehicles, so that an average of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre is achieved.
My fourth comment, for Mrs Harms' benefit, is that I think there are two things that we really must not do.
Perhaps she and I can agree on that if on nothing else, and what I say is also the position taken by the German Government.
It would be mistaken to involve the motor industry in emissions trading in Europe, since that would have the consequence of making emissions trading even more complex, and it is already too complex as it is, so it makes sense to do this outside the emissions trading system.
We might perhaps also agree that the reduction of CO2 output is a task for the future that we ought not to hand over to the private sector by saying that it is, in the final analysis, dependent on individuals' driving habits.
The challenge is a technological one, and it is one we want to face in a technological way, by changing motor vehicle technology and taking some account of the development of synthetic biofuels and of the way they are added.
If your question had to do with the position of the German Government, then I hope that the answer I have given is sufficient for you.
If, though, your question was directed at the Presidency of the Council - which is how I understood it - then I would be obliged if you would have the decency to allow the Presidency the chance to have at least a general debate in the Environmental Affairs Council, which it will be able to do only once the Commission has released a communication on the subject.
I have to say that, if your suggestion was to be understood as a request for such a communication in order that a general debate might be made possible, then that would be the part - indeed the only part - of your speech with which I would find myself in agreement.
(Applause)
Mr President, I listened very carefully to what Minister Gabriel said, because the headlines in the Irish papers today state: 'Germany fights EU limits on car emissions'.
The papers go on to state that 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to fight "with full vigourâ the plans to introduce across-the-board limits on CO2 emissions from cars ...'.
My two minutes does not allow me to continue.
You have a big PR exercise, Minister, if what you say is accurate rather than that which the German President of the Council says.
Therefore, please sort out the confusion that exists there at the moment, particularly as Chancellor Merkel's address at the start of the German Presidency was excellent and most encouraging in this particular area, and she has guaranteed that this issue will take high priority on the summit agenda in March.
We need greater political ownership of this debate.
The real problem is - and I say this through the Chair to our Commissioner as well as to the Minister - that we have left it to our officials and our diplomats.
Yes, Nairobi was 'a step forward' in preparing the ground.
That is what you said.
But it was a baby's step forward, a tortuous step forward: hardly an improvement on what had been agreed in Montreal.
It makes no sense for thousands of us from hundreds of countries to meet once a year, use up carbon and fly to all sorts of locations to sit and argue mainly about what should be on the agenda, then leave again after up to two weeks, only to come back 12 months later to pick up the argument about the agenda that we had left 12 months earlier!
If what we say and all the reports from economists, NGOs, environmentalists and eminent scientists are right - and they are right, 99% of the community agree they right - then we must take the highest political ownership of the resolution of the problem.
That is at summit level: not only at summit meetings, but also at the COPs and the MOPs and in Nairobi and wherever else we meet.
We must drive it upstairs to prime-ministerial and head-of-state level throughout the 12 months of the year, and not just the annual meeting at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change or the Kyoto MOP meeting.
We need political ownership at the highest level.
Drive the agenda, please.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gabriel, I do hope we can agree on the proposal to reduce the CO2 emission of cars to 120 mg and, moreover, on a still greater reduction in the second generation of fuels.
Measures are desperately needed, for very many people have grave concerns about climate change.
Tomorrow, the United Nations will be announcing that the Earth is warming up at a rate quicker than we had previously imagined.
Europe must show leadership in solving the problem.
That is why it is important that we really stand firm with regard to this 30% and that we do not cave in to accept 20% if the rest of the world does not join in.
The fact that we rely on other countries in that manner is very disappointing, although I can see why: first of all, we have a moral duty towards the rest of the world.
Since we have caused climate change, we must also resolve it.
Secondly, according to the Stern report, it is far cheaper to adopt solid climate policy than to pay for subsequent costs for adjusting to global warming.
Climate policy offers ample opportunity for innovation and employment.
Mr President, the Presidency has got off to a very good start on this issue.
I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister in any way at all, and was very pleased to hear the strong words from the Chancellor just the other week.
But of course the rhetoric has got to be matched by the reality, and Germany has a problem.
It has the problem of the national allocation plan, first of all.
I realise there is a problem as regards a difference in interpretation between the Presidency and the Commission, but one way or another it does not help with you in the hot seat not having a national allocation plan approved.
So Minister, please get it sorted.
Then of course there is the issue today of the German car industry and the rhetoric in the various papers.
I have just come from and will return to chairing a hearing on reducing CO2 emissions from motor vehicles.
The clear message from many of the experts speaking is that 120 grammes per kilometre is perfectly realisable within the five-year timescale that we are talking about at a cost of a thousand euros: that is the estimate that many of those experts are putting on it.
And that is a thousand euros with a quick return for car-owners because of fuel economy and savings at the petrol pump.
I ask you, how often in environment debates have we heard industry coming along and saying 'this is impossible, this is the end of our industry if you do this, European Union; this is going to cost an extravagant amount, European Parliament'?
And so often we introduce the legislation and somehow the problems are dissipated, industry copes with it and we become more competitive and our position across the world is strengthened.
I suspect the same thing is happening once again. Industry exaggerates, it always does.
We talk about dealing with this issue of climate change.
If we are looking at the real price of a car, which has come down so significantly over the past 20 or 30 years, and we are saying that to reduce emissions by 25% would cost an extra thousand euros, still leaving the real price of a car at less than it was thirty years ago, can we not bear that price?
How can we look at our children and say that we were not prepared to pay just a little bit more to make such a big difference?
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, as I see it, one reason why we should extend this debate on cars is that it highlights the gulf between words and actions.
Mr Gabriel's proposal for combining the admixture of biofuels and the requirement for the efficiency of motor vehicles obscures the issue, for, even if I sell a car that can run on biofuels, I cannot be certain that the customer will use them in it later on, and so it is the very opposite of clear from the system you propose as to how the output is to be measured, and that gives rise to enormous problems.
Although you talk in terms of a CO2 output of 120 grams per kilometre, what you actually want is the same as the German car manufacturers, namely 130 or 140 grams.
That would be a fatal move not only for Europe but also for the world generally, for, as the target of between 60 and 100 grams must be achieved by 2020 at the latest, the figure of 120 grams can represent only an intermediate stage.
I also want to thank you for your clarifications; I hope that Mrs Merkel and Mr Glos take the same view, for it has not been clear from the press over the last few days that they do.
I may well not be a German, but, for me, Germany has always been one of the great leaders, for the German public give the highest priority to the protection of the environment and to dealing with climate change, and for a German Presidency, having set itself to do great things on the climate change front, to fall over the first time the economy comes under even minimal pressure is an appalling disgrace.
(EL) Mr President, scientists have been sounding the alarm for years.
We are talking not about a future danger but about a present threat.
That is why ambitious statements do not suffice.
Specific measures are needed with tangible and quantifiable results.
The example of the car is a typical example.
As soon as general statements move towards specific measures, the lobbies react.
My opinion is that the lives of all of us and of our children weigh and count more than the automobile industry.
We welcome specific measures such as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, support for renewable sources of energy, clean fuels and new, cleaner technologies.
The European Parliament is calling on the Commission and the Council to set more ambitions targets and, more importantly, to attain them.
We need to change a great deal about our living and consumption habits.
The European Union must take the vanguard in creating a big global alliance.
The Kyoto Protocol, which some still refuse to adopt, no longer suffices.
Mr President, this issue is surrounded by half-truths and misleading statements which cast doubt over the integrity of the issue and raise more questions than answers.
For instance, why, outside this House at any rate, is there continual reference to carbon emissions?
Carbon is a black solid; it is soot or graphite or diamonds.
They should be talking about carbon dioxide which is, by the way, not a pollutant but a natural constituent of the atmosphere.
Why did the director of a UK environment agency tell me they could not link global warming to climate change?
If global warming is due to CO2 and the greenhouse effect, as opposed to a variation in solar activity, why was the same director unable to tell me if the greenhouse affect rises in proportion to the extra amount of CO2 or rises greatly for the same amount of CO2 - an exponential - or a lessening increase, meaning a tapering-off graph and a static effect at some time.
Why does the Stern Report show a hockey stick graph for global warming - a steady rise over 2000 years - when in fact it was warmer in the 14th and 15th centuries than it is now?
Why does Friends of the Earth say that incineration of waste to generate electricity produces more CO2 than conventional gas-fired generators when effectively much of the waste is bio-fuel and therefore carbon-neutral?
They ignore the fact that landfill waste will produce methane, which is 12 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2.
Finally, why does the President of the Commission drive a car which produces 1.6 times more CO2 per kilometre than the average sort of car I drive?
(CS) Mr President, a number of experts have claimed that, apart from speculation based on short-term warnings, there is no incontrovertible scientific evidence that greenhouse gases from industrial growth lie at the root of climate change.
Climate change takes millions of years and the climate will of course go on changing.
I therefore do not share the view that people can change the history of the planet with their daily routine.
That view is, to my mind, arrogantly anthropocentric.
Caring for the planet has little to do with emissions trading, bringing in stricter standards, enacting new legislation or investing massively in cutting emissions from existing sources of energy.
A far more sensible course of action would be to invest in developing new sources of energy and nuclear energy.
I strongly believe that today's narrow-minded, anti-nuclear approach to global warming will, under the guise of combating greenhouse gases, lead us down a blind alley where both our incomes and our freedoms will be curtailed.
Such an approach certainly does not amount to caring for the planet in the interests of our children.
(FR) Mr President, we have a four-fold challenge in front of us: firstly, there is climate change itself and the public desire to tackle it; secondly, international involvement in the fight against climate change; thirdly, the innovation required for a change in production methods and the use of energy; and lastly, our countries' adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change.
It is tempting to ask: what is Europe actually waiting for before properly opening up the debate on nuclear power, by which I mean serious, dispassionate debate?
I would call on you to hold this debate without any further delay.
The option of renewable energy is admittedly a very appealing one, but we have no choice but to look at these things realistically.
Let us take two examples: wind energy and biofuels.
The former accounts for 0.05% of the world's energy consumption.
How fast would we have to develop wind energy in order to achieve 2% annual growth in global consumption of such energy over a period of 30 years?
It is impossible even to contemplate.
Biofuels, on the other hand, are an interesting, media-friendly way of dealing with a problem of agricultural policy, but the possibilities offered by biofuels are limited by available agricultural space.
Mr Dimas, you will have to convince your fellow Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, not to hinder our ambitions.
Mr Gabriel, there are some battles in which we will have to support certain industries that, faced with this global threat, are leading rearguard actions.
I trust that German car makers will be able to come up with the kind of positive responses that are sorely needed.
What, then, are we to say to third countries?
Do we tell China, for example, that it has no right to develop its economy?
Not to mention the hypocrisy of Europe patting itself on the back about emissions trading.
To conclude, those who indulge in alarmism will only end up destabilising public opinion.
We must raise awareness and inform the public, but making people afraid serves no purpose.
It is not constructive.
We should try to propose workable solutions.
This requires everyone to make an effort, and time is our only priority.
(FI) Mr President, for many people climate change has only become a reality now that its cost has been estimated.
According to one estimate, the cost of doing nothing could be as much as 20% of GNP globally.
If we take action now, however, and halt climate change at two degrees, the cost will be a fraction of that.
Moreover, investment in the low-emission economy will create a global market for energy-efficient technologies which is forecast to grow to a value of up to EUR 27 billion by 2020.
For Europe to be part of this technological development, the Union needs to create a viable domestic market for renewable, low-emission forms of energy.
We have to remember that nuclear energy cannot be the answer to this problem, especially if we want Europe to be a self-sufficient energy economy.
(SV) Mr President, I shall not repeat what has already been said, but I just want to mention one thing. The European Parliament must embark on a direct dialogue with the newly elected American Congress.
Instead of just following the American debate in the media, it is our responsibility to take action.
The political balance in Congress has changed, and right now the door may be open for the cooperation that must take place if change is to take place.
Congress has now even set up a special committee on climate change.
Strength lies in the EU and the United States acting together.
Only together can we influence countries such as China and India so that they too might be involved in global emissions trading.
They must not firstly be allowed to pollute their own environment and ours at will just because they are developing countries, and only once they have achieved high living standards assume responsibility for the global environment.
I propose that the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety make immediate contact with the corresponding committee in the American Congress.
A joint meeting between the committees concerned should be organised as early as this spring.
The objective of this dialogue must be to get the United States and other countries not included in emissions trading to get involved in it.
As representatives of the peoples of Europe, we must dare to take the bull by the horns.
That is why we were elected.
Mr President, there has been a lot of rhetoric here this afternoon, particularly from the Council, but what is missing is a sense of urgency and a commitment to ambitious action.
It is clear the EU has to do a lot more and to show real leadership.
However, in my one minute I want to ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to do something very specific.
There has been a lot of discussion about what is wrong today but not enough about what we need to be doing - some of the answers.
I want to raise the issue of personal carbon allowances.
It is a scheme that is growing in interest in many Member States whereby emission rights are allocated to all individuals on an equal per capita basis and then surrendered, for example when they are purchasing fossil fuels or electricity for personal use and, of course, over time those emission rights decline.
It is complementary to the emissions trading scheme, but in many ways it is more equitable than much greater taxation, it has the advantage of being subject to an overall and declining cap and, crucially, it engages people on a personal level.
It affects individual choices that they make, because one of the strongest disincentives to individual action is the sense that your neighbour is not doing what you are doing.
Therefore, I would ask your departments to investigate what they can do to encourage the take-up of such schemes across the European Union.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the more than 40 deaths caused by the Kyrill storm are a sad portent of what is in store for us in the near future.
Global warming and the associated climate change have not been dreamt up by environmental groups: during the 20th century, the average temperature increased by more than half a degree, and we must look for a cause in the emission of greenhouse gases produced by human activities.
The European Union is responsible for around 14% of these emissions, the highest per capita quota in the world.
That is why the fight against climate change, which requires the help of all countries, needs none other than the most advanced countries to lead the way.
The EU must therefore continue to work in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, which has led us to bank on technological innovation.
In recent years, however, some backwards steps have been taken, particularly in relation to energy, and the recent Commission proposals have not lived up to expectations.
Even though you yourself, Mr Dimas, asked for emissions to be cut by 30% compared with 1990 levels, a poor compromise was reached to reduce them by 20%, and there is no strategy in the transport sector, on alternative energy sources or on technologies for green hydrogen.
To say nothing of the ambiguity where nuclear energy is concerned ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President, industry is bound to notice that drastic measures will be taken.
Emission rights will need to be reduced annually and the allocation of emission rights free of charge will need to stop.
Moreover, since more and more sectors will need to fall within the compulsory system of emission trading, it is to be welcomed that the Commission wishes to include the aviation industry in it.
Both producers and consumers must take up their responsibility where the climate is concerned.
So, then, must all of us.
By way of a final remark, we should not attempt to address the climate problem unilaterally, which would mean that measures would lead to other environmental damage.
The production and incineration of biofuels must be environmentally friendly, and that is where the problem was with palm oil.
Environmental clangers of this kind must be prevented in future.
(DE) Commissioner, Mr Gabriel, I too have only a minute in which to get through to your mind.
The only thing one can say, having heard you, is that the lion has a mighty roar.
We know that President Bush holds the reins of power, and the way you, Minister, roar is reminiscent of the way one of your predecessors - Klaus TÃ¶pfer - roared in 1992, when we were in much the same situation.
It almost seems as if an historic window of opportunity opened up for us somewhere between the fall of the Wall and globalisation, but, as nothing happened that serves as an example of what not to do.
I do, however, want to encourage you to stick with this issue, to sidestep as elegantly as possible the resistance with which you meet on the part of the German motor industry, and to really concentrate on the matter in hand.
You will, of course, have to be aware that this will not happen without some sacrifices.
If you succeed in getting the idea across to the rich Member States that doing without is sexy, your political destiny could be that of the successor to the environment minister whom I have named - and for you, and perhaps for the world, that would be no bad thing.
Mr President, we have two tasks to fulfil: one is to reduce CO2 emissions and the other is to ensure that we can meet the changes that follow climate change.
They both require that we have the resources for investment, that we have the opportunities for growth and the opportunities to take care of the environment.
Limits and goals are important in this, but it is just as important to take action that is compatible with economic growth and resources for investments in order to safeguard what we must do.
Sometimes we can look at the more practical and realistic actions.
I shall mention only two.
Long-truck combinations are one of the more substantial ways of reducing CO2 emissions regarding road transport.
Commissioner, President-in-Office: you can do something about that as a practical action that will have a substantial result.
The second task concerns energy policy.
Phasing out nuclear power in the way and at a pace that is being planned in today's Europe is a secure way of getting increased CO2 emissions.
If we succeed in launching more renewable energy sources, then the phasing-out of nuclear power will reduce the gains and maybe we will get into minus with increased CO2 emissions.
I should like the German Presidency to take the lead in a new policy.
You should do that not in order to solve the greenhouse effect, as some say, but in order not to make things worse.
We must at least keep the same share of energy coming from nuclear power that we have today in order not to increase CO2 emissions.
We need high-tech, not low-tech; we need more trade, not less trade; we need more investments, not less investments and we need more growth, not less growth.
The challenge is to combine those things, and I look forward to your reply on my two certain tasks, however politically uncomfortable it might be for you.
(PT) As Kofi Annan said in Nairobi, climate change is not science fiction.
It is a global problem requiring a global response from both governments and citizens.
Governments must, as a matter of urgency, take effective measures, but the citizens, too, must change their routines and their lifestyles, for example, by not using their cars and by walking more, which is healthy and protects the environment.
Fighting climate change is a priority for the German and Portuguese Presidencies.
I hope that, together, they can provide a major boost to this fight and that the EU will take the opportunity, at the next UN conference to be held in Bali during the Portuguese Presidency, to lead negotiations towards a whole new approach to the climate issue.
Thank you for your excellent address, Mr Gabriel.
(FR) Mr President, thinking ahead to 2030-2050, will fossil fuels have run out?
Will the ITER project have kept its promise on fusion?
Given the huge growth of China and India, will energy resources be sufficient?
What will the effects of growth be on the climate?
We do not necessarily have all the answers to these questions, but what is clear is that we must act within the framework of a European and world strategy, because energy is a fundamental need and the phenomenon of global warming must be stopped.
I welcome the ambitious objectives consisting of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, because the EU must send out a strong message that behaviour and mentalities must be changed so that innovative solutions with global impact might be found.
I also welcome the measures proposed by the Commission, but they must be accompanied by political action.
Accordingly, more must be done to force the Member States to take more proactive measures, for example in connection with the use of biofuels and renewable energies, and to take taxation measures to foster energy saving and to promote the energy efficiency of buildings.
Moreover, without wishing to be alarmist, a European communication campaign should be launched, with the support of the media, in order to present the citizens of Europe with simple things that anyone can do to help protect the climate.
The future we desire will come about through fundamental technological development, as well as through actions that we can all carry out, starting today.
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the day after tomorrow the UN will publish a scientific report that says that the earth is most likely to warm up by three degrees this century. If that happens it will mean that Greenland's ice sheet will inevitably melt and sea levels will rise by at least seven metres.
It will mean that the map of Europe will be redrawn.
This has to be prevented.
We have to take very urgent practical action to stop the earth from warming up any more than two degrees, which is the EU target.
We need to move from rhetoric to practical deeds, however.
In this context, it is hugely disappointing to see that today the European Commission has once again put off the issue of mandatory limits for carbon dioxide emissions.
We need to understand that the most important factor of all is measures to improve energy and fuel efficiency.
That also applies to transport.
We cannot get round this by substituting biofuel for improved energy efficiency.
If we try and do this, it will only mean that the environmentalists will turn against biofuel.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank the Commission and the Council for coming here to debate this issue and the strategy to be pursued in the future.
We all agree with the principle of reducing polluting emissions that underlies the proposals by the Commission and the Member States.
We agree with the diagnosis, though we have certain differences in terms of the remedies to be applied and each person's responsibilities.
I am delighted to have heard something here that I believe to be essential.
That is that there must be an international agreement on emissions reduction that includes everybody.
Unless we achieve that, it will be difficult to find a solution if objectives are set unilaterally.
Amongst other things, because, on its own, the European Union can neither reduce world emissions nor set objectives for maintaining temperatures at global level.
I truly believe that our main objective must be to reach a global agreement through our efforts, of course, and also with the efforts of our industries.
Like you, Commissioner, I would personally prefer a more flexible objective, to which everybody is committed, to an objective of a 30% reduction with no idea of who will sign up to it.
In addition to that, we must take a series of principles into account.
Firstly, the countries that have historically polluted more must reduce their emissions more, and reasonable emissions limits for the future should be set for the emerging economies.
Secondly, all sectors will have to face their responsibilities in accordance with their emissions, because it makes no sense to talk about electricity but not to talk about transport.
Thirdly, we must also bear in mind the benefits for carbon retention of agriculture and forests, which are natural regulators of the environment.
Finally, I would like to point to the importance of promoting renewable energy sources and clean forms of transport and say that it is urgent that we discuss seriously the issue of nuclear energy once and for all.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister for their personal commitment to this crucial issue and remind the House that these are the good guys!
There are plenty of people in the Commission and in the Council who are going to be pushing against these in terms of where we are at.
The proposals that have come forward from the Commission are indeed ambitious.
However, they are not ambitious enough and they do not follow through the science.
The science suggests that if we are to follow through what the ministers have already decided - that is not to go above two degrees - then you have to have a 30% cut in carbon emissions.
If you follow Stern, you have to take the pain now to save later.
What we want to see is world leadership.
A 20% cut is not world leadership.
The ministers have to follow through.
If they sign up to this, they have to follow through.
It is disappointing to see that the Member States are not signing up to 20% binding targets on renewables.
It is disappointing that the Commission has caved in to the German car lobby, but it is good to hear the ministers say that actually we are not going to cave in to the car lobby, as some Commissioners have done - not Mr Dimas.
Please Minister, sort out your national allocation plan.
It is crucial.
It is time for the Council not just to talk the talk, but to walk the walk.
(Applause)
(HU) I agree that climate change may have catastrophic consequences for the world - and with it for Europe.
If over the next ten years we do not radically turn around our current practice, if we do not change our current way of life, then this may cause enormous economic and ecological damage.
It is precisely for this reason that it is in the interests of each Member State, and their moral obligation, to commit itself to the climate policy announced by the German Presidency - namely, by 2020 reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, increasing the share of renewables in the total energy mix to 20%, as well as raising the proportion of biofuel in the fuel consumed to 10%.
As far as actions are concerned, I call upon the Commission to compare the operating programmes of the Member States, which are currently under assessment, with these targets.
Insofar as the Commission should determine that in a particular Member State there are insufficient EU sources allocated to reaching these targets, it should make use of its powers and refuse to accept in this form the operating programme of the country in question.
It is unacceptable that a few Member States should support energy efficiency and the joint European efforts made in the area of energy savings with words alone.
Hungary and Poland want to devote scarcely more than 1% of the Union budget to this area, while Lithuania, for instance, is willing to devote 5.4%.
It is already clear that this will not enable Hungarians and Poles to fulfil even their current EU commitments.
If we think and act responsibly, then in the next six months the third industrial revolution may begin.
The goal of this industrial revolution is to stop climate change, and its result will be the creation of a low-carbon, and then a carbon-free economy.
(ET) In recent days, a great deal of interesting information has come from Davos about the extent of climate change and its possible catastrophic impact.
I participated in the same event 12 years ago, and I must admit that climate change was not mentioned on that occasion.
Talk, however, is not enough.
The melting of Greenland's ice sheet, the Arctic ice and the Siberian permafrost have noticeably reduced the amount of ice on the Earth, which will lead to a dangerous increase in the sea level around the globe.
It appears that this has helped us to understand better the dangers that we face.
It is clear that the Kyoto Treaty itself as a political mechanism is insufficient - we need quicker action.
This was also mentioned at Davos.
We must set binding and ambitious objectives in Europe to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
The developing economies of China and India are key countries and must hold an important position in the new political mechanism.
In order for them to follow us, we must first show that Europe is taking this topic seriously, and will not just limit itself to a 20% reduction.
(SK) In dealing with such a serious issue as climate change, it is necessary for us at the European Parliament to support better communication and a more standardised procedure for identifying appropriate strategic solutions.
I believe that the initiative of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could have involved prior consultations with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, particularly regarding the energy package of the European Commission.
The draft resolution of the Committee on the Environment comes up with new binding objectives that are much more ambitious and yet we are not at all sure whether or how we will meet the goals set out in the existing proposals of the European Commission.
We all know that it is time to act, since the situation in the area of climate change is indeed serious.
I am not going to list those areas of the energy sector where substantial improvements can be achieved as regards CO2 emissions.
Expected growth levels will, however, bring forth new ideas concerning the problem of rising demand for energy.
There can be no doubt that the development of new energy-generating installations should be based on carbon-free technologies.
Renewable sources, which we have so often advocated, and quite justifiably too, will scarcely be able to meet the ever-growing demand.
It is therefore difficult to understand why nuclear energy, which generates virtually no CO2 emissions, still finds little support and is mentioned only vaguely in the strategies of the European Commission and the European Union in general, leaving the decisions to the discretion of Member States.
Mr President, in my one minute of speaking time, I would like to focus on three issues based on my amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety yesterday.
Transport is one of the main sources of climate change; road transport uses five times more energy than train transport for the same number of passengers.
The same goes for private cars on the one hand and trams and subways on the other hand.
That is why public transport should be a priority for us.
In a market economy, in a capitalist society, most of these fine goals could be reached by using economic and financial tools.
Energy efficiency can be increased only along with a very balanced green tax system.
In the longer term, Europe should have a harmonised ecological tax system, because without such a system, our common environmental policy does not have proper tools.
Our developed Member States have exported their energy and natural-resource-consuming activities to less-developed countries, exporting greenhouse emissions and environmental damage as well.
We must prevent such practices in the future.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a lady Member has just said that political problems such as climate protection must not be talked about for too long if there is no solution to them, the opposite is also the case, in that, in politics, you have to take care that problems are not whipped up into the most important problem full stop and into something that presages the end of the world, without, at the end of the day, any solution being offered that really does amount to a change for the better.
It is also with a certain amount of concern that I see some recent debates being conducted in a way that loses touch with reality, with people talking about storms being caused by changes in climate, even though anyone who reads intelligent meteorology knows that that is not how it works.
There are also certain questions that are simply not being asked, or not being answered, for example, why it is that, despite the worldwide increase in the amount of CO2 being generated over the past 120 years, a temperature increase of only 0.3 degrees is being recorded at most locations, and why it was that it was between 1930 and 1960 that there was the greatest increase in storms of the highest category, with a less marked increase over the last four decades?
Why is it that we have no explanation for the fact that, even if all the industrialised nations were to reduce their greenhouse gas output by 30%, we would, by 2100, have done no more than delay the warming effect by six years?
I am not questioning the need for us to give this problem our urgent attention; I am merely asking whether we are giving it thorough enough consideration and whether we are perhaps sometimes acting precipitately without asking the right questions.
We are discussing climate change, security of supply and competitiveness, albeit without weighing up the various points, and instead considering them in terms of what the alternatives are.
Why is no serious thought being given to the possibility of deriving 70% of the CO2-free electricity from nuclear power, for, if the protection of the climate is so important, surely all the alternatives have to be considered fearlessly and without ideological presuppositions, and one of those alternatives, in the future, will be nuclear energy.
If we are to have this debate at all, it must be conducted on a broad basis, openly, and with the necessary time being set aside for it.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I do not doubt that the topic of climate change will occupy us for a long time to come and there is going to be a long timelag between any action taken and the actual effect of turning climate change round.
That makes it all the more important that we should get Europe, its policies and the legislation that goes along with them adjusted to this fact and should get something practical done about it, which will of course involve - along with the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 - strategies for reducing CO2 emissions in individual sectors, for example, from private motor vehicles, in respect of which we must not only express concerns but also discuss opportunities.
Reduced emission of CO2 from motor cars and the associated savings in fuel will have a positive effect on security of energy supply when one bears in mind the fact that road traffic accounts for all of 26.5% of the European Union's total energy consumption.
The special measures already mentioned do not involve reinventing the wheel; other states, Japan among them, have also brought in programmes for reducing the CO2 pumped out by motor cars, which involves vehicles being divided up, in 'top runner' programmes, into nine different weight classes and binding targets for reductions being laid down.
As the report put before us recently by Mr Stern reminded us, the saying that time is money acquires a new significance in climate policy.
Mr President, first of all I would like to agree with Mrs Doyle that the problem that we are facing is not environmental.
It affects all sectors of society and we have to take a systematic and comprehensive approach.
To Mr Reul I would like to say that I think we have to realise that parallel to climate change, we are also affected by the depletion of fisheries, huge and rapid deforestation, and water scarcity in many parts of the world.
We have to face the fact that the lifestyles that we have developed in a world with 8 to 9 billion people goes beyond the carrying capacity of the globe, and that is why we have to take a systematic approach that brings us back onto a normal, sustainable path.
The reason I asked to speak is primarily that I am very disappointed with one aspect of the energy and climate package from the Commission.
You talk, Commissioner, in that package, about an energy partnership with Africa.
That is good.
But why not the same for China and India?
I know there are technology agreements, but there is very little money to back them up.
In the coming five to ten years, emissions from these countries because of expanding energy systems will totally overwhelm us unless we help them to do the right things now.
Some people say 'let China pay'.
But then we disregard the historic responsibility we have for all the emissions in the past and we also disregard the fact that the Chinese need skilled people; they need technology to make it happen; they need to invest in clean technology.
So my question to you and to the Minister is, why do you not think big?
Why do you not establish a partnership with China and India and beef it up with financial resources so that we can really do this together aggressively?
Otherwise I think what we are doing here will be rather marginal in the years to come.
We have to have this dual approach, and I feel the omission of this in your energy package is conspicuous.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is a golden opportunity to overcome Europessimism by showing citizens the added value of our sovereign states sharing power to address the global problem of climate change, about which they are all seriously concerned.
However, decisions must be made transparently and democratically so that we can see who is pressing to have decisions deferred.
Later decisions will be too late on this issue.
We must pool our resources, adopt common rules and regulations and the necessary penalties to guarantee implementation.
Hard political decisions must be made on taxation, renewable energy, fuel efficiency and cleaner technologies that will revolutionise our industries and our consumption.
Indeed, why not benchmark the national infrastructure programmes which in many cases the European Union is funding?
I would also argue that we must beware false prophets, like the nuclear industry, which claim to be the answer to this problem.
Mr President, honourable Members, there are just a few points on which I would like to enlarge.
Many of you have said that we have been talking about climate change for many years without anything actually having happened, but I would ask that we should not underestimate what the Commission has come up with over the last few weeks and not make it out to be less than it is.
That the Commission should, for the first time, have devised a joint strategy for securing energy supply and protecting against climate change is something I see as constituting a unique opportunity, and I would point out that, while we have, in the past, as a rule, discussed these two things separately, we now have a joint strategy.

Turning to Mrs Harms among others, let me ask this: just what were the most important proposals that you criticised earlier?
The first package dealt with energy efficiency.
It is not just a case of the European Union being able, given increased energy efficiency by 2020, to save EUR 100 billion that are urgently needed for consumers, for investments in research, development and other things that are on our agenda, for increasing energy efficiency by 20% means that we are spared 780 million tonnes of CO2 - double the amount we wanted to save in Europe under the Kyoto Protocol.
Energy efficiency does not often lend itself so well to big ideological and political debates as, for example nuclear power.
Energy efficiency is often about many small issues that one has to monitor, keep an eye on, and keep on moving forward, but it does offer the greatest opportunities not only for secure energy supply but also for climate protection.
I regard the Commission's proposals on this subject as an excellent package, and would be glad if we - quite apart from all the great banner headlines - were to give at least as much thought to the issue of how we can actually implement the many individual programmes contained in this package, both as a matter of Community policy and in the policies of the Member States.
Secondly, the motor industry's 120 grams of CO2 emitted per kilometre are of course part of the theme of greater energy efficiency, but, returning to your earlier question as to how it is to be ensured that a proportionate amount of biofuel is also taken into account, I can say that we are together putting the case for Europe's oil industry to move on from the present proportion of 5.75% biofuels to be mixed in, to a substantially greater percentage.
The Commission is proposing 10%, and some Member States see an even higher percentage as feasible.
As I see it, 12.5% or 15% ought not to be beyond the bounds of possibility as an effective means of ensuring that, in the European Union, no oil gets on to the market and into the petrol pumps unless it contains a specified proportion of biofuels.
I see that as an absolute necessity, firstly in order, in this area too, to make us less dependent on oil and gas imports, secondly to ensure that we become less affected by international price increases, and thirdly, in order to make the most important contribution to reducing the output of CO2 as a result of the fuels we consume.
The second major area is, of course, that of renewable energies, so can we please not act as if it were already self-evident in the European Union that all Member States would accept as a single goal what the Commission is proposing, namely that primary energy consumption in Europe should be 20% renewable?
There is a long road to travel before we get that far.
What I would ask your House to do is to help us and the Commission get a majority for this target at the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government, for I regard it as one of the most important that we have to achieve.
Mrs GrossetÃªte, who had asked me for an answer on the subject of nuclear power, is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber, so perhaps you would tell her from me that, if nuclear power accounts for 15% of Europe's end-user energy consumption, it makes little sense to concentrate only on that 15%, for, if we did that, 85% would be unaffected.
Perhaps I might add that, if you want to make yourself less dependent on oil and gas imports in order to have motor vehicles emitting less in the way of CO2, you will hardly be able to offer nuclear power as an alternative unless we in Europe can agree to drive only electric cars.
I do not exactly see that happening any time soon.
That is why concentrating on renewable energies, as the Commission proposes, is very definitely the right way to go.
That will of course have to involve a burden-sharing arrangement, with every country in Europe having to take on a certain percentage and thus make it possible for the 20% target for primary energy consumption to be achieved by 2020.
Let me conclude by mentioning two areas in which we are a long way away from achieving any real breakthrough.
Many of you have pointed to the emerging economies of such countries as China, India and Brazil - set to produce a great deal of emissions in the future - and argued that we need to get them on board where the reduction of CO2 is concerned, by means of undertakings that may well be voluntary, but better still mandatory, and you are right to do so, but we will not be able to do that in the absence of technological solutions that we can offer them as a means towards growth.
Whether the European Union opts for 30, 20, 40 or 10 per cent is completely irrelevant; the only way we will have a chance of getting these countries on board is to offer them technologies that they can use to provide themselves with energy, that will guarantee them growth while not, at the same time, damaging the climate in the way it hitherto has been in the industrialised nations, and we are a long way away from doing that.
Despite the good initiative from the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, despite the willingness to transfer technology by way of 'clean development mechanism' projects under the Kyoto Protocol, that which is on offer is far from enough.
I would therefore say that, if you want to find out just how differently the European Union and the developing countries think about these things, you should go and participate in international talks from time to time.
When we start talking about how to deal with climate change, our opposite numbers in the developing countries take that to mean that their former colonial masters are coming along and trying to inhibit their economic development.
When we go to Brazil and talk about how to protect the rainforest - one object of that being to stop putting so much CO2 into the atmosphere, and another being to maintain the forest's natural capacity for absorbing it - the answer we get from officials is 'you have not yet got used to the idea that these are our rainforests; it is we who decide what happens to them, and not the old colonial states in Europe, who are again trying to tell us what to do'.
That is how far we actually are from any sort of common understanding of what protecting the climate is about, and common ground on this point is very difficult to achieve.
A number of you have said that we need to practise self-denial; I presume that they mean that the people of Europe have to deny themselves prosperity and other things.
I do not think that they need to do that, yet all the same, we, in the industrialised states, must declare ourselves willing to return some of the benefits we have gained over the past few hundred years from our former colonies, some of the wealth we have accumulated at the cost of their poverty, to those states, not least in order to give them answers to their questions as to how they can drive forward their own economic and social development without damaging the climate.
That is the sort of self-denial we are talking about - not the renunciation of prosperity for ourselves, but abandoning the idea that all the wealth we in Europe and in other industrialised states have worked to create should be kept by us for us alone.
We will have to make some of this wealth available in order to fund technological developments and technology transfers, along with the things that need to be done to adapt to the climate change that is already happening.
That is the second thing that the developing countries demand of the industrialised nations; before they become willing to talk with us about limiting their CO2 output while still pursuing growth, they want to see us showing ourselves willing to repair the damage already done in them by climate change and to help them to adapt to it.
We now possess a fund intended to be valued at EUR 300 million - perhaps more - by 2012, with the intention of funding adaptation measures around the world.
Is there anyone in this Chamber who actually believes that EUR 300 million will really be enough to get the world as a whole adjusted to climate change?
That amount is approximately equivalent to the budgets of two medium-sized towns in my own country, and it is far from being enough.
Those are the two questions that are put to us.
We are not being asked whether we, in Europe, are willing to make cutbacks of 20%, 30% or 40%; we are being asked what we are doing to facilitate real transfers of technology to their countries in order to enable them to achieve growth while at the same time avoiding doing harm to the climate, and, secondly, what we are doing to fund adaptation in those countries to the climate change for which we are responsible.
Those are the answers we have to give if we want to get China, Brazil and India - who will account for so much future output - on our side.

Like Commissioner Dimas, I am convinced that America will sign up to an agreement that works; whether that agreement is called Kyoto or something else remains to be seen, but what the USA will do is participate in a functioning market, in a functioning emissions trading system, and in climate protection schemes that actually work.
For as long as no answers to these questions are forthcoming from us, the Americans - no matter who is in power there - will find it easy not to sign up to binding undertakings.
I would like to make a second comment in response to the Austrian Member who said, 'Well roared, lion!', and to Mrs Harms, who said, 'enough words have been bandied back and forth, now is the time for some action.'
I believe that nothing like enough has yet been said, and if Mrs Harms wants evidence of that, she only needs to look around this Chamber or at the Bundestag back home in Germany.
If we are convinced that climate change really is a challenge to the human race, why, then, can we not, in the national parliaments, get those Members who speak up in debates about health service reform, the labour market, foreign policy and peacemaking, to get worked up about climate change?
Why, then, have we not managed to get the Members who were in this Chamber earlier to vote to stay here and take part in this debate, to get angry about what the Commission or the Council say, to come up with their own proposals, to express their agreement or disagreement, to make criticisms or contribute to debate?
We are far from having engaged the voting public to the degree to which we should have done, for if we had, there would be unanimity on these various issues in the Member States.
Let us then be careful with assertions about there having been enough talking; I believe we still have some way to go before we have convinced those who need to be won over if difficult decisions are to get majority backing.
It is not enough to convince the environmental policy experts, and, indeed, some of them in our Member States have yet to be won over.
I am not particularly inclined to tell other people what they have to do; we have quite enough to do in my own country, and I suspect that I am not alone in thinking this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the February part-session.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity, and it is one where isolated and patchy responses by individual countries would be entirely inadequate.
The European Union is a level at which action can be highly effective, both in setting stringent common rules for our common market and in terms of leverage to secure action at world level.
Without the EU, there would have been no Kyoto agreement, but we must now move forward with all the more vigour to secure a successor agreement.
We must also look at strengthening our emissions trading scheme and seeking to extend it to other parts of the world.
Indeed, EU action on the environment must become so effective and visible that our citizens begin to equate the letters EU with 'Environmental Union'!
(FR) The fact that we are meeting to debate climate change at exactly the same time as international experts are meeting in Paris to discuss climate change and the consequences thereof sends out a strong message.
Global warming is not a figment of the imagination of a few publicity-seeking scientists and politicians; it is a reality that we must now come to terms with.
It is up to us as lawmakers to draw up rules aimed at limiting the impact of climate change.
This is what the Commission's proposal to include aviation in the emissions trading scheme is designed to do, and there are other such cases.
This legislation is necessary if we are to offset the impact of the dramatic rise in air transport.
We must, however, pay careful attention to the way in which we decide to implement this mechanism, because this is not about undermining European airlines or holding back air transport, but about reducing the impact of air transport on climate change.
Furthermore, in order for our efforts to have genuine impact on CO2 emissions, I would like to see the Union also enact laws on other means of transport, not least in the car industry.
(PT) As we know, the Commission recently proposed a package of measures on energy and a number of targets on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy, thereby affirming their desire to combat climate change and to foster energy security and EU competitiveness.
The Commission has now come to this Chamber to restate these objectives and targets, highlighting an international agreement on the post-2012 framework and the target of a 30% reduction in emissions in developing countries.
Accordingly, the EU must immediately undertake to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% and to implement practical, energy-specific measures.
However, the possibility remains open - unsurprisingly - of emissions trading, which especially affects the more economically fragile countries that do not have the money to buy emissions rights.
Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the area of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there is another set of proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, knowing the opposition, that is, the USA.
Most importantly, however, all of this must not be taken as an opportunity for more liberalisation and further concentration in the area of energy, and the further domination of the most powerful countries.
We are speaking as though the debate is over, and the threat of catastrophic global warming is real.
Yet there are many climatologists who take a different view.
They believe that current changes are within the normal historic range, and that predictions of future warming are exaggerated and alarmist.
Nevertheless, whatever our view on climate change, energy security demands that we reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.
We can no longer rely on Russia, the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela for energy.
While we must develop renewables, and enhance energy conservation, there is only one non-carbon technology which can provide the continuous, reliable base-load power we need to drive economic growth, and that technology is nuclear.
It is bitterly ironic that many of the climate alarmists, who call for dramatic reductions in carbon emissions, also oppose nuclear power.
(IT) As the German Presidency rightly pointed out, we can no longer put off drafting a proper energy and environmental policy if we want to guarantee our citizens and the EU healthy and sustainable development over time.
I therefore agree with my fellow Members that we should make this subject an absolute priority in our work over the coming months.
It seems strange, but precisely on the 50th anniversary of the European project, and at a time of political deadlock due to the failure of the Constitution, the difficulties in relation to enlargement and the estrangement that a section of the European population is reporting, we have the opportunity, armed as we are with far more adequate economic, technological and political instruments, to relaunch the process with practical proposals, by reviving and adapting to everyday needs the idea behind the European process: that of combining our efforts and aims to achieve a sufficiently independent and sustainable energy supply.
Economic development, as well as the health of our citizens and of our environment, will depend on this, just as it did 50 years ago.
Furthermore, thanks to the role that it now plays at international level, the European Union can also influence the world's political stability and serve as an example for those fledgling economies that are booming economically but are not yet aware of the consequences that that entails.
New PNR agreement SWIFT (debate)
The next item is the debate on
the oral question by Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0001/2007), and
the oral question by Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council, on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0002/2007).
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has, in the past, demanded your attention here in the European Parliament, and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly, and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers' personal data.
As we all know, following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the United States enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems, the material known as 'passenger name records', and, should the airlines decline to comply, they are threatened with the withdrawal of their landing rights.
I would now like to briefly remind the House of the state of play.
In May 2006, the European Court of Justice had, in response to an appeal by your House, declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to the US authorities and, likewise, the Commission's decision on the appropriateness of the data protection measures.
The ECJ's fundamental justification for its decision was the European Community's lack of power to conclude any such agreement, since it was not within the sphere of the first pillar.
It had nothing to say about the material question of whether the data was sufficiently protected.
As you will be aware, negotiations with the USA on a successor agreement proved to be highly problematic, but it was nevertheless eventually possible to conclude them with an interim agreement due to expire on 3 July this year, which is on the basis of the third pillar and of the USA's undertaking given in respect of data protection, which had already been taken as a basis to the earlier agreement between the European Community and the United States.
At the beginning of January 2007, the Commission made a recommendation to the Council to the effect that it should approve the commencement of negotiations with the USA on a new passenger data agreement that should replace the present interim one.
The EU's negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency, which the Commission endorses, was today discussed by COREPER, and the prospect is that the Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February.
It is likely that the negotiations on a new passenger name record agreement will prove to be extremely difficult, since there is no evidence of any interest on the part of the United States in improving data protection.
Indeed, it seems far more likely that they will claim that their undertaking in respect of data protection no longer applies.
The conclusion of an agreement is, however, essential in terms of the standard of data protection that is to be guaranteed and in the interests of the European Union, for, in the absence of an agreement, the airlines would be under great pressure to pass on the passenger data in order not to risk losing their right to land in the USA.
The German Presidency of the Council will, with the Commission's support, be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data, taking the interests of the passengers and of the airlines into account and maintaining a high level of security, and I would like to stress that it is, in this, taking due account of the positions of your House as expressed in the relevant resolutions of September last year on data protection, on the combating of terrorism, and also on the defence of human rights.
This subject also brings me to speak in response to the oral questions put to me by Mrs BerÃšs and Mr Cavada on the subject of SWIFT.
The Council wishes to thank them for their interest in this dossier, in relation to which it has already had the opportunity to answer questions from your House's Members on various occasions.
As regards my answers to these questions, I would refer the honourable Members to my statement.
In December 2006, the Council informed the Members that the questions they had raised demanded careful examination; the Council is still engaged in doing this, and its inquiries have not yet been completed.
In the remainder of this speech, I shall be endeavouring, on behalf of the Council, to answer the various questions put to me by Members of your House, although all the matters to which I can refer are still subject to the Council's inquiries.
In a speech in July 2006, the Finnish minister for European affairs, as the then President-in-Office of the Council, announced to the plenary that the Council was not at that time able to confirm press reports of an exchange of information between SWIFT and the American authorities.
She reminded your House that finding out what had actually happened was a matter for the national authorities, and went on to state that the European Union was then, and would in future be, prepared to act if it turned out that events made legislation at the European level necessary.
As I have already mentioned, the Council and the Commission are currently still engaged in examining every aspect and every issue of potential relevance to this dossier, while also taking the outcomes from the data protection group into consideration.
The Presidency is giving thought to how the work on this at Council level might be organised, and will, in so doing, take account of what emerges from the current investigations, but what I can tell you is that no new group has as yet been appointed with this purpose in mind.
Since investigations are still ongoing, the Council is at present unable to answer the question as to whether these matters will impact Regulation 1781 of 15 November 2006 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds.
The Council has no knowledge of whether or not the Commission is considering submitting any proposal for the amendment of this Regulation, but I am sure that we will learn that when the Commission makes its statement.
Under the Treaty, it is the Commission's function to monitor the implementation of Community law in the Member States and to take appropriate action as and when a Member State fails to discharge its obligations under EC law.
Reference has also been made to the 'automated targeting system', an American system affecting the transport of freight and persons within the United States and from and into them.
Whether data obtained from SWIFT have been fed into this system is one of the questions currently being examined.
When it stated that an international framework for combating terrorism was already in place, the data protection group was referring to the working party on fighting money laundering and the funding of terrorism and the recommendations made by it.
The Council believes that good work is being done within this framework, although it has to be said that this group's recommendations are addressed to banks and financial institutions.
While I am on this subject, I would like to stress - speaking on the Council's behalf - that SWIFT cannot be regarded as a financial institution for this working party's purposes and that the Financial Action Task Force framework is therefore not directly applicable, except possibly to certain specific aspects.
That concludes the Presidency's statement on behalf of the Council.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I shall begin by addressing PNR.
As you all know, the temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year, in a few months' time.
There is therefore the need to negotiate a very solid and stable legal framework which will enable the exchange of PNR data with the United States with full respect of data protection and privacy rights.
As the Presidency of the Council just said, the Commission has recommended to the Council that it authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives.
I am confident that these recommendations will be examined very soon.
I personally strongly hope that by mid-February we will get a negotiating mandate to open this very difficult exercise.
The Commission is recommending to the Council to strive for full respect of fundamental rights, notably the right to privacy.
I have said on a number of occasions that the right to privacy is for me non-negotiable.
It has to be respected, fully and completely.
Legal certainty is also an important element for air-carriers.
It must be taken into account, as it has been from the very beginning.
As I have already stressed in this Parliament several times, the Commission is committed to continuing to give due consideration to privacy on the one hand and legal security on the other, as they form key principles of this file, without forgetting the importance of preventing and fighting terrorism and related transnational crimes.
The negotiations for a new agreement with the United States on PNR data are a key priority for the Commission, and for me personally, and I understand from what the Presidency of the Council just said that it shares this view.
I warmly welcome the close cooperation between the Commission and the Council Presidency, which is crucial if we want to succeed, if we want to speak with one voice.
On my side, of course, as usual, I will keep Parliament informed as this work progresses.
You know very well that, as it was in the past, for me it will be a political commitment, though this document - for example, the negotiating recommendations - once approved will be classified as EU-restricted.
The negotiations will present a real challenge for Europe.
It will require imagination; it will require a lot of common effort from all the EU institutions and from the United States as well in order to reach a very robust, solid solution.
To conclude, I would like to see, for example, this Parliament, together with the United States Congress - following the political phases of this very difficult exercise - making, perhaps for the first time, a joint political commitment which would be particularly useful for the ongoing negotiations.
However, it is up to you to decide.
(IT) I shall now refer, ladies and gentlemen, to the SWIFT matter, which has also been addressed by the Presidency.
You will recall that a few weeks ago, before the Christmas holidays, I informed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the SWIFT case needed to be addressed from a European perspective, and I said on that occasion that we would begin an exploratory dialogue with the US authorities in order to address both the general issue of data protection and the specific issues raised by the use of SWIFT data by the US Treasury.
You will probably be aware that these informal, yet important, discussions have already begun.
I am in favour of finding a European solution to addressing this issue, a European solution that ought, in my opinion, to include clear rules and precise guarantees, which the US Treasury should endorse and include in its documents.
In other words, the two points at stake are, as ever, legal protection for personal data that are transferred and legal certainty for all parties concerned and, I must say, legal certainty for banks, too, for, as the Presidency has clearly highlighted, SWIFT is not a bank.
It is quite clear, then, that when I talk about guarantees from the US authorities, I intend to specify in which circumstances, for what purpose and by whom these data may be known and used.
I would say right away that it must be made clear that the purpose is restricted solely to terrorism investigations and thus to preventing the funding of terrorism, so that we avoid the, albeit indirect, risk of such data being misused, for example for economic espionage purposes.
It is also clear that there seems to be a need for a further restriction, and that is to link the use of these data to research on specific individuals who are suspected of terrorist activity.
In other words, there should be no non-specific transfers of data without suspects who warrant further investigation having first been identified.
You are aware of the letter that I wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT.
Only seven Member States have so far replied to my request for clarification.
This is unfortunate, and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases: in the specific case of Italy, for example, it has requested more time to respond.
In other cases, there has simply been no response.
From the seven responses that I have actually received - although no general conclusions can be drawn from them because too few Member States have responded - it emerges that banks normally use personal data for the sole purpose of executing payment orders and that they were not informed, in such cases, of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Treasury by SWIFT.
Therefore, the general response given is simply that they are not aware of the fact that someone, namely SWIFT, transfers data after having received it from them.
However, it has emerged - but you already knew this - that, in many cases, central banks had been informed precisely by the US Treasury of the transfer of data from SWIFT Europe to SWIFT United States and from SWIFT United States to the US Treasury.
You are aware that actions and further investigations are being carried out by the national data protection authorities with the aim of shedding some light on the issue and of finding out whether, apart from the Belgian case, which is now well known, there are other specific cases in which national data protection authorities can open a file and thus start proceedings.
Clearly, as soon as I have some information in this regard, I will pass it on to you, as I have done in the past.
There is a specific question concerning the possibility of applying the Automated Targeting System to SWIFT data.
On the basis of the technical explanations given to me, it would appear impossible or highly unlikely for the system in question to have been used for processing SWIFT data, for the simple reason that it is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which relates to the protection of borders and thus to the movement of people passing through the US.
It was not surprising that the European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data.
SWIFT data are in a totally different category because they come under a different administration, which is the Treasury.
The question submitted also asks whether the Commission is aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector.
I have no information on that, and so I cannot answer that question.
There is no doubt, however, that, while the fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, this fight cannot undermine or limit a fundamental right, such as that of customers to have their personal financial data protected.
As you know, one of the violations uncovered by the Belgian authorities and the European Committee for privacy protection is precisely the lack of prior information for customers, which coincides with what the banks said, since they had not been informed of these transfers either.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there are two reasons why we need to work towards a European instrument.
Firstly, we cannot limit or destroy our Euro-Atlantic collaboration in relation to the fight against terrorism: that would be a serious mistake, which I believe the European Union should avoid making.
Secondly, we must also point out to our American friends that it is in everyone's interests for fundamental rights and the protection of personal data to be scrupulously adhered to.
If, by virtue of having a European instrument, we succeed in doing the same thing that we are trying to do with the PNR - even though the two issues are very different, the principle is the same - and find a European solution that prevents differences in treatment between one EU Member State and another in relation to the United States, I believe that it will be possible to strengthen the European Union's negotiating power and to demonstrate at the same time that our aim is to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic link, not to weaken it.
author. - (FR) Enriched by the lessons of the case of passenger name records (PNR), we should be able to make quicker progress when it comes to SWIFT.
I should like, if I may, Mr Gloser, to correct you on one point. I believe that this is the first time we have held a specific debate on SWIFT here in the Chamber, and this is no doubt in the normal course of things, but I do hope this debate will enable us to make progress.
SWIFT is not an undertaking that operates solely in Europe or solely between Europe and the United States. It operates everywhere.
To put it simply, after September 11 the nature of relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition, and we are now seeing the consequences not only in terms of data protection for the EU but also in terms of the balance that should be struck between data protection, the fight against terrorism, the security of payment systems and protection against economic espionage.
The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has begun to put forward proposals.
In a recent letter addressed to Mr Cavada and me, the Central Bank also recognised that the time had come to enter new phases, without going too far in the proposals. This confirmed what it had said to us at the hearing, which, unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to attend.
The Central Bank had told us at the hearing that it bore very little responsibility for what had happened in the case, and the letter partly confirms that view.
Reading the memorandum concluded between SWIFT and the US Treasury in April 2004, it is very clear that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner in which SWIFT transferred information to the US Treasury.
Just as a train driver bears some responsibility for his train and the post office bears some responsibility for what it carries, SWIFT must bear some responsibility for the data it passes on.
The key point here, following the hearing held jointly by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last October, is the briefing of the 'Article 29' working group which, on 22 November 2006, clearly confirmed our concerns, namely that, in the SWIFT case, data that should manifestly not have been concealed from the US authorities had in fact been concealed and that, accordingly, the 1995 Directive had not been complied with.
We should like to thank the Commissioner for taking the initiative of calling on the Member States to rectify, without delay, the issue of non-compliance with the 1995 Directive, but, as he himself also said, the results up to now have been quite poor.
The European Central Bank, for its part, has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent.
That remains a very prudent thing do.
As regards this last question, there are two points we must raise.
The first is the nature of transatlantic relations and the manner in which data are used in something of a spirit of free, unbridled competition on the US side, and, on the European side - we have experience of this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - sometimes with a degree of naivety.
One would like to think that these data are used solely for the purposes of combating terrorism.
We dare to hope so, but we have no proof.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if there is a message that, I believe, Parliament would like to convey to you when you hold talks with the Americans on the issue, it is that the purpose of the talks must not be to validate the current state of affairs as regards the transfer of data via SWIFT.
It should be to ensure that the level of data protection and the concept of data protection itself that we have here in the EU are respected and accepted.
Everything leads me to think that the task facing us in this area is a tough one, but you can count on Parliament's unwavering support.
Just one more minute, Mr President, to address the last aspect, which is the issue of the status of SWIFT.
As SWIFT is a Belgian company, we are always being referred back to the Belgian State.
That being said, the fact that SWIFT is a Belgian company is because we are in a legal vacuum.
It is clear that SWIFT is doing a job that should really be done by a European-level body, overseen by a European supervisory body.
I believe that in this area too, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you need to proceed on the basis of new information.
Parliament is once again ready to discuss this matter, but we cannot accept the current state of the debate.
author. - (FR) Mr President, there is an expression in French to describe the surreal confusion of an institution when it finds itself faced with an unexpected situation. We say that it behaves 'comme une poule qui a trouvÃ© un rÃ©volver [like a chicken that has found a revolver]'.
Frankly, Mr Gloser, without wishing to underestimate you, the least we can say is that your position on this matter is extremely disappointing.
I therefore feel entitled to remind you that your mandate is to defend European sovereignty, something of which I have seen little sign so far.
As you will have appreciated, we are therefore disappointed and above all worried.
I will talk firstly about PNR data.
In a few month's time, as we know, as you have said and as Mr Frattini has pointed out, the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire.
We have no clear information on how it is working.
I would also like to point out that when the previous agreement was annulled by the Court, it was based on an assessment of the adequacy of data protection in the United States.
This is not the case with the agreement in force, however, even though this assessment is required by the protocol to Convention 108 of the Council of Europe, which is binding on the Member States and hence directly, or at least indirectly, on the European institutions.
Having a dubious basis, the agreement has not so far been properly implemented, since the data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004, the 'push' system, is not yet operational, and that is despite the announcements made, most notably last September.
In a spirit of cooperation, I would like to ask certain questions publicly.
Firstly, I wonder whether the Commission should have applied more pressure in order to ensure that the 'push' system was implemented by the airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors.
Secondly, I wonder whether effective information for air passengers should have been demanded with regard to the use of their personal data for security purposes, in the same way that information campaigns have been carried out on rights in the event of delays or flight cancellations, for example.
For our part, with regard to this dossier, we are awaiting clarification from the Commission and, above all, from the US authorities on a number of points.
I shall mention two of these.
First of all, we do not understand why, in order to fight terrorism and organised crime, it should be necessary to have all thirty-four pieces of data listed in the PNR and not just the nineteen pieces of data that Parliament and the data protection authorities had deemed sufficient for that purpose.
Secondly, how can it be that European citizens and passengers could have been classified as dangerous for years, unbeknownst to them, without us demanding anything in return?
I shall now turn to the SWIFT system.
This second issue is even more delicate and it concerns the American authorities' access to data relating to financial transfers.
My fellow Members have already dealt with a number of points.
I shall therefore just express the views of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
At stake here is the protection of our citizens' fundamental rights and the credibility of our partnership with the United States.
It is really incomprehensible that no reciprocal arrangements have been proposed in order to negotiate with a partner, even if it is a friend.
Will we one day act in the same way with another partner to the east of our borders, Russia?
I would therefore like to say that European sovereignty is not being respected.
In agreement with the political groups, therefore, I have taken the initiative to invite the competent committees of the American Congress and I am awaiting a response.
(The President asked the speaker to conclude)
I understand perfectly well that Parliament's timing is extremely important, and since I am confident that my colleagues will say everything else that needs to be said, I will stop there.
I have said the most important things I wanted to say.
I honestly thought that I had five minutes.
I am of course very sorry, Mr Cavada, but unfortunately, when we organise our parliamentary business, it is essential to abide by speaking times in general so that we can proceed, especially in the case of 'mini-sessions', when times are accordingly short.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire and all the documents that uphold the values of European civilisation and protect the freedom and personal integrity of each individual.
We are opposed to any unlawful conduct which restricts such freedoms and works against the individual.
We recognise, however, that protecting peace and security also imposes certain constraints.
For this reason we believe that any intrusion into personal privacy should be kept to a minimum and be conducted on a legal basis.
On the basis of the documents that are available to us, there is a well-founded suspicion that access to the data held in the SWIFT System could represent an illegal intrusion into personal privacy.
So, please allow me to put to you the following questions:
First, I would like a detailed answer as to which data held in the SWIFT System are available to the US authorities and which data are they entitled to access on that basis?
Second, do the US authorities have access to all the transactions carried out in SWIFT branches in the USA, and can they, through these or other SWIFT branches, also gain access to transactions carried out outside the USA?
Third, I would like to ask the Commission, the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman whether accessing the data held in the SWIFT System represents a violation of the provisions on data protection and, consequently, an illegal intrusion into personal privacy.
Fourth, at the October hearing we did not get any convincing or sufficiently clear answers on the competence of institutions with respect to SWIFT.
So I would like to ask who is actually competent to rule on the SWIFT issue and on what legal basis?
And fifth, I am interested in the principles underpinning our negotiating platform with the USA on these issues and whether, within that framework, we will also learn how the US authorities make use of the data obtained and what dangers are involved in data leaks and abuses.
Mr Coelho will address the PNR issue.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the controversy surrounding the transmission of personal and banking data by SWIFT to the US law enforcement authorities and the judgment on the EU/US agreement regarding PNR data have demonstrated the urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of trans-Atlantic relations.
Europe understands the United States' increased need for security and we want to enhance our cooperation with our American partners with a view to fighting terrorism effectively.
Having said that, it is also essential to deal with the protection of fundamental rights and privacy within the framework of trans-Atlantic dialogue.
We are in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement, but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens' privacy.
That is why we want the Commission to communicate to us the details of the proposed mandate for the negotiation of this new agreement.
The European Parliament must be fully involved in this process.
Could you also provide us with more information on the work of the high-level working group on the sharing and protection of data?
We would also like to know about the priority proposals recently put forward by our American partners.
With regard to SWIFT, the Belgian data protection authorities and the 'Article 29' Working Group believe that this transmission represents a violation of the Belgian and European rules on the protection of personal data.
So far, no concrete solution has been proposed to put an end to this violation.
All of the actors involved agree that it is urgent that a European solution be found, a solution that is respectful of fundamental rights and which companies can implement properly.
The European institutions must ensure that the payment system in the European Union, provided by SWIFT, complies with the Community legislation on data protection.
We would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what measures have been taken to resolve this problem.
Are there plans to negotiate an international agreement, similar to the PNR agreement?
You tell us that the Commission has held a dialogue with the American Treasury department with a view to finding a solution.
Can you tell us what solutions have been studied?
Furthermore, at our last debate on the same subject, you informed us, Mr Frattini, that a questionnaire would be sent to the Member States in order obtain all possible information on this transfer of information.
Have you really received all of the necessary replies and how are you going to follow up on that questionnaire?
Furthermore, in 2006, within the codecision procedure, Parliament adopted its Alvaro report on the regulation stipulating the personal data that must accompany transfers of funds and under what conditions.
The transfer to a third country of banking data that does not have a specific link with that country clearly falls outside of the scope of the regulation and may represent a breach of the fundamental principles of data protection.
For the same reason, given that the transfer of the SWIFT data does not just involve data relating to transactions between Europe and the United States, but also data relating to transactions within the European Union, it would appear to be clear that this issue belongs in the first pillar.
An agreement pursuant to Articles 24 and 38 of the European Union Treaty would not be an appropriate solution.
We cannot accept an agreement to legalise current violations on a case by case basis.
SWIFT has no legal obligation to use a mirror site in the United States.
Would it not be possible to find a solution in another country in order to move that mirror site to one that contains European data, as the 'Article 29' Working Group suggested?
Finally, SWIFT, PNR, and also the Automated Targeting System, ATS, and perhaps in the future telephone data, demonstrate that the exchange of information is intensifying and the urgent need to draw up a common framework for protecting the privacy of European citizens.
Do you not believe that the European Union should take a global approach to these issues, in order to establish general principles for the transmission and protection of data with our American partners.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am always very touched when I hear how attached the Council and the Commission are to involving Parliament, because it is indeed true that in the area of counter-terrorism policies, the decision-making is profoundly undemocratic because it totally excludes the European Parliament, and national parliaments are only very partially involved.
Therefore I would have a solution to offer you, and that is not just to make solemn pledges here before the House, but to actually consult Parliament on a voluntary basis on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT, because that would not only lend democratic legitimacy to such a mandate: it would also actually strengthen your negotiating position, because frankly, although I have a high appreciation for the officials who do the actual negotiations, I think matters of such importance should have a political mandate.
Secondly, I fully agree with the remarks made by Mrs Roure on the need for global standards on data protection.
People who think that we are anti-American are wrong.
I have actually seen how attached the Americans are to their privacy laws, which are very good, and how critical they are when the public authorities do not respect the rules on privacy.
So I think we should take their critical attitude as an example.
I would like to know if Commission and Council are aware of other categories of data being accessed by the US authorities, not only passenger data and SWIFT data, but also, for example, telecommunications records and insurance company or social security records, and if not by the US authorities, by other countries.
If you are not aware of this, maybe you should start investigating.
With regard to PNR, SWIFT and ATS, I will not repeat here all the expectations that we have of the PNR negotiating mandate.
That has been said already.
But I would like to know why the Commission and the Council did not bother to insist on a second joint evaluation of the implementation of the PNR agreement before agreeing on a new negotiating mandate.
Would it not make sense to first evaluate how this one works and how effective it has been before we start talking about the next one?
I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to the switch from push to pull, which was scheduled for December 2005, then for December 2006.
It is now January 2007.
Where are we on this point?
I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to information to passengers.
I have been travelling myself lately and I could not get any information on the matter.
I would also like to know on what basis the European Commission will actually be negotiating an agreement on SWIFT.
Finally, with regard to ATS, you get a letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying, 'Do not worry, we comply with the PNR agreement as we understand it'.
I am not a lawyer, but I think that is rather a funny formulation.
It does not reassure me and I would like further reassurances about profiling and data-mining.
Does it take place?
I should like to know about the discrepancy with regard to storage periods and about purpose limitation.
What other data are being fed into this and what are the exceptions as regards the privacy act?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this extensive legal-political debate involves the fundamental issue of European sovereignty, as the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has also rightly pointed out.
Consequently, there is a factor that has not yet been referred to that should not be left out, which is the statements made by the highest US authorities; I do not think they have been challenged, but they are worth mentioning.
The SWIFT system, which we are analysing in relation to European law, has certainly had the merit of cutting short some atrocious terrorist initiatives; it has made it possible to uncover or has helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005; and it has at least led to the capture of key players, such as the terrorist Hambali, who seems to have been the brains behind the Bali bombing in October 2002.
It should certainly also be said that the publicity surrounding this procedure has, in all likelihood, led many terrorists to give up using such methods.
On the other hand, it is undeniable that, when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law, it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards.
This is a problem that must be addressed, as is the problem of the European Central Bank's role and responsibility.
The ECB had been informed about the issue right from the start, and it played a leading role in this instrument - I shall not go into the matter of its transparency.
Before the Committee on Civil Liberties, the ECB, through its president, Mr Trichet, sheltered behind the confidentiality agreement among the ten banks and also claimed that it had not been able to give SWIFT its blessing because that was not within its power.
What, then, we wonder, are the powers of the ECB if it does not have power in a situation like this one?
This is a very important point, and I think we will have to thoroughly re-examine the ECB and its transparency.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs in 't Veld may be unwell physically, she is still in excellent form verbally.
That being so, I should like to carry on where she left off.
I still feel that we are very much running behind the facts.
When it became evident that the United States collected credit card data, as well as other personal data from our passengers, it was a scandal, and we as MEPs wanted a regulation in place, and in most cases, the governments did not want anything, except that if rules were broken, they wanted this to be done quietly; eventually they were forced into a form of action.
With SWIFT, we saw a repeat of past events: the government mounted a low-level investigation, which will hopefully culminate in some sort of action, and the question is indeed: are we now entirely convinced that this is it?
The Commission is quite clear-cut when it says that although it is not in any event aware of any developments, it does not rule them out either.
I should like a response from the Council to this.
Do you consider it conceivable and what will you do now to know for certain?
We are always saying that we are partners with the United States, which is true, for that is what we are, and we have a great deal of work to do.
This also means, though, that you are entitled to know what your friends are getting up to.
I would therefore like to find out from the Council how it intends to address the issue in order to know exactly what data are being collected of our citizens in all kinds of areas.
According to the Council, it is hard to conclude a fresh agreement, because the United States is not so keen on this data protection.
There is, however, a limit to the level of blackmail we are willing to accept.
You cannot say that we have to reach agreement, at any cost, if at a given moment in time, the price we need to pay is too high.
It could, in fact, be quite funny, once we have sunk as low as we can, to draw the line at some point.
This may imperil the landing rights, but will, at the same time mobilise quite a bit of opposition, including in the United States, because it is true that although the US administration would very much like to force this through, there is much support for our position among the parliamentarians.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to take a stand against the black and white terms in which this debate is all too often held.
It also appears, some of the time, that the United States is an enemy instead of an ally in the fight against terrorism.
One may well deny it, but just about every measure that has been taken has come under fire from this House.
It is, of course, the case that the SWIFT case evokes a number of justified questions, which Members from various groups have already asked.
Where, for example, do you draw the line between tracking down terrorists and respecting fundamental rights?
It is a question, in fact, that has also been put to the American Congress.
In the final analysis, the fight against terror is largely related to risk analysis, the calculation of probability, in other words.
The processing of commercial data on top of personal data pure and simple can make a useful contribution in this respect.
What we must do, though, is to put guarantees in place to prevent misuse.
For example, among other things, this House must monitor the functioning of the system, as well as the algorithms that are used which, moreover, have to be highly confidential; sanctions must be put in place in the case of misuse; the information obtained may be used only for the purpose of combating terrorism, and there must be a call centre where complaints from the public can be handled.
It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of consultation with the United States.
A clear legal framework is needed, and, in creating one, all partners must be open to fresh ideas and new techniques.
(PT) I should like to begin by saying that I see the United States of America not as an enemy but as a friend and partner in shared fights.
Of course, in our shared fights we must pay particular attention to combating terrorism, but it is also important to mention that, in some of these fights, the US Administration has at times gone too far, both at internal and international levels, and I am chairing a European parliamentary committee to look into some of these excesses on the international stage.
It should also be noted that the US Congress has undergone a shift of balance, which has led the US Administration to pull back from implementing some of its more controversial plans at internal level, and I hope that this will have an effect at external level, too.
This, to my mind, means that the USA is clawing back its good record of placing the emphasis on civil liberties, which is a good thing.
Mr Frattini has reminded us that the demands of security must not undermine the values of essential freedoms and in particular data protection, and Mr Cavada rightly pointed out that the amount of data requested is excessive.
Does Parliament want to know what data is involved?
Who can have access to it?
How can we ensure that objectives are limited and that data are not used for other purposes?
With whom can they be shared?
For what length of time can they be kept?
Then there is the issue of the push system, as mentioned by previous speakers, and the question of people's rights to appeal in the event of the misuse of their personal data.
Previous speakers have said that, if we in Europe offer US citizens the same level of personal data protection that we offer European citizens under the principle of reciprocity, we are legitimately entitled to claim the same, namely that European citizens in the USA should enjoy the same level of data protection as that offered to US citizens.
(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament was quite right to become fully involved in monitoring the routine transfer of European Union citizens' personal data to the United States.
Control by the European Parliament is acceptable. Refusal to transfer data is not.
It seems that data transfer can be justified on the grounds of the terrorist threat, posed mainly by Islamic extremists.
Nonetheless, such a threat cannot be perceived and exploited as a good pretext for the uncontrolled and unrestrained restriction of citizens' rights.
We must not become extremists ourselves.
We must not retreat from the front line of the war against terror under the banner of citizens' rights.
On the other hand, we need to control those who would like to control us in the interests of that war. I refer to the monitoring our flights, financial affairs and privacy.
If the justifiable war against global terrorism is not to transform into a dictatorship and a war against citizens' freedoms, it must itself be subject to strict scrutiny by the European Parliament.
(DE) Mr President, we need a thorough assessment in the run-up to an agreement. Central to this will be the issue of the effectiveness not only of the present agreement, but also of the previous one.
This question must be answered before we can make further progress in this matter.
Any future agreement must be based on the push system.
The pull system is no longer acceptable, since, as is well known, the push system ought already to have been introduced in the previous agreement.
The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used.
Otherwise, we cannot contemplate such a regulation.
The future agreement must also be given full democratic legitimacy, a process that should involve the European Parliament and, if appropriate, the national parliaments.
We also need an annual evaluation as a necessary component of any agreement, and the evaluation reports must be publicly accessible.
Clearly, the rules governing personal data need urgently to be protected under the third pillar, as do global standards covering all the categories of personal data.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg, in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people, and make it clear to them, what Europe's strong points are.
Mr Gloser, this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights.
We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism.
There is consensus in this House on that matter, and it does not need to be discussed.
Where, however, do we stand, then, in this debate?
We began by discussing airline passenger data, and now we come on to SWIFT.
In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted, it is to be feared that, over the next few years, we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with, but we still have not made further progress.
In the meantime, we have a situation in which, under pressure from the United States, a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans, which Europeans are unable to scrutinise.
Moreover, SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States, but only a data bank.
That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium.
This is like a running theme.
There is more and more American regulation of European affairs, appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these.
I would therefore, bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7, urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and, as well as investigating matters, to resolve one issue: how, on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity, are we to join together in combating terrorism?
Mr President, of course the reality of this is that on PNR, the Americans are setting a negotiation bar for conditions of entry into the US or into their airspace.
That is the reality. They can set the bar as high as they like.
We have citizens who wish to travel and businesses who want to work there.
That is the reality.
The reality on SWIFT is that we had an institution, not I believe the only institution, that was dealing with a conflict of jurisdictions, operating and holding data in the US and equally in the EU.
It had subpoenas which it legally had to meet in the United States of America and that was where we had the conflict.
SWIFT, I believe, has actually operated and negotiated an excellent memorandum of understanding.
We can either come into politics to name, shame, moan and whinge, or to try and solve a problem.
I came in for the latter.
Therefore I believe, Commissioner Frattini, you are absolutely right.
We need legal certainty for EU citizens, for EU businesses operating outside the EU and with offices outside the EU as well as within, and in which they hold data.
We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all, and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms.
Therefore I welcome the joint meeting of this House and US elected representatives so that we can reach an agreement.
Finally, this will only be achieved by decisive action at Council level, not just at Commission level.
I welcome the excellent suggestion of the previous speaker of bringing this up at the G7.
Let us solve the problem; let us not moan about it.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for being present at this very important debate.
We have heard that maintaining good cooperation with the US was crucial in our fight against terrorism.
I do not deny that.
I even believe that the transatlantic relationship must be reinforced because terrorism is a global phenomenon.
We must join forces to fight it efficiently by exchanging information and providing our law enforcement agencies with the necessary means.
Our citizens have the right to live in a safe and secure place.
However, the SWIFT case is showing us again the drifts arising if we do not ensure strict safeguards when exchanging information.
There is a correct balance to be struck between freedom and security, and in this case, security has once again prevailed.
You cannot combat terrorism by giving up the very rights that terrorism seeks to destroy.
Our high standards must not be lowered under pressure from any third country, even from our closest partners.
It is even more important that many of the new Member States have a long history of dictatorship and mass surveillance of their population.
Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there is a perception that the illicit practices of the past are still carried on.
That is why Europe must remain the defender of fundamental rights, and that includes the right to privacy.
On the one hand we need a framework decision on data protection in the third pillar to ensure high standards in police and judicial cooperation.
We have been waiting for it for too long now.
On the other hand, we must also remain vigilant and ensure that the existing instruments are properly enforced in our own countries.
We must prosecute those who infringe our basic rights to privacy.
We need to reassure our citizens that we want to maintain high standards in Europe.
Mr President, as my colleagues have said before, this is not a debate about the shape of the transatlantic relations.
Everyone in this House should know that the United States is our strongest ally in the fight against terrorism.
But this does not change the fact that if we are partners it makes it easier for us to stand firm and really defend our values and our laws.
I can only echo what my PPE colleagues - especially Mr Radwan - have said: in order for us to really safeguard the respect of the European regulatory framework, we need full information from the Commission and Council on the information that is delivered to the US authorities and how this information is protected by the US authorities.
We have to start to negotiate and get an agreement on information exchange which is on a viable basis and which respects the EU laws.
If this does not happen, we have to immediately stop delivering any kind of information to the US authorities.
Even after the ECB's response, I am quite puzzled as to what the role and the responsibility of the ECB is in this case.
The ECB itself is subject to the data privacy requirements of EU law, but it does not seem to take any responsibility for what it might have in this information exchange.
I also understand that there is a clear need for the US to track down information on international bank transfers that might have a link to terrorist financing, but these details have a link to other kinds of financing.
Our European businesses, especially, might be at risk if we do not act and stand firm.
The information that will be given should always be in line with our legislation and protect our citizens and European businesses.
The national financial transfers contain such delicate information that this is really an issue which should be taken seriously by the Commission and by the Council, this Parliament and the US Congress.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council should, in my view, observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data.
Firstly, it is through a proportionate approach that an appropriate level of security will be achieved, and that approach is not apparent in the case of the current agreements.
Such an approach depends - and this is my second point - on implementing compliance with normal European data protection standards, and that in my view involves changing the status quo, mainly through reducing the quantity of behaviour-related data.
Where switching over to the push system is concerned, Austrian Airlines has, to my knowledge, operated this system from the beginning - successfully, too.
The system involves having a clearly defined framework for using the data, a limit on the period for which the data is stored and, not least, the ability to lodge a complaint in the event of data being misused.
Mr Gloser, you rightly said that we need legal certainty as quickly as possible for European airlines.
As a politician involved in transport issues, I can only concur with that.
Given that the transfer of data really is about making progress in combating terrorism, it has an international dimension, and we no doubt also need international agreements with internationally binding data protection rules.
These are what we should be negotiating towards.
We must always be concerned to uphold our right to freedom of movement, which can only be achieved in an open society in which people can move about freely without falling under general suspicion.
It would be unacceptable to us as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens, on the one hand, and to non-Americans, on the other.
I have confidence in the determination of the German Presidency of the Council as it conducts the negotiations.
I know that these will not be a simple matter.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the fact that you have heard the same refrain right across the political groups should, I believe, give you pause for thought.
The message is that we do of course need a transatlantic partnership and that we are allies in the fight against terrorism.
Not only the refrain, but even the verse was the same across the board, namely that credibility, confidence and transparency are necessary where these issues are concerned.
Let us begin with credibility.
I still remember very well how, in his last speech in this House, the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement.
I do not believe that such praise is compatible with the rights that we should have from the point of view of data protection law.
Where the transfer of airline passenger data is concerned, there is no duty to provide information, and the individuals concerned have no right to correct the data.
What, moreover, has happened to credibility when you call the conversations you are conducting with the United States 'negotiations'?
You are standing with your back to the wall and with a pistol pointing at your chest.
The United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land, and none of the European Union's institutions has the backbone to say that, in all good faith, we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that.
Credibility is undermined by our hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved.
If you are serious about that, then include us around the table and, in so doing, show us that you mean what you say.
Turning now to the subject of transparency, which European citizens are aware that, when they board an aircraft, 34 items of data, including information about what they have to eat and where they sit, are transferred?
None do.
I have discussed this very question with citizens in a broadcast.
No one knows that this is what happens when he or she boards an aircraft.
We are on your side, so involve us instead of just fobbing us off.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT debate very clearly fits within the wider discussion on the high-wire balancing act between the fight against terrorism on the one hand and the protection of fundamental human rights and privacy on the other.
Not only, though, is there a clear dividing line between the European and American positions, we cannot even seem to agree on a common definition for terrorism.
The Commissioner has indicated on this platform how he would like to develop a European instrument for the future that would meet these requirements, but that is something that cannot, of course, be done overnight.
