These massacres and exactions are intolerable and Parliament has already denounced them.
In the new resolution before us today, the European Union reiterates four main points.
First, we must support the call by several authorities, especially the religious authorities, for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to come to the assistance of the Indonesian government in order to prevent further massacre.
Secondly, we must welcome the arrest of the warlords openly calling for civil and religious war as evidence of the will of the Indonesian authorities to support a peace process in all the regions involved.
We must support the efforts of these authorities.
Thirdly, these initiatives only make sense if the economic situation in the archipelago really can be improved.
Consequently, we need to intervene, including at a financial level, in order to help reconstruct a civil society which really respects the human rights, especially the religious rights, of the people of this country.
Without political and financial aid on our part, there is a risk of the walls closing round the contradictions of the Indonesian experiment, which would probably put an end to the democratisation process which, all said and done, is still in its infancy.
And fourthly, in these situations of extreme confusion, we need to get to the bottom of all these exactions.
Only an independent inquiry by international human rights experts can do this.
We call on the Indonesian government in our resolution to set up just such a committee of inquiry.
Mr President, in the shadow of the conflict in the Middle East, terrible events are being played out in Indonesia, more specifically in the Moluccas.
The terrorist group Laskar Jihad - for it is nothing less than a terrorist group - is digging the grave of anything that might be called religious life.
The group is a grave-digger for Islam and has shown that it does not stand for anything other than hatred, violence and the undisguised killing of the Christian population in the Moluccas.
I wish to appeal to the Commission, here in the presence of Mr Nielson, as well as to the Council, not to let the conflict in the Middle East mean that a veil is drawn over the ethnic and religious cleansing of Christians in the Moluccas that is now taking place. Instead, this should be placed in the spotlight.
Vigorous action should be taken to ensure that the Indonesian Government gives the Christian population every form of lawful protection.
I also wish to emphasise that many Muslims in the Moluccas have been badly affected by this invasion by the terrorist group, Laskar Jihad.
Christians and Muslims have previously lived together in peace, and now soldiers arrive spreading hatred, violence and death in the name of Allah and God.
Between 5 000 and 10 000 people have been killed, and 25 000 seriously injured.
Of the Moluccas' 10 million inhabitants, 350 000 are refugees.
Four hundred churches and 80 mosques have been burned down.
I have met the Catholic bishop, Monsignor Mandagi and the leader of the Protestant churches, the Reverend Hendrix.
I have looked directly into their eyes and seen their suffering.
Mr Nielson, let the EU do everything it can to ensure that Indonesia becomes a region of peace.
Find out who is funding these terrorist warlords.
No person, or state, can simply shake off its own past.
This also applies to the Republic of Indonesia.
To this day, its struggle for independence is making itself felt in national politics.
Parties continue to employ the tried and tested guerrilla tactics.
Physical force is used as a big stick.
According to Western standards, this is an insurmountable obstacle for a constitutional state.
It gets even worse when prominent politicians maintain close ties with extremist groups.
The attitude of the Indonesian Vice-President, Mr Hamzah Haz, only adds fuel to the religious fire of the Moluccas.
According to Mr Haz himself, he endeavours via the parliamentary route to set up a sharia state in the archipelago.
His personal contacts with leaders of the Laskar Jihad, however, are more symptomatic of a double political agenda.
This provocative attitude places a time bomb under the Malino II agreement.
This is why we would ask the Council and the Commission once again to urge the government in Jakarta quite emphatically to promote this difficult peace process to the best of its ability.
This requires firm government action against all agitators, irrespective of their religious affiliations.
The Indonesian army plays a crucial role in this respect.
Sadly, there is sufficient evidence that certain sections of this force fan the political and religious contrasts in the country's large problem areas in favour of its own position of power, its own economic interests and the ideology of the rigid unified state.
Vigorous European support for the moderate, right-minded wings in the army, which certainly exist, is very much what is required.
No mean task for the Council and the Commission, in fact.
Just as deserving of this support are the spokespersons of Papua's indigenous population.
Like their fellow citizens, they are extremely shocked about the findings of the National Inquiry Committee into the assassination of Papua leader, Mr Theys Hiyo Eluay, on 10 November 2001.
The Committee refers to it as a criminal case.
The Papua leaders and the population think differently.
In their view, this is a downright political assassination.
In a joint letter of yesterday, they therefore urge the President, Mrs Megawati Sukarnoputri, to mount a truly independent inquiry.
In Paragraph 10 of this resolution, the EP unreservedly endorses this justified request.
We call on the Council and the Commission to do the same as a matter of urgency.
For the sake of internal peace and the archipelago's unity as a state.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is once again scrutinising the situation in Indonesia.
We are concerned about the continuing violence against defenceless civilian populations in the name of regional and religious disputes.
Every life is important and sacred to us, but the situation in Indonesia has already claimed thousands of lives.
We deplore the incitement to slaughter Christians by radical Muslim leaders, and we put forward the example of tolerance and democratic spirit shown by East Timor.
In a land where more than 95% of the population identifies with the Catholic Church, the current democratically elected prime minister is a Muslim, and this causes no problems.
We appreciate the initiatives of the present Indonesia regarding the normalisation of relations with East Timor and Portugal.
The symbolic gesture of their representatives being present at the opening of the latest cultural event held in Indonesia with the support of the Portuguese Embassy did not go unnoticed.
We appeal to the Indonesian Government, however, to pursue measures to protect the populations and to identify and punish those responsible for human rights violations.
Impunity must not be the rule, especially when members of the army or police are involved, as has been proved in some cases.
In this context it is desirable and advisable that the international community should be involved in independent inquiries to investigate the truth in some of the reported cases.
We appeal to the Indonesian Government to continue trying to find political solutions to the disputes that exist.
We respect their attempts to keep the country united, but we stress the need to find solutions other than the mere use of force to respond to the ethnic, religious and regional differences that unsettle life in that country.
Finally, we urge the United Nations Human Rights Commission not to persist in its inexplicable silence towards the events in Indonesia.
Mr President, like the Northern Ireland conflict, the conflict in Indonesia is far from being a religious conflict.
The fanaticism merely disguises itself as religion.
In reality, these are ethnic conflicts with a very deep root, namely the Indonesian Government's Transmigrasi programme which attempts to resettle the population of the main islands to the other islands on a systematic basis.
The evidence for my theory can be found in the Moluccas, the old Christian Spice Islands, where there are conflicts between Christians and Muslim immigrants.
In Borneo, there is a similar conflict between adherents of the animist religions and the incoming Muslims.
In Aceh, the same problem occurs between the indigenous Muslim subjects of the old sultanate of Aceh and immigrants from the main islands such as Java and Sumatra.
In my view, it is essential to point out to the Government that it must halt this migration and shelve the artificial resettlement programmes, for otherwise, this massive country, which stretches from Australia to the Asian continent, will no longer hold together and will disintegrate.
Mr President, the Commission fully shares with honourable Members their concerns about the continued violence in parts of Indonesia.
Together with the EU diplomatic missions in Jakarta, we have been monitoring the situation in the Moluccas since early1999 and we have participated in two fact-finding missions in late 2000 and early 2001.
The Commission has also participated in several EU dÃ©marches to the Indonesian authorities to express our concerns about situations of continuing conflict in different parts of the country.
In addition, the Commission has provided more than EUR 4.6 million in humanitarian assistance to the people of the Moluccas since May 1999.
We have joined with the Member States in a declaration welcoming the Malino II Peace Agreement and urging its full implementation.
At the same time, we have urged the government of Indonesia to take appropriate measures to support the peace process.
Since then, we have followed closely the efforts of the government to deal with new outbreaks of violence, including the arrest on 4 May of Ja'far Umar Thalib on charges of incitement to violence.
The situation in Aceh has also preoccupied us for some time now and has also been the subject of EU dÃ©marches to the Indonesian authorities.
EU Heads of Mission visited the region in October 2001.
I am therefore particularly happy to welcome the joint statement issued on 10 May by the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), following two days of consultations facilitated by the Henri Dunant Centre in Geneva.
The joint statement recognised the special autonomy law as the starting-point for further negotiations in an all-inclusive dialogue and confirmed the intention of both parties to work on an agreement for the cessation of hostilities.
It has been our view for some time that the full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be the key to a durable resolution of the present situation.
Papua has equally been a matter of continued concern and the subject of EU dÃ©marches.
The EU condemned the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay in November 2001 and called on the government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and to bring its perpetrators to justice.
EU Heads of Mission in Jakarta also visited Papua in February this year.
In the case of Papua, too, it is clear that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to the resolution of the situation.
The Commission has included in its Country Strategy Paper for Indonesia, which is now in the final stages of preparation, a particular emphasis on institutional capacity building, good governance and the rule of law, as well as conflict prevention.
Financial support has already been committed to the UNDP-managed Partnership for Governance Reform, and technical assistance has been provided to the Attorney General's Office.
Provision has been made in the draft National Indicative Programme for 2002-2004 for a specific programme to support the implementation of the government's policy for decentralisation in Indonesia and to promote good governance at local government level.
In the meantime, we have also taken steps to support the processes of conflict resolution more directly.
Following discussions between Commissioner Patten and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Wirajuda, last November, and in the context of the Commission's Rapid Reaction Mechanism, an independent mission on conflict prevention in Indonesia visited the Moluccas, Sulawesi and Papua in February 2002.
The expert mission met a wide range of central and local government representatives, as well as NGOs operating in these areas.
On the basis of the mission's report, a package of projects is now in preparation for the Moluccas and Papua.
The project in the Moluccas will focus particularly on support for the participation of civil society.
The projects in Papua will support both the authorities and civil society.
All of these measures are consistent with the Commission's support for the EU's stated position, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia's internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character.
We will continue to follow this approach and to provide all possible support for constructive action to deal with these very difficult situations.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
Mr Tannock and Mrs Martens, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the religious clashes in India (B5-0287/2002);
Mr Vinci, Mr SjÃ¶stedt and Mr SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the violence in the State of Gujarat (India) (B5-0291/2002);
Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the inter-communal violence in the State of Gujarat (India) (B5-0298/2002);
Mrs Lambert and Mr Messner, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on India (B5-0299/2002);
Mr Sakellariou and Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in India (B5-0304/2002);
Mr President, we are here to express our concern at the recent outbreak of inter-communal violence that has erupted in the Indian State of Gujarat - violence which has claimed hundreds of lives and left thousands homeless and destitute.
I am sure that Parliament will join me in expressing condolences and profound sympathy to the members of both communities who have suffered loss and bereavement, including relatives of my own London constituents.
There is some history to the inter-communal violence in Gujarat including, it must be said, persecution of Christians by Hindu extremists.
The latest outbreak began after Muslim extremists killed 58 Hindu pilgrims on a train near Godhra - a deeply callous act which unleashed a round of reprisals and counter-reprisals.
This chain of events has generated considerable soul-searching in India itself, a country founded on the rule of law and secular democracy, with accusations that the State authorities did not react quickly enough to the scale of events.
No system of government is perfect, but since the army was called in, 30 thousand arrests have been made, with 80% of those arrested being Hindus.
In addition, it is significant that the violence did not spread to other parts of India and large areas of Gujerat itself remained calm.
In the Indian Parliament, the government accepted the Congress Party opposition's motion as the basis for discussion with cross-party support, reaffirming its belief in democratic pluralism and respect for minorities in a giant country of over a billion people of diverse backgrounds and race, and the independent Justice Verma commission is now reporting back to the government.
Clearly lessons have to be learned, but we should not forget that India is currently reeling from a series of atrocious terrorist attacks by Islamic Jihadi extremists - most recently the killing of 30 people, including women and children, and scores of wounded on the outskirts of Jammu.
This attack makes the dangerous threat of war more likely between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, a country which regrettably and, until recently, actively supported Islamic terrorists.
The international community must urgently do everything possible to prevent any further escalation of violence which might threaten global peace.
Mr President, the atmosphere of conflict between religions, ethnicities and civilisations, which is worsening across the world, and in particular in India, is concerning.
The influence of events in building tension in that atmosphere is also very concerning, as it shows that this is not an entirely spontaneous phenomenon or simply the result of clashes, but that in many cases it is being orchestrated to hide the real social problems affecting people.
We have to take account of the atmosphere of high tension and violence that we are experiencing and which I believe has increased since 11 September, and the supposed clash of civilisations, with the war in Afghanistan and everything that goes with it, because that shows that we are seeing the consequences of the process that we call 'globalisation', which is gradually increasing inequalities and tension, and as a result, confrontations arise between communities.
I therefore think that the European Union should, as the Commissioner said, pay attention to these phenomena and increase its efforts, not only looking to the places concerned but also to the United Nations in order to deal with all aspects of the problem.
These types of acts are going to increase and we, the European Union, as an international body, have a great responsibility and the capacity to act, not only with financial aid, but, as I said earlier, by changing the effects and the process of globalisation, which is affecting so many peoples across the world.
Mr President, the violence between the different population groups in India cannot remain undiscussed.
Needless to say, this is a very important matter that has to be considered in the light of the significance that India represents, not only in Asia, but also in the rest of the world.
After all, we should not forget that India is not only a superpower that has great economic potential, it is also a country that has nuclear capacity.
All credit to the common resolution for not having succumbed to radical opinions.
After all, it should be clear to everyone that India is certainly not experiencing a clash of civilisations.
It should be emphasised that Muslims have largely been integrated in Indian society.
A concrete example of this so-called multicultural society is the fact that Muslims occupy high government offices.
This, however, does not detract from the fact that I deeply regret what happened in Gujarat.
I would, however, note that the incidents in Gujarat did not spread to the rest of India.
This is, in my view, proof that the Hindu-Muslim coalition is still respecting democratic values.
On the other hand, we need to be concerned about the increase in Muslim fundamentalism that is a daily occurrence in Kashmir.
The day before yesterday, an attack on an Indian army camp claimed 9 victims.
Extremist militia of Muslim activists who demand union with Pakistan are very active here.
Last Tuesday, there were already 32 casualties in an Indian army camp too.
This time, Indian women and children went into hiding.
These incidents must, further to this resolution, also be brought to the attention of the international community.
This tragic incident underlines once again the enormous threat which growing terrorism poses.
I take the view that the European Union and the European Parliament have every interest in continuing the support India as a constitutional state, where Hindus and Muslims are treated equally, in their endeavours to respect the democratic principles.
Mr President, although I appear on the list as an author, my group is not a signatory to this joint resolution, although we are likely to support it.
As previous speakers have said, probably none of us in this Chamber would deny the devastating effects of religious extremism.
In the case of Gujarat, as Mr Tannock mentioned, it is actually Hindu extremism.
It was the action of those so-called "pilgrims" which resulted in an appalling massacre of 58 people.
We have seen the fallout from that in what is euphemistically called "inter-communal violence".
The resolution states that whereas numerous independent inquiries by human rights organisations confirm that state officials and the police of Gujarat were involved in the clashes, this involvement runs deep.
It is not just a question of a casual street brawl but orchestrated violence and intimidation over a sustained period.
The Human Rights Watch report states that the Gujarat Government chose to characterise the violence as a spontaneous reaction to the incidents at Godhra.
Human Rights Watch findings and those of numerous Indian human rights and civil liberties organisations and most of the Indian press indicate that the attacks on Muslims throughout the state were planned well in advance of the Godhra incident and organised with extensive police participation and in close cooperation with officials of the BJP State Government.
On 3 April India's national Human Rights Commission released the preliminary findings of its report on the violence, a strong indictment of the failure of the Gujarat Government to contain the violence.
The very authorities to whom people should have been able to look for protection were, in many cases, complicit in devastating attacks and increasing the level and ferocity of violence which makes every citizen feel threatened, whatever their religion or background.
There are now about 100 refugee camps organised by NGOs in the area.
A mere handful see support from the government of Gujarat State. That authority has a responsibility for the wellbeing and care of these people now and in future.
The Indian Government has an overall responsibility to see that justice is done and that the instigators, organisers and perpetrators of this violence are brought to justice.
They will also need to ensure that the police force in Gujarat is made to recognise that it owes a duty to all people who may be under threat or attack, not just their own.
Clear signals are needed from the government - indeed we have had some - that religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred have no place in secular, democratic India.
My group welcomes the ruling of the Indian Supreme Court in March this year banning any religious ceremonies at Ayodhya until the definite legal settlement of the case which we hope will be in the interests of a peaceful, long-term solution.
Mr President, first of all, I do not think this emergency resolution is the best way to help solve the still worrying situation in Gujarat, mainly because the violence seen in this state during recent months is a manifestation of an extremely complex phenomenon affecting the whole region and not just India.
It involves social factors such as poverty, urban 'ghettoisation', some interference by organised crime with unknown links abroad, a certain inability of the political elite to mobilise people's energies around political ideals and the drift towards the religious sphere, especially through fundamentalist extremism.
It is, however, quite right that the European Parliament should feel concern for a case that has already cost the lives of a about thousand people - or even more, as estimates vary according to the source.
This is not the time to analyse the episodes that gave rise to this violence, but it is worth pointing out that everything began with the fire in two train carriages on 27 February last, in which 58 people died, half of them women and children.
Nothing can justify this kind of action, and the retaliations and revenge that followed cannot be justified at all, either.
Godhra, it should be remembered, is a peripheral urban area with a high population density and a level of latent social conflict, where the forces of law and order generally find it difficult to act, apart from the possible involvement of members of the local police in one or other religious faction, according to the results of inquiries so far.
What is certain is that at first the forces of law and order did not succeed in putting an end to the violence.
The matter was, however, taken up immediately by the democratic institutions of the Indian Union, namely the government, the opposition parties and parliament.
I did in fact visit the Indian Parliament on the very days when this subject was discussed.
Urgent measures were adopted not only on the government's own initiative but also because of strong pressure from the opposition and the Indian media.
I must point out that stands adopted outside the Indian democratic system itself, however well intentioned they may be, sometimes end up being counterproductive in that they bolster nationalist and fundamentalist positions of various origins, Islamic or Hindu.
In any case, on behalf of my group, I recommend adoption of this resolution without any changes, as we consider it well balanced.
Mr President, in the 1980s, there were violent clashes between Hindus and Sikhs, and in the early 1990s between Hindus and Muslims in Bombay and Uttar Pradesh.
Now violence has erupted in Gujarat, where murders, massacres and burnings alive by both sides have claimed around 1500 victims since February this year.
The Hindu nationalist parties justify their radicalism by referring to the spread of Islam in neighbour states and its influence on India.
The Indian Supreme Court's ruling of 13 March gives cause to hope that the violence will end.
The Court ruled that the land on which Hindu fanatics tore down a mosque to build a temple in 1992 may not be handed over to the radical Hindu organisation WHP.
Constitutional guarantees, such as the Muslim marriage law which upholds the traditions of Indian Muslims, are an expression of India's religious freedom and freedom of opinion.
Secularism is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution of India.
Article 25, which guarantees the freedom to practise and propagate a religion, also imposes an obligation on the Indian State to protect all its citizens.
The ideal of peaceful co-existence between different ethnic communities and cultures is upheld as a principle.
The Indian Government has deployed a number of units of the army in an attempt to send out a clear signal to the world community that it is willing to end the violence.
It has also offered the relatives of the victims the prospect of an aid package amounting to around EUR 35 million.
The international criticism of many of the completely inadequate measures taken to deal with the radical movements has been acknowledged by the Indian Justice Minister in recent days, especially since India signed international human rights agreements a long time ago.
The PPE-DE Group believes that such insights should set a precedent.
Mr President, India is a State whose independence and foundation in the middle of the last century was possible based on a mass and globally respected social mobilisation, which was built on a doctrine of passive resistance as a political resource.
Mahatma Gandhi led the Indians with a message of non violence, tolerance, and overcoming religious differences, in an epic campaign that has remained among the most symbolic victories of peaceful methods in politics, as it established the most populated democracy in the world and a society considered to be a model of co-existence of races, languages and, in short, of civilisations.
However, conflicts based on religious fanaticism have never stopped occurring in India.
Although one of the most significant victims of those conflicts was Gandhi himself, the list continued with other assassinations, such as that of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, her son, also Prime Minister, and others.
And as well as those people whom we know as important figures, thousands of innocent people have fallen victim to intransigence and fanaticism.
It is a paradox that it is precisely where the material and social needs are greatest that religious extremism and intolerance arises and builds up.
We are talking about a country where the inequalities are devastating and where the physical environment and natural disasters often make life even more difficult for the people, and it is there that conflicts between the followers of majority beliefs and other smaller communities have permanently marked and tarnished the history of the greatest democracy in the world.
The international community must ask the Government of India to guarantee the safety of its people with the same amount of effort that it is making with other challenges of development in which it is achieving significant success.
The Indian Government must maintain its efforts by dedicating sufficient resources to enable people who have been displaced to return to their place of origin and to re-establish harmony in Gujarat and other areas affected by the recent clashes that led to our debate, and they must also purge the cases of collusion by the security forces in episodes of religious and political violence.
The European Union must support these efforts and urgently send as much aid as possible to the area.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think, as many of you have pointed out, that current events in India are partly the result of the wind which Europe and the West have sown in a good part of the world over the last forty years.
It is hardly surprising then that we are now reaping a hurricane.
These unbelievable and, as Mrs Lambert has just demonstrated, logical reversals are the same as those which we - or rather you - applied to Palestine: the fact that Mr Sharon visited the esplanade of the mosques or Temple Mount was justification enough for attacks by suicide bombers who are in fact nothing less than suicide murderers.
Today, the fact that 60 pilgrims were burnt is justification and excuse enough for the violence unleashed on them by the Muslims.
I think that all this is the result of this inability, this democratic relativism spreading throughout Europe which prevents us from getting to the root of problems, which prevents us from remembering that, with 1 billion inhabitants, India is the largest democracy in the world, which prevents us from realising that, by going to Beijing rather than to Delhi, we are encouraging dictatorship, that by supplying arms to Pakistan for 40, maybe 50 years, we are strengthening the dictatorship, that by doing what we have done to the Taliban regime or by not doing what we should have done, we generated a tragedy in Afghanistan, especially for its women.
This has slowly been building up to the events we are witnessing today and I think that, even if we can reproach the Indian authorities on a number of counts, we need to get beyond these reproaches.
I think we also need to look at the exemplary manner in which this huge country has reacted; federal armed forces have been sent to Gujarat, a committee of inquiry has been set up and recourse has been taken to the Supreme Court, all fundamental reactions on the part of India despite its development problems.
I think that if there is a problem, Mr Marset Campos, it is not globalisation but the lack of globalisation.
There is still a special unit within the Commission - I do not know if Commissioner Nielson can confirm this - which ensures that Indian textiles do not enter the territory of the European Union.
Now, as everyone knows, textiles are one of the sectors around which India can develop and create a stronger economy.
Over the last ten years, since globalisation began, India has had a rate of growth of 6 to 7%.
That was certainly not the case before globalisation.
So long live globalisation, but long live globalisation in both directions!
We cannot expect to keep on exporting our products to India while stopping imports of Indian products into our countries.
This is how to achieve development, this is how to strengthen democracy in India and perhaps also closer to home.
Mr President, the Commission very much shares the honourable Members' preoccupation with the continued violence in the Indian State of Gujarat, a situation that gives serious cause for concern on humanitarian grounds.
Like the diplomatic missions of several Member States, the Commission Delegation in New Delhi sent a fact-finding mission to Gujarat to assess the situation on the ground.
The Commission has a significant cooperation programme in Gujarat of more than EUR 100 million.
I was there in January meeting the state government, inspecting the devastation after the earthquake a year before and trying to accelerate our reconstruction activities.
The mission I am talking about was different and more problematical because of its background, but it was necessary to send a mission to Gujarat to assess whether the riots had implications for the principles on which our cooperation is based, including respect for human rights and democracy and the rule of law.
The findings were deeply worrying.
Violence was not only widespread, but in many cases extreme brutality was used.
Unofficial figures set the death toll at 2000, most of them Muslims.
The mission also heard accusations from the Indian media and the Indian Human Rights Commission that the Gujarat state authorities had been complacent in their handling of the Hindu rioters.
In line with India's healthy and vigorous democratic tradition, a lively debate has been going on in the country about the consequences of the events in Gujarat and the responsibilities of the government at state and national level.
I am confident that India's commitment to democracy and the rule of law will ensure that those who were responsible for these atrocities will be held to account, and that the victims will be provided with relief.
The central government and the state government have already taken steps in this direction.
Both in Delhi and in Madrid, the EU troika has raised our concerns about the crisis with the Government of India, and the Commission has participated in these dÃ©marches.
From a humanitarian point of view, the Commission is currently examining the possibility of giving humanitarian assistance to the victims of the riots through ECHO.
A decision on this is expected within the next two weeks.
The honourable Members will, of course, be informed immediately.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
Mr Van Orden, Mr Deva, Mr Parish, Mrs Foster, Mrs Banotti, Mr Corrie, Mr Gahler, Mrs Korhola, Mr Lehne, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Mr Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe (B5-0286/2002);
Mr SjÃ¶stedt, Mr SeppÃ€nen and Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe (B5-0295/2002);
Mrs Maes, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe (B5-0300/2002);
Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe (B5-0303/2002);
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the negative developments in Zimbabwe are in inverse proportion to the degree of international attention focussed on this country since the rigged presidential elections in March.
One of the most dramatic outcomes, for example, are the growing food shortages which, as Commissioner Nielson has already mentioned in another context, are largely man-made, namely by the Mugabe regime itself.
We have received reports that around 50 000 people in Zimbabwe have fled their homes as a result of repression and violence at the hands of Mugabe's troops, and we receive daily reports of farm lootings, while Zimbabwe's leadership is blatantly enriching itself by confiscating private property while it can still get away with it.
However, I would also like to draw your attention to another quite scandalous aspect, namely the Council's response to the situation.
Yesterday I received a reply to an application for information from the Council. I asked for an update on the targeted sanctions applied against certain persons.
I wanted to find out about the situation regarding the refusal to grant them visas.
In reply, I was told this was a matter for the Member States.
In other words, I could have just asked the others this time.
Apart from that, the question which really arises is this: what are the Council's motives concerning these measures in a country which - as Commissioner Patten said at a Committee meeting - is in freefall?
How has the Council managed to achieve a situation in which a country which is in freefall has vanished completely from its operational agenda?
It was postponed in April, and a more comprehensive decision in May was also postponed because the high level troika had not yet departed.
It is now due to leave on Sunday. The really lamentable aspect of this state of affairs are the attempts by France, Belgium and the Presidency itself to water down the troika's terms of reference in advance of the visit.
In light of the situation in the country, this is really quite incredible.
There is already talk of resuming cooperation, even though no evaluation of the measures we have taken has yet been carried out.
I really do ask myself what else has to befall the country to raise the Council's awareness of its responsibilities in this context once more.
I hope, at least, that the European Union troika, which will visit the region from Sunday to confer with SADAC countries on possible courses of action in response to the Zimbabwean crisis, will hear first-hand, at least in one of Zimbabwe's neighbours, about the dramatic worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe from diplomats posted in Harare.
As the European Parliament, we cannot accept the Council's attempts to play down such an urgent issue in southern Africa in this way, and, above all, that it is not prepared to make these developments in Zimbabwe a test case for the new African development programme, for example.
These are the things we should definitely be demanding.
Mr President, once again we find ourselves discussing Zimbabwe, and the 64-thousand-dollar question is: what will actually work?
We have already adopted several resolutions on Zimbabwe in this House.
The Commonwealth has condemned the country.
So has the ACS-EU meeting.
What else could we do, in fact?
Despite everything, the pillaging and killing simply continue.
Mugabe appears to be unassailable.
In addition, a large-scale famine is threatening to erupt.
It is, of course, extremely difficult to deny hungry people food.
I think food should always be provided, no matter what.
But is there no way we can bring Mugabe to his senses?
Another way that could still be tried is to apply pressure on the SADEC member states around Zimbabwe, and on South Africa, in particular.
In my view, that country could have a great impact, and if that country takes the new programme for African development, the Nepad programme, seriously, then South Africa too should make more of an effort if it wants to count on aid from the European Union for this important economic programme for Africa.
There may also be another way.
We have already spoken in previous resolutions about maligning sanctions.
Would it not be possible for the European Commission to take stock of all the property owned by the leaders of Zimbabwe in Europe?
How was it acquired?
When?
Where did the money come from?
In most cases, land registry offices in Europe, and in Africa, are public, although it will be difficult in Africa.
Why does the Commission not set itself the task of mounting an inquiry into this and to publish the findings via the BBC and whatever other stations are listened to in Africa.
We will then be able to apply a little more pressure and bring shame on the leaders.
The Commission shares the concern about Zimbabwe following the presidential elections, in terms of the legitimacy of the present government, the issue of freedom of the press, continued violence, the economic crisis and the associated food shortages.
It is clear that the election results did not reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe.
The process leading up to the elections, as well as the conduct of the elections, were characterised by deliberate attempts by the authorities to prevent free and fair elections.
We are particularly concerned about the continued violence and repression prevailing in Zimbabwe, the crushing of the opposition, civil society and the independent press.
Putting an end to violence and the resolution of the political conflict through negotiation is the highest priority.
Only with a degree of social peace can the rule of law be re-established, and, with it, the impartiality of state institutions, such as the security forces.
The EU has applied targeted sanctions against members of the ruling party and a moratorium on bilateral ministerial contacts.
It is possible that the Council may decide to further extend sanctions in view of the stalemate and lack of progress in inter-party dialogue and the continued repression and violence we see in Zimbabwe.
I would like to underline that the situation in Zimbabwe has now become a very real emergency, and is likely to become a protracted one.
We have anticipated humanitarian needs and are addressing food shortages and the needs of refugees and internally-displaced people.
EUR 18 million is available to cover immediate needs.
This figure is not fixed, but it reflects the needs assessment we have made so far.
This is the way we normally do things.
We have to ensure that this is the basis of our decisions.
These funds will be managed by the World Food Programme and by different NGOs, reflecting the need to avoid political games.
Although prepared to make a major effort to assist the population, we are fully aware of reports pointing to the government of Zimbabwe's use of the food crisis for political purposes.
In our contacts with the Zimbabwean authorities we have systematically stressed that all of those affected by a humanitarian emergency need to be assisted, regardless of their political conviction, and reiterated the need for non-partisan food distribution.
Unfortunately, about 18 months ago, one of our attempts to distribute food in an even-handed way was disrupted by violence.
Moreover, we have emphasised that in Zimbabwe - once a food-exporting country - the present food shortages are mainly the product of misguided policies and only partly the result of drought.
The drought problem is, however, a regional problem and has the negative effect of making it more difficult to buy food in the region in order to assist Zimbabwe.
Thus, things are more complicated because of the drought, but the real problems we are faced with in Zimbabwe do not basically stem from the drought but are a product of misguided policies.
We believe that the international community should follow the situation very closely.
A European Union Troika visit to the SADC region will take place next week to confer with SADC countries in looking for courses of action, and to support regional efforts to broker a negotiated political settlement in the internal Zimbabwean crisis.
We hope to initiate a real dialogue on Zimbabwe and to promote coordination between the EU and the SADC region.
In fact, we managed to establish a close political dialogue with the SADC region at political level during the difficult months - winter and early spring - this year, but we need to move that discussion further in order to try to create a positive influence on the situation in Zimbabwe.
As to Mr Mulder's suggestion of doing something about the assets in Europe of leaders of Zimbabwe, we have not been very good at delivering on the justified, legitimate demand from Nigeria to identify and retrieve the money that was stolen by the previous military government.
Some progress has been made, fortunately, with a number of court rulings and this is important.
I mention it to illustrate the difficulty of simply delivering something like this, but it is an area that needs to be investigated.
We have a question of extraterritoriality to discuss with these kinds of sanctions, and this is not very easy.
There are important principles at stake in those decisions and discussions.
So, much as I welcome the thrust and the direction of the thinking in Mr Mulder's contribution, we have to be careful about what we do.
Mr President, I am grateful for the answer of the Commissioner.
I think there is a bit of a difference from the situation in Nigeria because, as far as I recall from the newspapers, this mainly concerned bank accounts in Switzerland and some money was recovered there.
But I am mainly thinking about physical properties in countries of the European Union, and probably also in the United States.
Investigations could probably be made into what has been purchased in the last two years or so, and that could be recovered and this fact made public.
Then the people in Zimbabwe could ask themselves: Where did the money come from?
How were they able to do that?
All those things in Europe are completely public and it just requires an official of the Commission to look into it and do some studies on it and then publish it.
Mr President, I have another brief question for the Commissioner: is the Commission prepared to lobby actively to persuade the Council that the terms of reference of this high level troika which is due to visit southern Africa must not be watered down and restricted, but that the discussions and negotiations with Zimbabwe's neighbours in the region must genuinely reflect the gravity of the situation?
Mr President, I can say to Mr Gahler that a troika is one thing, but we, in the Commission are in an ongoing, quite intimate dialogue with governments in the whole region, with or without troikas.
We talk on the phone, we also meet informally, and I see this troika mission, because of its timing and visibility, as a way of clarifying the seriousness of the moment.
It is also a good signal to our partners in the SADC region that we want to build further and, in a more systematic manner, have an ongoing, very direct exchange of views on problems of this character.
But we have to do it a manner which gives them confidence to get into dialogue with us.
That is how it has to be done.
In no circumstances will we limit the terms of reference because this whole matter, this whole discussion, is part of an ongoing political dialogue with the region.
To Mr Mulder; yes, it sounds easy as you put it, and that would be the case if we could be sure that the correct names are put in the register of real estate.
That may not be the case.
So, to produce something that really is relevant is more demanding than you suggest.
I come back to the advice in the investigation done by the journalists in the Watergate case - "follow the money" I think that it makes sense to try to pursue that track.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Mr President, this afternoon, the debate was suspended twice for more than a quarter of an hour, firstly before the topical and urgent debate, and then again after that debate.
I just wanted to say this: I would ask that in future, whenever this occurs on a Thursday afternoon, the Sittings Service should amend the timetable by automatically adding an extra 20 minutes.
If it were to allocate 20 minutes more speaking time than before, this would work out exactly.
If, for once, everyone who was supposed to speak were actually here, as I would hope, the worst that could happen would be that the vote would take place at 5.45 p.m. instead of 5.30 p.m.
Until now, we have voted at 6.30 p.m. anyway.
I would be very grateful to you, Mr President, if you would tell the Sittings Service that they can be a bit more generous in their timetabling.
I was cut off relatively promptly by the previous President twice this afternoon.
I respect that, but in such instances, there should not be any gaps in the programme later.
Thank you, Mr Posselt, for your comment which, I can assure you I have already noted and shall pass on.
Mr President, when I was thinking about what I was going to say in my explanation of vote on this report, being the elected representative of pensioners, I was concerned that I might be a little biased towards pensioners and the elderly in my explanations of vote.
I therefore decided to ask the youngest Member of the House for advice, and the youngest Member currently present in the House is Mrs Kauppi, who, by coincidence, is sitting near me, and she replied: 'In my opinion, you should vote for the motion so that United Nations policies helping pensioners and the elderly throughout the world can be better coordinated world-wide'.
If such a young Member is speaking up on behalf of the elderly, it means that we are all, irrespective of our age, very concerned that pensioners and elderly people throughout the world should receive increasingly more help.
Therefore, I can only hope that, in future, the European Union will send a single representative to the United Nations, and I hope that this representative will be the young Mrs Kauppi, who has shown both the Pensioners' Party and all the parties represented in this Parliamentary House in Strasbourg that she cares deeply about elderly people.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on 16 April 2002
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome a delegation of Brazilian parliamentarians who have taken their seats in the official gallery.
The delegation is led by Mr Foscarini and has been visiting Parliament during the past week.
I hope that their visit has proved interesting and informative.
You are very welcome.
(Loud applause)
It also gives me great pleasure to welcome among us a group of students from the College Jean Zay in Lens in France, along with their teachers and the Mayor of Lens, Mr Guy Delcourt.
They have constructed in their school a unique giant Euro coin which I understand is now in the Guinness Book of Records and on show at the French Finance Ministry.
I want to thank them for their efforts and again say how welcome they are in this House today
As regards today's agenda, I want to inform the House that Mr CortÃ©s, Secretary of State for international cooperation in Latin America, cannot be here before 5.30 p.m.
The Council and Commission statements on the EU/Latin-American Summit will therefore begin after 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requested that today's agenda include a statement by the Council and the Commission on the common fisheries policy at the beginning of today's sitting.
Not only did it request this statement, it also requested a statement by the Commission and the Council on the common fisheries policy and on how the decisions behind the common fisheries policy are taken.
We requested this statement because the public is under the impression - an impression which the Spanish Government and its Minister of Agriculture have helped to create - that a Member State's government exerted an influence or pressure on one or more members of the Commission when these decisions were being taken.
That alone would be highly significant, given the relevance of this procedure to European law, which is why an explanation by the Council and the Commission on the matter, by which I mean on how these decisions are taken, would appear to be in order.
And we are doubly convinced that an explanation is in order following the article on the Commission's decisions in today's press and the massive criticism of the Commission's decisions voiced in an open letter by the Commissioner in question, Commissioner De Palacio, who was clearly put under pressure by her government and who obviously did not attend the crucial meeting of the Commission in person.
We saw the smoke at the time and now there appears to be a fire, which is why a debate in Parliament is called for, but not before the Council and the Commission have made a statement.
The Council is not here but could easily make a statement on its understanding of how these decisions come about at the forthcoming plenary sitting in Strasbourg.
But the Commission representative might at least add to today's statement on the common fisheries policy an explanation of how these common decisions are taken .
Mr President, I would have kept my peace, had Mr Schulz refrained from making these comments.
I have no wish to make a snap judgment of the conduct of the government referred to by Mr Schulz, let alone the conduct of a member of the Commission.
But, my dear Mr Schulz, your comments would have had more credibility had you also criticised the fact that, when it was in line for a blue letter, the German Government put so much pressure on the Council of Ministers that in the end the letter was not sent.
You would have been more credible had you also had something to say when a member of your party in the Commission - I shall not name names because I do not want to open a can of worms - infringed Commission regulations. Please be assured that I have no wish to rake over old ashes.
But you are being selective in your complaints and that casts doubt on your credibility, although it does not undermine what may well be well-founded criticism of the conduct of individual governments or Commissioners.
That is all I have to say.
We agreed that Commissioner Fischler should make a statement today.
Commissioner Fischler is most welcome.
But we should not make party political capital out of his statement.
(Applause)
Mr President, it is sometimes hard to keep a clear head when grievances fill the air and I think we are seeing the results of that.
It is clear that certain allegations have been made about the activity of certain Commissioners and others in a case involving fisheries, but this matter has been considered by the Conference of Presidents.
The Fisheries Committee has been asked to look into it and report back to the Conference of Presidents and I understand that the Budgetary Control Committee is also looking into it.
It is important that we allow due process to take place in Parliament before raising these issues in plenary.
It is also important that we do not mix the question of these allegations with a very important communication that the Commission has brought forward on the future of the common fisheries policy on how to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.
So I would ask you, Mr President, to ask Mr Schulz, on behalf of the Socialist Group, to bring this back to the Conference of Presidents in due course.
Mr President, two points.
First, we did in fact agree in the Conference of Presidents to discuss both issues.
We wanted to discuss them separately but we were told, no, it had to be in conjunction with the Commission statement.
You just have to agree at some point on what it is you want.
We are prepared to discuss it one way or the other.
But what we do not agree with is someone telling us, every time we decide something, that it has to be done the other way round and then turning it all round again!
Secondly, on the question of government intervention.
It may come as a surprise, but you are right to criticise the German Chancellor and he is right to criticise the government ...
(Interjection from Mr Poettering: then he should do both!)
... that is what I am saying!
Except that the Commissioners do not represent their governments, they represent the interests of the European Union.
The ministers represent governments and we have to make that perfectly clear to all our governments.
So instead of sitting here trying to represent parties and governments, let us join with the Commission in representing the interests of the European Union.
Agreed?
Agreed!
(Laughter, applause)
Mr President, could I just remind all the Members in this House that whilst we may have difficulties or disagreements with regard to procedures or undue interference directed against individual Members of the Commission or anybody else, the most important issue we are discussing here today is the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people involved in the fishing industry.
These people want to ensure that they can continue in their role as fishermen feeding all the peoples of Europe and maintain strong, rural coastal communities.
This bickering about procedures, individual issues or political issues does us no credit as a Parliament.
We are supposed to represent the interests of the people within the European Union, not simply political blocs trying to score points.
So let us listen to what Commissioner Fischler has to say, and attack or support the policy.
Let us work with real issues not with esoteric issues concerning political point-scoring.
Mr President, as Mr Watson said, we have had a full investigation on this matter in the Fisheries Committee at the request of the Conference of Presidents.
We have now drawn up a report based on a very frank two-hour hearing that we held with Mr Fischler, who gave very frank answers to a barrage of questions.
We will be submitting that report to the Conference of Presidents after the Fisheries Committee has had a further look at the report to make sure they agree that it is a fair record of the hearing that took place last week.
Our job in the Fisheries Committee, as Brian Crowley has just said, is now to focus our attention on the common fisheries policy reform package.
To do otherwise and put any further obstacles in the way of getting this reform back on track, is simply to play into the hands of those who sought to derail the whole process in the first place.
I would hope this House would support the Fisheries Committee in looking at the reform package.
If there are other questions to be asked about personnel management or any other aspect of this controversy, then I would leave that to your good offices in the Conference of Presidents.
Mr President, what causes me to take the floor is simply Mr Cohn-Bendit's observation that we must not serve national interests on this issue.
As a Dane, I should like to say that that is something with which I completely agree.
An investigation must, however, be carried out, then, into whether matters have in actual fact proceeded in this way or whether national interests have played a part.
I do not, moreover, think that a report is sufficient.
Anyone at all can come and say whatever they like.
We must have a proper investigation. I do not, however, agree that what we have to defend here is the EU's interests.
It is our children's and grandchildren's interests.
Are there to be fish in the sea for future generations too?
It must be our task to ensure that there are.
It is not the interests of the EU but those of future generations that we must serve.
Mr President, I accept the reasons that the Conference of Presidents had in the first place for keeping separate the debate about the substance of the proposals which we are all very anxious to be getting on with.
But I also believe that we have unfinished business in relation to the recent controversy.
As others have said, there are wider issues that are worthy of further inquiry.
For instance, it is a remarkable coincidence that 10 years ago, the last time the CFP was under review, the then Director-General of Fisheries departed in very similar circumstances during a very similar controversy.
So in order to clear up the cloud that could hang over the Commission in this matter, I think there is a case for further consideration, separately from the Fisheries Committee's consideration of the substance of the proposals.
Mr President, I believe that we are engaging in a democratic process which, in truth, hides interests that cannot be denied.
The reform proposed by the Commission will cause 28 000 job losses in an environment in which there is clear discrimination in allowing northern countries to take additional catches whilst denying this option to those of the south.
We are all in favour of the conservation of resources, given that all Europeans have the same status in Community waters, something denied by the Commission and by many of those protesting, through interventions by the Spanish Government, which I cannot support.
Mr President, I too have a procedural suggestion: not to comment further on what Mr Poettering has said.
That is no easy task and anyone who knows me knows that I shall have to exercise an inordinate amount of self-control!
The election campaign is due to start in Germany in a couple of weeks' time. Mr Poettering has made it clear here that it has already begun.
Which is why I shall say no more.
But to have to bolster a motion in Parliament under the rules of procedure, which our group put on the agenda and the merits of which I have justified, by criticising your own government in order to be credible, takes the biscuit as far as party political statements goes!
Which is why it is you who are lacking in credibility!
We call for a vote on our motion.
This issue was discussed in the Conference of Presidents when we planned the agenda for today.
Today's agenda was voted and approved by a plenary sitting of Parliament in Strasbourg.
Once that agenda was adopted, the question of changing the agenda rests at my discretion.
I take note of the request from Mr Schulz in the Socialist Group.
Having regard to the work of our colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, I suggest that we should invite the chairman of that committee to present a report to the Conference of Presidents and, in the light of that report, the Conference should make a recommendation concerning any further agenda item as proposed by Mr Schulz today.
I would suggest that we do not change the agenda today.
(The order of business was thus established)
Mr President, in the light of a very recent incident, I should like to make a statement, raise a security issue and warn everyone entering and leaving this House.
At about 6 p.m. yesterday evening, my assistant and I were mugged by a group of four or five young men at the visitors' entrance to the House. My assistant's handbag was grabbed and her hand injured.
We were in the courtyard, in the security zone controlled by security cameras.
The attack was clearly filmed and I suggest that we all study it carefully.
I screamed and called for help and chased the perpetrators as far as the park.
Only once my assistant had picked herself up and gone into the House did she receive any support or help from the security staff.
From which I conclude that our security around the entrance is far from guaranteed.
My question is: why did the security guard not come to our aid?
He must have heard me and he did hear me.
What has Parliament done since the last such incident?
I call for a safety precinct or no-go zone round the House and at the access to the Eastman building, which we also use for our parliamentary work.
We cannot have gangs of muggers striking terror here in the House, while all the security service does is to search and harass our visitors, our assistants and sometimes even us.
Mrs KlaÃ, your point is well made.
You will see from the response that you and your assistant have the support and, I am sure, the sympathy of all Members of this House.
The issue which you raise is a very serious one.
There is a meeting of the Bureau later today at which I will bring this matter up and report back to you.
Mr President, there is just one thing to add to the important points raised by Mrs KlaÃ.
The whole incident was filmed.
So the time has come for you, Mr President, to take disciplinary measures against everyone who was in the vicinity on behalf of the security service and failed to intervene.
You should also file charges with the relevant criminal authorities on the grounds of failure to provide assistance!
Mr President, it is appropriate I raise my point after this exchange because the greatest political excitement in the Brussels village at present is the machinations and intrigues on the fisheries policy, rather than the content of it which is of course very important.
It is a great pity that we do not have the flexibility to insert on our agenda a debate on the threat of nuclear war in Asia between India and Pakistan.
I wish to protest that we are navel-gazing and ignoring the greatest threat to the world's security today - a war in which millions of people could die.
I am glad that Mr Solana, Mr Patten and Mr Straw have gone to the region, and I am not saying a European Parliament debate would be decisive, but we seem to be ignoring the issue.
The European Parliament is therefore abdicating any claim to seek to build an effective EU common foreign and security policy.
When such a threat is hanging over the world, to be honest, it puts some of what we have heard in the last quarter of an hour into perspective.
I fully accept the point you make about the serious nature of the problem between Pakistan and India with regard to Kashmir.
Commissioner Patten cannot be at our sitting today or tomorrow, but he will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy next Monday.
The Spanish Presidency has indicated that it is willing to debate this matter in Strasbourg.
So although we are not in a position to debate this issue at this part-session, we have taken steps to ensure that it will indeed be on our agenda for the reasons which you have given.
Mr President, on 10 April we debated the GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez report on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
I was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in relation to that report.
It was withdrawn on 10 April because of an agreement that there was no adequate legal basis for the measure as it then stood.
By way of an emergency, it was rushed through the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development yesterday in a new form without any reference back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That is an irregular way of proceeding and I request that Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market be asked, even it is asked to do it quickly, to verify that a legal base exists for this measure in its new form.
While I am on my feet on the issue of Rule 63, a lot of the issues under the common fisheries policy reform raise profound issues of legal base, and hopefully that will thoroughly considered in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as well as the Committee on Fisheries.
Thank you for drawing our attention to this question.
We will check that between now and Strasbourg.
The next item is the Commission statement on the common fisheries policy.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present to you today the proposal for the reform of the common fisheries policy which we decided yesterday in committee should be presented to the Fisheries Council and Parliament.
It is not an exaggeration or mere rhetoric to say that only far-reaching reform will guarantee our fishermen and our fish stocks a future.
The current fisheries policy is not sustainable and is therefore doomed to fail.
More and more stocks are threatened by collapse.
Fishing capacity is going up, not down.
Controls and sanctions are uneven and therefore unfair.
It is costing more and more to land fewer and fewer fish.
Economic opportunities for fishermen are deteriorating and, despite higher public subsidies, many have to give up their trade.
I have often been asked how it can have come to this.
My answer is, because the system we have is wrong, which is why we need to change the system rather than trying to treat the symptoms.
The future fisheries policy needs clear objectives.
The outcome of the reform must be a new fisheries policy which ensures sustainable development ecologically, economically and socially.
We need responsible fisheries and aquaculture which allow a healthy marine ecosystem.
We need to build a successful and competitive sector which also serves the consumer.
We must ensure that those who are particularly dependent on fisheries have a fair economic framework within which to work.
We also want to apply the principles of new governance within the new fisheries policy by guaranteeing openness and transparency in our measures, involving the sector itself, setting clear responsibilities, developing swift decision-making procedures and guaranteeing coherence with other policies.
The best way of illustrating the extent of the reform is to compare current policy with future policy.
Until now, the December Council has decided on TACs and quotas from one year to the next and year after year scientific recommendations have been watered down by compromise.
What is more, the existing system has not been effective in preventing illegal catches and excessive by-catches of juvenile fish.
We have predicated stock management and stock management controls on quotas, instead of establishing a clear and direct relationship between scientific assessment of the stocks and allowable fishing effort, which is so much easier to oversee.
We have been operating a fleet policy, the objectives of which have not brought about any noticeable reduction in capacity and the measures under which have been completely cancelled out by promoting vessel construction, instead of establishing a link between the stocks that suffer most from capacity pressure and the reductions needed in order to be able to give individual fishermen a reasonable level of fishing effort.
We have contributed to the current race between ever more efficient ships for fewer and fewer fish, with the result that income has declined, despite increasing prices for fish, and with the result that some 66 000 jobs have already been lost between 1991 and 1998.
We boosted this trend by using financial support primarily to buy new, more efficient ships instead of on measures which would have encouraged the people concerned to do things differently.
Finally, thanks to a system of widely varying controls and sanctions, what we have done, instead of making sure there was a level playing field is to create a climate of mistrust, so that today every fisherman thinks he is worse off than fishermen in neighbouring countries.
That is why we want to create a new coherent system which steers its own way towards the objectives set, rather than sucking them into a vortex.
We have taken as our starting point the stocks in the sea which are generally fished in common.
We shall have them scientifically assessed and shall draw up multiannual stock recovery and stock management plans as and where necessary.
From these we shall be able to establish the level of fishing effort each of these stocks can tolerate and what technical measures need to be applied.
In other words, in future we shall set ever smaller annual TACs and quotas and then determine how many boats may fish for how many days in certain zones and what nets they will be allowed to use.
This system is also much easier to control using VMS and can also be adapted year on year, depending on how stocks evolve.
In places where there is overcapacity, fishermen who can no longer use their vessel to full capacity will have to ask themselves if it is more worthwhile for them to carry on fishing, leave the sector, have their vessel scrapped and retire or get retrained.
We must, though, stop using subsidies to entice fishermen into new investments without providing an economic environment which can sustain them.
Instead, we want to use public funds to help give those leaving the sector a positive future, which will also improve opportunities for the vessel owners who remain in the sector.
In order to finance this concept, we need first and foremost to reprogramme the existing structural programmes.
The Member States can no longer hide behind the argument that we would have to wait until 2006.
Current regulations already provide the facility for reprogramming.
We propose to use the funds previously used to export ships and for joint ventures for scrapping and, instead of supporting vessel renewal and creating artificial competition, to use the EUR 450 million for social measures.
As far as we are concerned, it is vital that this money be spent on social measures in future because, according to our initial calculations, around 7 000 jobs a year could be scrapped due to restricted fishing efforts, in addition to the other jobs which will be lost this year anyway, one reason being the increasingly modern and less labour intensive techniques being used in the fisheries sector.
However, if necessary, additional new funds will be made available for scrapping and for social assistance.
That is the main difference.
As I said, without reforms, 8 000 jobs a year have been lost over the last few years.
Around EUR 100 million has been earmarked over the entire term of the current structural programme for social measures to secure these jobs. EUR 800 million have been marked for vessel renewal.
We really do need to focus more on people and ensure this extra money is used for their good, not for new ships!
The result of all these efforts will be a smaller but more competitive fleet, the fishing effort of which will be much better adapted to the resources available.
The fleet will also be healthier economically and less dependent on aid.
In order to strengthen uniform monitoring of fisheries, we intend to establish a common fisheries control structure.
We intend to coordinate national and EU control activities and to combine the funds earmarked for the purpose.
After all, fishermen do not just fish within the borders of their own country, so why should inspectors be restricted to their own territorial waters?
Inspections - be they in the Bay of Biscay or in the Channel - will be carried out in future by teams of inspectors from several Member States.
But common inspections also require harmonised sanctions.
Member States who do not respect the common rules will face quota reductions, fishing effort reductions or cuts to their FIFG funds.
I am well aware that the sector will at first be wary of some aspects of this approach.
We cannot hold this against them, because those who are directly affected by the fisheries policy have traditionally been excluded from any decision-making.
So, here too, we must find a new approach and make the sector our first and most important policy adviser.
To achieve this, all our decisions must be transparent and understandable, so that fishermen no longer feel they are in 'Animal Farm', where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.
We also want to promote dialogue at international level, especially between the European Union and the countries with which we have fisheries agreements.
Our strategy for worldwide fisheries includes an action plan to combat illegal fishing, better assessment of the stocks available to EU ships outside EU waters and an integrated policy concept for partnerships in fisheries.
So, in summary, our first reform package contains our future objectives and our reform proposals on stock conservation, on integrating environmental objectives into fisheries policy, on fleet policy, on fisheries inspections and on combating illegal fishing.
We shall soon come forward with further proposals and reports on the conservation of stocks in the Mediterranean, fishing outside EU waters, monitoring of fisheries, aquaculture, the integration of economic factors into fisheries policy and the restructuring of the fleet in coastal areas.
According to our timetable, we should be ready to start implementing measures by 1 January 2003.
If we have the courage to take responsible decisions, there is hope: hope for sustainable fisheries, for balanced ecosystems, for greater independence for the sector and for economic and social stability in our coastal regions, which is why I call on you to do everything you can for fisheries reform.
You can certainly count on my total commitment.
Now a brief word, if I may, on various articles which appeared in today's press, stating that Vice-President Palacio Vallelersundi disagrees with the fisheries reform.
A number of other articles have also been published along the same lines.
To my mind, this is regrettable.
I should like to make it clear that it is perfectly normal for a Commissioner to write to a colleague in the run up to a decision, although the choice of words in this letter was unfortunate.
I should like to make one thing clear: if we are going to talk about provocation, then the only provocation, to my mind, is not being in a position to overhaul the fisheries sector!
So let us keep to the business of reform in hand, so that this sector and the people working in it can be assured of a future.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his presentation.
Of course, radical reform of the CFP was long overdue and the Commission is to be congratulated on producing a dynamic first package of proposals, particularly in view of the concerted effort to derail the reforms, which we were speaking about at the beginning of this meeting, and the attendant storm of controversy that this clumsy bullying tactic created.
I welcome the proposals to make permanent the 6 and 12-mile zones which are essential safeguards for fisheries.
I am delighted to see significant devolution of management and conservation controls to the Member States within these zones.
Indeed, devolution of management is a core feature of these CFP reform proposals.
The creation of regional advisory councils involving fishermen, scientists, representatives of the aquaculture sector, marine ecologists and even the recreational angling sector, together with regional politicians represents a breakthrough in stakeholder involvement.
I applaud the bravery of the Commission in demanding an immediate end to the bizarre spectacle of subsidising modernisation and new building of vessels in some Member States, while subsidising the scrapping of vessels in others.
We all know that there are far too many fishermen chasing too few fish.
We all know the EU fleet capacity must be cut.
We must therefore insist that all public aid be switched from modernisation and restructuring and new building to scrapping.
However, as regards overall capacity reduction in the EU fleet there is great concern about the Commission's figures.
According to my calculations, on a country-by-country basis, the northern Member States who have fished primarily in the North Sea, the Baltic and the Atlantic will suffer a 21.3% cut in gross tonnage.
Meanwhile, the southern Member States who fish in the Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Bay of Biscay will experience only a 9.2% cut in gross tonnage.
Taking individual examples, the UK will be required to scrap 23.1%, Belgium 25.3%, Denmark 27.3% and Sweden will face a staggering loss of 49.7% of her gross tonnage.
Meanwhile, Spain, with by far the largest fleet in the EU, escapes with only a 9.4% cut and Italy with the second largest fleet only suffers a cut of 7.3%.
People are wondering if the Commission has bowed to bullying pressure from Spain.
We will closely scrutinise these figures in the committee.
The Commissioner said that we do not want to go down the road of everyone being equal, but some people being more equal than others - that seems to be exactly the road we are going down with these proposed cuts.
Mr President, I shall take up where the Commissioner left off; in any EU country, if a minister writes, on the very day that a decision is taken, a letter such as the one the Vice-President of the Commission sent to the Commissioner, without going to the Council, there would be a governmental crisis, and the Prime Minister or President would have to dismiss one or both or these.
This is traditional practice in a democracy.
I shall take advantage of this occasion to say, Mr President, after listening to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, that I have very little confidence in his neutrality when it comes to carrying out an impartial investigation, after what he has said, because the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has to represent Parliament's interests as a whole, and not make his own calculations on what could concern one country or another.
If you will allow me, Mr President, I should like to say that we are facing a problem with regard to the reform of the common fisheries policy, but there is also a constitutional problem apparent: in the Council, a President-in-Office of the Council saying that he gives instructions to the Commission; in the Commission, a very clear, public and well-known division, which we found out about from the press.
The Commission made the decision yesterday without appearing before Parliament, yet revealed all to the press.
The only way we have of finding out about such matters is by buying newspapers.
Mr President, I am going to ask just one question of the Commissioner, based on the fact that Parliament has an enormous responsibility in trying to defend the interests of all Europeans, starting with fishermen.
We feel that this report does not discuss economic and social cohesion; it does not talk about the social fabric in coastal areas, which are also European; it does not talk about sustainable development; it does not include aquiculture, and does not talk about consumers, who also have rights, and furthermore, we all agree with doctors when they tell us that, to improve our diet, we need to eat more fish.
Therefore, Mr President, the only question I would like to ask the Commissioner is the following: why not apply all those principles he claims to defend in the reform of the common agricultural policy to the reform of fisheries?
If we say that this is multi-dimensional, that it has to defend citizens, the landscape, the culture and all those aspects that shape European life, why should this be defended in agriculture but not in fisheries?
(Applause)
Mr President, the ELDR Group welcomes the proposals that the Commission has brought forward.
In its resolution on the green paper, Parliament asked for a policy that would strike a balance between the needs of environmental sustainability and of fisheries as a socio-economic sector.
Indeed, the very future of that sector depends on our commitment today to the conservation of stocks.
We agree that there is an urgent need to reduce fishing effort, and that this has to be effected in part by a reduction of capacity.
It must, however, be done in an equitable manner, as well as in a way that reflects the actual state of the different stocks.
Nor can we expect sustainability to be achieved through decommissioning alone.
We need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about.
Undoubtedly, the promised long-term approach, setting multi-annual catch targets, will be a major improvement and help to solve the problem of discards.
The proposals also bring good news, not just for juvenile fish but for other vulnerable species such as dolphins, sea birds and sharks.
We welcome too the intention to bring about better enforcement of the rules and the action planned to fight illegal fishing and ensure sustainable fisheries beyond EU waters.
The retention of the 6 to 12 mile limit will assist in development of conservation measures and do much to protect the coastal fishing on which many of our fragile communities depend.
Confirmation from the Commissioner that the new regulation on these limits will definitively be in place by 1 January 2003 would be of great comfort.
We also believe that the establishment of regional advisory panels will do much to encourage responsible conservation measures, although the role of such councils needs some clarification.
We understand that the withdrawal of public aid for fleet modernisation and renewal will not be acceptable to everyone, but we believe that it is only logical in the circumstances.
Nevertheless, the exception for safety is again welcome provided it is indeed for safety alone.
We are particularly glad that the monies will be converted into a substantial social package to ameliorate the effects of the measures on the livelihoods of those currently engaged in fishing.
It has always been a matter of concern that decommissioning measures do nothing to assist the crews of fishing vessels.
If we get things right, we shall sustain both fish and fishers to harvest them.
If not, we may have neither and future generations may find it very hard to forgive us.
Mr President, this long-awaited package contains many welcome aspects.
The accent on conservation and sustainability must of course be central to the CFP.
Multi-species and multi-annual management is welcome.
Efforts to create a level playing field in enforcement are welcome.
Technical conservation measures and their development are welcome.
Of course, fleet capacity needs to be brought more in line with available resources.
I take it that the Commissioner can confirm today that recent efforts in certain areas will be taken into account in that regard.
I welcome the 6 and 12 mile limit retention, but beyond 12 miles I have some very serious concerns about the wording of the documents in relation to access to waters and resources and in relation to relative stability.
Is the Commission saying that equal access will bring equal access to fishing opportunities in our waters?
Is the document really saying that relative stability keys will be perennially open for review?
Does the Commission envisage additional Member States gaining quota in areas where they have none at the moment - for example, in the North Sea?
The wording of the document in that particular chapter points towards relative instability rather than the stability which was intended.
There is at least a possibility that the otherwise good intentions of the conservation proposals in the document could well be undermined.
So I am looking for major and clear assurances of intent in that area.
Mr President, the Commission has submitted a proposal on the common fisheries policy and, once again, we find ourselves using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
It is undeniable that some fishing-grounds are in a difficult situation, but it is surprising that the Commission can find no solution other than to dismantle the fisheries sector and related jobs.
It is surprising that so little attention has been paid to technical measures for regenerating stocks and that industrial fishing should have been exempted from fleet reduction measures.
It would seem that industrial fleets fishing indiscriminately for huge quantities of fish to feed animals have no effect on marine resources, while fishing to feed human beings, which generates employment and has greater added value, is what depletes the fishing-grounds.
The Commission has tried to give this biased, partisan proposal an ecological gloss.
It is surprising that greater fleet reduction is being imposed on countries which have fulfilled the obligations of the MAGPs without imposing additional obligations on those which have not fulfilled them, or have even increased their fleet capacity - and I shall not name names.
Forget that structural actions are planned up until the year 2006.
It is surprising that the Commission dares to withdraw the public aid granted for the modernisation of vessels agreed on at the Berlin Council.
The real problem is a social one.
The Commission proposal will result in the loss of a tremendous number of jobs in areas dependent on fishing, which are on the periphery of the European Union and have a high level of unemployment.
The Commission must be aware that it should have made balanced proposals, that the fisheries policy is unlikely to progress under this measure, as it is unlikely to enter into force and meanwhile, Commissioner, we shall continue to waste valuable time that could be used to solve the problems of the fishing sector.
Mr President, I had hoped that the extra time taken by the Commission to fine-tune the proposals would have resulted in documents which would fully reflect the concerns raised by this House when we adopted our opinion earlier this year.
I had hoped that they would pay particular attention to the social and economic implications for those regions on the periphery of the Union.
These areas are heavily dependent on fishing, as by and large there is no alternative source of employment.
I regret to say that I have been disappointed with what the Commission has produced after its long deliberations at many levels.
Instead of carefully crafted measures which would address the real problems affecting the fishing industry, the Commission has delivered what can only be described as a blunt instrument which, if adopted, would fail to protect fish stocks or to address the issue of fishing effort.
Ireland fully meets the legal commitments under the multi-annual guidance programmes.
Our fishing fleets keep within the legally imposed TACs and quotas on fleet sizes.
In this context, it is totally unacceptable for the Commission to put forward proposals that would penalise all countries for the sins of a few.
I do not have time to refer to the sins of those greedy countries, the Member States from other parts of the Union that try to exploit the fishing resources in areas far from home.
These proposals underline an 8.5% reduction in fishing fleet.
This is being somewhat economical with the facts.
It may be a reduction of 8.5% in the fishing fleet but it is a reduction of at least 18% in capacity.
The Commission's proposals to forbid all state aid for the upgrading of the fleet is nothing short of irresponsible.
The essence of fleet renewal policy is to improve the safety and living conditions on board ships, not to improve the capacity or the effectiveness.
Failure to do this would be a dereliction of duty and we must insist on the right of Member States to continue the policy.
Therefore, I am extremely disappointed that the Commission have not reinstated the policy prior to December 2001 - that was the safety capacity clause.
How can the Commission claim to advocate a safer working environment for fishermen and crew members while at the same time penalising the owners of the vessels who want to carry out measures to improve safety on board?
In simple terms, if you want to put a whaleback on a vessel to protect the crew and create a safer environment, you are now penalised.
The Commission must take this into consideration and be much more reasonable.
In conclusion, I believe that these Commission proposals are just that.
It is fortunate that the watchdogs of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will be there to protect fish stocks and also, but equally as importantly, to protect the interests of fishermen from areas, where, as I said at the outset, there is no alternative source of employment.
Mr President, this is not reform, as the Commission itself points out.
Council Regulation No 3760/92 established the framework upon which the CFP rests.
Of course, at its core is equal access to Community waters which was derogated until 1 January 2003.
Only at this point will the CFP fully come into force.
So what we are actually seeing here is the final stage of implementation of the CFP.
After 30 years of meddling by the Commission and in-fighting by Member States, what we now have is a world-class ecological disaster and the near destruction of many parts of the British fishing industry.
This itself is graphic testimony to the abject failure of the measures thus far implemented.
But instead of new measures to deal with it all, what we are now seeing is a complete contradiction.
Bound by treaty obligations to afford equal access, which effectively means allowing the Spanish fleet into the rest of British waters, against that, we see: relative stability.
Relative stability is based on track record; equal access is based on fleet tonnages.
They are in fact opposite things.
They cannot exist side by side.
That crucial point alone demonstrates that these proposals are a political fudge.
Not surprisingly, therefore, Mr Fischler's colleague, Mrs De Palacio, has expressed global reserve on every aspect of the proposed reform and I share that global reserve.
Nothing that the Commissioner has offered addresses the fundamental flaw and that is that it is a common policy.
The only fisheries policies that have been successful around the world are those that are managed exclusively by sovereign nation states.
Thus, the only real option is to abolish the CFP.
Politics and fishing just do not mix.
Mr President, the Commission's new-found awareness of its responsibility for long-term conservation of fish stocks is to be applauded and encouraged.
However, due to the almost total failure of previous policies, I am of the opinion that control of fishing activities should be better returned to the elected governments of Member States with the return of control over their former national territorial waters.
These proposals are unfairly weighted against United Kingdom fishermen with a reduction in tonnage of 29% compared to 20% for France, 12% for Spain and 2% for Greece.
Fish stocks are a truly natural resource and should be renewable for all time.
With regard to land-based food chains, we have to sow and breed as well as harvest and process.
With fish, we merely hunt them down.
We must not allow ourselves to fish selfishly or to hunt them down to extinction.
It would be an act of cynicism for Member States to dilute these proposals further.
We not only need friends of fishing; but more importantly, we need friends of fish.
This is probably the last opportunity for European countries to show a clear determination to deal with these chances effectively.
If these proposals fail to be effective, I for one shall campaign for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the CFP entirely.
Mr President, Mr Fischler, you have given in to the anti-European nationalism of certain Member States that just want to monopolise fishing for themselves. They do not want to share, and are using the excuse of environmental fundamentalism which puts fish before human beings.

Of course, we are in favour of conserving stocks, more so than you, as your proposals do not prioritise radical scientific reform, which has to be the very basis of the system, you relegate it to second place, to a second package.
Big mistake.
What is more, you allow the scandalous squandering of over a million tonnes of fish which one Member State destroys each year to convert into animal feed without asking how this affects the food chain of the species.
That is not conservationism.
You promise us studies, but we have had a fisheries policy for twenty years and you are still promising us studies.
This is not acceptable.
We need to divide up all available resources scientifically and update the level of dependency of the European regions, which is another thing you have failed to do.
You have admitted that the studies are incomplete.
A reform of this calibre cannot be tackled with incomplete studies of the extent of the dependency of the regions.
Some fishing grounds are being reserved solely for certain States.
Boats are being scrapped as if starting from scratch, as if some States had not already scrapped fifty per cent of their fleet while others have increased theirs.
The reform goes against the social cohesion policy laid down until the year 2006, preventing economic operators from continuing with the activities they had planned in Objective 1 regions. They are not asking you for more money, Mr Fischler, but rather to carry on fishing.
They want to continue to fish, they can continue and the European Union needs them to do so.
With regard to foreign policy, Mr Fischler, you have broken your promise to Parliament that your reform would give equal treatment to shipbuilders and the northern agreements and shipowners and the southern agreements.
You have not done this.
You have restricted commercial agreements with third parties and outlawed mixed companies, thereby undermining the global position of the European fleet, increasing the vulnerability of our industry and making us more dependent on imports.
This is a political error of the first order, an error on a scale never before seen in fisheries policy, and if we do not change this and make the sector more European, you will be sounding the death knell of an entire economic and social sector of strategic importance to the European Union.
Mr President, today the Commission is presenting a point of extraordinary political importance, as demonstrated by the tremendous controversy between the Commission and the fisheries sector.
The fishermen are complaining that the Commission has not included their opinions in its proposal for a reform, nor has it included the opinions of Parliament on this matter, given in January this year.
What is more, this proposal was adopted yesterday by the members of the Commission by simple majority in the absence of four Commissioners, and with no guarantee that it has the necessary qualified majority in the Council.
The Commission is acting outside the sector.
A French shipowner told me less than ten minutes ago that the Commission hears but does not listen.
Any reform of a basic policy such as fisheries must, in order to be credible, ensure the survival of the sector and an improvement in the living and working conditions of those concerned.
The Commission proposals are far from seeking a balance between conservation of stocks, the efficiency of the fleet, maintaining jobs and economic activity in fishing regions.
The Commission does take account of the well-intentioned concerns of environmentalist groups, but puts them before those of the fishing world itself and shamelessly sacrifices basic principles of the European Union, such as economic and social cohesion, in regions that are heavily dependent on fishing, all of which are Objective 1 regions.
We, as socialists, call for the sustainable management of stocks, but we believe that this can only take place if the fishermen are involved.
With this plan, stocks will have been replenished within ten years so that Europeans can look at them in a display case, and we shall all be eating imported fish.
The twenty-eight thousand jobs that you are already saying will be lost are only the tip of the iceberg.
Fishing generates many more jobs, directly and indirectly, which are not counted in the document presented by the Commissioner.
His proposal goes beyond fishing.
It concerns a neoliberal reform to scrap boats, which clears the way for a CFP that is neither Community-minded, as it turns its back on European solidarity and increases the North-South divide, nor is it political, as the Commission refuses to exercise its powers, and nor does it have the interests of fisheries at heart as it condemns the sector it is meant to protect, and in particular coastal fishermen, to extinction.
My group, Commissioner, will therefore work in Parliament and the Committee on Fisheries as of today, the day on which we have seen the texts, together with the sector, together with the other groups represented in Parliament, listening to anyone who wants to talk to us to work towards a reform that is gradual, that is established by consensus and that is properly financed, because we believe that a sector of the vital strategic importance of fishing in the European Union cannot be condemned to die out.
Mr President, the reform plans receive my approval.
They focus on fleet control and enforcement, with good reason.
Making cuts hurts, but it also opens up new opportunities.
EU resources must be deployed with a view to promoting viable economic activities.
Concerning control and enforcement, I share your view about international uniform control on a level playing field.
I have a few critical comments to make.
First of all, it is beyond me why the Commission wants to allow EU countries to fish for 'free' species in the North Sea without any restrictions.
That is just asking for trouble.
What is required here is a balance.
Secondly, you claim that, in principle, the polluter pays.
This is indeed stated in the document and is also correct, but we must, however, not lose touch with the facts or reality.
We must not get fishermen to foot the bill for natural phenomena.
Next I would like to turn my attention to the multi-annual programme: I have no objections to it, as long as we remember the lessons from the past. I would urge you to use effective assessments and minimise red tape.
Finally, these are proposals aimed at striking a balance between market forces and the environment. This is European policy..
Mr President, while the Greens fully support the efforts of the Commission to create a sustainable fisheries policy within the EU, we reject any attempt to simply transfer our problems to the developing world.
For far too long the EU has sent its distant water fishing vessels to scour the oceans off Africa and other areas where they can cause immense harm to fish stocks and to local artisanal fishing communities.
We have to clean up our own house without transferring our problems to those who are economically worse off than ourselves and who are desperate for any money they can get.
Commissioner Fischler has stated that the EU must work for sustainable fishing wherever EU fleets operate and we shall hold him to that goal.
In relation to the over-capacity of EU fleets, I would like to ask the Commission how it feels about the announcement by the Irish Government yesterday for a EUR 56 million investment package for EU vessels?
This conflicts quite strongly with what the Commission is trying to do.
If the Irish Government is allowed to go ahead with this, how would it square with other Member States who could follow suit and do exactly the same?
This is at complete odds with what the Commission is trying to achieve.
Finally, in relation to the whole saga regarding Spain's involvement in recent weeks in the reform of the fisheries policy - and a Spanish minister actually admitting on television that he was ordering his commissioners what do to - this goes completely against the EU's rules.
This entire saga needs to be properly and thoroughly investigated because, forgive the pun, as far as I can see, the whole thing is very fishy.
Mr President, the proposal that Commissioner Fischler has just made amounts to a real declaration of war on the fisheries sector, with particularly serious implications for countries with poorer and older fleets, such as Portugal.
Environmental protection is being used as an excuse for a proposal to dramatically cut fishing effort, with measures designed to reduce the level of catches and to reward the decommissioning of fishing vessels, without taking proper account of the specific circumstances and needs of each country.
It is being overlooked, for example, that Portugal is the Member State that has already far exceeded the objectives for reducing fishing effort, while maintaining an ageing fleet - around 40% of its vessels are over 25 years old - and which has the lowest average yield in the European Union.
Nevertheless, what the Commission is promising is more incentives for decommissioning fishing vessels, with 287 in Portugal or a reduction of around 12 thousand tonnes in gross tonnage, whereas what Portugal needed was to increase support for modernising its fleet with a view to supplying a population which is the biggest per capita consumer of fish in the European Union, which also makes Portugal a very attractive market for multinationals.
But this is not in the interest of Portugal's population or of workers in the strategic fisheries sector, which is now under such enormous threat.
We are therefore rejecting the proposal and proposing that there should be a wholesale review of it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the euthanasia plan for coastal fishing in Europe which Commissioner Fischler has just calmly outlined to us must be rejected outright, both for its general philosophy and its technical structure.
This plan is, first and foremost, characteristic of a dreadful supranational approach, demonstrating an off-hand technocratic arrogance that could spell - following a broad consultation of professionals for the sake of appearances - the condemnation pure and simple of an industry due to the widespread abusive use of deficient and questionable technical assessments, that are both incomplete, biased and often misleading. I refer you to the cases of anchovy and black pollack in the Atlantic.
This plan is absurd and contradictory: although it claims to conserve fish stocks, it actually condemns one of the most restrictive and cautious fishing industries in terms of conserving fish stocks, to the advantage of third country fleets, which show the least respect for conservation, and which will be called on, if we support Mr Fischler, to supply, almost single-handedly, Europe's booming fish market.
This plan is dangerous because it is unworkable.
It is based on a key concept, namely fishing effort, which cannot be measured by any reliable indicator or statistical instrument - and you are aware of this, Commissioner Fischler.
Lastly, the plan reflects the growing contradictions within the Union and the danger of adopting uniform solutions for European industries.
What gives those Member States that have sacrificed their coastal fishing for the sake of industrial fishing, the right to prevent those that wish to preserve coastal fishing as a fundamental element of their identity and land management from doing so?
We therefore need the powerful forces within our Member States to come together, we need genuine action from those who support fishing, to call for the Council to condemn unequivocally, on 11 June, the new CFP proposed by Mr Fischler and to demand an ambitious plan in its place.
This plan must be the exact opposite of the Commission's assumptions: which are the unsubstantiated prediction of a disastrous future for fish stocks and the refusal to take into account the fact that other factors apart from fishing affect these stocks.
By recognising our lack of knowledge regarding fish stocks, which was in fact admitted in the Commission's Green Paper, this voluntary plan must provide for considerable development of independent research at the Commission and close cooperation between professionals and scientists.
We can thus refine the quota system and make the destruction of new vessels unnecessary.
This plan must also include the essential element of fleet modernisation, which fishermen themselves are not in a position to undertake.
Public aid is therefore necessary and legitimate if we wish to avoid further accidents caused by ageing vessels.
Like the agriculture plan, this plan, Mr President, must provide for the 'setting-up of young fishermen' and 'traceability' from the fisherman to the consumer.
This is the only way to preserve coastal fishing which is of great importance to many Member States.
Mr President, I am pleasantly surprised that, as delegation leader Mr Galeote, you too have asked to speak on fisheries today.
You even have three minutes, time enough to score an equaliser, I think.
This official support - I trust you are indeed supporting the reform, Mr Galeote - would be most welcome from all the honourable Members.
Unfortunately, the fishing boat appears to have no one at the helm and there is a storm brewing, and not just in the Committee on Fisheries, unfortunately!
Perhaps in future every Member of this House could explain exactly which hat they are wearing when they address us.
Now to you, Mr Fischler. Who, apart from you, will be our contact in your directorate-general in future, now that your important colleague is - not to put too fine a point on it - in the political wilderness?
And can we really expect the taxpayer to pay for people to move into consultancy posts when no one succeeds to office?
Who, at long last, is going to give me, is going to give all of us the data and facts we need if we are to back the reform?
Please, we need to see your figures and how you arrived at them.
With all these attacks going on, we need answers.
Having said which, may I ask you Mr Crespo - at least I would if you were still here - then you, Mr Noguera, what you mean by this North-South conflict you keep referring to?
Are we really at war, Mrs Figueiredo?
Why did our Spanish friends in the Committee on Fisheries welcome the new Amigos de la Pesca grouping with such jubilation?
Does this group integrate or render asunder?
Why are the other fisheries nations not involved?
Are they not wanted?
Where does this leave the Community?
I was in the Spanish port of Vigo just yesterday.
A few people said, 'Keep up the good work, girl!', but there are widely differing views on the matter there.
Alarm bells are going off in all directions.
I hope that everyone speaking on fisheries here today and tomorrow is up for integration.
In the final analysis, we all want reform, because we have fished everything there is out of the sea.
And now we must bear the consequences - as a Community!
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's package of reforms affecting the common fisheries policy.
I am also pleased to see that little has been changed from the original objectives of reform.
The existing common fisheries policy has failed to achieve its objectives.
It fails to provide an adequate living for many fishermen and, at the same time, it fails to conserve fish stocks for present and future generations.
We have to make hard choices.
In the new CFP, we must cut the existing EU fleet; however the EU should not make a blanket cut but take into account the different sizes of the EU national fleets.
For example, the Scottish fleet has already shrunk in recent years to a more sustainable size.
We must see an end to the subsidising of boat-building and put this money into helping fishermen who are coming out of the industry to find new employment.
We must see the retention of the 6 and 12-mile limits as proposed by the Commission - most Member States agree that these act as a safeguard for coastal regions especially dependent on fishing - with much closer involvement of the fishing industry via the new regional advisory councils in the development and operation of fisheries management measures.
We must seriously examine the problem of discards and we need improved inspection and enforcement standards across the Community and an equalising of these standards.
Finally, we need better agreement on fishing in developing countries' waters, based on sound science to prevent over-exploitation of stocks.
I look forward to the next six months.
The sooner we get a conclusion, the better.
Time is short, but if the will is there I am confident we can have a CFP fit for this century.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I hope that your proposal for reform of the common fisheries policy will be rejected by the Member States and by this House.
I in fact hope that you will resign, because you are working in the interests of the northern countries, who regard themselves as the owners of the Community's waters, and because you are acting against the interests of the southern countries, such as Galicia for example, which are still considered to be intruders in their own European home.
Your proposal should be rejected because it amounts to ignorant despotism, because it is not based on serious scientific studies about the preservation of resources, and because it enshrines a discriminatory principle of relative stability that runs counter to the treaties, granting 16% of normal Community catches to Member States like Denmark, whereas Spain has only 6%.
No one would dare to propose what the Commissioner intends to do in the fisheries sector in any other sector of the economy.
Commissioner, you should make way for another Commissioner who is less partisan, more open and aware of the needs of the fisheries sector, and who will bring forward measures that are compatible with genuine sustainable development.
Mr President, the Iberian peninsula, Europe's biggest fishing area, is condemned to confrontation with Commissioner Fischler's new, indiscriminate common fisheries policy.
Since 1986, the fishing fleet of the peninsula has been reduced by half and if the new measures are finally implemented, the days of the Basque fishermen will be numbered.
Based on the advice of scientists and seamen, the Commission should clarify first the scale of the impact on fish stocks from industrial and rural pollution, nuclear waste and tanker shipwrecks.
For that, more time is needed.
Meanwhile, the clashes between the Presidency-in-office and the Commission must not interfere with a new period of efficient control on the abuse of nets with meshes that are too fine.
This would allow the dwindling fish stocks to recover.
Mr President, the Commissioner stated that it is only possible to practise sound politics if clear goals are set.
This is the kind of language I can identify with.
He also indicated that the fisheries policy must aim to strike a balance between economic, ecological and social conditions.
But what is crucial is that there will not be a fisheries policy at all if there are little or no fish stocks.
Some stocks have experienced a dramatic decline.
We must acknowledge this, and this means that measures must be taken.
The multi-annual guidance programme has failed.
Given the current situation, we cannot continue to grant premiums for new constructions in the shipbuilding industry.
I subscribe to this approach and this clear stance.
I also subscribe to the Commissioner's view that quota control must be stricter.
This is the Achilles' heel of the European fisheries policy.
This control must be stricter, and I hope that we can sum up the courage as a Parliament to tighten this control by making sufficient financial means available for this purpose.
I also hope that we can summon the courage to implement the fisheries policy by considering each fish stock situation individually and tailoring our fleet and quota policy to these accordingly.
We should call an end to cattle-market-style wheeling and dealing among Member States with regard to the way in which the quota is handled from year to year, and I applaud the fact that we might be moving towards a multi-annual system for quotas.
I do believe that painful measures should go hand in hand with adequate financing measures. It is not acceptable for one Member State to support the social programme by means of co-financing and not the other.
Ideally, when implementing these measures, I would like to see co-financing abandoned and replaced by direct financing by the European Union.
I have another critical comment in this regard. It is insufficiently clear to what extent Member States with no access to the North Sea and no quota at present will have this in future.
Surely it would make no sense if a number of Member States around the North Sea were to be heavily affected by the shrinking fishing fleet, while other Member States were given access.
This does not add up.
You cannot turn the tap off at one location, only to open it at another.
Mr President, no one with any common sense would deny or question the absolute need to preserve and protect our fishing resources, that is threatened marine species.
We cannot accept a purely predatory attitude as if we were still living in prehistoric times but hunting with twenty-first century technology.
There is no longer any reason for fishing to continue as a predatory activity.
Nevertheless, the reform process has got off to a bad start, Commissioner Fischler, it has got bogged down in polemics and started off rather farcically, to put it mildly.
Which means that it is already mortally wounded, which is a shame.
It is attracting the opposition of those it is intended to help, who are up in arms.
The reform process needs objectivity and a calm and pedagogical approach, not the climate of guerrilla warfare that has broken out.
Furthermore, this reform is too brutal and is being attacked by those it affects.
It is an unbalanced reform which keeps the fishing industry of some countries intact.
It is an unfair reform because it does not take into account on the one hand those who have flouted the rules and on the other those who have respected the policies established up to now in this field.
It is a reform without any particularly rigorous scientific basis.
That is what everyone is saying.
Lastly, it is a technocrat's reform: it does not reflect the importance of cultures dating back thousands of years and lifestyles that must be protected.
That is why we have reservations and are protesting.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the common fisheries policy is concerned, we have been advocating vigilance and practical measures, stock management and the preservation of the marine environment for several years now.
Most of the governments have not given a reaction to these proposals, which aim to sustain fisheries in the future.
Now that we can see stocks are being exhausted - between one and two thirds of hake, cod and whiting have disappeared - we now have our backs to the wall.
We must therefore thoroughly reform the instrument, which must become less aggressive and more selective, to avoid, in particular, by-catches which sometimes make up 80% of a haul, including juvenile fish.
Each Member State will apply this European directive, which has been drawn up in the general interest, in the way it considers best.
Instead of quite devastating industrial fishing practices, we, the Greens, are calling for coastal fishing that is more capable of safeguarding jobs.
Considerably greater sums than those currently allocated to cover the social compensation of this policy will certainly need to be made available.
We are not in favour of taking blind administrative steps.
These must be determined in conjunction with the Regional Advisory Councils proposed by the Commission, made up of professionals, labour experts, scientists and civil societies that can adapt them to the specific problems on the ground.
This should enable us not only to salvage something from this situation but, more importantly, to provide the fishing industry with a new impetus and the sustainable development that is essential to our economic as well as human stability.
Mr President, Commissioner, I represent a country whose history revolves around fishing and the sea, and which still has a total of around 50 000 jobs in the fisheries sector as a whole.
The first criticism I have of the Commission proposal is that it does not take account of the diverse make-up of the European Union's fishing fleet: some countries' fleets consist mainly of large vessels used for industrial fishing and other countries which have predominantly small vessels.
In Portugal, 90% of the present fishing fleet consists of vessels less than 12 metres long used for small-scale coastal fishing.
As around 40% of these vessels are over 25 years old, the overwhelming majority of our fishermen will be unable to modernise and make their activity viable unless they receive support from the Community.
My second major criticism is about a fundamental issue that affects all these proposals, and which relates to the way in which the various countries have complied with the objectives laid down in the multiannual guidance programmes, the MAGPs.
There are some countries that have complied with these objectives, and there are others, as with Portugal, which have even exceeded those objectives by 30%, whilst there are others still that have not only failed to comply with their objectives but have even increased the capacity of their fleet.
Furthermore, I would like to remind you that since Portugal joined the European Union in 1986, the Portuguese fleet has been reduced by 45% and total catches cut by 50%.
Given these figures, I do not think it is fair to ask us to make further sacrifices when there are countries that have increased their fleets.
So because the Commission's proposals do not take account of this recent history, they not only involve robbing Peter to pay Paul, but worse still they reward those who have flouted the rules in the past.
To conclude, Commissioner, I would like to say that it is a mistake to try to rush a reform, because that is always a recipe for disaster.
The issue of the sustainability of resources is very serious, but it should not be used as an excuse for doing things hastily and giving insufficient weight to human and social aspects, and above all imposing an unfair balance.
Nothing has been said about fishmeal, the ultra-peripheral regions or illegal fishing.
And I hope that the reactions to the Commission's proposals will mean that aspects that have not been examined will now be reconsidered, leading to a more balanced reform covering all aspects of the problem.
That is why we need to wait a little longer.
Commissioner, you have just outlined proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy and these have instantly sparked controversy.
In your proposals, and quite apart from the many positive aspects that they contain - I am thinking in particular of the areas of control and sanctions, on which everyone seems to agree - there are two points that we see as essential which have not been taken into account.
The first point is the reference to total allowable catches, the infamous TACs, and the question of quotas, which should remain the cornerstone of the common fisheries policy.
The second point that I would like to highlight, one that has not been taken into account, one that has almost been disregarded, is that of economic and social cohesion in this sector and the consequences for local employment, both direct and indirect employment.
The only social measures envisaged are retirement or hypothetical retraining plans.
Nothing is envisaged for the youngest generations, to train them, to improve working conditions, and therefore to provide investments in safety on vessels.
It is unacceptable to propose the protection of species, fish in this case, as the sole criterion in formulating a policy.
We believe that the guarantee of sustainability, in any area, is the result of a balance between economic objectives and environmental objectives, of course, but also between social objectives.
For a Community policy, a common policy, to be understood and accepted, it must be based on a comprehensive approach, which is not so in the case of the proposals that you are making today for fisheries.
I feel that more needs to be said on the subject of the social objectives, including the danger of consigning the social objectives to European Union policies which are now a basic cause of mistrust and, at worst, rejection, of Europe on the part of the citizens.
The impact of the measures on regions dependant on fisheries has not been taken into sufficient account and the proposals you have laid before us today will have to be reviewed to eliminate this imbalance.
Commissioner, please allow me to be a little forward.
Do you know where Barbate is, or Isla Cristina?
Do you know where Ayamonte, AlmerÃ­a or Motril are?
Do you know anything about Andalusia other than the bitterness of its green olives?
Without wanting to be harsh, Commissioner, you have set a new record in terms of proposals to destroy employment which will be difficult to break.
Have you or anyone from your team considered that your proposals for reforming the CFP only add to the effect of the failure of the disastrous negotiation with Morocco to renew a traditional fisheries agreement that would prevent the destruction of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs?
Commissioner, you globalised fishing in the south of Europe, and ensured that the place occupied by a small-scale fleet, under an agreement between Morocco and the European Union, which respected biological rest periods and maintained very close control of nets and meshes, should now be taken in these fishing grounds by a fleet which does not respect rest periods, and whose nets are not controlled at all.
A proportion of their catches is not landed and they do not generate local employment, as the Community fleet did.
Commissioner, you have presented a proposed CFP which perfectly quantifies the scrappings and the job losses, but leaves it completely unclear what the solutions to alleviating the social and economic problems caused by your proposal are to be.
Do you know where the money we need is going to come from?
The intention is that we now incorporate unemployed fishermen into the tourism sector.
More hotels, more golf courses, Commissioner?
Is this what you call sustainable development?
Is this what diversifying the economies of the regions means?
Do you realise that when you prohibit modernisation you also prohibit the sustainability of fishing, a form of fishing that is more respectful of the environment, of those fishing grounds that fishermen have most interest in respecting?
Through your proposals you are destroying the only fleet that generates employment and also respects the environment; the small-scale fleet.
They also prohibit the creation of mixed undertakings, the only solution which allowed us to resolve the problems resulting from cases such as Morocco.
Although we are going to make the scrap merchants richer, I suppose!
Finally, your proposal will not only affect the traditional employment and culture of peoples you do not know, but it will also considerably increase the cost to consumers of one of the essential ingredients of the Mediterranean diet, a healthy and balanced diet, without cholesterol, which as a result of your proposals we will lose in favour of the junk food which is so popular in the North of Europe.
Commissioner, I really do not envy you. Quite apart from the many compliments and congratulations you have received in this House, I do not envy you because, I regret to say, you have come here today to declare the failure of a policy.
At least from the human point of view, therefore, you have my heartfelt sympathy.
How have you declared the failure of the fisheries policy?
In a nutshell, you said that we had spent money on reducing the fishing effort, and we see that these funds have, in actual fact, served to increase it; you said that we had spent money on preserving fish stocks, and - on the basis of the figures you have disclosed, although we were not able to see them - fish stocks have become completely impoverished; you said we had spent money on limiting the social impact on this sector in terms of employment, and today you have told us that 66 thousand jobs have been lost and 28 thousand are likely to be lost in the future.
Well then, Commissioner, there is one initial question that has, in any case, to be asked: Why, if these were the results - and these results were plain for you to see - has the Commission so persistently defended this common fisheries policy for so long?
This is a very pertinent question.
I realise and I can see from the proposals you have put forward that an attempt is being made to change this approach, but I will not go into details as we are wont to do on specific proposals for there is no time for that now.
I will just make one, very strong recommendation, that I would like the Commission to take into consideration: we must not repeat our past error; we must not see fishermen as the enemies of sustainable development, the enemies of the endeavour to preserve a balance.
They are our main allies, they are your main allies.
If we - if you, first and foremost - do not involve them in defining the goals and managing the rules we set in place, then no goal will be achievable.
Regionalisation is one of the key requirements from this point of view, for our attempt to manage this policy through centralisation has failed.
There is another subject I care deeply about: the Mediterranean.
You have not presented to us today the proposals which had been announced as imminent.
When you do so, I will endeavour to understand the situation and to express my opinion and the opinion of my country on that part of fisheries policy too.
Mr President, I welcome the fact that we have finally begun to discuss the proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy.
I do not like the route we took.
However, there was not much we could do about that.
We have to accept the present common fisheries policy has ended in failure.
We all know that.
We must come to the conclusion, that our responsibility, as Mr Stevenson has said, is to get down to the substance and work with the Commission and the Council to come forward with a policy that hopefully will be infinitely better than the previous one.
I welcome the fact that we are going to give more responsibility to local fishermen closer to the areas in which they work.
I want to see real responsibility, and not a minimal consultation because if that is what we end up with it will not work.
Yes, we all recognise there has to be a reduction in capacity and we must have a sustainable fishing industry and a fishing fleet at the end of all of this.
We must develop a policy that will work.
For years, the UK Government has totally failed fishermen and the fishing industry.
I want the Commissioner to ensure that whatever is brought in is unified throughout the European Union and is financed in a unified way so that no one Member State can pour in more money than another to support their particular industry.
We cannot deal with every point here today.
We might like to do so, but we cannot.
We all recognise that the livelihoods of everyone involved in these industries is at stake and I have no doubt that we will all work to try and resolve that.
Finally, Commissioner, I would like to put the point to you which I put in committee last week.
I asked you to outline the substance of the report that has changed since Mr Smith was dismissed from office.
You agreed that you would inform the Committee on Fisheries.
Will you stand by that and tell us what substantial changes have been made to the report since Mr Smith was dismissed?
Commissioner, you are appearing before the European Parliament with a proposal which demonstrates that the European Commission has failed in relation to managing the common fisheries policy.
It now proposes that this failure should be paid for by the sector, not the whole sector, but rather the fishermen of the Mediterranean countries, who fish for human consumption, not for the manufacture of meal, who have made the greatest sacrifices in recent years by constantly reducing their fleet and who are now bearing the cost of this proposal.
A cost, by the way, which your colleague responsible for the budget wants nothing to do with.
So where are you going to get the EUR 240 million you need to incentivise the scrappings between 2003 and 2006?
Are you going to get them from the Structural Funds?
I would like to remind you of a figure produced by your own services.
Between 1996 and 2000, Spain, for example, was obliged to reduce its fleet by 88 000 tonnes, and during that same period, Denmark, for example, increased its fleet, thanks to Community aid, by 64 000 tonnes.
These figures come from your services.
Do you intend to reassure the sector by saying that the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, after 17 years of waiting, will have access to the fishing grounds of the North Atlantic?
That is guaranteed in the Act of Accession which, so far, the European Commission cannot modify.
The Commissioner mentioned differences within the Commission, which he described as normal; what is not normal is that there should be such a pronounced geographical division between the three institutions.
And since the World Cup is about to start, we could say that the score according to your proposal, Mr Commissioner, is 'the North 1 - the South 0', but we are at the beginning of the match and we hope that you will be a fair and unbiased referee.
That is the important thing.
What are trivial are certain speeches we heard at the beginning of this debate, which put domestic political interests before the future of thousands of families in Galicia or Andalusia, which is quite simply disgraceful, and I regret that the people or person who said that are absent.
There is no institutional crisis here, but a personal crisis, a crisis of attitudes, a crisis which suggests that those who speak in this way will be in opposition for many years, to the benefit of everybody and in particular the fishermen of my country.
Mr President, I rise to make a point of order before Commissioner Fischler replies to this debate.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said he had no faith in my neutrality as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
I strive at all times as chairman of that committee for complete neutrality, but neutrality has to be built on a platform of fair play.
I am sure that everyone in this House believes in equal treatment for all Member States.
If that is an alien concept to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, then I am sorry for him.
I hope the House will support me on that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests, I have listened very attentively to the debate and should like to comment on a number of important points raised, especially where there are obviously still ambiguities.
But before I do, I have a request.
I understand full well that parliamentary debate is rooted in polemics.
But I think that the verbal radicalism of terms such as 'death sentence' and 'execution' do not become this House.
I therefore call on you to bring the debate back to basics, because the problems are big enough, without inflating them artificially.
I think we should keep sight of what Mrs Langenhagen said: we are not moving towards war!
All we want to do is bring about a situation which holds greater promise for the future of our fish stocks and for the future of our fisheries sector than they have experienced over recent years.
And we need to work together on that.
I do not think we should play the old North-South card, Mr Galeote, and say that the score is currently 1 - 0 to the North.
I fail to see that.
If anything, the starting whistle has only just been blown and we should play as a team and be aware of the fact that we have to prevent these traditional standoffs which have often caused difficulties in the past.
Mr Stevenson quoted a number of figures.
You should, in fact, just let the figures speak for themselves and quote figures which are properly backed up.
You can read the real numbers of ships per Member State on page 49 of the resource management regulation, Sir.
I should also like us to clarify exactly what we mean by scientific.
The purpose of science is not to conduct a mammoth project upstream of the reform and then operate reform management; the purpose of science is to accompany fisheries policy.
And that is exactly what our proposals set out to do.
Mr Baron Crespo asked why the fisheries policy is not subject to the same rules as the common agricultural policy.
Unfortunately, he is no longer here, but could someone please tell him that exactly the same rules apply.
The basic principle for the future of both policies is sustainability in all three dimensions and we want to keep it that way.
It is also wrong to say that we no longer care about the safety of fishermen and the safety of boats.
We have made express provision to continue supporting investments in safety equipment on board ships in the future.
There is no change here; on the contrary, we want to put heavier assistance in place.
Then there is the important matter of access to fishing grounds.
There appear to be a number of misunderstandings or perhaps misinterpretations here.
First, the provision which is still contained in the accession agreements of Spain and Portugal is due to run out at the end of this year.
When it does, it will guarantee that these two countries no longer have to accept specific restrictions, can no longer be discriminated against and will have access to fishing grounds.
But do not forget that access to fishing grounds is not the same as access to fish!
When a transitional provision runs out, it means that Community law must be applied without discrimination.
And that is what we shall do, no more no less, because we are obliged to do so.
It needed no special mention in the reform, because it goes without saying. But we mentioned it nonetheless, just to be clear.
A further difficulty is that the impression appears to have been created that we want to use our new fleet policy to punish countries which voluntarily did more in the past than they were required to.
First, we must not forget that our fleet in Europe is too big and anyone who disputes that is burying their head in the sand.
Secondly, there are sanctions for anyone who fails to comply with the requirements already in force and the law now in force.
They are expressly provided for in the proposals.
For example, their fisheries effort will be reduced.
Countries which have voluntarily done more are at a huge advantage under the new system, because the fisheries effort allocated to the individual Member States in the future can then be allocated to the fleet in a way which makes greater economic sense and will not result in any one particular ship being given enough days at sea to be able to fish sensibly.
That is the main difference, which is why it really has paid off for Member States who have not just complied with the requirements of the current law but have even gone beyond them.
I have no wish to comment further on the calls in various guises for fisheries policy to be renationalised.
If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, then go ahead, but I cannot see that this will get us anywhere worth talking of.
We need a common fisheries policy, one policy for all the Member States.
Another subject which appears to keep making everyone hot under the collar is industrial fisheries.
It is true that important quantities of fish meal will continue to be produced, but not least so that it can be used as fish food on fish farms.
In other words, without fish meal there can be practically no aquaculture and we should not forget that.
Secondly, industrial fisheries concentrate on species which are of no nutritional value to human beings, meaning there is no competition between industrial fisheries and fisheries for human consumption.
Naturally, industrial fisheries will be subject to the same restrictions and the same standards as any other type of fisheries.
We really cannot be accused of failing to thoroughly investigate the situation and the development problems of regions which are highly dependent on fisheries in the run up to this reform.
We carried out 22 studies on these regions.
The results are posted on the Internet for you to read any time you want.
They have been for the last year.
Then there is the question of people getting the impression that we are introducing a sort of scrapping reform.
Let us not get carried away here!
Our proposals will probably reduce the fleet by 10%.
One tenth!
So there is no point in carrying on as if every ship were going to disappear!
Nevertheless, we have changed one thing and that is that we are implementing these measures in a socially responsible manner by flanking this well-needed reduction with proper social measures.
So if you want to accuse us of anything, it should be for our current, not our future policy!
Another point is the debate on artisanal fisheries and fisheries which use very large, very efficient ships.
I really do feel - and I have said as much in the Commission - that we need to take proper account of this difference when we implement the policy.
We must also safeguard some sort of future for artisanal fisheries.
If you ask me what Director-General Smidt's departure has changed in the proposals, your question is wrong on two counts.
First, Mr Smidt has not departed; he is still the Director-General of the Fisheries DG.
Secondly, I can say with a certain degree of pride that the proposals have not substantially changed or been changed.
Finally, Mr Galeote asked where the money will come from for the reform.
As I said, some of the money will come from rethinking whether our structural programme for the fisheries sector, as it now stands, is the right programme and from reprogramming.
