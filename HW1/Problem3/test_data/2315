None of this is mentioned in the report, and I understand the difficulty, but I also fear that our reticence will not help the groups of women in those countries who, unaided, are courageously starting to raise the issue of separating religious and political authority.
The most important laws on women are those making up what is known as civil law.
Well then, all those laws which codify - and I repeat - codify discrimination against women are, albeit in different forms - directly applying the interpretation of the Koran.
There are women there fighting for the separation of powers, there are women fighting for the Koran to be brought up to date.
None of this features at all in the report, where the effects are listed but the cause is not addressed.
I regret this, for I feel that we are lagging behind them.
I would like to add my voice to those of my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her report.
Certainly, listening to Mrs Bonino, we cannot deny the truth of what she has said. The two minutes' speaking time restriction undoubtedly prevented her from going into more detail.
This is an important issue which must certainly be dealt with using a different approach from the one adopted in the recent report, which focused on 'women and fundamentalism' .
If we take that approach, we will not be enabling either the women or ourselves to make any useful contribution to the growth - the cultural as well as economic growth - of these countries, and we will not be enabling these peoples as a whole to escape from a cultural and religious situation in which the human and civil rights of people in general and women in particular are being trampled underfoot.
I therefore feel that the issue must be addressed from the perspective outlined by Mrs Bonino, for the matter has hitherto been little debated in Parliament.
However, with regard to this report, as it stands, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and make two recommendations to the Commission and the Council. They are contained in the text before us but I would just like to emphasise them.
The first is that the presence of women at all levels of social, economic, financial and political life in conditions of equality, not least as regards decision-making, is a prerequisite for democracy and therefore for peace and well-being.
In everything the Union does to pursue these objectives, it must ensure that the programmes we have already implemented or are currently implementing are totally inflexible in terms of respect for the protection of rights, and that none of the work carried out by the Council towards partnerships and cooperation ever fails to take into consideration the need for these rights to be respected.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her sound analysis and for her excellent collaboration in the drafting of this report.
I think we can refer back to the Beijing World Conference of Women, where, too, steps were taken towards women's empowerment and capacity building, and the MEDA programme actually provided us with the right instruments.
I must say, though, that we lack the statistical data to carry out a more exact and more precise analysis.
For example, the data is not in the report on the programme, and no yardstick has as yet been laid down against which progress can be measured.
Why was it that MEDA I and II included not even one regional programme exclusively devoted to women?
Why is the democratic clause not applied with greater thoroughness where there is flagrant violation of women's rights, as with genital mutilation, for example?
The Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco Report gives important pointers to that.
Why is fundamentalism not addressed in greater detail?
I ask the women from the other groups, though, to pluck up the courage to introduce these issues into the Plenary rather than having their treatment obstructed in the Bureau.
I ask myself why women are barred from education in many countries.
It is a destructive tendency.
Particularly in rural areas, up to 60% of women are excluded from education, even from being taught about reproductive health.
Why, for example, do our Member States, when dealing with immigration and asylum, not show a very emphatic red card to the illegal trade in human beings?
In the Member State from which I come, for example, the recognition of gender-specific persecution or any persecution that is not carried out by the State as grounds for asylum is currently being made into an electoral issue, and the good starts we have made in our immigration law therefore end up being put out of the reach of women in the Mediterranean.
I think this is an area where women like us need to work together even more.
With this report, we are setting a good example.
Not only do we need more women performing social functions here, we also need them in our partner countries, and I emphasise again that the European Union must focus its instruments of cooperation even more intensely on women, so that it is to the advantage of us all that we, with the help of the democracy programme, empower women and open up dialogue.
First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her excellent work.
This report reminds us how important it is for the European Union to promote the role of women in economic and social life, both by means of Community policies and in the context of cooperation with third countries and the Mediterranean countries.
I would simply like to add a few words on the current situation, which is impeccably described in this report.
Although circumstances have improved for women in some Mediterranean countries, there is still a long way to go, in particular as regards access to education, vocational training and the labour market, but also in social matters, with regard to single and divorced women, single mothers and women in rural areas.
The European Union should draw attention to any progress that is made and lend its support should the opportunity arise.
The European Union must also ensure that the good intentions stated during discussions on partnership or association agreements are in fact followed by practical measures, with a view to increasing social cohesion.
However, there is still much progress to be made.
The promotion of gender equality in the Mediterranean countries is hindered by a number of obstacles such as the influence of cultural and religious traditions and the lack of social and legal structures.
At a time when some of these countries are undergoing significant economic expansion, the integration of gender equality into all policies and, in particular, policies concerning access to training and the labour market, must be promoted, as women can only have access to positions of political, economic or social responsibility if specific measures are implemented with regard to training, backed up by appropriate social measures such as, for example, the establishment of childcare structures.
The Spanish Presidency has reiterated its strong interest in developing programmes such as MEDA and in partnerships between these countries and the European Union. This is an ideal opportunity to encourage our current and future partners to promote women' s economic, social and civil rights in order to create an active society involving both men and women, which, I hope, will enable an area of peace, security and prosperity to be created in the medium term.
Mr President, I wish to offer Mrs Kratsa my warmest congratulations, both on her initiative in drafting this report and on the report itself and the clear policy proposals contained in it.
This report will be a huge help to the women of the Mediterranean who, despite some improvement in their situation over recent years, still suffer sexual discrimination and inequality.
Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical care and little involvement in professional and political life are the main aspects of life for women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin.
However, what is worse, and here I agree completely with Mrs Bonino, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, of ultra-conservatism and of autocratic regimes who hang on to their power by controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even their mode of dress.
Without doubt, irrationalism and fanaticism are the main obstacles both to the emancipation of women and to social and economic progress in general in these countries.
Obviously, the best defence against the powers of irrationalism and fanaticism is to strengthen the worldly aspects of the state and legal democratic order.
We must send out a clear message.
No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the Rule of Law.
As long as these basic aspects of a democratic state are lacking in numerous countries around the Mediterranean, there will only ever be a faint glimmer of hope of any improvement in the position of women and the resolutions passed and conferences held within the context of the Barcelona process will be meaningless.
That is why we are calling on the European Commission to use every means at its disposal, especially when negotiating association agreements, to include clear-cut clauses and commitments protecting women's rights and the principles of the Rule of Law and recognising them as the sine qua non to social development in the countries of the Mediterranean and the promotion of the Mediterranean basin as an area of peace and cooperation.
Mr President, I wish to make four points in connection with this report. Firstly, I feel that the fact that this report has been produced is a very positive thing.
I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts.
Secondly, I take the view that Mrs Bonino's reflections are something we should all share.
What is lacking in the report is precisely the principal cause underlying the facts of this situation, which was analysed in the report, in part unsparingly; the cause of it, though, is not there.
Thirdly, it appears to me that we are, from the point of view of consistency, far too amicable, far too calm, far too balanced.
Appeals are made, recommendations are made, requests are made, things are emphasised, but, in my view, far too little is demanded.
I believe we must in future exert much more pressure on this issue.
We must exert massive pressure on these countries and the societies in them, even with the suggestion of sanctions - and I do know that the word is not quite the right one.
That means that we must convince them and give them to understand, that the failure to positively influence the placing of women on an equal footing in these countries will have consequences.
Fourthly - and here I pick up on one of the Liberal Mrs DybkjÃŠr's ideas - this is very much an issue for men too.
I am a bit of a black swan here today, but I hope that those men who are not here today will, when the vote is taken, do the right thing and advance the policy of this report a few steps further - and I hope that they will also do so in future.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities because not only is this a report of substance, it also puts the question of women's rights straight back on the Euro-Mediterranean agenda.
The Barcelona process is basically a means for dialogue between the Community and the countries of the Mediterranean.
Needless to say, this dialogue cannot simply be based either on the principles of the European Union or on the principles underpinning the regimes in these countries.
It has to be based on international law, human rights conventions, the Beijing declaration, which these countries have signed - all the international texts and conventions which place women's rights at the heart of human rights, bringing us back to the question of the gender dimension of foreign policy.
Because the Barcelona process is one of the ways used to develop the European Union's foreign policy.
I should like to inform the House that the Commission has already taken an initiative to adopt a text of recommendations and principles in the hope that it will be accepted by the foreign ministers and will govern every contract and agreement between the European Union and third countries as regards women's rights and the gender dimension of foreign policy.
The Commissioner responsible for foreign policy issues and I have already held initial talks.
The first conference of international experts on the matter has been organised and will be held some time in April.
Our aim is to have an established programme of recommendations and agreements in principle at political level by 2003.
Of course, we shall be holding separate discussions on this with the Committee on Women's Rights, I imagine very soon, once we have the full programme and timetable, so that we can discuss a specific text with the parliamentary committee.
The financial tools for the Barcelona process are ÃEDA I and ÃÃDA II.
But, as you rightly said, we have no reason to be especially proud of the results of ÃEDA I as far as the social sector and women's issues and rights are concerned.
The difficulties are caused, in large part, by our inability to close the gap between administrative systems and, in even larger part, by differences in principle.
The objective of the ÃEDA IÃ programme is to create a free trade zone between Europe and the Mediterranean countries in the long term, by 2010 and, within it, to implement programmes which will help these countries develop economically, along with social and economic measures to support this economic development.
And, at the heart of these measures, there must be measures for women and for involving women in education, the job market and social and economic life.
It is the Commission's job, following the forum held during the Belgian presidency, to prepare a specific regional programme during 2002 containing measures on the job market, women's networks and easier access for women to financing by developing initiatives which also relate to training.
This report will provide a great deal of input into the final programme which the Commission presents but, in closing, I must stress that I believe that any regional programme, irrespective of how much funding it has, if it is not applied within the framework of international agreements - I repeat this because the approach on the European side is often considered paternalistic - so I repeat that this programme will only succeed and bring in the results we all hope for if it is applied within the framework of international agreements, the Beijing declaration on respect for human rights and respect for women's rights.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Illiteracy and social exclusion
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0009/2002) by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on illiteracy and social exclusion (2001/2340(INI)).
Mr President, almost two years ago, we adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The right to knowledge and, consequently, the right to know how to read, write and count are part of this Charter.
Consequently, the opportunity to learn how to read and write should be available to all as a fundamental right, and parents, teachers and politicians should recognise their obligation to ensure that this opportunity is grasped by all, in particular because, when people cannot express themselves with words, they often do so with their fists, as they feel excluded from school, business or even their own family.
This right to knowledge is not currently realised, however, as 10 to 20% of the population of the European Union, or as many as 30 % if we count the candidate countries, are considered to be illiterate: 45% in Portugal, 35% in Italy, 22% in Ireland and Great Britain, 15% in Germany and France and, to add the candidate countries: 42% in Slovenia and Poland, 33% in Hungary, 29% in Bulgaria and 20% in Lithuania.
Illiteracy increases the divide between privileged members of society who are in a situation of relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to the labour market and consequently suffer financial insecurity, psychological isolation and social exclusion.
From an economic perspective, we all know that illiteracy also affects our businesses and their modernisation: it leads to increases in costs relating to the accident rate, employers' contributions and time taken to complete work because of the need for additional supervision.
However, although the European Commission and our institutions have produced a number of documents, there are still a number of obstacles: gaps due to a lack of reliable data, the lack of clarity of certain programmes proposed and policies which are still insufficiently integrated.
This matter, which I consider to be serious, Commissioner, should also be addressed through integrated policies associating social, and cultural and educational objectives, and should be discussed at policy level to increase awareness of this phenomenon.
It is with this in mind that I call on the Commission to submit to Parliament and the Council a Green Paper on Illiteracy, together with a timetable for achieving tangible objectives along the lines of the social agenda, precisely defining the measures to be taken at European level.
In the same vein, I call on the Commission, in connection with the employment guidelines, to propose specific indicators and benchmarks relating to illiteracy, in close cooperation with the social players.
I also ask the Commission to submit to Parliament, each year, a written report, incorporating statistical data, on progress towards the objectives of combating illiteracy and social exclusion.
We should all be aware that this matter is a key issue for development and for harmony in our societies.
We are not always aware of this, which is why I would also like us to be able to set up, not another observatory but, within the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, based at Thessaloniki, a sort of European illiteracy monitoring centre, as suggested by my group, specifically by submitting Amendment No 5.
Lastly, I would like to say, with regard to the amendments tabled recently, in particular by the Group of the Greens, that I am in favour of Amendment No 4 and that I would have been in favour of Amendment No 2 had it been considered as an additional item.
As for Amendment No 3, even though I am not against it in principle - the amendment requesting a Green Paper on illiteracy and mathematical illiteracy - I call for a vote against it because I think that, in the wording "Green Paper on Illiteracy" , the problem of mathematical illiteracy is obviously included.
Lastly, I cannot accept Amendment No 1.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those were the points I wanted to mention.
Mr President, my compliments, in particular, to Mrs Hermange for her initiative in taking up one of the elements of the new strategy on combating social exclusion and poverty such as illiteracy, which I feel is a genuine barrier to the exercising of fundamental human rights, the rights of all citizens.
The idea that functional illiteracy affects over 10% of the European Union' s population is horrifying, to say the least, in a developed society in which Europe is pursuing ambitious goals such as those set by the Lisbon Council: firstly, the need for every citizen to have the necessary skills to be able to live and work in the new information society; and secondly, to make Europe the most competitive, dynamic economy in the world.
I feel that we must approach the debate on illiteracy, or rather the problem itself, with great vigour, taking this approach and with these goals before us.
The resolution focuses on certain points which I would like to mention briefly: firstly, knowing how to read and write is a fundamental right which must be guaranteed to all people; secondly, combating illiteracy is essential because it secures and strengthens the freedom of the individual; thirdly, the task of combating this disturbing situation must be undertaken by society as a whole and by public authorities and administrations in particular; fourthly, 'returning' illiteracy, which particularly affects elderly people, especially those in danger of social exclusion - who, as they lose their self-sufficiency, are obliged to live in sheltered accommodation, leaving their family and socio-cultural environment behind them for good - is a scourge which must be combated.
Therefore, governments should promote an incisive initiative through Community programmes, while it is up to you, Commissioner - and, as we know, you are very aware of the problem - to honour the undertaking to address this issue.
Mr President, I would like to begin with a phrase from the rapporteur' s explanatory statement in which she clearly states that extreme poverty and social exclusion must be considered to be a violation of human rights and illiteracy an intolerable violation of those same rights.
Furthermore, we must remember that, as she herself has said, between 10 and 20% of the European population is functionally illiterate.
The situation of these people severely restricts their ability to find decent work and to integrate themselves into the society in which they live.
They also have difficulties in reading some of the official documents which we regularly present.
This situation really contributes to the fact that, in a prosperous continent such as Europe, between 18 and 20% of people live in poverty, if we consider that they are below 60% of the average in their country of origin.
This is an intolerable situation.
The rapporteur proposes a series of objectives which we agree with and which must be taken into account in future decisions.
Firstly, a definition of the different forms of illiteracy - which we still do not have - with common criteria and mechanisms.
Secondly, common action against the situation of functional illiteracy, with an open method of cooperation between the various countries.
This fight against illiteracy must be incorporated into other Union policies and must be taken into account whenever we talk about education and training.
There must be a timetable for specific achievements, and Parliament must take account of the progress made, as the rapporteur has said.
The matter must be integrated into equal opportunities policy.
We have just discussed another report which speaks about this and we are perfectly aware that illiteracy figures in all countries are always higher amongst women.
And finally, there must be participation by social agents and the sectors involved.
This participation is crucial.
In previous programmes to combat poverty, as you will recall, there were concrete projects which spoke of the crucial importance of participation by all the sectors involved.
Mr President, Commissioner, I must congratulate Mrs Hermange on her initiative on this report on illiteracy, since it is a problem which we do not normally pay much attention to, because we think we have achieved total literacy, since the majority of Member States of the European Union have made enormous efforts over recent years to achieve this objective and we thought we had done so.
However, there are increasingly pockets of marginalisation in the cities, there is an immigrant population establishing itself in our cities and that means that the problem of illiteracy, and particularly functional illiteracy, is a really serious problem today, because it is always linked to poverty, to marginalisation and to social exclusion.
As defenders of human rights - and this is one of the most fundamental rights, as has been pointed out here - we have an obligation to draw attention to this matter so that programmes are set up to resolve the problem.
The worst affected are the young people who come from these sections of the population, who do not have employment opportunities, or in some cases find insecure jobs, without any opportunity to improve their working conditions.
Since the Lisbon Summit, becoming the most competitive information society in the world has been one of our objectives.
If the information society is fundamental to work in the future, these young people who can hardly find work under normal conditions, will not have any opportunity unless we integrate them into this information and knowledge society.
It is therefore urgent to carry out programmes and actions by means of the Green Paper which the rapporteur is requesting, so that these sections of the population, which are increasing with the immigration of recent years, are offered a solution to this fundamental problem, so that they can access other systems of personal welfare.
We always focus on health, housing and employment, but this is a fundamental problem and resolving it should be a priority.
I once again congratulate the rapporteur on this wonderful initiative, which draws attention to a problem that is still facing us.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, on her presentation of this report to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and on her extremely detailed work.
We know that Europe is one of the most prosperous continents in the world but, despite that, a substantial number of our citizens live in conditions of extreme poverty and social marginalisation.
One of the parameters for measuring these conditions, in addition to income, is, without a doubt, illiteracy, for illiteracy is a cause of exclusion and prevents access to human rights, as the rapporteur rightly said in her report.
Illiteracy, understood to mean either a lack of basic education or 'returning' illiteracy, is causing an increasing divide between those who are privileged and enjoy relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to work, who are in danger of isolation and do not participate in social life.
Illiteracy also represents an expense, a cost both for businesses and in social terms, as well as a cause of exclusion.
It is an ongoing problem in Europe, although it is not thought of as a cost, but there are no reliable data available for analysis.
Combating illiteracy and social marginalisation is now essentially the responsibility of the Member States, but at the Lisbon Summit - as has already been said - the Heads of State and Government set themselves the goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, etc, etc.
Moreover, the European Social Agenda was adopted at Nice.
Therefore, combating illiteracy and marginalisation must become one of the priorities of the Union and the Member States, with all the relevant policies applied in the context of a global, integrated strategy.
We therefore firmly support the rapporteur' s calls for a Green Paper and an Action Plan. I will not go into their contents because they are already outlined in the report.
However, we do call strongly upon the Commission to promote these texts: Parliament will support them and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission to ensure the Council endorses them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is scarcely credible that between 10% and 20% of people in the European Union are unable to understand printed matter and documents and make use of them.
Even I will readily concede that I am not in a position to fill in my German tax return forms without expert help, let alone actually fill in an application form for a project promoted by Europe.
It is, though, surely not this sort of documents to which this report refers.
People who have difficulty with reading and writing are restricted in their ability to participate in the life of society, and, when it comes to earning a living, are relegated to work for which minimal qualifications are required and which is therefore badly paid.
On economic, but above all on ethical and moral grounds, it is our duty to preserve people from this fate in this century of the information society and of lifelong learning.
Parliament is therefore doing the right thing with this report by describing a problem which is often shamefacedly hushed up, and offering solutions to it.
That has been done in this report as thoroughly as necessary and as briefly as possible, by the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange.
European legislation, though, is limited in this task to measures of development and support, as general and vocational education falls within the remit of the Member States, and that is where it should stay.
The Member States' sole duty is to make real the right to education which is now also enshrined in Article 14 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The work of the monitoring centre which the report calls for should be carried on in the already-existing Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki, using the resources available there.
That makes sense in view of the costs involved and of the relevance to the functions Cedefop performs in any case, and so I ask you to support our Amendment No 5.
I would also subscribe to and support a European Year devoted to books and to reading, in view of our young people's widespread mania for television.
Mr President, Commissioner, this own-initiative report, which we should welcome, concerning the specific subject of illiteracy sheds light on two particular approaches recently implemented by the European Union in adopting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on the one hand and the action programme combating social exclusion on the other.
As Marie-ThÃ©rÃšse Hermange, our rapporteur, reminded us, the right of each individual to know how to read, write and count is the practical basis that enables these individuals to exercise their rights as citizens.
This right must be guaranteed by practical measures wherever the scourge of illiteracy is present; it is therefore enlightening to be reminded of the figures.
In practical terms, I believe it must be possible to develop these actions in two directions.
We need to make the connection between illiteracy and unemployment, on the one hand - for example there are the proposed actions targeting illiteracy in the workplace - in order to ensure the coherent implementation of the decisions made in Lisbon, and between illiteracy and social inclusion on the other.
We should devise actions for social inclusion that are independent of the professional situation of the people concerned, and I am thinking of women in particular.
I believe the case of migrant women must be considered in this respect.
The report also calls for the creation of a monitoring centre, and I think it is realistic to plan this within an existing tool, Cedefop, since compatible indicators and benchmarks between Member States are the basis of any coherent Community policy.
In conclusion, I believe that this report must be seen as a tool to facilitate the drawing-up of a measure involving local, national and Community levels, each with their own specific responsibilities.
Today, the handling of these issues requires Community initiatives and the impetus to encourage the Member States to make decisions that are essential for their people.
I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Hermange on this important document, which I support, and to wish Commissioner Diamantopoulou every success in her work. This is the first time I have had the pleasure of seeing her this year and I am sure she will be just as successful in her work in the second part of the legislature as she was during the first two and a half years.
I feel that this document is extremely important, and it is crucial that Mrs Hermange has stressed that illiteracy does not just mean not knowing how to read and write, but not understanding discussions and being unable to move about in modern society, where it is not enough to know how to read and write but where a certain culture and savoir-faire are necessary for a person to have any status.
In some States of the European Union, this form of illiteracy is as high as 30 to 35%.
I would therefore stress the importance of resolving this issue.
There is another Commission document on the issue, which has been referred to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - on that famous subject 'lifelong learning' - but this is a question of learning not the languages of other States but our own.
Well then, I am concerned by what happens as a result of this kind of illiteracy during elections.
Voters who are illiterate in this way do not know what or whom they are voting for when they go to the ballots and they do not understand the programmes.
This means that democracy is diminished.
Pensioners, I must say, know exactly which way to vote when they go to the ballots, but we must be sure that everyone understands why and for whom they are voting.
Mr President, as others have also said, this is an incredibly important report.
The nightmare scenario for the future is that society will be divided into two groups: the initiated, who know everything and are plugged into the knowledge society, and those who have been left behind and will therefore be marginalised in society.
Nor is there any doubt that this is a European issue, which is why I also sincerely support what the rapporteur has said about open coordination being the best method of achieving progress in this area.
The only way is to make it genuinely very embarrassing for the Member States if they do not do something in this area, and for the status of their efforts to be made as public as possible.
We must proceed with the proposal on lifelong learning as quickly as possible, and I naturally hope that the Commission will include the views adopted by Parliament today in the proposal on lifelong learning, for that is where they in fact belong. I also think that we must endeavour to get some new thinking into this area.
We must bear in mind that, if adults are to learn about a subject, going back to school is not an option.
Instead, they have to learn in some other way. They have to learn in the context of the labour market; they have to have time off work to be able to go to classes; and they have to learn through the process of schools and teaching coming out to the workplace.
I believe it is very important to establish the connection between work and learning so that we can continue with lifelong learning.
The last thing I want to say concerns an idea for the Commissioner that could perhaps be taken further and might also put pressure on the Member States to demonstrate that they are doing something in this area. It is the possibility of introducing 'knowledge accounts' for the individual Member States through which the latter would simply report each year on how much they had done in the area of lifelong learning to combat illiteracy and promote knowledge and education in general.
'Knowledge accounts' are a good idea, Commissioner, which I hope you will consider.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wholeheartedly concur with the Lisbon objectives.
I consider it a thoroughly positive thing that we live in a performance-oriented society, one which wants to become the most competitive, the most dynamic and also the most reliant on knowledge.
That being so, it is of course quite deplorable that we see society actually disintegrating and that we have in our society a new grouping which is weak in social and educational terms.
In view of this, I support the report and am of the opinion that there is a need to address these documents that have been mentioned several times today in the context of the Green Paper and that the amendment on the monitoring centre tabled by Mr Pronk and Mrs Stauner should be adopted.
I wish to address a second aspect of this topic, the issue of to what extent it is possible to compensate for differences between the various Member States in education, training, schooling, and the current state of knowledge.
The idea of States retaining their own competences in this area is, after all, pretty obsolete.
This is where we should be reorienting ourselves and also accepting a degree of harmonisation, even if that were to lead to substantial restructuring in certain countries.
It is not fair to tell the citizens of this EU of ours that there is freedom of movement and of establishment when differing school systems and recognition of training standards mean that there are significant differences, and therefore discrimination, when it comes to actually putting it into practice.
We should, for this reason, be taking this report as an opportunity to take steps towards harmonisation in the cultural sphere.
Mr President, today's report on illiteracy is a very important contribution to the wider issue at European level, i.e. our review of the basic skills of literacy and a working knowledge of arithmetic as prerequisites to social integration, as prerequisites to the European Union's achieving the Lisbon objective of a knowledge-based economy.
We have, without doubt, entered a new stage, in which basic skills do not stop at reading and writing and now include IT skills, high-tech skills, entrepreneurship, foreign languages, interpersonal communication skills and social skills.
All this can be summed up nowadays in four simple words: the need to learn.
The Commission's policy in this sector will be expressed in a series of initiatives and programmes which are currently in the pipeline as a result of cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
My first point is that the Lisbon Council in 2000 called for the Commission to draft a report on the specific future objectives of education and training systems.
This report was presented in Stockholm and we are currently preparing a programme of work on the subject of the universal acquisition of basic skills, which will be presented in Barcelona.
The acquisition of basic skills is one of the 13 basic objectives for the education and training systems of the European Union.
This objective includes defining indicators to measure over a ten-year period the extent to which Member States ensure that all their citizens acquire a working knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic.
This is the first specific indicator which will reflect developments in this sector over a ten-year period.
Secondly, I should like to remind the House of the communication which the Commission published in November 2001 on creating a European area of lifelong learning, which stresses that lifelong learning depends on acquiring basic skills.
Thirdly, I should like to mention the forthcoming action plan on skills and mobility in the European Union which the Commission, by which I mean President Prodi and I, are due to announce next week, the aim of which is to achieve a real European job market based on mobility and a minimum level of common skills at European level.
My fourth point concerns the Community strategy on combating social exclusion.
As you know, the bottom line in the national actions plans of most countries is that there is a direct link between social exclusion and the acquisition of basic skills.
And both the Equal programme and the Social Fund make provision for funding for individual programmes relating to access to basic skills, especially by groups subject to discrimination.
And we must not forget that certain groups, such as people with disabilities and immigrants, must overcome even greater problems in order to acquire basic skills.
My fifth point concerns cooperation at international level, in other words, our international strategy.
The European Commission is working with the OECD, ÃSÃÃ and G8 to support direct action to get basic skills put on the corresponding agendas.
Which brings me to the report and, more specifically, to the application of the open method of coordination. As I mentioned in relation to the strategy on exclusion, we can take it as given that the Council of education ministers will approve the open method of coordination on common objectives for education and training systems next week.
As far as the Green Paper is concerned, I must express a certain reticence, mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started, important matters are in the pipeline in various Councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy; it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the Green Paper, given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years.
Which brings me to the recommendation to Member States on reading and writing lessons and access to basic skills.
I must stress here that we need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and take particular care in our approach to education, which is a strictly national matter.
The open method of cooperation is an excellent tool, giving the Member States added value in the form of indicators and exchanges of best practices.
On the question of a European illiteracy monitoring centre, I have taken note of the proposal by the Members of Parliament on the need to use existing institutions, such as Cedefop, and I would remind the House that there are already a number of programmes, such as the OECD Pisa programme, which provide some initial answers.
Before creating new tools, we need to be sure that we are making efficient use of tools which already exist.
Finally, as far as the proposal for an annual report on illiteracy to Parliament is concerned, we want to look at the most efficient way of informing Parliament and what use Parliament can make of reports on national action plans on social integration and reports via the open method of coordination, i.e. how existing means, reports which are drafted every year anyway, how this dimension can be used so that the information provided is exponential and more efficient.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.
Social policy agenda
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2002) by Mrs Hermange on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda (COM(2001)104 - C5-0536/2001 - 2001/2215(COS)).
Mr President, it is unusual to speak twice in a row in the same day.
I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your comments and suggestions, which we will have to discuss.
Commissioner, we have greatly criticised the Nice Summit, yet it has provided you with a valuable instrument: the Social Agenda, which was drawn up with the objective of making the European Union the world' s most competitive economy, as decided at the Lisbon Summit.
As we all know that there is no openness between European, national and local partners, this agenda raises the issue of responsibility and attribution of powers of all those playing a part in its implementation.
It is in its dual role of ensuring openness and acting as a social instrument that the Social Agenda is a key component of economic and social modernisation, as its implementation will, in the long term, be decisive for achieving the strategic objectives laid down by the Lisbon European Council.
We are sure of this, even if it is not currently given much consideration.
That, Commissioner, is why Parliament and its Committee on Employment and Social Affairs deeply regretted not having been able to consider the Social Agenda prior to the Stockholm European Council.
We therefore ask that Parliament be involved in the implementation of the adjustment of the Social Agenda, as well as all the social partners, and we insist that, from now on, the scoreboard make clearer the various responsibilities of the parties involved.
We also call on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requests we have made: to define an appropriate legal basis for the development of civil dialogue; to provide a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy; to integrate the social dimension into competition policy; to submit a directive on social security cover for new forms of employment; to reinforce the action programme and instruments against poverty and social exclusion and submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/85/EC on introducing measures to help improve the health and safety of female workers; and to launch an initiative aimed at better guaranteeing the social quality of work.
You will also understand, Commissioner, that we are calling on you to speed up a number of operations: in particular to submit a proposal for a review of the enterprise committee directive as soon as possible so that the legislative procedure can be concluded as intended, to submit to Parliament a memorandum on policy in the area of health and safety at work that could serve as a consultation document, to conduct in-depth examination and assessment of the impact of the Luxembourg process, and, lastly, to propose activities to mark the European year of the disabled.
Commissioner, we are convinced that this scoreboard should not be confined to setting out actions implemented by the Commission but should eventually become a strategic instrument by means of which the agenda' s implementation can be supervised, and where need be adjusted.
We are also convinced that partnerships should be strengthened in all the actions taken in this area.
Commissioner, Nice has provided you with a valuable tool.
You therefore have a valuable role to play in making social policy more transparent.
Take this opportunity to transform this Europe of commodities into a people' s Europe, in the knowledge that Parliament will be right behind you.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on the extreme care and sensitivity with which she has drafted this report on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I agree with her that the table of results of the Social Agenda should include all planned activities and the division of responsibilities and should be submitted to the European Parliament within a reasonable period of time so that Parliament can study and give an opinion on it.
The European Parliament has supported the Commission proposal on a cohesive policy framework for social development right from the start, although it did point out that the updated European standard which was the whole purpose of the Social Agenda should serve the values of solidarity and justice underlying the European structure better and more efficiently, given that these values are currently under attack.
In order to promote these values, the European Parliament stresses in its resolution that we also need to promote the full participation of women in economic and social life.
The European Parliament also stresses in its resolution that the gender dimension needs to be included in all sectors covered by the Social Agenda and monitored in regular reports.
We need a proposal to amend the directive on the safety and health of pregnant and breastfeeding workers, i.e. directive 92/85.
We need to highlight the fact that the social partners have a responsibility to put the principles of equal pay and equal opportunities into practice.
We need to take an initiative to improve working hours and strike a better balance between work and home, we need a more substantial take on sexual equality in all pre-accession negotiations and we need to promote dialogue with women's organisations in candidate countries.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights for the Social Agenda, I should like to ask the Commission to tell the European Parliament how it intends to follow up these issues and if it intends to present a proposal for a directive on equal treatment in sectors other than the employment sector.
Finally, the European Parliament has highlighted the need to make it easier for social agencies to take part and I should like to ask what initiatives you intend to take to increase the participation of women's organisations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should obviously, first and foremost, like to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for her excellent cooperation.
The result is there for everyone to see.
This report is based on a very broad consensus, for not one single amendment has been tabled.
However, I should also like to say that, with this report, the European Parliament actually falls between two stools.
On the one hand, it is a fact that the scoreboard which we are discussing has actually been outdated for a long time.
On the other hand, the new scoreboard has not yet been finally rubberstamped by the European Commission, despite the fact that, in Stockholm, we were assured that this scoreboard, together with the summary report for Barcelona, would be before us by no later than January.
I should, at any rate, like to thank the Commissioner for the opportunity we have had, together with the coordinators, of obtaining current information about the Commission' s intentions, and of making our concerns known regarding the state of implementation of the Social Agenda.
Commissioner, in my view, we should make this sound initiative an integral part of the procedure in order to guarantee Parliament' s involvement during the implementation of the Social Agenda.
I should therefore like to afford this debate a little more topical value by seizing the opportunity urgently to call upon you, Commissioner, but especially - and I am stressing this - the entire board of Commissioners, to implement the ambitions of the Social Agenda and the pledges made during the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies down to the last detail and according to the time schedule.
After all, Commissioner, there are quite a few reasons why we are concerned.
It is, of course, the case that 2001 has produced some welcome results, but it is vital to keep this momentum going and, for this, we need a new and better scoreboard, which clearly indicates the responsibilities with the attendant expiry dates.
I will give you a few reasons why we are concerned.
First of all, the role of the social partners in relation to labour organisation and lifelong learning is crucial if the Social Agenda is to be implemented , and I hope that their contribution to Barcelona will be considerable.
But where consultation fails, the legislator needs to step in, and this is currently the case with temporary agency work, in connection with which we have long been waiting impatiently for a Commission proposal.
Secondly, following the successful completion of the directive on worker participation in the framework of the European Company and the directive on the information and consultation of workers, nothing now stands in the way of a review of the enterprise committee directive.
This also applies to the action plan to improve health and safety which Mrs Hermange introduced a moment ago.
According to the Social Agenda, the initiatives should have been before us at the end of 2001/beginning of 2002, but, Commissioner, there is no trace of these in the operational programme of the Commission.
I am also picking up signals that there is quite a bit of resistance in the Commission.
I should therefore like to say one thing in conclusion, Mr President.
I should like you, Commissioner, to pass on these words to the College of Commissioners: pacta sunt servanda [Treaties should be respected].
This Parliament will never accept the Social Agenda being shelved, and I hope that you will be able to use the support of this Parliament in the College of Commissioners.
Mr President, the ELDR Group would like most sincerely to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her report and on the unanimity that it achieved in committee.
That said, it is only fair to give notice to the House that we may find ourselves less able to form part of a consensus when the Commission brings forward some of the proposals referred to in paragraph 14.
In some cases it will depend on the form of the proposals, given our commitment to subsidiarity; in others, it will depend on their exact content.
I would, for example, express my own concerns in both respects over the second indent of the paragraph and any proposals for providing a tax and legislative framework for the development of the social economy, the third sector.
Many voluntary organisations have already expressed their worries to me that such a measure, unless we get it exactly right, could well prove more of a hindrance than a help to their activities.
This is just one of the reasons why I would like to give wholehearted support to the first indent of paragraph 14.
Knowing how much volunteers contribute to our well-being, I sometimes wonder just how much of a society we would have without their efforts.
We urgently need a proper legal base for the civil dialogue.
Without one, we will find it much more difficult to do what the President of Parliament urged us to do yesterday: involve EU citizens in the creation of a Europe fit for its future.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work.
We are looking for a greater role as a parliament in ensuring that we can conclude agreements with regard to social inclusion, so as to best respond to the needs and demands of those people we represent.
Parliament's role must be a constructive one.
However, I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape, which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda.
We must favour creating a proper business environment where employment can be created, and where proper and real jobs can be maintained within the European Union.
Nowadays when we look around the world we can see how it is more common and easier for industry and business to relocate outside areas with high social costs and high taxation.
We must work towards a more progressive system in which workers are entitled to keep as much of their earned income as possible and there is better provision of services in the social sphere in areas such as housing, health and education through the national exchequer.
We may not achieve those with the proposals contained in this report.
I am in favour of the report, but I have specific concerns.
We must also look at the whole legislative process implied by what is being called for in this report.
Although Parliament is seeking a greater role, more involvement in coordination and quicker action, with hindsight it is also looking for more legislation to be put in place.
Legislative instruments are called for when negotiations are not concluded in relation to training, lifelong learning, organisation of work, adjustments, new forms of work, guidelines for negotiations by social partners and supplementary sickness insurance.
However, the Commission has proposed something different.
The Commission is taking a far more proactive and forward-looking approach in its proposals.
We must support the call for research, which unfortunately was not highlighted within the committee report. There has to be a radical increase in employment participation.
An emphasis must be put on better jobs. More must be done towards building a European labour market with more mobility included within it.
Finally, we must play a greater and clearer role as regards the place within society of those with disabilities.
These people represent 10 % of the population, yet they are excluded from so many walks of life.
We have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people.
Mr President, congratulations to Mrs Hermange on her report, and also to the Commission on its communication.
It is a new instrument that is being developed.
It is the first time that it is on the table, so it goes without saying that it will require fine-tuning in future.
All criticism should therefore be seen in this light, and criticism is obviously always relative.
I welcome this instrument, and would want to make two comments in this respect.
First of all, we have developed a great deal of European legislation.
One of the aspects to which the annex to the communication refers is the need for codification.
This is absolutely vital, in my view, for the complexity of European legislation and the large quantity of European legislation are starting to play tricks on us.
Needless to say, we can insist on more European legislation, and more European legislation is probably required in the social field.
However, there should also come a time where we can catch our breaths and take stock, certainly in the light of enlargement.
After all, all these new laws will also need to be transposed in the candidate countries.
If I consider the social situation in the candidate countries, then this is certainly not straightforward.
They are very poorly developed in the social field, and if we pass new laws, these will also apply to them.
I therefore call for occasional reviews to be drawn up of the situation as it stands.
Would it not be useful to consider the results of all the existing laws?
How do they operate in practice?
Also, should the results in practice not be included in the scoreboard so that we at any rate have an overview, not only of our wishes for improvement, but also of the reality in the field?
I call for including this too in the scoreboard.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to congratulate Mrs Hermange and thank her for this fine report, which is every bit as good as its predecessor.
We share her analysis and also the criticisms she has raised in the report.
I wish also to thank you, Commissioner, for your ideas on the Barcelona Summit.
Only this morning, I was telling a party of visitors from Bad Hersfeld how much commitment you demonstrate.
Your agenda has enjoyed very strong support from Parliament, and especially from the group to which I belong, but we now expect definite proposals and initiatives, action plans and also - Mrs Smet - directives.
This will not work in the complete absence of directives.
Of course, we should make more use than hitherto of the new method of coordination, especially in discussions with the candidate countries.
I see that as an excellent instrument for getting these countries involved right now and also giving them the opportunity to set out to us their current concerns and needs, and what they have achieved.
Here too, I do not share Mrs Smet's opinion that these candidate countries lag behind on all these points.
I think we urgently need a reform of the European Works Councils directive.
If you have problems at the Commission, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, then just take the excellent report that Parliament produced last autumn.
We must also shape social policy along precautionary lines, and not always leave it until, so to speak, the child has fallen down the well.
The scandal surrounding lorry drivers in Luxembourg is only the tip of the iceberg.
The head of Luxembourg's government has said that there is an urgent need for action on the part of the European Union, and perhaps we should take him at his word.
The Spanish presidency is, unfortunately, rather hesitant, but, Commissioner, Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the degree to which the European Union complies with the Social Policy Agenda is a major indication of its interest in resolving the countless social problems that still exist.
We are still seeing not only major delays in this policy' s implementation, however, but also that concerns with social policies are not being reflected in other policies and in the Community budget and we are even seeing a reduction in funds in the fields of employment and social affairs, which is unacceptable.
Even in the field of social inclusion, and despite the miles of paper that have already been used up on the subject and despite national inclusion plans and countless declarations of intent, there are still serious problems which could grow worse as a result of the slowdown in economic activity and the insistence on privatisations in fundamental sectors and in public services that are essential to a genuine policy of social inclusion, in addition to the fact that financial resources are still very thin on the ground.
If the European Union' s leaders persist in this approach, there is a danger, as the report states, that the commitments given in the Agenda will not be fully met by 2005.
This is why it is so important for the Commission to speed up its work and, above all, to change its policies, giving the utmost priority to the social aspect in areas such as quality employment with rights, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the guarantee of access to fundamental rights, specifically for the more vulnerable social groups such as children, the elderly, immigrants and the disabled and the establishment of equal opportunities for men and women in all areas.
Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Marie-TherÃšse Hermange and her colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for including in the report proposals that I tabled, specifically on asking the Commission to adopt initiatives and to present an action plan for the effective prevention of musculoskeletal injuries at work, to take initiatives to provide appropriate safeguards for workers' rights, and notably employment, in the event of the restructuring or relocation of undertakings and to take initiatives, and notably adopt an action plan, to put into practice equality of payment for men and women.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her excellent work but also express some dissatisfaction at the Commission' s communication.
We do not, of course, want to ignore the various initiatives planned by the Commission regarding employment and certain social issues, nor do we want to disregard the negotiation initiatives undertaken by the social partners.
The fact is that, although the agenda has a programme structure, endorsed since Nice by the Lisbon conclusions, in particular - and which, moreover I clearly support - this initial assessment of its implementation would seem somewhat inconclusive, removed from the original plan and goals set.
Indeed, I wonder whether, in the meantime, a predefined model and predefined frameworks exist, within which the responsibilities laid down by the agenda for the many parties involved can be exercised; whether there is evidence of even embryonic good quality work and what its particular characteristics are; whether the job placement systems and systems providing information on opportunities are successfully fulfilling their role and whether school and training courses are starting to be rationalised.
Moreover, it should be ascertained, at both Community and national level, whether industrial relations are moving steadily towards general development in terms of flexibility and security and whether local bodies and social forces are starting to cooperate responsibly in respect of national action plans and whether these plans are starting to be fully consistent with Union guidelines.
It would also be appropriate to ascertain, in order to get an overall picture, whether the States have at least initiated an internal debate on their social rules, on cohesion within their national territories and on the integration of groups which are relatively or extremely marginalised because of age, disability, sex or profession.
One last point concerns enlargement, on which the agenda focuses greatly, unlike this initial assessment, which merely refers to NGOs' activities, although that is not to say they are not important.
To sum up, the point we are trying to make is that, although much of the issue is left to the principle of subsidiarity and the active responsibility of a number of parties to manage, the social protocol, although behind schedule, is an integral part of the Treaties, and social policy at last goes hand in hand with economic policy in the open method of coordination.
It is, therefore, vital that the Commission take a more incisive, specific role, which must be shared by the European Parliament in a more substantial, ongoing fashion.
Mr President, I have very great respect for the ambitious work which the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, has put into the report on the scoreboard for implementation of the social policy agenda.
However, I am at the same time concerned that the work has led to the request for a long list of legislative initiatives on the part of the Commission, relating for example to lifelong learning, organisation of work, the need to reconcile work and private life, working environment policy, supplementary sickness insurance and the hiring-out of staff.
There are two main reasons why I believe that demands for legislative initiatives within these areas are the wrong road to go down.
First of all, we Swedish Conservatives believe that these issues should not be dealt with at Community level.
They are best dealt with at national level and, best of all of course, through negotiations at national level.
Secondly, I believe that adding more and more pages of legislation to the thousands upon thousands of pages that the candidate countries are now already required to accept and incorporate into their own legislation would make it considerably more difficult to implement any enlargement of the EU.
I therefore agree with what my colleague, Mrs Smet, said about its being important to pause and reflect and to review the legislation that already exists.
We are not being given the opportunity to vote against individual points in the report.
We Swedish Conservatives will not be able to support the report as a whole in the final vote, in spite of the fact that there is actually a lot in the report that we think is positive.
Unfortunately, the initiatives are, as I said just now, to be taken at the wrong level.
They should be taken at national level.
Mr President, I should like to start by saying that this report will help enormously in improving how we use an important tool.
As Mrs Smet said, it is vital that we understand that this is the first social policy tool we have had at European level, a tool achieved with a great deal of hard work and sensitive negotiation.
The report and the amendments tabled by the honourable Members touch on three issues: content, time and procedure.
As far as the content is concerned, I would remind the House that the Commission highlighted the need for a binding Social Agenda in the spring of 2000 and spent 6 months making important policy preparations in close collaboration with the French presidency and Parliament, in the person of Mrs Van Lancker, resulting in Nice in agreement between the leading countries, for the first time ever, on a long-term, five-year Social Agenda.
The Commission was specifically instructed to implement this Social Agenda and it announces a programme every year so that the commitments made will be fulfilled by 2005.
I should like to remind the House that I presented the results of the first year's implementation of the Agenda to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in October 2000.
It was 100% efficient; there was a 100% correlation between commitments and implementation.
In October 2001, I again presented a table of actions in 2001 to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and again there was a 100% correlation between commitments and results.
The question is, does the Agenda remain constant or does it absorb new factors over the course of time?
The Commission is basically - or rather absolutely - committed to the Social Agenda as adopted in Nice on the basis of the Agenda agreed in 2000.
In the meantime, we have promised to review it in 2003 and, of course, I agree with the report that Parliament will need to play an important part if we are to have the facility to adjust it.
My second comment concerns time.
First, the report on the Agenda and the Commission's summary report to the spring Council need to be submitted at the same time.
This always creates problems, which we are trying to resolve.
Secondly, our criticism is based on the results of the first year of the Agenda, as Mrs Hermange says in her report, so we must bear in mind that the report in question had to be submitted two months after the decision taken in Nice.
This brings me to the procedure. I agree with the report on three points: first, that the Social Agenda and the table of results cannot simply be a statement of past action and should make a careful examination of broader achievements and look to the future.
Secondly, it must refer back to the wider review of the factors involved and look forward to future expectations, these factors being, of course, the social partners, together with women's organisations and civic society organisations, as described by the honourable Members.
The third point is that the stability and cohesiveness of the Agenda are not written in stone, i.e. we must intervene wherever there is an emergency or new elements create problems at social level with social repercussions.
As was the case recently with the initiative on restructuring, to which the Member in question has already referred, where we had 350,000 redundancies in a year due to corporate restructuring in the European Union.
We had no choice but to intervene, even though there was no commitment in the Agenda.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am positive that this report and the close collaboration with the committee in question will help to improve consistently the performance of the Social Agenda which, I would again remind the House, is a completely new tool and which close cooperation will help to make even better.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour and a pleasure to welcome to Parliament the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Mr Georgi Parvanov, who has taken his seat in the official gallery.
His delegation includes prominent members of the Bulgarian government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Passy, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Svinarov, as well as members of the Bureau of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee.
Mr Parvanov took office less than three weeks ago, and we are delighted that one of his first actions should be to visit the European Parliament.
We are aware of the endeavours made by Mr Parvanov and the Bulgarian government to overcome the country' s present social and economic difficulties and to prepare it for accession to the European Union.
We support its desire to be part of the European family and we would stress that the European Parliament is rooting for Bulgaria and its citizens.
Thank you, Mr President, for your visit.
(Applause)
Vote
I wish to table an oral amendment to Amendments Nos 10 and 16, which are identical.
This is to do with the original text's stipulation that the Joint Undertaking's registered office should be located somewhere where it would be exempted from taxation.
For reasons of competitiveness, and other comparable reasons, this is of course not feasible.
In consultation with the groups, the text should be replaced by:
... "subject to the existing tax regimes and negotiations with the potential country of location".
(Parliament gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, this is a first for me, being the first time I have taken the floor during a vote, and I also want to keep it brief.
I am grateful for the signal that Parliament is sending out to the Council, and hope that the Council will give equally definite agreement to this project in March so that we can get things moving at last!
Joint motion for a resolution
on the situation of the lorry drivers stranded in Luxembourg
Regarding paragraph 9
Mr President, there is an omission in item 9 of the joint resolution.
In the discussions between the various groups, the European Commission was given the task of reforming the CEMT permit system, but this role has been omitted from the text of the resolution.
I therefore suggest tabling an oral amendment and adding the following words, which we agreed.
The text would then be worded as follows: "Calls on the Member States, in close collaboration with the Commission services, to initiate a qualitative and quantitative revision" .
(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the situation in the Middle East
Regarding Amendment No 2
Mr President, I request that the first clause - "calls on Israel to comply with" - be replaced with the clause "calls on the two sides to comply with international conventions" , and that, after the words "arrested and imprisoned" , the words "by Israel" be inserted.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0100/2002) on measures to combat terrorism
Regarding Amendment No 8
I wanted to table an oral amendment both on behalf of my own Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The intention is to add a few words which will then make it clear that the definition of terrorism, in the form that we adopted yesterday, will also apply to these measures.
In other words, the amendment will not affect the entry into force but the interpretation of the definition of terrorism.
The text reads: "would like the implementation of these four measures and especially the common position on specific measures to combat terrorism to be subject to the interpretation of the definition, as laid down in the framework decision concerning the definition of terrorism that was laid down by the Council on 6 December 2001, particularly with regard to the guarantees described in the recitals and the relevant statements made by the Council" .
I hope that this is acceptable to everyone.
(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the financing of development aid
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the UNCHR in Geneva
Regarding paragraph 5
Mr President, paragraph 5, where it says "to sign and ratify" should read "to ratify or accede to the Rome Statue" because at this stage it is no longer possible to sign the Statute.
So paragraph five should read as follows: "Calls on the Member States to appeal to all UN members to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute setting up the International Criminal Court".
(The House gave its assent to the tabling of the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0023/2002) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments in European integration [2001/2023(INI)]
Before the vote
Mr President, I would like to inform the House that at the end of the debate yesterday afternoon, Mr Napolitano, in response to statements made during the debate by myself and others, made the following offer: he suggested that we ought to withdraw Amendments Nos 18 and 12 in order that he might, through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, propose the bringing forward of a specific report on the issue of constitutional regions in the architecture of Europe.
Many of us believe that is a very important question.
Those who think it is important are divided at the moment between those who would wish to include it in this report and those who would wish to deal with it in another context.
The best course - and my group agrees with this as I believe the Liberals do as well - will be for us to accept Mr Napolitano's generous proposition that this should be raised as a separate topic in its own right through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and that we should withdraw these amendments.
I therefore propose that be done.
Mr President, I would like to table a compromise oral amendment absorbing Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 tabled by Mr Belder.
My amendment replaces citations 2, 4 and 6 of the report with the following: 'Having regard to the recent statements by a number of Heads of State or Government on Europe' s future,' .
Mr President, Mr MacCormick has now withdrawn Amendments Nos 18 and 12, but Amendment No 10 deals with the same subject.
Will the latter be withdrawn accordingly, or will it be kept?
First of all, I would like to know whether the House agrees to the oral amendment tabled by Mr Napolitano as rapporteur, to replace the three citations with the clause he has just read.
Are there any objections? Good.
The amendment is adopted.
Mr MacCormick has proposed to withdraw Amendments Nos 12 and 18.
Mrs Van Lancker says that Amendment No 10 can also be withdrawn as it deals with the same point.
I have also been informed that Amendment No 17 is on the same subject.
On the basis of what I have been told, I therefore conclude that Amendments Nos 10, 12, 17 and 18 are to be withdrawn.
Could you confirm that, Mr MacCormick?
Mr President, I am content with that, but they are on different points.
The other two amendments make this observation: there are exactly 15 Member States in the Union at the moment and that is not disputed.
Whether there are more nations is a different question.
However, in a spirit of goodwill I withdraw these amendments as well.
Mr President, on a point of order, at yesterday's vote on the Watson report on the European Arrest Warrant, there was confusion on the numbering of amendments.
You will see from today's report that what was Amendment No 3 has been penned over as 4.
Even in the Official Report it is not quite clear on some of the pages.
Amendment No 3, which dealt with the legal concept of habeas corpus, had been circulated to us in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group.
We knew that the amendment would be defeated but nonetheless I and a number of my colleagues decided to vote for it because of our firm belief in the principle of habeas corpus and that it is a good one.
We wish to indicate our vote that this legal remedy should have a place in European law.
Looking at the record of yesterday's proceedings, Amendment No 3, which we received yesterday morning, became Amendment No 4 at the vote.
Our decision to vote for the principle of habeas corpus was negated by this change in the numbering of the amendment.
I wish it to be recorded here that our vote was intended to support the principle of habeas corpus.
Mr President, I offer this explanation of vote on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
The concern of the PPE-DE Group was that, as a result of the ambiguity of its wording, Amendment No 8 to the resolution on the European judicial area could be wrongly interpreted.
This wording - particularly in certain language versions - could be interpreted as meaning that the entry into force of the four measures was being replaced by that of the framework decision on terrorism.
Following Mrs Buitenweg' s clarification, we have voted in favour, because it is logical that the framework decision on terrorism should serve as an interpretative criterion for these four decisions.
Hatzidakis report (A5-0012/2002)
. (NL) For a long time, we used to aspire to ever faster road vehicles for the transport of both freight and passengers.
Speed restriction was seen as a temporary and unwanted hitch in technology waiting to be perfected.
Each deliberate attempt to return to any form of speed restriction was considered an infringement of the driver' s individual freedom or a barrier to favourable profit margins for hauliers.
The rising death toll on the roads is forcing us to have second thoughts.
Despite this, the prescribing of devices for an ever larger proportion of road transport is only part of the solution.
If appliances are made compulsory but if the legal speed limit is not sufficiently restricted, then this looks more like a disguised form of subsidy for companies that can tap into a new market in this way.
This is comparable to the covenant with the car industry, which produces headlights that are activated automatically when the car is switched on, whereupon the driver needs to switch them off again in order to meet national statutory provisions or safety requirements.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur confines the proposal to company cars, extends transitional periods and, in part, increases the maximum speed of category N2 motorised vehicles to 110 km.
Speed limitation devices only make sense if they are designed to make compliance with such a serious statutory speed restriction enforceable, and this is, sadly, still not the case.
Marques report (A5-0001/2002)
Mr President, firstly, in my capacity as a member of the EU-Bulgaria joint interparliamentary delegation, I too would like to welcome the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Mr Georgi Parvanov, to the European Parliament.
As regards the Marques report on rum in the French overseas territories and the Azores, how could I vote against the motion?
Last night, I dreamed I saw the pirate, Captain Morgan, who said to me: 'I have been appointed by the trade union of pirates to advise you to vote for this document, for otherwise we pirates will not be able to sing our usual refrain' - which I will read, not sing here - '15 men on a dead man' s chest and a bottle of rum' .
The bottle of rum is essential, and so I voted for the motion.
.
(FR) Rum is no longer sufficient fodder in the FOD!
Faced with a truly lamentable situation for this type of quality product which, like others, has fallen victim to competition from the ACP countries, we must preserve the French demand for rum from the overseas departments and therefore extend the derogation which has been in place since 1995, that is, a reduction in excise duty, until 2009, for social and cultural reasons, in the hope that structural measures will be taken either to save the rum industry by making it competitive or by providing alternatives to the 40 000 jobs concerned.
I am in favour of extending the reduction in excise duty on FOD rum for a quota of 90 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol in France, particularly as I believe, in general, that the exorbitant excise duty should be reduced on wines and spirits, in particular in the North of the Community.
This is therefore a good precedent, as the Commission, which is drawing up proposals to abolish zero excise duty for wine, should also be discouraged.
In my opinion, we should take every opportunity to protect against such intentions.
However, I consider that, in the interim report that the Commission is due to present to us in 2006, not only should the continued presence of the reasons justifying the derogation be assessed, but Community rules concerning State aid should also be taken into consideration and the continued derogation should be conditional on the effective restructuring of the sector.
I believe this to be a legitimate request.
With regard to the reduction of the crippling excise duties on liqueurs and eaux-de-vie produced and consumed in Madeira and the Azores, I am also in favour of granting this derogation until 2008, with an interim report to be produced in 2005.
This is for reasons of regional policy, in order to enable small firms to survive, despite competition from imported products with far lower production and marketing costs than local producers.
. (FR) Article 299(2) of the Treaty provides for the possibility of introducing special measures in order to ensure the survival of activities in the outermost regions where a climate of legal certainty is greatly needed if economic operators are to maintain their position and to grow.
The production of rum has a major impact on the economy of the French overseas departments as 40 000 jobs are involved.
The Council Decision of 1995, which is due to expire at the end of this year, authorises France to impose a reduced rate of excise duty within French metropolitan territory for "traditional" rum produced in the French overseas departments.
The current review of the COM in the sugar sector and the dismantling of customs barriers in 2003 have led France to propose that these tax arrangements be maintained beyond 2002 on the grounds that the measures adopted at national and Community level would not in themselves be enough to allow FOD products to compete with products from other regions.
In order to preserve this traditional agricultural activity, which generates jobs at every stage of cane-sugar-rum production, the current system sets a minimum level for imports from the FOD into France which is strictly limited and supervised in order to compete with the ever-increasing sales of rum from third countries, which are not subject to the same production specifications.
In order to ensure the survival of the sector, rum producers in the FOD are obliged to use local raw materials, which guarantees quality, but which, for example, prevents Guadelupian rum from being produced using cane from Martinique as well as from third countries.
Rum from the overseas departments is therefore obliged to participate in the FOD rural development policy, which increases restrictions and production costs and places it in a disadvantageous position on the market in relation to products from third countries.
The dispensational tax system therefore merely aims to compensate for the obligation incumbent on FOD producers to participate in the survival of the cane-sugar-rum sector.

Glante report (A5-0005/2002)
Let us talk about the Galileo project, Mr President.
As you know better than me, Galileo Galilei, the great Italian scientist, used to study the sky with his telescope from the earth.
Here, the opposite is happening: Galileo will study the earth from the heights of the satellites, which is where he will be sent into orbit.
This coincidence is curious but it does not alter the fact that the Galileo project is very important, and so I voted for the motion.
. (EL) The purpose of the GALILEO programme is to design and build a satellite navigation system which allows users to determine their position on earth extremely accurately.
Apart from the fact that it is much more accurate than the American Global Positioning System (GPS), which has been up and running for several years now, the main point about GALILEO is that, unlike the GPS, it is to come under political, rather than military control.
It is also the first European space project and, if it can be successfully installed and commissioned, apart from helping to improve navigation, it will give a tremendous boost to space science and technology.
The European Commission communication under examination does not relate to the GALILEO system per se but to the creation of a joint public/private undertaking to finance its development.
Mr Glante's report proposes several important improvements to the Commission proposal.
However, the European Parliament approved two amendments by a large majority, led mainly by the European People's Party, with the backing of the Party of European Socialists, which seek to militarise the system by making express reference to military use of the system for so-called "peacekeeping operations".
If the Council and the Commission follow this line of thinking, it will completely negate the non-military purpose of the system and will, of course, be an addition to the European Union's arsenal in its interventions against the people.
It is worth noting that the European Parliament approved a similar amendment in my report on the European Union's space policy on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy at the last part-session.
This is no random coincidence; as we pointed out on that previous occasion, it demonstrates a clear intention to use space for military purposes.
These developments prove that the global grass-roots movement needs to step up its fight against imperialist aggression and the militarisation of space.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
The MPF delegation firmly supports the Galileo project for the implementation of a European satellite radionavigation programme, a system that will work parallel to yet independently of the American GPS system whilst maintaining 'interoperability' , in other words, it will not work against this system and will permit the possibility for the two systems to work together.
The Galileo project seems exemplary for three reasons.
From a technical point of view, it will have numerous positive effects for all economic activities and will increase Europe' s general productivity at a time when this is very much needed.
From an institutional point of view, it is clear that a project on which there is Europe-wide cooperation would be justified with regard to subsidiarity, and that the European Space Agency (ESA) could provide the appropriate instrument for this.
Finally, from a political and strategic point of view, the Galileo project will grant Europe independence from the United States while the acceptance of the GPS monopoly, on the other hand, would imply a tangible dependence that would increase over time.
In spite of these arguments, the final decision on the development of the Galileo project has been deferred from Council to Council, and the latest, held at Laeken, was no exception.
It is already almost too late for a useful decision to be made.
Apart from the technical discussions on the precise procedures for the involvement of private partners, the true reason for the delay lies in the United States' hesitation, which has influenced certain European countries.
This brings us to the main issue: do Community procedures not slow the whole process down because they are too rigid and the partners are not all in agreement?
These structures are acting like a brake now on the project' s launch and they will act like a brake tomorrow and at each stage of development, especially if we want to add military or 'peacekeeping' operations.
On this point, the European Parliament is frankly making a mistake in demanding an ever greater communitisation of the project, for example in estimating, in its resolution of 17 January, that "The ESA with its basis of intergovernmental cooperation should in the longer term be brought within the EU" .
In truth, the opposite is the case: we need to apply the principle of variable geometry to Galileo, as for Airbus and Ariane, and create a structure that groups together only those States that are truly involved in the project.
This would be the best way to pull this project out of the rut it is currently stuck in and make real progress.
. (FR) I would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Norbert Glante, on his research and negotiations on this matter of great strategic importance.
I would now like to draw your attention to the Galileo system.
We often hear mention of this project without really being aware of its future applications.
Galileo is a satellite radionavigation system that allows the user of a receiver to capture the signals transmitted by a number of satellites in order to determine its position in time and in space.
At the moment, there are two systems of this type: the American GPS system and the Russian GLONASS system.
These two systems have been developed on a military basis, which is not the case with Galileo.
On a practical level, we will be able to use this system in areas as varied as transport, fisheries, agriculture, telecommunications, oil exploration, defence and civil protection activities.
To give you an example, in the field of inland transportation, it will allow planning and better management of transport times, the automatic control of vehicles, a reduction in traffic jams and the number of road accidents and so on and so forth.
Of course, we are not at this stage yet.
The implementation of Galileo should take place in four phases.
We have completed the definition phase.
We now have to launch the development phase for 2002-2005.
During this period, we will have to establish the technical and financial conditions necessary for the rapid deployment of infrastructure in 2006-2007 in order to be able to exploit this system commercially in 2008.
The European Commission has made us proposals with regard to this second phase of Galileo.
Our Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was of the opinion that the proposals made with regard to structures were not appropriate.
Thus, according to the model envisaged by the European Commission, private companies would be able to participate fully in the establishment of the Joint Undertaking.
Following the example of the rapporteur, I believe that there would be a conflict of interests if these companies were directly involved in the joint undertaking, since they would then have to respond to invitations to tender issued by this same company.
It therefore seems desirable that only the founding members, the European Communities and the European Space Agency, should be members of this Joint Undertaking.
The EIB may also become a member of the Joint Undertaking in the future.
(Intervention cut short pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (DE) I consider the establishment of a European satellite navigation programme to be generally sensible and deserving of support.
I have, despite this, voted against the Glante report today, as I am unable to follow the rapporteur down the road he is taking.
In no way is there any certainty that Galileo will succeed in economic terms as a competitor to GPS, which has until now enjoyed a monopoly of the market.
I therefore take the view that the financial risk should be borne equally by the public sector and private enterprise.
The rapporteur wants to facilitate industry's involvement in financing Galileo by means of a development company instead of giving it a share in the Joint Undertaking, as the Commission had planned.
One objective in this is to allay the Member States' misgivings on the security policy front, and the other is to avoid the private businesses which constitute part of the Joint Undertaking enjoying competitive advantages when tenders are invited to set Galileo up and operate it.
I take the view, however, that the end result of this purely optional solution to financial participation will be that the investments Galileo will need will be raised by the public sector alone.
Industry will get on board only when Galileo has demonstrated its earning potential and is set to make profits.
This would boil down to funds raised by taxation being invested as venture capital and to substantial shares in the profits then being handed over to private enterprise.
That is not how I envisage taxpayers' money being handled.
Nor am I convinced by the argument of possible conflicts of interest in tendering procedures.
It is, for example, the usual practice in municipalities for enterprises owned by the local authority to tender jointly with private firms when contracts are put out, without this resulting in unequal treatment.
As regards the argument of security policy, I have misgivings of a quite different kind.
Both the Commission and the Council leave no room for doubt that they regard Galileo as a central component of the independence of European defence policy.
Parliament has not been able to make up its mind to decisively reject the use of Galileo for military purposes.
I, though, reject all use of satellite navigation systems for military purposes.
- (NL) The rapporteur is right to refer private companies to a separate development company.
However, I do not back this proposal, for GALILEO is 15 years overdue.
The benefits which a navigation system supported by satellites could have for the government, industry and individual users have long since been stolen from under our noses by the American competition.
Only if we intend to close off the European market for American goods and services is it useful to develop a system with Community funding that, within a liberalised global market, is doomed to lose the competitive battle to the American GPS system.
This intention does not exist, and it even looks like we are painstakingly trying to avoid trade wars with the US over the import of dangerous goods and pollution by noisy aircraft.
European companies are, of course, free to try, off their own bats, to compete with the American product with something that is of superior quality.
In doing so, they may be able temporarily to gain a tiny foothold in the market and subsequently do profitable business with the Americans, which will enable them to incorporate European inventions into improvements to the existing system.
This does not apply to a large-scale project that has partly been funded with tax money and that can only win or lose.
Such a waste of Community funding only serves the interests of industry and the military machine.
The members of the MPF delegation to the European Parliament have supported Mr Glante' s report in order to give their backing to the implementation of the Galileo programme, but they are anxious to show their disagreement with the mixed Community and intergovernmental approach, which has been retained.
This project is a perfect illustration of one of the domains in which European cooperation is vital.
The common interest is obvious and clearly defined.
The Galileo system is crucial if we are to ensure the independence of the Member States of the European Union in the strategic domain of satellite position-finding, since it will mean that they no longer have to depend on the GPS, that the United States controls in a discretionary fashion.
On the other hand, in attempting to manage the project with a 'Joint Undertaking' , where the Commission, together with the ESA, would make up one of the two pillars, we would be running the risk of paralysing its implementation, causing disagreements, bureaucracy and delays and making it impossible to call upon competences outside the Union and so on.
The only effective solution would appear to be a specific ESA programme, for ESA mechanisms have proved their flexibility and efficiency.
Only a voluntary intergovernmental framework will permit the satisfactory resolution of the essential issue of the use of the system by the military.
. I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague which will endow Europe with an independent technology which can be widely used for several practical purposes, including transport and telecommunications.
It is increasingly vital that the EU should develop an independent technology from the only two which exist in Russia and the United States.
Presently, we have a precarious situation whereby the EU is reliant on these two countries' systems which could potentially be called into use for military purposes at any point.
Financing for this project has always been a contentious issue: its financial underpinning must inevitably come from the private sector, but the ensuing relationship between the Joint Undertaking and the private sector must be carefully defined.
This will preclude any conflict of interests or awkward ambiguity between the partners of this project.
In light of this, it is a sound proposal to establish a development company which would effectively act as an arbiter between the partners of this project.
Lastly, a monitoring committee which would observe the project throughout its creation will ensure that the project is as transparent and accountable as is necessary.
Joint motion for a resolution on the Middle East (B5-0101/2002)
Mr President, I am delivering this explanation of vote on my own behalf.
I voted for Amendment No 1 on the Israeli reservists refusing to serve in the occupied territories, against the instruction of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
This instruction was given purely for tactical reasons, because if this amendment had been adopted, the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would not have voted for the resolution.
I feel, however, that if there are men and women in Israel and the Palestinian territories who have the courage to say no to war, there is a glimmer of hope, and this is a wonderful example of courage to which we must cannot, under any circumstances, fail to respond.
In any case, I feel - and I want to believe - that history will prove these reservists right.
.
(EL) The European Parliament resolution on the Middle East may ascribe some responsibility to the Israeli government, but it remains faithful to the general policy of sitting squarely on the fence, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote.
The Communist Party of Greece condemns the blatant violation of international conventions, international law and bilateral agreements by the Israeli government and, more importantly, the aggressive, barbaric tactics of the Israeli forces occupying the West Bank and Gaza.
The barbaric move in cutting off President Arafat's headquarters - and hence, to all intents and purposes, the Palestinian Authority - in Ramallah is intolerable and we call for an immediate end to it.
We also condemn the increased and indiscriminate use of violence by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people, as a result of which the Palestinians have suffered hundreds of deaths and thousands of casualties among the civilian population and constant bombardment of their infrastructure, including their homes and fields.
We welcome the fight by the Palestinian people for a fair and peaceful solution in accordance with UN resolutions and we stand by them in their struggle to found their own independent state around the capital of East Jerusalem.
We also welcome all the Israeli democrats who oppose their government's barbaric policy, who are fighting for a fair and viable solution and who often risk their life by refusing to be party to their government's illegal and inhumane action.
More importantly, we stand by the Israeli soldiers who refuse to murder civilians.
We consider that the ÃU's stand to date, despite its pronouncements to the contrary, has not helped to resolve the Palestinian question.
On the contrary, by promoting the new order together with the USA and keeping to its tactic of sitting firmly on the fence between the murderers and the victims it is perpetuating the problem so that it can turn it to its advantage in accordance with its imperialist interests in the region and beyond.
We call on the governments of the Member States, especially of the countries represented at the UN Security Council, and the ÃU to raise the issue of increased tension in the Middle East, the failure to apply the UN resolutions already passed and their violation by Israel at the UN and to call on Israel to help find a fair and viable solution to the problem and recognise the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state, which will make a decisive contribution towards stability and security in the region.
. (PT) The situation in the Middle East is so serious that it requires urgent measures and greater solidarity in demanding an end to the continual illegal incursion by the Israeli army into territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, to the virtual house-arrest of President Arafat, to the extrajudicial execution of Palestinian representatives, to the violation of the most basic human rights, including the torture and killing of children, and to the destruction of Palestinian infrastructures and other installations funded by the European Union and by other donors.
The international community must, as a matter of urgency, adopt new initiatives that lead to an end to the violence, to re-establishing trust and to reopening negotiations between the two sides, in accordance with international law and with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
Hence my support for the Joint Resolution which, although watered down, could express the European Parliament' s concern at this situation, repudiate the statements and actions of Ariel Sharon, and reaffirm that the solution to the problem, including the safety of Israel and peace itself, requires the State of Palestine to be recognised in conditions that are viable.
I regret the fact, however, that the majority of those on the right has refused to show solidarity with the Israeli army reservists who refuse to serve in the occupied territories, and whom history will show to be completely right, although I welcome the decision to send a very high level parliamentary delegation to the region to meet the Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to convey a message of peace to both communities, together with the European Parliament' s insistence on the need to urgently send international observers to the region.
I hope that, this watered-down resolution of the European Parliament will at least be implemented immediately.
. (FR) At a time that is particularly tragic for the Middle East as well as particularly dangerous for world peace, at a time when the United States is no longer providing the impetus for the peace process, reverting to a more partisan approach, a time at which the Arab States seem to be stunned by the position adopted by the Americans, it would appear to be the clear responsibility of the Europeans to take the initiative and to try to overcome the current situation of violent impasse with diplomatic advances.
Alas, however, we have yet to make any significant achievements.
Member States which may have had the diplomatic ability to act are becoming paralysed by the collective mechanisms of the Union, which can only produce joint statements.
The European Parliament resolution is just another manifestation of this European powerlessness.
There are murmurs from France.
The suggestions are appropriate but France believes that it no longer has the strength to push them forward.
The organisation in the occupied territories, of elections based on the theme of peace would act, however, as a lever that would force the Palestinians to adopt a clear position with regard to the Intifada and terrorism.
The recognition of the Palestinian State by all, as a starting point for negotiation, going beyond questions of personality that muddy the waters, would allow the peace process to be relaunched on a more solid basis.
Naturally, the European Parliament resolution makes no reference to these proposals, since, coming from a single Member State and not from a European authority, they cannot by definition, in the Union' s eyes, be pertinent.
Not being supported by genuine political will, it is very likely that these proposals will vanish into thin air, when they could have put both parties back onto the path to political dialogue.
Motion for a resolution on terrorism (B5-0100/2002)
. (FR) The vote on our motion for a resolution against terrorism means we can state firmly once again that terrorism is evil by definition, is totally unjustified and should be eradicated at all costs.
The main characteristic of and driving force behind these unscrupulous minority groups is the imposing of their ideas and power through violence and fear.
The causes of terrorism should not be confused with the means it employs.
Terrorist leaders, whoever and wherever they are, have need of resources to be able to achieve their goals, namely:
money, first and foremost, from their personal fortunes or obtained through racketeering, criminal activity, drug trafficking or petrodollars...
foot-soldiers, which they find in fragile environments by playing on nationalism, religion, ambition, dreams, revenge, poverty or despair...
terror, which they impose on democracies and their citizens that are ill prepared to resist ... and always ready to negotiate compromises...
We remember all the terrorist movements and their actions over the last few years, whether it be the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany, the Red Brigades in Italy, movements in Corsica, in Ireland or in the Basque Country, striking every day, not forgetting the massacres at the Munich Olympics, the suicide bombers in Tel Aviv and the networks of the fundamentalist multimillionaire Osama Bin Laden.
All these actions have a common goal: to destroy democratic systems by means of terror.
Combating terrorism should be the main objective of all democracies, wherever they may be.
The ability to call upon a large amount of resources is needed in order to implement measures with determination, to mobilise the citizens, explaining to them what is at stake, and to strengthen the power of the public authorities at both national and European levels.
Without this...there is not much hope!
This is why I supported the European Parliament' s forceful and legitimate request to be closely involved in the actions of the Council in this area.
If we are to combat terrorism effectively, public opinion must be roused, and the European Parliament is the best representative of this opinion.
Joint motion for a resolution on development aid (B5-0034/2002)
. (FR) We are living in a world of unprecedented global wealth.
This wealth, however, has never been so poorly distributed.
Inequalities on a global scale have reached intolerable, appalling proportions.
In 1960, the 20% of the world' s population living in the richest countries had an income 30 times higher than that of the 20% poorest.
In 1995, their income was 82 times higher.
At the other end of the scale, almost three billion people live on less than USD two per day.
More than 800 million are starving.
In September 2001, in the 'Millennium Declaration' , the international community committed itself to halving poverty by 2015.
The international community must, from now on, make the move from these good intentions to positive action.
Europe must provide the impetus for this action.
Next March, in Monterrey, then in Johannesburg in September at the World Summit on sustainable development, the European Union must take the initiative and make concrete proposals and set a precise timetable to honour these commitments.
This offensive promoting development and combating poverty should be organised around four key ideas.
The first is to increase public aid in considerable proportions until it reaches - at last - the objective of 0.7% of the wealth of the northern countries set more than 30 years ago.
A major step was taken in this direction by the last 'Development' Council, which put this objective back on the agenda and called upon the Commission to set deadlines together with the Member States.
We need, from now on, to establish a more precise and restrictive timetable.
Secondly, we need to provide new answers to the problem of the debts of poor countries.
In order to do this, the number of debt restructuring operations that favour the education and primary health care sectors should be dramatically increased, along the lines of the 'debt-reducing and development contracts' (C2D) implemented by France.
We need to go further than the HIPS 'heavily indebted poor countries' initiative and engage in a vast programme for the cancellation of the debt of developing countries.
We need to think about the conditions of access of developing countries to international financing, in accordance with the guidelines mentioned by the French Prime Minister.

Napolitano report (A5-0023/2002)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for the Napolitano report.
The Convention is extremely important and we all support it.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to state that, in my opinion, there is a lack of democracy in the way the delegates from the European Parliament to the Convention were chosen.
I feel, for example, that Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo would have been much happier if the House had elected him by secret ballot, as the President of Parliament and you yourself, Mr Vice-President, were elected.
Everybody would have voted for him and the vote would probably have been unanimous, but that would have constituted a genuine, democratic selection of candidates and therefore of Members of the European Parliament to this Convention.
I would like to point out here that although 'a good start is half the battle' , in this case, a bad start means working twice as hard.
I hope that, in future, the appointment of European Parliament representatives to these important bodies will be more democratic.
Mr President, as Vice-President of Parliament responsible for relations with national parliaments, I very much welcome both the tone and the content of Mr Napolitano's report.
I am convinced that his ideas will help us enhance what is already a good relationship between ourselves and our national counterparts.
I strongly believe that this relationship is vital if we are to ensure that the EU is built on democratic foundations.
However, I agree with some of my colleagues when they emphasise that the regional parliaments which have legislative powers are an equally important part of ensuring democracy in all EU decision-making.
To take my own country, for example, over half the work of the Scottish Parliament is not about implementing laws thought of in Edinburgh or even implementing laws coming from London, but in fact about implementing laws from Brussels - about ensuring that EU laws are properly transposed into Scottish legislation.
So while it is important that we look at national parliaments - and I continue to welcome the emphasis we give to that - we should also now consider how we might embrace the regional parliaments in our work.
I believe this is an excellent and very wise report, much like the rapporteur.
I am personally in full agreement with this report, because I believe it takes the perfect approach.
However, I have not taken part in the vote - despite agreeing personally with the contents of the report - owing to my appointment as a representative of the President of the Spanish Government in the Convention.
Not because I believe there is any incompatibility - which there is not: either legal, material, ethical or any other - but, quite the opposite: the status of MEP - which I share with two other Members who have also been appointed by two other Heads of State and Government, in Greece and Luxembourg - gives added value to the Convention, which is a joint task and not one of opposition.
Nevertheless, also for personal reasons, which are much more symbolic or aesthetic, if you like, Mr President, I have preferred not to participate in the determination of an approach which will undoubtedly serve as a basis for the position taken by Parliament' s delegation in the Convention.
Although there is no incompatibility of any type, I would like it to be noted that my blank vote is purely intended to reflect the fact that I was present.
. (EL) The proposed resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is a move in the right direction, which is why I support it.
National governments are generally relegated to the edge of the European structure.
Their role needs to be developed, not with yet another institution which will get bogged down in the red tape of the European Union, but by:
improving debates of European issues in national parliaments,
examining each minister's programme before it is presented to the Council of Ministers,
controlling the activities of the Council of Ministers,
setting up more high-profile committees on European issues in national parliaments,
involving national parliaments in drafting European legislation,
strengthening collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
We voted in favour of Amendment No 21, and more specifically paragraph 3, of the report because we agree with the rapporteur that the European Parliament and the national parliaments within their respective areas represent the people of the EU.
However, we do not believe that increased parliamentarisation of the EU requires the European Parliament' s powers to be extended where all the EU' s decisions are concerned.
It is important to remember that intergovernmental cooperation takes place between governments controlled by the national parliaments, which also demand accountability.
We voted in favour of paragraph 7 of the report because we agree in principle with the rapporteur' s view that it would be an unfortunate development if the governments were to go overboard in developing new instruments for exercising power that exclude the parliaments' influence.
At the same time, we would emphasise that - in spite of its being insufficiently rooted in parliamentary procedure - the open coordination method has been, and remains, a successful and welcome method of achieving increased integration, cooperation and results in areas not considered suitable for more supranational forms of decision-making.
We voted in favour of paragraph 8 of the report because we agree with the rapporteur that it cannot be regarded as legitimate - in terms either of the practicalities or of providing representation - for MEPs to have a double mandate, that is to say with seats in both the European Parliament and a national/regional parliament.
Where seats in regional parliaments are concerned, we are nonetheless proceeding on the basis that the rapporteur is referring to such parliaments as have independent legislative power and not to such parliaments as have delegated decision-making power, such as the Swedish county councils.
It should be possible reasonably to combine a seat in the latter type of parliament with a seat in the European Parliament.
. (FR) The Napolitano report reflects the traditional view held in the European Parliament on its relationship with the national parliaments: that these are isolationist and content to console themselves with the subordinate role of defenders of fragmented national interests.
This view clearly fails to take into account the fact that the most vibrant level of democracy is that of the nation state, and that to disregard this to too great an extent is also to disregard democracy.
The European common good is not decreed from above, from a European democracy that is too weak to be anything other than a kind of technocratic smokescreen, but lies instead in the peaceful dialogue between the interests and aspirations of various national democracies.
There is a point, however, to which the Napolitano report claims, according to the explanatory statement, to have brought 'an extremely important innovation' : that is, the proposal of some sort of 'joint constituent power' .
This, in reality, exposes the true intentions behind the report' s mollifying proposals: the idea is, in effect, no more and no less, to take away from the national parliaments the exclusive right of ratifying European Treaties and, therefore, of defining the competences of the European Union themselves.
This new 'constituent power' would be shared between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as, as is stated in paragraph 21 of the resolution, by the Commission and the governments of Member States, which is truly unprecedented from the democratic point of view.
Such a reform would constitute a serious climbdown. The power to revise the Treaties, not to mention the 'constituent power' , belongs to the people alone, and certainly not to national or European executives; the people can delegate this power in certain cases to assemblies that have been elected for this purpose, such as the French parliament in the cases specified in Article 89 of the Constitution, but the European Parliament is not one of these assemblies, because no constituent power, or even the revision of treaties, is included in the powers specifically conferred on it by the people.
. The report confines the national parliaments to a role of scrutinising their respective governments, a role which has been curtailed ever since the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council broke the link between European decisions and those taken by each people separately.
It also seeks to widen the powers of the European Parliament, failing to recognise that legitimacy is primarily granted by citizens at national parliamentary level.
In order to revitalise democracy in Europe, it is essential to give each people the visible power of decision at European level.
Consequently, in future we must see national parliaments as standing at the centre of the decision-making process, rather than on the periphery.
The Nice European Council in fact appears to have had an intuition of this when it placed 'the role of the national parliament in the European architecture' (and not on the fringes of that architecture) on the agenda for the next IGC.
Citizens in the European Union generally see elections to their national parliaments (and, in some countries, elections to the national presidency) as the fundamental democratic choice between, for example a left- or right-wing government.
The legitimacy of democracy is today based on the elections to the national parliaments and, as a consequence, the institutions of the European Union must be adjusted to this fact.
Most importantly, major decisions in the Council should have to be ratified by the national parliaments.
- (DA) SOS Democracy is unable to vote in favour of the Napolitano report because it does not give the decisive role to the national parliaments, which are the only institutions that have a close relationship with the people.
. (ES) The fact that the process of European integration is at such a decisive point, as a result of the enlargement under way, on the one hand, and the new political and economic challenges facing the EU, on the other, demands the cooperation of both the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States so that the citizens, via their legitimate representatives, may participate in this process.
Hence the timeliness of the excellent Napolitano report and my vote in favour of it.
Since, while it is clearly necessary to guarantee the democratic control of Community policies and decision making, it is also clear that this control must be carried out while respecting each of the areas of parliamentary activity.
In this respect, I believe the commitment given by Mr Napolitano, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to draw up a report in the near future on the role of parliaments in the constitutional regions within this process is particularly positive.
The regions with legislative powers are a fundamental part of the mechanism, and not only because they are closer to the citizens, but also because the parliaments of these regions, as legitimate representatives of the people making up the Union, have the right to participate within the framework of their competences in the control of the legislative process for Community policies and to have a voice so that they can defend their interests.
. (FR) Whilst I generally support the Napolitano report, I abstained in the final vote because I believe it premature to conclude against the possibility of having a second European chamber or Senate for the Member States.
It will be the task of the forthcoming Convention to develop these ideas, and to draw its own conclusions on the institutions to be created, or not to be created, depending on the global architecture that will eventually be retained.
. (PT) I felt obliged to vote against the Napolitano report although I acknowledge that its resolution reflects a range of positive concerns about the role of national parliaments, both in exercising control over their governments, especially when these governments are involved in defining and implementing European policy, and in producing this policy.
I also acknowledge, as I mentioned expressly in my speech, that the rapporteur was able, in part, to include in the document some of the proposals put forward in the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I was draftsman.
Nevertheless, I cannot agree to some of the conclusions that have been adopted, which I feel are of great political significance.
Amongst these, I would highlight item 21, on the emergence - by means of the Convention - of a constituent power, albeit exercised jointly by the European Parliament and the national parliaments, the Commission and the governments of the Member States, and the outright rejection of a future Senate (item 17), which could, in my opinion, destroy the principle of parity between the Member States of the Union.
Through this explanation of vote I have made my position clear, because, in addition to the objections I have stated, which determined my vote, I feel that Mr Napolitano deserves my intellectual respect for his work and for his efforts to increase the role of national parliaments in the EU, rejecting the simplistic plan to give the European Parliament exclusive rights to represent Europe' s citizens and to be the guardian of democracy in the relationship with the other institutions of the Union.
Pohjamo report (A5-0006/2002)
. (DE) My group agrees with Mr Pohjamo's own-initiative report.
Positive effects have not yet been forthcoming, to the extent we had hoped, from the current provisions of the law and from the reform of the structural funds within the Agenda 2000 framework.
The following, in particular, need to be optimised:
the lengthy negotiations on programmes between the Commission and the Member States
the complicated financial provisions
the involvement of the regions in the implementation of programmes and projects
the expenditure on administration, and
the non-binding nature of the monitoring of project implementation.
Unless further structural changes are made in the administration of the Structural Funds, it will continue to be scarcely possible to resolve the problem posed by the decrease in disparities between the Member States not being reflected by a decrease in those between the regions within them.
Such changes must, in particular, cover the following aspects:
time limits on projects
discontinuance of the financing of projects, the realisation of which overruns the timescale envisaged
the redistribution of Structural Funds resources from countries not availing themselves of them to those which have submitted sufficient qualifying projects
greater weight to be given to infrastructure projects which promote employment.
Enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the Commission should produce, by 2003 at the latest, definite proposals to guarantee that present Member States should suffer no detriment as regards structural resources and that the countries that are candidates for accession should be treated equally in line with the tasks of a common structural policy.
There is no other way to achieve the objective of long-term reduction of existing differences in levels of development and the consequent enhancement of economic and social cohesion.
The amendments tabled by my group have also supported this statement of political objectives.
- (NL) As long as the structural funds remain unchanged, there will be tension between the regional side and the European side.
Viewed from the regional angle, this is about the regions' own funding to which they are entitled and which they must be able to spend independently and as freely as possible.
From the European angle, this is about European money that can only be made available under strict conditions for use in regions and cities and that must be demanded back if deadlines are exceeded or the planned spending plan deviated from.
These clashing demands can only be brought into line with each other following much official, preliminary consultation and a great deal of inspection.
This means that high expenses and much bureaucracy are involved in spending these funds.
It might be preferable for Europe to confine itself to the redistribution of funds that can be freely spent for the benefit of investments in regions suffering from a disadvantage, a crisis or a geographical location that is economically disadvantageous, and keep interference in spending to a minimum, or eliminate it altogether.
Such a change would allow European officials to be deployed on other tasks on which work still needs to be done and would put an end to the needless re-circulation of funding from rich Member States back to the same rich Member States.
That might result in fewer propaganda hoardings sporting a European flag, but it would be far more effective.
. I wholeheartedly applaud the call for EU Structural Funds to be made more efficient and more result-oriented.
Indeed, Structural Funds are a prime way in which European citizens can be made to feel that the EU is doing something for them and it is crucial that the widespread impression of red tape and bureaucracy is not confirmed.
All too often, the execution of Structural Funds has been bureaucratic and the implementation slow and inefficient.
With considerable successive growth in the amount of money allocated to the Structural Funds, it is vital that the principles of productivity, regional added value and quality should not only be reiterated, but also vigilantly monitored.
The effective allocation of the Funds requires the cooperation of all levels of European government.
National governments have a role to play in freeing up the execution process and I favour the call by MEPs for a more direct channelling of Funds to the regions.
In addition, the Commission should be more proactive in approving guideline documents, thus further freeing up the process.
Finally, the consideration of Structural Funds and enlargement is apt: the EU could use this opportunity to allocate Funds more effectively, first time round.
Musotto report (A5-0007/2002)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I would like to point out - this document concerns the economic and social cohesion of the regions of the European Union - how important it is in the opinion of the Pensioners' Party and myself that the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union should not bring about any change in the major cohesion policy implemented through the Structural Funds.
I feel that it is the duty of all the wealthiest regions of Europe to contribute, both financially and otherwise, to the progress of all the other, less wealthy, poorer regions, for I am sad to say that there are still poor regions in all areas of the European Union.
With this in mind, I therefore voted for the Musotto report.
. (FR) I would firstly like to thank both our rapporteur from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Francesco Musotto, and indeed the whole of this committee for the high quality work they have presented.
To vote for this report is, as far as I am concerned, first and foremost to underline the fact that the principle of cohesion and thus of solidarity and the integration of the peoples and territories of the Union is enshrined in the Treaties and, this being the case, it is essential that it be defended.
The fact that the progress made has been uneven, and, more importantly, that unacceptable regional disparities remain, giving rise to the marginalisation of the less developed regions, should therefore be underlined - and this report does so - in an appeal to the States to support the efforts for regional economic convergence made at European level.
The report' s authors, who, quite rightly, think it essential to ensure an extremely high degree of consistency between action taken at a European level under the heading of cohesion policy, and Member States' domestic policies that support development, therefore call on the Member States, in accordance with the principles of additionality and subsidiarity, to support this drive for regional economic convergence instigated at European level, by means, for example, of an appropriate investment policy.
This drive is all the more important given that we must overcome the challenge posed by enlargement.
Cohesion should, in this regard, be even greater if we want to avoid these disparities between regions dramatically increasing upon enlargement.
Finally, I will fully support Amendment No 49, which underlines all the possible shortcomings of the 0.45% of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy, if we want to establish an effective cohesion policy that brings genuine solidarity.
. I voted in favour of this report, but would like to stress some key aspects in relation to fisheries policy.
The preservation of historical fisheries interests is inextricably linked to economic and social cohesion in fisheries-dependent communities.
Under the principle of relative stability, the proportions of stocks allotted to given states in given fisheries remain constant.
When catch opportunities increase or decline in a given fishery, all states with legally recognised stakes in that fishery derive a proportional share of the spoils.
Relative stability is fundamental to fisheries policy and the maintenance of fish stocks, and should not be undermined.
Moreover, the importance of the Hague preferences must also be stressed.
The Hague preferences recognise the extent to which many coastal communities are fisheries-dependent and offer additional protection.
The socio-economic role of these arrangements cannot be exaggerated - they must be maintained as not only fundamental to the Common Fisheries Policy but also integral to the basic objectives of cohesion policy.
Finally the importance of FIFG funding must be emphasised when it comes to fisheries-dependent communities, and in particular with regard to fleet renewal for safety reasons for a sector that operates in a clearly hostile environment.
. (FR) I believe there is a fundamental contradiction between the so-called cohesion policy and the neo-liberal tendencies which dominate in Europe; in fact, widespread competition and privatisation run counter to genuine harmonisation.
This involves the extension of funds providing the necessary transfers and adjustments, which would, in turn, introduce positive distortions rather than pure market phenomena and the blind quest for profitability.
These funds could be provided by a unified tax on capital returns.
The Musotto report recognises this contradiction in its own way, for example by underlining "the need to adapt competition policy and fiscal policy" .
However, it immediately feels the need to make up for this by singing the praises of a private-public partnership.
In spite of their tentativeness, the report' s suggestions are sound: it calls for a better assessment of the effects of enlargement and considers the 0.45% of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy to be a minimum.
This is why I did not vote against this report, even if it falls far short of the requirements of a genuine policy for solidarity and equality on a European scale.
. The EPLP welcomes the conclusions of the Musotto report on Cohesion.
However we believe it is premature in the debate to take a fixed position on the future options for designating European Assisted Areas.
There will continue to be areas of need in the UK post-2006 and we would like the Commission to assess the role that both a safety net mechanism and transitional funding could play in assisting poorer regions of the UK post-2006.
It is disappointing that the British Conservatives failed, among others, to support this amendment.
In addition their failure to support a stronger role for local and regional governments in the management of European funding is a blow to democracy and partnership.
. (PT) This report has the merit of making a reasonable diagnosis of the current situation with regard to economic and social cohesion within the European Union.
We agree, in particular, with the emphasis it gives to the fact that cohesion is, under the terms of the Treaties, one of the pillars of the Community.
We also agree with the explicit reference to the delays in fighting asymmetries in development and in standards of living and even to the steps backward being seen in regions of some countries.
We must also agree with the need the report expresses to provide continuity and to strengthen future regional policy and, therefore, to oppose the possible withdrawal of some regions from Objective 1, for purely statistical reasons.
Nevertheless, and with regard to the causes of these situations of delay and backsliding, the report does not go as far as we would have liked.
Furthermore, in terms of the inadequacy of financial resources made available for the objective of cohesion, it omits essential aspects such as the absence of a redistributive aspect to the Community budget and the absolute need for a revision of the financial perspectives, all the more important on the eve of enlargement.
The report also ignores some crucial factors for the least-developed regions, particularly the harmful effects and, consequently, the need to revise macro-economic, financial and sectoral policies, which often prove to be profoundly inappropriate for these regions.
One of the greatest achievements of European integration was a result of the decision, in 1975, to bring about the solidarity and cohesion needed to reduce the gap between the economic levels of all the EU States and regions.
Today, we can say that the way we adapt our Community cohesion policy with a view to enlargement will determine the quality of the Union' s future development.
The European Parliament has, quite rightly, for a long time supported the idea that an appropriate economic and social cohesion policy cannot be reduced to the level of taking from the rich to give to the poor.
It is the analysis of genuine needs, magnified by the prospect of enlargement, that should be considered as a priority, and not fixed references to budgets set in the past for different contexts.
For, as the European Commission points out, enlargement will increase the development differential between the centrally located territories, on the one hand, and the peripheral and outermost regions on the other.
In this regard, I would call for the outermost regions to continue to be considered a regional and cohesion policy priority, through further advances to be made with the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
Furthermore, we need to adapt competition policy, particularly national regional aid, and tax policy in order to strengthen regional and cohesion policy, with the understanding that the Structural Funds are not sufficient to counterbalance the handicaps and the delays in development accumulated over several decades.
We also need to prepare for the revision of the common agricultural policy and rural development, in order to better coordinate the urban and rural dimensions of regional development.
Finally, it would appear urgent to create a European monitoring centre for territorial cohesion.

Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report (A5-0022/2002)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I voted for Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou' s report, which concerns women in Mediterranean countries, too.
In this regard, I would like to call upon all the Members to undertake to ensure that the European Union unilaterally extends the scope of Regulation 1408 on pro rata payment for the period of time a person has worked in the States of the European Union to all the citizens of southern Mediterranean countries, who have worked for many years in Europe and have the right to receive a proportionate pension for the work they have done in Europe, above and beyond the provisions of the relevant conventions.
Mr President, this report creates a depressing picture of the situation of women in some Mediterranean countries.
It demonstrates that they are disadvantaged economically, that they are disadvantaged in terms of health and, perhaps most significantly, in terms of education, with the levels of literacy among women in some Mediterranean countries way below that of men.
It is important that Parliament draws attention to that issue, but that is not sufficient.
We should also ensure that EU policies are designed to help women improve their standing in some of those countries.
For example, the MEDA programme so far has no lines particularly dedicated to the education of women, to improving the health care of women.
We should look at that.
We should also look at the way our economic relations with some of the Mediterranean countries operate and see if they could be used to enhance the status of women, for example, by supporting women's cooperatives and other activities.
. (FR) At first sight, we could ask ourselves why we need to be particularly concerned about the promotion of women' s rights in Mediterranean countries.
Equal opportunities policy is the same throughout the European Union.
We do not for one moment think, for example, that due to the particular circumstances or the mentality of men in Mediterranean Member States, implementing equal opportunities policy, a policy which is now firmly grounded in the Treaty of Amsterdam, would be any more difficult there.
We would not even call the men from these countries 'macho' .
They are certainly no more or less macho than men from Northern States.
But it is clear that, in Mediterranean countries that are not, or not yet, members of the European Union, the situation of women is more worrying in many regards, and that we need, and this is perfectly legitimate, to devote more attention to trying to remedy incidences of unacceptable discrimination.
I am therefore in favour of this report, with two reservations.
I believe that positive actions such as those laid down in paragraph 5b of the resolution and the creation of infrastructure should permit not only women but men as well to combine working and family life.
Paragraph 14 advocates the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank.
Do we really need to create a new bank, when we already have the European Investment Bank, which is quite capable of granting loans within the framework of the Barcelona process?
We need to be wary of creating precedents.
If we create a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, why not create one for the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, or anywhere else for that matter?

Hermange report (A5-0009/2002)
I voted for this report, which is an excellent initiative for creating a coherent, clear and effective policy at Community level on the problem of illiteracy.
This is a problem that has never received the attention it deserves, probably because until very recently it was taken for granted that the more highly developed countries did not have problems of illiteracy due to their systems of compulsory education.
It should be noted that the last Community actions specifically concerning this problem were approved in 1987.
Nevertheless, the OECD report on reading and writing, published in June 2000, clearly shows this not to be the case, in other words, that illiteracy is a reality in our countries, entailing high economic and social costs.
The OECD defined literacy as "the reading and writing abilities that adults use in their everyday lives, at work or in the community, to achieve their objectives, to acquire knowledge and to increase their potential" .
This being the case, the existence of illiteracy is a negation of one of the most basic human rights, which is the right to education, and is also a barrier to access to other rights, because it prevents people from improving their standard of living, restricts access to the labour market, limits individuals' freedom of expression and, consequently, their participation in society, and prevents them from enjoying the civic rights to which they are entitled.
The figures available to us on the scale of this phenomenon at Community level cannot be underestimated, because they affect a considerable percentage of the population of the Union European between 15 and 65 years of age.
It comes as no surprise, but always with considerable unhappiness, that my country, Portugal, is the worst affected.
Unless something is done, this problem will only get worse.
(The President cut the speaker off pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) Whilst recognising the fact that knowing how to read and write is a right for all, the report will be of little help in promoting a policy that can really make a difference in the fight against illiteracy.
I feel that the references made to teachers and trainers are only useful if we safeguard a genuine recruitment policy in national education, because this is a public service remit.
There are, in effect, tens of thousands of unfilled teaching posts throughout Europe.
The recent demonstrations by primary school teachers and parents in the Nantes region against the closure of classes and for the creation of jobs and a limit on class sizes are an illustration of this.
Finally, it is the damaging effects of liberal policies - unemployment and attacks against public services - that are the cause of an upsurge in illiteracy.
If we are to combat illiteracy, we must also combat poverty.
However, as the report does propose a certain number of positive measures such as equal access to fundamental rights for all, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, as well as specific aid to the EU regions most affected by this by this form of social exclusion, I voted for this report.
Hermange report (A5-0004/2002)
The EPLP has voted for the Hermange report on the scoreboard implementing the Social Agenda because there are many positive aspects to this report on the European Social Agenda.
However, there are several areas of concern where the report calls on the Commission to supply information on how it proposes to act on a number of requirements that are in the Social Agenda but which the EPLP did not support in plenary in 2000.
In paragraph 14 the EPLP could not support the call for a European right to strike and abstained.
The EPLP feels that this is already dealt with by Member State legislation and is also covered in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Terrorist attacks in India, in particular against the Parliament
The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:
B5-0053/2002 by Mr Collins on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group,
B5-0061/2002 by Mr Mann, Mr Morillon, Dr Tannock, Mr SacrÃ©deus and Mrs Maij-Weggen on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats,
B5-0072/2002 by Mrs Frahm on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,
B5-0081/2000 by Mr Sakellariou and Mr Van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,
B5-0089/2002 by Mrs Lynne on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party,
on the terrorist attacks in India, in particular against the Parliament.
Madam President, 13 December 2001 was a black day, not only for relations between India and Pakistan.
The attack on the Indian parliament by radical Islamic terrorists was an assault on the nerve centre of the world's largest democracy, on a freely-elected representative institution and on a multi-ethnic society.
The aftermath has seen troops mobilised on a massive scale and weapons systems massed in a threatening manner.
There is great danger that raids by terrorists will gain them access to these weapons.
The situation has been made more acute by the attack on the American cultural centre in Calcutta, which is suspected to have been the work of militant Muslim fundamentalists.
Pakistan has for some years been suspected of affording Islamic extremists a safe haven and giving them logistical and material support.
This time, though, President Musharraf ordered action to be taken.
Around 1 500 suspects were interned and some 400 offices belonging to Islamic extremist organisations were closed.
This is something that gives cause for hope.
The involvement of President Musharraf, a military leader, in the international anti-terrorist alliance has without a doubt helped bring his country out of isolation.
His words on television to the effect that he wanted to be consistent in fighting terrorism, must, though, be matched by actions.
It is much to be desired that those Taliban fighters who have gone to ground in Pakistan should be unmasked and arrested.
The radical Islamic religious schools, which are an intellectual breeding ground for the Taliban, must undergo organisational restructuring and the reform of the content of their curricula.
What is most important, though, is to investigate the causes of the sympathy for the Taliban and of the continuing adulation of them as freedom fighters over wide areas of the country.
There is a need for intensive intellectual engagement here, which requires that state education be made a priority.
People whose good education at school has gained them self-confidence and the capacity for critical judgement will also be in a position to resist all kinds of dictatorship and all forms of manipulation.
Pakistan must come to accept the idea of religious freedom for minorities.
This has been brought to our minds by, among other things, the most recent massacre during a service in a Christian church.
The Islamic terrorists responsible for it have still not yet been caught.
Anti-Christian discrimination - including at the hands of the public authorities - must become a thing of the past, as must the persecution of other religions.
India has demanded that Pakistan expose and extradite the ringleaders behind the attack on the Indian parliament, and it is quite right to do so.
Actually doing this, though, will require a great deal of patience.
The Indian rocket tests are ineffectual as a means of exerting pressure and constitute a provocation with counter-productive effects.
The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats calls on both parties in the conflict to bring all diplomatic means to bear on this crisis situation.
We must see to it that military force is renounced.
It is a matter of concern for me as vice-chairman of the delegation to the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation that Pakistan should finally ratify and implement the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism.
Overall, the path mapped out by the Lahore and Simla Agreements must be followed.
The European Union is very well able to play the role of a respected mediator, which surely all the parties want.
Our balanced policy has earned us a great deal of trust over the years.
Both these States and the security needs of South-East Asia as a whole are deserving of our commitment.
Mr President, recently, at the beginning of last month, we faced the unforeseen possibility of a heated exchange between India and Pakistan.
Luckily, this exchange was avoided thanks to the sense of responsibility demonstrated by both sides.
In other words, following the heated clash and the circumstances in which it took place, and rightly so, with the terrorists in Afghanistan, there was a risk of yet more unfortunate developments between two large countries with nuclear capabilities.
However, this does not mean that the problem has been resolved.
In this sense, the purpose of our debate here today is to remind both countries, both India and Pakistan, of their responsibilities towards their people and the neighbouring region.
At the same time, however, we too need to assume our responsibility, as the European Union, to help find a peaceful solution to all the differences in the area, to respect for international law and human rights and to anything and everything relating to the Rule of Law and human rights.
However, this endeavour should not lead us to overlook the fact that Pakistan does indeed have a serious human rights problem, serious problems with democratic issues and serious problems with religious minorities.
These problems are not being raised here in order to accuse Pakistan or in a gesture of friendship towards India.
On the contrary.
They are being raised as urgent priorities which both countries need to address, for their own good, for the good of the area and for the sake of peace in the area.
Both countries are responsible for the stability of the area.
And both countries are responsible for future developments, so that these areas can stop being areas of poverty, misery and conflict.
In this sense, I believe that today's resolution and unanimous support for it from all sides of the House will make both a symbolic and a substantial contribution.
Madam President, let me say from the outset that I condemn terrorism wherever it takes place.
But I condemn in particular the attacks on the Indian Parliament and the US cultural centre.
There is no justification for terrorism, whatever the perceived provocation.
But we have to look at the root causes of terrorism.
That is why I am delighted that we have widened this resolution, even though we were unable to change the title; I would not like us to think that we are linking any country or organisation with these attacks.
We still have no real knowledge of who perpetrated them so I am very pleased that the Indian government is investigating it and that Pakistan is helping with that investigation.
It gives me the opportunity to address the wider problem: the threat of war again between India and Pakistan.
I welcome President Musharraf's announcement that he is clamping down on terrorism, but it is also important to look at the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, which has been going on for over 50 years.
I repeat the call for the EU to offer its services as a facilitator to both sides and to take account of the relevant UN resolutions.
What I am proposing is something similar to what Senator Mitchell did in Northern Ireland.
The people who continue to suffer are the ordinary people and civilians of India, Pakistan and Kashmir.
People who say a facilitator provided by the EU, the Commonwealth or the UN is no way forward are not offering any alternative.
We have to find an alternative to the bloodshed and to the continuation of this dispute.
I hope we will vote for the resolution, to demonstrate not only our horror of terrorism but also the desire to find a solution to the tension within this region.
Madam President, on 13 December last year an appalling and vicious attack occurred on the parliament of the Indian Union in Delhi, which is their most visible symbol of democracy and secular nationhood.
Let us not underestimate the danger this posed as, had it succeeded in killing the assembled government ministers and opposition leaders, it could have heralded a war between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers with massive conventional land forces as well - although India has at least declared a policy of no first use of its nuclear arsenal, unlike Pakistan.
The responsibility was soon traced to militant Islamic terrorist groups based in Pakistan, with full support and training from the Pakistani government, and also responsible for the earlier attacks in Srinagar against the Kashmiri State Assembly.
This is in clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1373 forbidding states from sponsoring terrorism against other states.
Nevertheless, I welcome President Musharraf's change of heart in backing the United States in their war on terrorism which toppled the Taliban regime and destroyed the al-Qa'ida network in Afghanistan, even though this regime was largely a creation of Pakistan's interservice intelligence agency; in particular, his speech of 13 January promising reforms of the madrassas, or religious schools, which fomented so much hatred of the west and bred an atmosphere conducive to the massacre of Christians peacefully at worship last year.
This is a promising start, but Pakistan has yet to accede to the request to extradite the 20 ringleaders of the plot.
There are deep concerns that the kidnapping of Wall Street journalist Daniel Pearl may have involved renegade pro-Taliban members of the Pakistani security forces.
There is now also some evidence from e-mails that the controller of the shoe-bomber Richard Reid, from my country alas, may have been based in Pakistan.
I call, therefore, on Pakistan to ratify the SAARC and all UN conventions on terrorism and I congratulate India on its restraint in the face of provocation and on its joint declaration with the EU in November last year against terrorism.
During the Afghan war in the 1980s we in the west supported Islamic militant ideology in order to oppose the spread of communism.
America, alas, paid the price on 11 September.
Will the west again repeat this mistake?
Madam President, I should like to express the Socialist Group's deep concern about the growing phenomenon of fundamentalist terrorism, not only in India but all around the world.
I express our concern about the threat this poses to democratic societies and reaffirm that acts of terrorism anywhere in the world threaten peace and stability, but no more so than in India and Pakistan at the moment.
Both of these possess nuclear weapons and one of them at least has not disavowed first use of those weapons.
We support India's demands for Pakistan to contribute to a full investigation into the attacks on the Kashmiri State Assembly and the Indian Parliament.
But we urge both sides to do all they can to avoid slipping into the prospect of war.
That will require willingness and leadership on behalf of both India and Pakistan, and President Musharraf in particular.
The only way forward is through negotiations.
We hope that India and Pakistan, with the support of the European Parliament, can take that road rather than the much more dangerous road for themselves and the rest of the world.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have had a close shave, particularly because a first text was distributed, signed by both Mrs Lynne and Mr Elles, which was truly unacceptable.
The work - particularly work that has been done through the night over the last few days - has significantly enhanced the text and has resulted in a document which, although still not perfect, is acceptable.
We must bear in mind the title of and the reason for this resolution, namely the terrorist attacks in India.
Therefore, the resolution is, first and foremost, an expression of solidarity with the victims of these attacks.
Dr Tannock outlined to us the disastrous effects that this attack could have had on the whole of the ruling class in India.
I think that the resolution underestimates them, just as we, I believe, are to a certain extent overestimating the effect of what are still, at this stage, only statements made by President Musharraf.
As Dr Tannock quite rightly pointed out, not all the madrassas, or religious schools, have as yet been closed down, and it is therefore vital that we maintain a firm approach towards Pakistan.
Furthermore, I would also say to Mr Souladakis that, in this case, balance is no real guarantee of democracy.
We are forgetting that India is a democracy and has been one for over 50 years.
Democracy is and must continue to be a reference point for Parliament. India is a developing country, which for more than 50 years has continued to strengthen its democracy with the population as it stands.
There is almost no other situation like this in the world.
There is China - India' s great neighbour, a great market, an Eldorado for many of our fellow Members.
And then, there is this great country that we all too often forget, where the Commission has made a fair amount of progress over the last two to three years.
The first EU-India summit has been held, and has been followed by a second one, but this is really not enough.
By virtue of its system of government and of its will to forge ahead with its development whilst respecting democratic values, India should serve as a point of reference for our cooperation policy with all the countries of the world.
India' s difficulties are infinitely greater than those of many other countries, in which we continue to tolerate a dictatorial regime, fundamentalism and other similar scourges.
I would therefore like to thank the Members who worked late into the night to transform the basic text and to make this into a document that supports India.
I think that we could have gone further in our support and that we must continue to exercise extreme caution where Pakistan is concerned, because Pakistan has, on many occasions, indicated its good intentions, but it is still not going far enough.
Madam President, I should like first of all to congratulate Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld on becoming the first Swedish Vice-President of the European Parliament.
I want to say how delighted I am at her election.
What happened on 13 December of last year in the Indian Parliament was unprecedented. The Parliament of a democratic, pluralistic country was attacked by militant Islamicist groups.
Parliament - the very heart of democracy - was exposed to a brutal assault.
People were murdered.
Democracy as a whole was called into question by these militant Islamicists.
It is important that we ourselves should try to understand emotionally what happened in New Delhi on that day.
Imagine if our own Parliament here in Strasbourg or our national parliaments - in my case, the riksdag in Stockholm - were to be exposed to a terrorist attack.
We should react in the most vigorous way.
It is perhaps difficult for us, as Europeans, properly to understand the real seriousness of what happened.
I want to address Commissioner Diamantopoulou and mention something about the Islamic religious schools, or madrassas as they are called, in Pakistan.
I believe that the Commissioner and the European Union have an incredibly important task when it comes to promoting a form of education in these schools that is based upon the ideas of love and of love of one' s neighbour and does not see other religions or other political outlooks with the eyes of hatred, for it is in these madrassas and other Islamicist contexts that hatred is disseminated.
Dear friends, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan has fallen, but the Taliban regime' s mentality of hatred and violence, of calling other people 'infidels' and seeing them as inferiors, is a frame of mind that still exists.
I would call upon Mrs Diamantopoulou to do everything she can to ensure that it is tolerance and the ideas of love and love of one' s neighbour that come to characterise education in Pakistan and, of course, in schools in the Middle East too.
Religion should be all about ennobling the soul, promoting lofty ethics and morality and giving people spiritual values - not about serving the causes of violence and hatred.
Pakistan operated as a training ground for the Al-Qa' ida terrorists.
It was one of three countries in the world that recognised the Taliban regime.
Afghanistan' s Taliban ambassador to Pakistan was allowed to remain there following the attack on the United States on 11 September.
Pakistan has a very great deal to put in order.
What President Musharraf has said is important.
We are now waiting for him to take vigorous action.
Thank you for your kind words regarding the election of a Swedish Vice-President.
Her election has meant a lot to us Swedes.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate you and wish you every success in office.
This resolution by Parliament is to be welcomed with satisfaction.
The Members of the House have stressed that what happened was an exceptionally serious terrorist attack against the supreme institution of greater global democracy.
The European Union has unanimously expressed its outrage at this event.
The Council has made a number of statements condemning these incidents and expressing the solidarity of the European Union with the Republic of India.
The Council and the Commission have also stressed repeatedly that Pakistan must continue and expand its anti-terrorist policy.
India is asking for Pakistan to take specific action to demonstrate that it is determined to stamp out all forms of terrorism, a perfectly legitimate request.
Following the attack on 13 December, we have witnessed an unprecedented influx of troops along the border between the two countries and the increased tension and military clashes are causing concern.
We therefore welcome the announcement by the President of Pakistan, General Musharraf, on 12 January, announcing drastic measures to combat terrorism and religious fanaticism. It is a step in the right direction and will help to defuse the tension between India and Pakistan.
The Commission will continue to draw both sides' attention to the need to cooperate rather than take the military option.
Next week, when the European Union and India meet at ministerial level on 14 February, the troika's message will be twofold.
First it will assure India that it has its full support in combating terrorism, as agreed in the declaration against terrorism at the second summit, and secondly, it will encourage both sides to return to the negotiating table as quickly as possible and to start withdrawing their troops.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
