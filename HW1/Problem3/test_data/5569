You will have my group's full support in this matter, and I am delighted that other groups in this House share this approach.
As far as Switzerland is concerned, we are told that Swiss internal affairs are being interfered with.
However, in an international trade environment, freedom is not unilateral.
Account must be taken of others' circumstances, and the freedom of one party stops where that of the other begins.
I believe that, when it comes to our excellent relations with Switzerland - and President Barroso reiterated this when he was in Bern the other day - this is how we must act.
At times, Switzerland has been able to divide and rule among Europeans, and everyone will recall the circumstances in which, after the Feira conclusions had come out and we wanted to adopt the Directive on the taxation of savings within the Union, some people used Switzerland to divide us.
I am delighted that the conditions for negotiating the mandate granted to the Commission will clearly enable the Member States to speak with one voice, while showing respect for Swiss sovereignty.
That is a very good sign, in my view.
To conclude, I should like simply to make an obvious point: when one considers the logic of the Swiss taxation system, the idea that a taxation system should take account of external costs is absolutely integral to the Swiss thinking on taxation.
To put it plainly, certain Swiss practices confirm the fact that, from the moment that production does not take place on Swiss soil, the cost of infrastructure or of employing qualified workers does not have to be incorporated in the taxation system.
We must - at the very least in terms of trade with the European Union - highlight the following situation: as the taxation system developed in certain Swiss cantons currently stands in relation to that of the EU Member States, we are losing revenue, since these production activities are being developed on our territory and the tax on the capital gains generated in this way is being channelled into Switzerland to avoid the need to provide any funding for these external costs.
I wish you luck in the negotiations.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on relations between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation provides us with an interesting and timely opportunity to reflect briefly on what we can learn from the ancient democracy of the small, yet historically important federal republic of Switzerland.
If the Swiss federal tax system were well known to the taxpayers of the EU Member States, it would be a model to be imitated - as indeed it is - especially with a view to protecting economic freedom.
I would remind the Member States' taxpayers that Swiss legislation is based on important principles, such as the principle of legal equality, the principle of economic freedom and, above all, the principle of the guarantee to property.
The principle of legal equality imposes the duty to tax according to economic capacity.
Thanks to constitutional provisions, the principle of economic freedom forbids the collection of certain taxes on trade that would be prohibitive in the context of trade policy.
Lastly, the important principle of the guarantee to property, enshrined in Article 26 of the Federal Constitution, forbids the imposition of tax when it takes the form of expropriation; thus the guarantee to property constitutes a limit to taxation.
That is what needs to be learnt by those Member States which, like Italy, still oppress taxpayers with their tax legislation and tax burden, which in Italy exceeds 40%.
From this great historical experience, we need to learn the principles of economic freedom contained in the Swiss Constitution.
Those of us from Padania have the good fortune to be the next-door neighbours of those free people of Switzerland.
Lastly, let us also think about the principle of freedom of belief, on the basis of which people are not obliged to contribute taxes to pay for the costs of religion if they do not belong to that religion, and also the fundamental right to express one's wishes directly through the referendum on taxes.
It is time to do away with the Member States' fiscal dictatorship over taxpayers!
Let the people have their say on taxes!
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Swiss citizens rejected entry to the European Economic Area back in 1992, no one would have been able to imagine today's emerging developments.
On the one hand, both the EU and Switzerland are benefiting from cooperation and bilateral agreements, for instance, in connection with security and asylum.
On the other, we have relentless negotiations, demands and even blackmailing, for example, in connection with the extended freedom of movement of persons and the taxation of savings income, or currently in connection with company taxation as regards which, it is the intention to use derogations relating to rail transit, which are so important as far as Switzerland is concerned, as a means of exerting pressure.
When Switzerland tightened its Asylum Act many years ago, the European Union did not hold back with its criticism.
This was designed to clamp down on the 75% of applications for asylum which were incorrectly submitted every year, which is actually what happened.
This about-turn by Switzerland, which has traditionally been so welcoming to visitors, forced those persons within our Union who dream of multiculturalism to reconsider, and the Union actually had to make an example of this Swiss Asylum Act.
Now is the time for us to seek solutions together to common problems which we face in the tax sector, as well as with regard to migration and integration.
Above all, we should use Switzerland as an example in terms of direct democracy, for only if EU citizens are once again under the impression that their intentions are being taken seriously, that they can have their say in matters, might we then be able to extricate ourselves from the crisis currently facing the EU.
The disputes surrounding the EU Constitution and additional EU enlargement offer adequate opportunity to use Switzerland as an example.
Mr President, the European Union has many bilateral agreements with Switzerland. These have seen the prospering of both the Swiss and Member States of the European Union.
The bilateral agreements should be recognised by all representatives of a joint and shared desire for prosperity.
There are further indicators that show the things we share and the direction we are heading: amongst other things, Switzerland is the second-largest trading partner of the European Union after the United States.
900 000 EU citizens live and work in Switzerland, while many more travel between these borders on a regular basis.
However, the present disagreement between the Commission and the Swiss Government is disconcerting and should be addressed swiftly.
I realise that the issue of double taxation which the EU and Switzerland are facing is no small one, but I would not like to see threats made in the preliminary rounds of negotiations, or in later rounds for that matter.
The issue of double taxation does not offer an easy way to investment, jobs and revenue for the Swiss cantons that allow the double standards.
The Council and Commission and Parliament should do its utmost to protect the interests of the Member States.
I wish you well in your negotiations and look forward to a positive outcome.
(LT) First of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia for the information he has presented about relations between the European Union and Switzerland.
However, I would like to hear what Mr Almunia has to say about the ultimate political goal of these relations.
In other words, is the development of closer relations between the European Union and Switzerland undertaken with an eye to membership of Switzerland in the European Union at a future date; if so, when can we expect this, and what must Switzerland and the European Union do before then?
If the development of closer relations is not aimed at Switzerland's membership, but is aimed instead at a privileged partnership for Switzerland with the European Union, then what should be the principles of such a partnership?
I do not think that bilateral agreements definitively solve the problem of Switzerland's political future; therefore, I would like to hear from Mr Almunia something similar to a road map, from which one would be able to see the direction of the Commission's work in developing the European Union's relations with Switzerland.
From the material presented it is hard for me to say whether the Commission has such a road map, or whether temporary agreements are a substitute for it.
My proposal would be as follows: it is necessary to produce a road map of the development of relations between the European Union and Switzerland, the ultimate goal of which would be either Switzerland's membership in the EU, or its privileged partnership in terms of the yet-to-be approved Constitutional agreement.
In order to choose either solution, it is essential to know the Swiss people's own opinion about the prospects for their country.
Until we solve this political problem, we will continue to make various agreements, and both parties to the negotiations will try to demand more favourable conditions for themselves at the expense of the other party.
As I study the existing and planned agreements, I have serious doubts as to whether we might just be making greater demands on Switzerland, which is still not a member of the European Union, than on the European Union Member States themselves. In my opinion, the opposite should be the case.
I hope that Commissioner Almunia might disperse my stated doubts by responding to the issues I have raised.
(PL) Mr President, Switzerland is viewed as a historic example of European integration by many people.
We need only to think of Jean Jacques Rousseau or Johannes von MÃŒller.
However, it seems to remain an island, a Sonderfall, beyond the united Europe which surrounds it on all sides.
Let us remember that, in a referendum held in 1992, 50.3% of Swiss citizens themselves voted against their country joining the European Economic Area.
I do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of the Confederation in any way.
In highlighting the good cooperation between Switzerland and the European Union in almost all areas, I hope that the right solution can also quickly be found in terms of taxation.
This is extremely important in order to achieve transparency in terms of our cooperation.
On behalf of the new Member States, including my own country, I would specifically like to welcome the outcome of the referendum held on 26 November 2006, which accepted the establishment of a Swiss Financial Instrument to the tune of one billion francs.
For their part, these countries have flung open their doors to Swiss capital investments.
In Poland, for example, imports from Switzerland rose by 20% during this period, while exports increased by only 5% less.
I am sure that Swiss funds will be used sensibly for innovative purposes, including scientific research, providing support for small and medium-sized companies, as well as protecting the environment and fostering regional development.
Finally, I would like to add that Switzerland has a particularly positive image in the European Union.
According to my data, around 72% of Europeans would be happy to welcome the Swiss Confederation into our common European home.
Perhaps it would be wise to make the most of this positive attitude.
Mr President, why are the Swiss doing so much better than us?
Why is the Helvetic Confederation richer, more content, more orderly and better administered than the European Union?
Allow me to suggest a reason.
Switzerland is founded on what one might call the 'Jeffersonian principle': the notion that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the people they affect.
The European Union, by contrast, is founded on the converse principle.
The very first line of the very first article of the Treaty of Rome commits us to an ever-closer union.
Whereas power in Switzerland is dispersed, power in the EU is concentrated, and from that one structural flaw come most of our present discontents: the unintended consequences of our directives and regulations, the inflexibility of our policies, the sense that the government has become remote from the governed, the determination of our national electorates to vote 'no' to Brussels at every opportunity.
Why then do we keep bullying and hectoring the Swiss over their refusal to join us?
Why do we attack their success in keeping their cantonal taxes down?
Why do we encourage that minority of Swiss legislators who see EU membership precisely as a way of sidestepping their voters and escaping their system of direct democracy?
Is it that we envy our neighbours their success or is it that we fear that our own citizens will be encouraged by their example to demand independence for their own states?
Let me propose an alternative approach.
Instead of seeking to drag Switzerland into our Union, why do our Member States not instead apply to become cantons of their confederation?
They are, after all, getting something right, these Switzers!
(PL) Mr President, there are many referenda in Switzerland and this is one of the reasons why I would not want to be a canton in even such a pleasant country.
Switzerland is a wealthy country, which does not have to be a member of the Union and, at the moment, does not wish to join the Union.
At the same time, it is a good, strategic partner for the European Union.
When one has such a partner, Commissioner, one negotiates and discusses, rather than initiating proceedings.
I agree here with my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
As a Polish MEP, the case of Switzerland reminds me of the unfortunate and, until now, unsuccessful attempts of certain German and French politicians, such as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, to unify taxation in the European Union, which would de facto lead to an increase in tax in my country.
There will be no consent to this move.
I am therefore not surprised that the Swiss now complain about Brussels interfering in the internal affairs of their country.
This whole matter shows that the Union should take a look at itself.
It should reform its own economy in such a way as to make it truly competitive, without resorting to proceedings, penalties and demands addressed to third countries or its own members.
Mr President, allow me just a few words.
Firstly, I wish to insist that the Commission considers relations between the EU and Switzerland to be very good.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to meet the President of the Helvetic Confederation on 3 April.
They discussed these very good relations, which do not exclude some legal problems, which can be likened to those which exist among the EU Member States.
Every time the Commission considers that the Treaties or Community legal provisions are not fully respected, as guardian of the Treaties, it is obliged to react.
This has been the case with the issue under discussion: the tax decisions adopted in some cantons of the Helvetic Confederation.
It is not about tax competition. It is about the enforcement of the rules that were adopted in our Agreement with Switzerland of 1972.
It is not about tax competition but state aid.
The Commission very often opens this kind of procedure on the grounds of failure to enforce state aid rules in the Member States, and it is a very important issue.
I do not know whether you are aware that over 20 000 letter-box companies have been established in Switzerland with the sole purpose of avoiding taxation in the European Union Member States.
We have been discussing this issue with the Swiss authorities since 2005.
We have not found a solution other than to open this procedure.
We are asking the Council for a mandate to negotiate with the Swiss authorities to reach a solution to this conflict.
I hope that, in the coming weeks, the Council will give us this mandate with the backing of a very large majority of the Member States.
I hope that during the negotiations, these issues, which constitute sizeable problems for thousands of European companies, will be resolved.
That concludes this item.
Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to issue a statement in this connection and I can say, quite categorically, that there will be no debate or discussions on this matter.
No speeches will be accepted.
The Conference of Presidents has instructed me to provide you with the wording of a press release issued yesterday by the President of Parliament and to make an additional comment in relation to this statement.
By a very large majority, the Conference of Presidents adopted the content of a press release which the President of the European Parliament issued yesterday on the issue of Mr BronisÅaw Geremek's mandate. Yesterday's press release reads as follows:
'The European Parliament has not, as yet, received any communication from the Polish authorities concerning Mr Geremek's mandate: BronisÅaw Geremek is a politician of high standing who has always supported democracy in his own country and European integration.
We will examine all legal avenues to ensure that Mr BronisÅaw Geremek may continue his work.'
(Loud applause)
My statement from yesterday continues as follows: 'According to our information, the Constitutional Court in Poland is currently also investigating the questionable law on which the withdrawal of Mr Geremek's mandate is based.
A decision by the court is expected over the next week.
I have commissioned the European Parliament's legal service to check the exact legal position.
This topic will also be discussed tomorrow by the Conference of Presidents.'
Ladies and gentlemen, this has just happened and the Conference of Presidents conveys its sympathy and solidarity to our fellow Member, Mr BronisÅaw Geremek.

Mr President, I wish to move an oral amendment to Amendment 19 so that the second half of the paragraph includes the words 'urges expansion of the temporary international mechanism and', with it then continuing 'urges the Council and the Commission to monitor changing circumstances closely', etc. This oral amendment would therefore simply add some words from the original paragraph 28 to the text of Amendment 19.

Explanations of vote
(DE) Mr President, the increasing fear of job losses, which has not only resulted in an increase in the incidence of various illnesses and, consequently, high costs on the part of enterprises and health insurance companies, combined with the associated risk of poverty, also diminishes the possibility and inclination of European women to have children.
However, children should no longer be the cause of a poverty trap and the conscious decision to have a home and family should not be punished by living the life of a pauper.
If we continue to drive forward with our policy of putting people in full-time employment and safeguarding jobs, we will not only reduce the level of absence caused by illness but may also help bring about a rise in the number of children again.
The questions of workers' health and working conditions, the organisation of health, hygiene and safety services in the workplace and the list of occupational diseases came to the fore in the Community in 1989 with the publication of Framework Directive 89/391.
Other directives covering various aspects of hygiene and safety at work have since been adopted.
The adoption of this report will hopefully lead to greater attention being paid to the effective implementation of these directives and to working conditions, with a view to reducing the figure of over 4 million accidents at work per year and over 4 500 deaths and injuries leading to permanent incapacity across the EU.
We strongly believe that there needs to be a policy of real improvement in the practices of the various Member States.
The Commission must, as a matter of urgency, submit a more thorough report on the current situation regarding workers' safety and health in the workplace.
Furthermore, the International Labour Organisation conventions and other legislation in these areas must be implemented.
The Freitas report being put to the vote today concerns the outermost regions and, in particular, RÃ©union.
The outermost regions suffer from geographical and geopolitical constraints that make them more isolated and less able to export their goods to the European continent.
Designed as it is to compensate for additional costs, this scheme offers support to local fisheries sectors by processing fishery products and transporting them to, and marketing them on, the European continent.
It also helps to increase the competitiveness of local companies and of the fisheries sector at European level.
The effectiveness of this scheme can be illustrated by the fact that this compensation has enabled RÃ©union to increase the volume and value of its exports since 2000.
Renewing this compensation scheme will enable us to continue our efforts to integrate the industrial, longline and coastal fishing sectors of the outermost regions into the internal market.
These efforts must be supported by other factors such as the taking into account of the variation in oil prices, because it ought not to be forgotten that the outermost regions rely heavily on oil and that transport costs constrain the export of local goods.
We are delighted that the report adopted today has incorporated all of the proposals that were tabled by the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP).
These proposals were already contained in the Committee on Regional Development's opinion, which we drew up.
Given their importance, we should like to highlight the following proposals submitted to Parliament by the PCP regarding the increase in the overall budget:
the increase of EUR 2 million in the overall budget from EUR 15 to 17 million, of which EUR 570 000 is earmarked for the Azores and Madeira.
the removal of the 75% compensation limit for transport and other related costs, thereby guaranteeing 100% complete coverage of these costs to continental Europe and for local markets in the outermost regions;
the removal of the expiry date, thus making the compensation scheme permanent, with a five-yearly review;
the local processing industry continues to be permitted to use fish caught by Community vessels where the local fleets' catch is insufficient to supply that industry;
positive discrimination in favour of traditional, small-scale inshore fishing;
the eligibility [for costs to be covered] of transport within each outermost region, in order to address the problem of geographical fragmentation, as in the case of the Azores.
I voted in favour of the Freitas report, for the following reasons:
1.
It takes account of the particular characteristics of the fisheries sector in the outermost regions, by ensuring compensation for additional costs incurred by the economic operators involved in fishing.
2.
The report proposes that the compensation scheme should become permanent, in view of the permanent difficulties faced by the fisheries sector in the outermost regions.
3.
It proposes the possibility of supplementing the Community compensation scheme with national aid.
4.
It proposes greater flexibility in the financial management of the scheme, by providing for variations in the funds allocated to each region or Member State.
5.
It proposes an increase from EUR 15 to 17 million in financial resources, which will fund the compensation scheme every year during the period 2007-2013.
In other words, although the Commission's proposal was good to begin with, Parliament's proposals have managed to make substantial improvements, by meeting in full the need to compensate the additional costs involved in fishing in Madeira and the Azores, which will now have an annual overall budget of EUR 5 million for the purpose.
The completion of the internal market and the gradual removal of trade barriers has helped considerably to boost economies of scale in the outermost regions.
However, the natural barriers to trade that remain in these regions put companies located there at a distinct disadvantage compared to those deriving full benefit from access to the Community market.
It is these geographical and structural conditions peculiar to the outermost regions that justify the compensation we pay for the additional costs incurred in marketing fisheries products from the outermost regions for the market in continental Europe.
Accordingly, the continuation of the compensation scheme for the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and RÃ©union into the period 2007-2013 means that we must finally adopt a specific development aid strategy for these regions, in particular in the fisheries sector, by strengthening the partnership.
Accordingly, this should be a permanent scheme, with the possibility of a certain degree of flexibility, in view of the specific conditions in these regions and in order to make best use of the scheme.
It is therefore vital we lend these measures our wholehearted backing.
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased with Mr Freitas's report, which takes full account of the additional costs faced by some French overseas departments when they export their fishery products.
The interests of Guiana and RÃ©union, as exporters of these kinds of products, have well and truly been protected.
The European Parliament has issued the following four requests, in particular.
Firstly, that the initial ceiling on compensation of additional costs, which has been set arbitrarily at 75%, be abolished.
On the one hand, this rate is not based on any logical criteria and, on the other, there is no reason why fishery products should not benefit from such a favourable scheme as agricultural products.
Secondly, that State aid for the production, processing and marketing of fishery products sourced from these regions be possible and that compensation be awarded for imported products, such as salt and oil, that are used during the processing of fishery products.
Thirdly, that recourse to intra-Community imports be permitted, if the catches of the outermost regions' fleets are not large enough to guarantee the profitability of the processing industries in these regions.
Finally, that the financial envelope for Guiana and RÃ©union be increased to EUR 5 518 000.
The Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) were established following the reform of the common fisheries policy adopted in 2002.
Council Decision 2004/585/EC defines a general framework for the running of the RACs in order to ensure that they are dealt with in a consistent and balanced manner.
The Commission's proposal, supported in full by Parliament's rapporteur, is aimed at putting the RACs on a sounder operational basis by improving the conditions under which they are funded.
The amendments introduced are intended to ensure that the Community contribution is not digressive, as originally proposed.
I shall be voting in favour of this report.
We support this report, which improves the operating conditions of the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs).
Their mainstreaming into the budget means that the Community contribution will no longer be digressive and that they will become subject to a single method of accounting.
The key issue that needs to be addressed, however, is that of the RACs' long-term financial viability.
Given that the RACs are an integral part of the common fisheries policy (CFP), Community funding for their normal operations should be guaranteed on a permanent basis.
The report before us applies to funding and not to other aspects of the Council decision such as the number, composition and functioning of the RACs, which will be dealt with in another review of Decision 2004/585/EC.
It is difficult at present to carry out an assessment of the RACs given that only four of the seven are operational.
Our support for this proposal is based, however, on a vision of the RACs as an instrument for encouraging the decentralisation of the CFP, for ensuring that the fishermen and their representative bodies are involved in the decision-making process regarding the CFP - which we feel is not completely the case at the moment - and for guaranteeing that the interests of all Member States on the issue of fisheries are fairly represented.
(SK) I voted for the report produced by Esther Herranz GarcÃ­a because it sends an important message to people with disabilities, especially women who experience various difficulties in everyday life and cannot make full use of their rights.
In my view there are still improvements to be made in helping the disabled, and I therefore welcome the European Parliament's efforts to improve social provision for people who cannot look after themselves and are dependent on help.
We should not forget the important contribution made by disabled people's families and organisations for the disabled, who provide us with a detailed picture of the difficulties and the barriers - including architectural barriers - which they face, and who suggest solutions for improving their quality of life and for helping them fully integrate into society.
I have a strong belief in the value of reaching out to people from whom something has been taken, but who have been gifted with the ability to see and perceive the world differently.
They perceive the world through different eyes and can perceive things the rest of us often fail to notice, or whose beauty often escapes us.
And the wonderful thing is that they can repay us many times over with their boundless dedication and appreciation.
in writing. (SV) This report concerns the Community's strategy for doing more to achieve the very important objective of improving the situation of women with disabilities in the EU.
We have voted against the report because we are confident that the respective national parliaments of the Member States can deal appropriately with this important issue.
We object in principle to the general trend whereby the institutions of the EU seek to achieve influence and competence within ever more areas.
(NL) Mr President, in 2006, 31 000 illegal refugees found their way to the Canary Islands and tried to emigrate from there to the European mainland - six times more than did so the year before.
We have seen similar scenes in Southern Italy and Lampedusa.
If the human tragedy of the refugees is to be addressed, it must be done by tackling the hopeless situation in their countries of origin, not by importing transitory social tension.
Accordingly, our group welcomes Frontex and the establishment of intervention brigades in the countries that are facing the problem of mass immigration, on the condition that this new instrument is deployed efficiently and not simply serves as a media spectacle.
External border control falls within the Member States' remit, but the flows of refugees that are common today illustrate that these external borders have become too permeable.
The exponential influx of illegal immigrants can therefore only be addressed by taking additional, but not replacement, measures to support the Member States, which, it is to be hoped, is where Frontex will come in.
(NL) Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Deprez report, because the amendments to the Commission's text generally contain technical corrections.
Frontex's rapid intervention teams are desperately needed, certainly in light of the huge shortcomings of various Member States when it comes to protecting external borders.
We will have to wait and see how efficient these teams will prove to be in practice.
The entire concept hinges on the willingness of all Member States to meet their Schengen obligations.
There is currently far too much apathy, far too much leniency, and mass regularisations of illegal immigrants have put the entire Schengen concept at risk.
Even if the Frontex rapid intervention teams work well and efficiently, this will all be in vain if some Member States refuse to face up to their political responsibility.
(DE) Mr President, I also voted for the Deprez report since, in my opinion, it is undoubtedly sensible at this time to use the planned troop deployment to strengthen the southern borders in order to bring the threat posed by hordes of refugees under control.
In this connection, however, we should not forget the other main routes, above all, our external borders with Eastern Europe.
In this context, I believe that the resources available under Frontex should be substantially increased.
At the same time, we must demonstrate the realities of Europe in the countries of origin of illegal immigrants, so that the dream of a land of milk and honey no longer prompts such acts of desperation and ensures that cooperation with these countries in the area of repatriation, which is indeed largely financed by us, functions more effectively.
We are opposed to the creation at EU level of what are called Rapid Border Intervention Teams along the borders of the different Member States, as it is indicative of the EU's repressive, military nature.
This measure forms part of the current trend towards security at all costs and reflects the policy of criminalising immigration, which illustrates a lack of respect for human dignity and for fundamental human rights.
These rapid border intervention teams, the walls and the immigrant detention centres are instruments for implementing a Fortress Europe policy, to which we are vehemently opposed.
This measure is being justified on the grounds of combating illegal immigration.
I wish to highlight the fact that one of the main components of the policy put forward is repression, whilst overlooking the real causes of immigration, namely poverty, hunger, war, the lack of prospects of a decent life for millions and millions of human beings, including Portuguese people, caused by capitalist exploitation and the brutal centralisation of wealth.
On the other hand, given that border protection falls under the competences of a State, we feel that this proposal - despite some safeguards - represents a further step towards creating a European coastguard, which, if it materialised, would constitute an attack on national sovereignty.
Hence our vote against the report.
in writing. (SV) I voted in favour of the report because I believe that the RABIT mechanism is necessary for coping with the extraordinary migratory pressure to which a number of EU Member States are periodically subject.
RABIT has a voluntary basis and is not an attempt to build walls to shut out the surrounding world.
I believe, rather, that it is important for the Member States to cooperate if they are effectively to combat trafficking in human beings and illegal people-smuggling, which often put at risk the lives of those who, in desperation, have been forced to leave their home countries.
Thousands of people die each year in attempting to reach Europe in ways that are unsafe.
RABIT is part of the work designed to prevent people from dying in the hands of cynical people-smugglers.
As a Social Democrat, I am working to achieve a generous and humane refugee policy and want to increase people's opportunities for finding their way to Europe legally.
in writing. - (FR) The regulation submitted to us establishes a mechanism that is designed to provide a Member State that is faced with a massive influx of illegal immigrants with assistance, in the form of Rapid Border Intervention Teams, for a limited period of time.
This reserve, which consists of 250 to 500 border guards within the European Borders Agency (Frontex), will be made available to those Member States that need it in order to protect their external borders.
It is true that, although the control of the external borders is incumbent on the Member States and comes under the intergovernmental remit, the massive influx of illegal immigrants that occurred, for example, between 15 August and 15 December 2006, when immigrants left the coasts of West Africa for the Canary Islands, showed just how wide open the Union's external borders were to a rapidly increasing number of immigrants.
Cooperation among Member States would therefore seem vital in this area.
More than 31 000 illegal immigrants landed in the Canary Islands in 2006, that is to say, six times as many as in the previous year.
Although we are in favour of the principle of the Member States' cooperating in order to protect the EU's external borders, we shall remain very vigilant regarding the trivialisation of Frontex for what are, essentially, media-motivated reasons, and to any federalist and supranational abuses of this agency.
I voted in favour of the creation of rapid border intervention teams, provided these are only used in exceptional cases and emergency situations.
In my opinion, when a Member State is confronted with a massive, illegal flow of nationals from a third country, this would constitute such a situation.
It must be emphasised in this connection that the human dignity of the immigrants must be observed and that individuals are not discriminated against on account of their gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or outlook on life, any disability they may have, their age or sexual orientation, nor should the Regulation have a negative impact on the rights of persons seeking protection.
Various principles and justifications - all of which are valid - can be put forward in support of maximum cooperation in monitoring, and taking action to protect, our external borders.
The EU as a whole is also defined by its borders.
In this context, it is clear that the Union's external borders are a territory under the exclusive sovereignty of the Member States, but also territories whose integrity, monitoring and protection is in everyone's interests, given that problems that arise on those borders tend to have ramifications for the other Member States.
First and foremost, one thinks of illegal immigration.
Yet there is also illegal trafficking and - on a rather different tack but an issue for which the rationale still holds - environmental threats.
It is entirely right and extremely important that we share the disproportionate burden carried by the Member States that, due to geographical reasons, have the most vulnerable external borders.
Quite apart from being an expression of solidarity among EU Member States, cooperation of this nature arises above all from the need to make border protection as effective as possible.
The idea of defending those borders should not be confused with that of protectionism or isolationism; it is merely a matter of observing the rules.
in writing. - (FR) Due to the fact that several Member States have been confronted with critical situations in the shape of massive influxes of illegal immigrants arriving by sea, the European Union has deemed it necessary to create Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
It is the solidarity among the Member States that is the cornerstone of this project.
These teams have not been put in place with the aim of turning back these people.
Rather, the aim is to provide European assistance to those Member States that admit too great an influx of illegal immigrants.
Indeed, the events of last summer have confirmed the urgent need for difficult situations to be anticipated, as much for the Member States of destination or of transit as for the immigrants themselves.
These teams will therefore have the task of patrolling the areas surrounding the EU's external borders under the authority of the national border guards of the host Member State.
Members of the rapid intervention teams will be able to exercise all of the powers necessary to carry out the activities of checking or monitoring the borders.
However, it is stipulated that they shall have to fully respect people's human dignity when carrying out their activities; equally, they shall have to respect the fundamental rights recognised by the European Union.
To conclude, the concerns expressed in some quarters about the use of these rapid border intervention teams must not become a reality over time.
in writing. (SV) We have chosen to vote against the report because we believe that the tonnage redistribution levels proposed by the Commission are adequate.
Moreover, we question the need for increased aid for an already over-established sector.
The EU already has considerable over-capacity in its fishing fleet, together with limited fisheries resources.
The difficulties, discussed in the Council, of checking that the catch capacity does not increase with conversion is therefore one of the reasons why we have chosen not to support an increase in the levels concerned.
In June 2006, after the political agreement reached in the Council on the new European Fisheries Fund, a decision was taken to amend two provisions of the basic regulation on the revised common fisheries policy (2371/2002) applying to the management of fishing fleet capacity.
The amendment is aimed at permitting some adaptations of the fleet to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene, product quality on board and energy efficiency.
The amendment will give the Member States the possibility for a limited increase in the capacity of their fleet for the purpose of improving safety, working conditions, hygiene and product quality on board, as well as energy efficiency.
I shall be voting in favour of this report.
This report concerns the amendment of Articles 11 and 13 of Regulation 2371/2002, the main instrument for reviewing the 2002 common fisheries policy.
One of the problems with the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) was that it jeopardised Community aid for modernising and renovating the fleets provided for in the previous financial instrument.
The current proposal, from June 2006, subsequent to the EFF, provides for limited aid for modernising the fleet to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene.
It covers energy efficiency, providing for the use of 4% of the tonnage withdrawn with public aid.
Furthermore, it states that the reduction in power following the replacement of an engine with public aid may not be restored.
In spite of our reservations regarding the Commission's proposal, our vote in favour is based on two proposals made by the rapporteur, which are as follows:
the 10% of the tonnage scrapped can be used for modernisation, which, being limited, will allow for prioritising the modernisation of small-scale coastal fishing vessels, that is to say, vessels with an overall length of less than 12 metres;
making aid for replacing engines for the purposes of energy efficiency more flexible.
The Galileo Programme (the European satellite radio navigation programme) can be an important instrument.
By providing a public service, it will provide an opportunity for cooperation, scientific advancement and the exchange of accessibility and information.
The project should be rooted in a strategy of public investment and monitoring.
Solutions ensuring its funding must be found in the context of international cooperation.
The Galileo system is viewed with interest by countries such as China and India, which could be important partners in the project.
This will help end the GPS monopoly and create instead a project based on broad international cooperation.
We feel that all users should be guaranteed universal access and that the general public should have access to available information free of charge.
It is necessary to reaffirm, however, that, when it comes to this project, the citizens' rights, guarantees and freedoms must be guaranteed and that it is not used for military purposes - the rejection of the militarisation of space and its use for military purposes - and/or for the purposes of enforcing excessive security, in contravention of what is currently laid down.
The Galileo Programme is, without question, one of the cornerstones of the Lisbon Strategy, given its technological scope and the expected added value in terms of not only jobs but also technological progress.
The potential economic growth from the programme is a very important factor for the European economy.
We are responsible for guaranteeing that the conditions for its implementation are created with the necessary clarity, effectiveness and speed.
Accordingly, I share my colleagues' concern that the negotiations on the concession contract are deadlocked, because these delays will have a considerable impact on the overall cost of the project.
At the moment, I feel it is vital that we channel our efforts into ensuring that, in June, the Commission submits a clear, credible timetable, solutions for the future financial obligations and alternative scenarios for carrying out the programme.
The Council will then be in possession of all the necessary data to ensure the continuity of the process, in order to make up for the delays.
The resolution therefore has my full backing.
in writing. - (FR) We voted in favour of the resolution on the Galileo satellite navigation project.
We have had the opportunity on several occasions in this Chamber to express our support for an ambitious industrial project, in which, for once, the European dimension had a full part to play, even though we have also highlighted the project's shortcomings and flaws, such as its purely civil dimension and the transfer of technology to non-European countries such as China, that Communist dictatorship and exponent of unfair commercial competition.
Today, the negotiations on the deployment and use of the system are at a standstill.
Furthermore, it occurs to me that it was because of the political will of States that were very pragmatic in their efforts to cooperate with each other that all of the technical, human and financial resources were provided for the construction of a European aerospace industry and that Airbus came about.
In the case of Galileo, because the Eurocracy has extended its powers, it is the Brussels-centred Commission that is struggling to negotiate with private partners, and the discussions are stalling over money-related issues.
Clearly, the first method was by far the best.
in writing. (SV) We believe that human rights are universal and inviolable and that they need to be among the foundation stones of all societies.
Unfortunately, violations occur in many places around the world, including in the EU Member States.
A large part of the European Parliament and its Members see themselves as the guarantors of human rights in the world.
These Members must not be thought any the less of, because they undoubtedly have good intentions, and it is essential to fight for these fundamental rights.
The difficulty arises when human rights are used as a means of promoting the EU's positions on, for example, developing a common foreign and security policy.
We have voted against quite a few amendments that we basically think are logical, fair and, in certain cases, also desirable but that should not under any circumstances be tabled, or decided on, by this House.
Once again, the majority in Parliament has drawn up a report on human rights around the world, which, although it contains some points with which we agree, is essentially characterised by an overriding manipulative and reductive view of human rights - political, social, economic and cultural - using them as grounds for interventionism and for exerting political pressure in some countries, always for the EU's interests and convenience.
It is a strategy of using human rights that involves an attempt to exploit the United Nations Human Rights Council, where the idea is to isolate those countries that do not kowtow to the dictates of imperialism.
As we have highlighted before, this is an act of extreme hypocrisy in which countries referred to as 'friends' are safeguarded and the 'others', which the USA and the EU have pinpointed as a target, are criticised.
This is an exercise with which we can have no truck.
Once again, the report is completely remiss when it comes to Israel; it completely overlooks Israel's brutal policy of aggression and occupation of Palestine, and the fact that Israel systematically violates international law and undermines the Palestinian people's inalienable right to their own sovereign, independent and viable state.
in writing. - (FR) Despite its claim to be exhaustive, the report on human rights in 2006 does not mention any of the main causes of the violation of these rights: Communism, which still oppresses more than one and a half billion people, in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and I could go on.
In every country in which they are in power, Communists deny people's fundamental rights, persecute their opponents, and send them in their millions to concentration camps.
On our continent, Communism has enslaved 300 million Europeans.
Today, despite the fall of the Berlin Wall, it continues to exercise its intellectual terrorism.
The fact that Mr Coveney does not dare mention the word in his report proves this.
Some of our fellow Members, such as Mr Cohn-Bendit, go as far as to want to ban the people of Poland from de-Communising their country.
That is an insult to the memory of the workers of Gdansk, of the insurgents of Berlin in 1953, of Budapest in 1956, of Prague in 1968 and of all the freedom fighters.
Since 1917, Communism has killed more than 100 million people.
Our Parliament, which has so much to say on the subject of human rights, should demand that Communism be put on trial.
Among the various points raised in the report there is one that should be stressed repeatedly.
I refer to point 10: 'Reiterates that, in their future Annual Reports on Human Rights, the Council and the Commission should analyse the ways in which human rights are dealt with in other EU policies, such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the policies on development and trade and immigration, and other relevant policies relating to the EU's external relations...'
The EU's role in the world and in particular in its immediate neighbourhood involves its ability to use soft power to increase universal respect for human rights.
On the other side of that coin, the time has come for us to address seriously the enormous threat to the spread of human rights arising from China's cooperation strategy and international aid, China being an emerging power in this area.
The time has come for us to rethink our strategy so that we follow the most effective path, in accordance with the values that we advocate and seek to promote.
British Conservatives recognise the important role of the EU in promoting human rights and democracy in the world, as it is highlighted in the Coveney report.
However, there are a number of paragraphs that we fundamentally disagree with, for instance paragraphs 4, 16, 28, 31, 47 and 132.
For this reason, British Conservatives abstained overall in the final vote on the report.
As we have said before, we welcome the initiative of tabling a motion for a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly calling for the adoption of a universal moratorium on the death penalty, which, according to reports, has the support of 88 countries.
The abolition of the death penalty is something to which millions of men and women throughout the world aspire.
Indeed, an increasing number of countries have removed it from their national law or have established a moratorium on its use.
We feel that this step is of benefit to civilisation and that ideally it should be extended to other countries.
This initiative could be a positive step in that direction.
I voted in favour of this Resolution as I believe in the dignity of the human being, which should never be taken away through sentencing to death.
If there is one cause to which we can and must adhere without any doubt or hesitation, this would be it.
The reasons are self-explanatory.
A society that does not consider life to be the highest value, the standard, the foundation, will always be a society that is capable of the worst atrocities.
For this reason, I am not surprised by the bloodthirsty countries that sentence their opponents to death without compunction.
I believe that we have a duty, and perhaps the ability, to stop them.
What surprises me more are the democratic countries that impose the death penalty, as though they had been struck by a sudden inability to judge right from wrong or by a breakdown of values.
I do not wish to digress here, but I must say I am struck by the notion of condemning the death of an adult citizen, even if that person is guilty of a heinous crime, whereas the life of an unborn baby is not deemed worthy of protection.
I shall conclude by saying that this commitment on the part of the EU is one to which I lend my backing.
I would also express the wish that the Member States and the EU as a whole follow up their words with action.
(FI) Mr President, I am absolutely opposed to discrimination against homosexuals, but I hope that this House will one day draw up a resolution which no longer needs to be confused with the unsatisfactory concept of homophobia.
I have spoken about this before and I wish to do so again.
If we are talking here about a real problem, discrimination, which we really must do something about, why on earth do we use the inappropriate word 'phobia' in this connection?
Phobias are different types of anxiety: they are states of fear considered neurotic disturbances.
Therapy is needed to help cure them, and they cannot be cured through political action, just as claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces, or arachnophobia, the fear of spiders, cannot.
I am sorry if people are starting to be made to feel guilty about their feelings or phobias.
That will only result in another new form of discrimination and manipulation.
I am sorry too if this resolution has discriminated against Poland by giving a mistaken picture of events and views there.
Because of these points relating to Poland and after thinking long and hard, I ended up abstaining.
I wish, however, to express my sympathy for all those homosexuals who have had to suffer real discrimination and injustice.
(NL) Mr President, it goes without saying - and I do not know anybody in this House who will beg to differ - that discrimination of homosexuals on account of their orientation is unacceptable in our Member States.
This does not mean, though, that the right of deeply religious people to express their opinions freely should be called into question on account of the suffocating atmosphere of political correctness and intellectual terrorism that is taking hold in this House.
As Mr Claeys briefly mentioned yesterday, a freedom of speech phobia is beginning to set in here, an irrational fear of letting people express their opinions freely.
This is one phobia we must fight with all our might, because this resolution is overshooting the mark.
Where in the past, debates on homophobia were held on many occasions, these days, it is more about everyone indulging in a bit of Poland-bashing.
After all, as in the Geremek issue on which nobody spoke with any authority yesterday, this is how the Left-wing inquisition on the issue of so-called homophobia in Poland took the moral high ground without any knowledge of the subject, or intellectual honesty for that matter.
This is why I have voted against this resolution.
(DE) Mr President, I wish to state here in relation to the way I voted that I have not voted against this resolution because I am in favour of discriminating against minority groups.
I also condemn the statement made by the Polish Minister.
I voted against because I believe that there are more important subjects which we should be addressing this week, also in the form of a resolution, namely, the murder of Christians in Turkey.
We should be able to address the theme of Turkish women being forced to marry, including those living in Europe, or the genocide perpetrated by Muslim mounted militias in Darfur, or human rights violations in Venezuela as well.
I therefore voted against because I am of the opinion that we should have been dealing with more important topics.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The Group of the European People's Party today abstained from voting since it does not agree with the procedure at the present time.
The PPE-DE Group declares its support for the decisions taken by the European Parliament in relation to homophobia, in particular, the decision of 16 January 2006.
In this spirit, the Group of the European People's Party emphatically rejects any form of homophobia as well as all forms of discrimination.
At the same time, the PPE-DE Group has the utmost confidence in the institutions of the European Union, in particular, the Commission as the guardian of the treaties.
Given the existing legal position, key word - 'the anti-discrimination Directive', the Commission will take the necessary steps, as far as there is a need on the part of EU Member States, in order to put a stop to these initiatives which must be rejected in every respect.
In addition, our group wholly supports the bringing in of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to investigate homophobia in Europe and would like to await the results of this investigation before taking further steps.
The PPE-DE Group absolutely trusts in the fact that Polish society will take the appropriate steps against these homophobic trends which have started to appear.
in writing. - (FR) I abstained in the vote on the motion for a resolution on homophobia in Europe.
Firstly, this document does not cover the whole of Europe by focusing on Poland, and the title of the resolution is therefore, in my view, too general.
Furthermore, I find it simplistic that the fight against homophobia is being treated mainly as a fight against discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.
This confusion between homophobia, which is defined as 'the fear of one's fellow man', and an aversion to homosexuality is a source of misunderstandings.
I am naturally in favour of the fight against all forms of discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation, marriage- and child-related issues apart. These are issues on which political thought needs to develop in line with the demand within society.
Nevertheless, I believe that the issue of the unequal treatment of human beings and the fear of our fellow men deserve better than this resolution, even though I agree with many points made in this document.
The UK Independence Party will not support this resolution because we believe the European Parliament has no business laying down moral standards in different Member States.
in writing. (DA) In today's vote on homophobia in Europe, I chose to vote neither in favour of the report as a whole, nor against it, in spite of the fact that I very much agree with what the report says.
I voted neither in favour of the report, nor against it, because I do not think that there should be a 'people's court' that condemns Poland.
Instead, I think that there should be a proper court.
The European Parliament does not have the competence to act in this area.
If human rights are infringed, the matter should be put before the International Court of Human Rights.
We voted in favour of this resolution on account of its general defence of human rights in the EU Member States, although we do have some criticisms with regard to the wording of one of the points.
It is unacceptable to continue to foster homophobic practice and any form of discrimination against people on the grounds of sexual orientation.
We therefore support the call on the Commission for an anti-discrimination package based on Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union, aimed at putting an end to discrimination on various grounds including that of sexual orientation.
We advocate a range of measures to encourage the fostering of equal rights and opportunities for all, rather than mere formal statements not backed by legislative or budgetary substance.
We also support the call for stepping up the practical enforcement of existing legislation in these areas, to defend and promote human rights.
We object to discriminatory comments by politicians aimed at homosexuals, given that such comments more often than not incite hatred and violence.
in writing. (SV) We voted in favour of this resolution because it expresses the importance of preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
We do not support those parts of the resolution's conclusions proposing that the EU have increased power and the right to take decisions.
Our support for this resolution is simply a vote against loathsome discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation.
However, we oppose all those conclusions in the resolution concerning more power for the EU within various areas.
I am proud to have voted for this resolution and very much regret the antagonistic approach taken by some colleagues to its being tabled.
This is the European Year of Equal Opportunities in a Union which prides itself on its commitment to human rights.
However, we still have certain Member States, such as Poland, where the Government has yet to realise what such a commitment means in reality.
It means delivering on equality at work; it means that you do not use language which incites hatred and attacks on individuals simply because of who they are; it means respecting the human rights of others, including their right to assembly and to be protected from violence - including state violence.
I sincerely hope that this is the last time that this House has to address this issue as I trust that Member States will fulfil their duties under the law and under International Convention.
I extend my thanks to those Members from the states concerned who have also voted for this resolution.
in writing. (PL) The European Parliament's resolution might have been better or more precise.
However, caring about the image of our country cannot be an excuse for keeping silent in the face of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
Homosexuality is not a disease, as some of the Polish participants in today's debate have claimed.
Homophobia is the real disease which plagues many societies, including Poland.
The resolution touches upon a fundamental issue; the serious situation facing thousands of European citizens, including thousands of my compatriots.
In Poland, as in other Member States, there is a feeling of dislike towards homosexuals.
However, in no other Member State do members of the government and people in the public eye make statements which infringe fundamental civil rights and, as such, infringe the principles and values which form the basis of our democratic system.
In Poland, it saddens me to say, that homosexual people are harassed and insulted.
If they come out, they encounter verbal or even physical aggression.
If those in power do not go as far as to support these actions, they certainly do not oppose them.
Just as there is no place for racism or anti-Semitism in a modern democracy, there can be no place for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
Certainly not in the twenty-first century!
That is why, following my own conscience, I intend to vote in favour of the resolution on homophobia in Europe, as it calls for the rights of those people to be upheld whose rights many others, particularly in Poland, would otherwise deny.
in writing. (PL) I am voting against the resolution on homophobia in Europe.
I do not entirely agree with some of the contents of the European Parliament's resolution.
The text, which is based solely on information from Poland, does not reflect the intentions and the title of the resolution ('Resolution on homophobia in Europe').
Unfortunately, in the European Union, we encounter homophobia at every step.
The failure to mention the infringements of the rights of homosexuals in other European countries makes this document incomplete.
The statements made by politicians such as Maciej Giertych, JarosÅaw KaczyÅski or Ewa SowiÅska fortunately do not translate into specific legislative measures.
No legislation has been drafted which infringes the rights of homosexuals.
However, I am afraid that this state of affairs may change.
There is no support for the view that teachers who promote homosexuality among their students should be dismissed.
These kinds of irresponsible statements are offensive to those who wish to live in a free, tolerant and open Poland.
They are a threat to democracy and they do not reflect the views of the majority of Polish people.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has abstained from voting on the resolution against homophobia in Europe since it does not agree with the procedure at the present time.
The PPE-DE Group declares its support for the decisions taken by the European Parliament in relation to homophobia (in particular, the decision of 16 January 2006).
In this spirit, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats emphatically rejects any form of homophobia as well as all forms of discrimination, whatever its nature.
At the same time, the PPE-DE Group has the utmost confidence in the institutions of the European Union, in particular, the European Commission as the 'guardian of the treaties'.
Given the existing legal position (the anti-discrimination Directive), the Commission will take the necessary steps, as far as there is a need on the part of EU Member States, in order to put a stop to these initiatives which must be rejected in every respect.
In addition, the PPE-DE Group wholly supports the appointment of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights to investigate the situation relating to homophobia in Europe and does not wish to take further action before the results of the study are known.
Polish society enjoys the wholehearted confidence of the PPE-DE Group in that it will take the appropriate steps against these homophobic trends which have started to appear.
in writing. - (FR) Everyone is equal when it comes to their dignity, which must be respected and promoted.
This approach must forever guide all of our actions.
The procedure in Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure specifies that 'when placing a statement with debate on its agenda, Parliament shall decide whether or not to wind up the debate with a resolution'.
What is the point of the exercise if, even before the debate takes place, all of the motions for resolutions need already to have been tabled and the deadline for tabling amendments has already expired?
A dialogue of the deaf, then.
This resolution is not a repeat of the interinstitutional debate in which, I might add, only the initiated were able to take part.
The procedure can be criticised all the more for the fact that Parliament's services, which have already been consulted, are refuting the allegations that have been adopted.
Poland itself had already responded, on 5 March, on its Prime Minister's official website, to the fresh accusations being made by Parliament.
Although the title claims to be talking about homophobia in Europe, we have unjustly accused a sovereign State and its democratically-elected government.
This resolution will certainly be used for purposes other than to fulfil our desire to show solidarity with all humankind against all forms of discrimination.
The Conservative Party in the European Parliament has consistently opposed (and remains opposed) to the entry of the United Kingdom into the euro zone, and in doing so usually abstains with regard to reports on the operation of economic and monetary union, as these are matters for those countries who are in the euro zone.
However, we understand that the health of the economies of those countries which have opted to join the EMU is important to that of the UK and we support all measures which seek to ensure the economic stability of our major trading partners.
We are abstaining in this instance, but wish to state our endorsement of the rapporteur's strong commitments to sound public finances and the proper application of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Such principles are essential to healthy economic and trading conditions and a good relationship between the UK economy and the economies of the euro zone.
Parliament's annual reports on public finances put forward the same recipe regardless of the economic situation at the time.
The implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the biggest hindrances to economic and social development in the EU and in the least developed Member States that suffer from economic difficulties, such as Portugal.
The report clearly states the objective of using 'the economic recovery to cut their budget deficits and by making labour markets more competitive'.
The idea, in other words, is to cut the State's social functions and to deregulate the labour market in terms of salaries and the job security of public administration workers.
The primary objective of this report is no longer zero deficit but budgetary excess.
Naturally, the rapporteur is not comfortable with the 2005 pseudo review of the Pact, when there is clear evidence of the Pact's irrationality given the economic recession the EU was experiencing.
This, as we all know, is a political pact, the fruit of the prevailing neoliberal ideology, in which economic justification is just an alibi.
This has been our position since 1997, since which time we have been calling for the abolition of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Hence our vote against the report before us.

Zimbabwe (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Zimbabwe.
Madam President, honourable Members, the events of March have dramatically served to underline the fact that the crisis which has long been smouldering in Zimbabwe has escalated.
The brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators and opposition politicians, as well as the threats made against Western ambassadors, show a regime whose 'rule of law mask' has finally dropped.
President Mugabe is battling to hold on to power using all means at his disposal.
Given the deplorable economic situation (I can only recall an unemployment rate of 80% and an inflation rate above 1 700%) and increasing levels of repression, public opinion in the country is openly turning against him more and more.
This is now no longer restricted to just the general population.
Even his own party, the Zanu-PF party, is no longer fully behind him.
His attempt at the party congress in December 2006 to postpone the Presidential elections by two years to coincide with the date of Parliamentary elections in 2010 was referred back to committee, where it failed.
In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we have, over recent weeks, made it quite clear where we stand in relation to events in Zimbabwe.
In two statements on 12 and 14 March, the criminalisation of the peaceful 'Prayers Meeting', which took place in Harare on 11 March, was condemned, and the release demanded of those persons under arrest, along with a call for legal and medical aid to be granted.
In its note dated 13 March 2007, the German embassy in Harare, on behalf of all EU partners, emphatically called on the Zimbabwean Government to observe the principles of the constitution.
Coordinating closely between themselves, EU ambassadors in the country expressed to the Zimbabwean Government the fact that they were ready at any time to look after those persons arrested and injured by the government, and were also prepared to do this personally.
In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we condemned in the strongest possible terms in our statement of 18 March the renewed arrests and mistreatment of members of the opposition on 17 and 18 March, as well as the imposition of a ban on leaving the country against two female opposition members seriously injured in the attacks on 11 March who wanted to undergo medical examination in South Africa.
Following this, the injured opposition members were able to fly to South Africa.
The majority of members of the opposition who had been arrested were released.
At the behest of the EU, in its debate on 29 March, the UN Human Rights Council dealt exclusively with Zimbabwe.
In a declaration supported by 50 countries in total, the EU made it perfectly clear where it stood in relation to the current situation in Zimbabwe and called on the Mugabe Government to respect law and order, defend human rights and cooperate with the UN's human rights mechanisms.
We are all paying very close attention to the reactions of Zimbabwe's neighbours.
Our embassies in the region are involved in an intensive political dialogue with the governments of their host countries.
We all agree in terms of our analysis that there are increasing signs that solidarity with the Mugabe regime is crumbling throughout the region as a whole, not least under the pressure exerted by civil society.
In this regard, we are particularly hoping that our African partners will now openly show for the first time how important the solution of the Zimbabwe crisis is to them.
In addition to individual remarks such as those made by Zambia's President Mwanawasa when he compared Zimbabwe with the sinking Titanic, the policy change by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has particularly caught our attention.
At a special summit on 28 and 29 March 2007, its Heads of Government acknowledged their regional responsibility in the Zimbabwe conflict for the first time.
President Mbeki has been provided with a clear mandate to set a dialogue in motion between the government and the opposition.
His activities are to be supported by his Tanzanian counterpart, Mr Kikwete, in his capacity as current Chair of the SADC organ on politics, defence and security.
The Secretary General of the SADC will present a report on the economic situation in Zimbabwe.
The principal demands placed on Mugabe by the SADC are to keep to the date set for the Presidential elections in 2008 and to cease repression of the opposition.
On 30 March, the central committee of the Zanu-PF party decided to hold Presidential elections in March 2008 and to bring forward the Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for 2010, to 2008 as well.
Mugabe has been chosen as the leading candidate without any internal discussions.
At the same time, changes were announced which would forcibly improve the starting position of Mugabe and his party in the run-up to the elections.
These include, inter alia, the increase in wards and, consequently, their gerrymandering, the appointment, not through direct elections, of senate members in proportion to the strength of the party in Parliament, and the fact that if the office of President remains vacant, the new President shall be determined by Parliament and not through new elections.
These new regulations still have to become law as a result of changes to the constitution.
The government has not stopped the use of force against individual members of the opposition.
It has branded members of the Tsvangirai wing of the MDC opposition party terrorists and, in so doing, is trying to drive a wedge between the opposition which united for the first time following the March unrest.
The State has, however, refrained from prohibiting or breaking up large-scale events such as the 'Prayers Meeting' referred to in the country's two largest cities.
The ban on gatherings and demonstrations has also been lifted, except for several areas in Harare.
Already by the end of 2006, the party congress of the Zanu-PF party had demonstrated that Mugabe's position was no longer undisputed.
In the meantime, Mugabe has increasingly been developing a siege mentality, which has manifested itself, not least, in the formation of parallel organisations such as the youth militia, which falls outside the military and police hierarchy.
Their impressive, even oppressive, presence in front of the central committee's session building certainly had an impact on the decision-making process of politburo members in favour of Mugabe's appointment as a Presidential candidate.
Despite Mugabe's tactical victory at the central committee meeting on 30 March, which gave him the nomination as a Presidential candidate in 2008 and thereby weakened the position of his critics within the party, the feeling in Zimbabwe is that a sort of apocalyptic mood seems to be holding sway.
Therefore, within the EU, in addition to discussions on current developments, thoughts have turned to the post-Mugabe era.
Over recent days, both the EU/Africa working group and the EU/Africa Directors have looked into Zimbabwe intensively.
Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the crisis in Zimbabwe in detail.
In its conclusions, the Council welcomed the SADC initiative and declared its willingness to support it, if called on to do so.
It has underlined its view that only a broad, constructive dialogue can form the basis for genuine reform and national reconciliation in Zimbabwe.
At the same time, it has stressed that the EU will also implement humanitarian measures in future which will benefit the population directly.
In its communiquÃ© following the special summit in March, the SADC called on the EU to put an end to sanctions.
In view of the current situation in the country, we will not comply.
Our policy must remain credible.
Reacting to the unrest which took place in March, and this is something which the Council also decided upon on Monday, we will widen the consolidated list of persons subject to sanctions to include the police officers who are primarily responsible for the current crisis and the human rights violations.
There is agreement between the EU partners that a solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe can only be achieved with African help.
Following their political about-turn in March, our African partners expressly called on the EU to be patient.
We will continue to monitor closely, however, whether, and to what extent, the SADC policy which is being striven for is acquiring some sort of shape.
We are conscious of the fact, however, that we cannot sit back indefinitely.
In the foreseeable future, the EU will have to adopt a stance in relation to the SADC initiative in terms of its content.
We will also react with the necessary vigour to events in the country.
The EU cannot, and will not, remain silent on human rights violations.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their statements.
Every Member of this House will be aware of the appalling situation in Zimbabwe.
We have expressed our views in some 16 resolutions in recent years, but the Mugabe regime persistently reminds us that no matter how bad the situation, it can always make matters tragically worse.
Millions have fled the country; many of those who remain are on food aid; hyper-inflation is expected to reach 5000% by the end of this year; unemployment stands at 80%; 3000 people a week die from HIV-AIDS; and Zimbabwe has the world's highest orphan rate.
Those are the grim statistics.
When people try to gather or make any sort of protest, they are, as we have seen, brutally attacked by the regime's police.
I agree that there has been one positive development: Mugabe's latest brutalities have at last provoked a response from neighbouring African countries. This must be encouraged.
The Southern African Development Community has finally recognised that a crisis exists in Zimbabwe.
That is a very significant development. It is further evidence that opinion across Africa is shifting.
Mugabe is now seen by his peers as a dictator who has selfishly abused his own people and whose actions threaten wider economic development across the whole continent.
They no longer accept Mugabe's tired excuse that Zimbabwe's problems came from outside.
It is clear for all to see that it is Mugabe who has brought his country and its people to their knees.
He went into the SADC summit expecting endorsement of his policies, but instead left with a flea in his ear and the appointment of South African President Mbeki as facilitator of the dialogue between Zanu-PF and the opposition.
Mbeki's task will be to create conditions for free and fair elections.
However, until freedom is restored to Zimbabwe there must be no let-up on the pressure on the regime.
All too often, European governments have on spurious grounds failed even to apply the EU's own travel ban and other restrictive measures.
When Mugabe finally falls from power, the international community must be ready to act without delay.
I call upon the Commission and the Council to begin serious planning now for a massive, comprehensive and urgent programme of assistance to Zimbabwe for the post-Mugabe era.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, the Zimbabwe that I knew was a proud country, leading in the region, proud of its hard-earned freedom, a beautiful country, where black and white Zimbabweans believed in the future, where black and white together tried to heal the painful wounds of the Rhodesia era's racism, a country where citizens worked at building a democracy.
This is in stark contrast with the Zimbabwe of today, with its appalling statistics.
Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is currently one of the world's lowest: 37 for men and not more than 34 for women; 80% of the Zimbabweans are living below the poverty line; one third of the population have fled the country, with millions of people having sought refuge in neighbouring countries, and 50 000 more refugees being added to their number every month.
The economy of the country that was once known as Africa's grain basket, has plunged by 40% in one decade, and there is no improvement in sight.
The Zimbabwean economy is still shrinking by 5.7%, which makes Zimbabwe the only country in Africa whose economy is not growing.
The hyperinflation, to which reference has already been made, means it is impossible for the many Zimbabweans who stayed in Zimbabwe, with its mass unemployment, to meet their daily basic needs.
The European Union was right to decide to penalise with even more extensive personal sanctions the Zimbabwean leaders, who, with their state terror, have brought about this level of devastation.
As we all know, there is a great deal more needed to find a way-out.
This way-out is described in our joint resolution.
It outlines how the country might go forward into a post-Mugabe era, describes concrete steps and measures, and, rightly, makes a dramatic call on Mbeki and the SADC members to block the door to state terror, with as heavy a hand as necessary, and to clear the path for dialogue in the post-Mugabe era.
We are behind the broadest possible opposition to Mugabe and in favour of Zimbabwe.
We would ask the Council to extend the scope of the sanctions.
Anyone who is responsible for this ever steeper downward spiral in this country that was once so proud must be called to account, including ministers, representatives, army leaders, the police and the secret service, as well as the governor of the central bank.
We would ask the United Kingdom to use its presidency in the Security Council to add Zimbabwe to the agenda.
Finally, we really do hope that Mbeki, playing an even bigger role, will bring the Mugabe regime to an end, for, after nearly three decades, it is time for it to be done away with for good.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, if a specific country is often mentioned in Parliament it is a bad sign, as it means that the human rights situation in that country must be serious.
We are afraid that, in the foreseeable future, Zimbabwe was, is and will remain precisely such a country.
The paradox lies in the fact that we are celebrating the 27th anniversary of this country's independence.
Unfortunately, this independence does not involve freedom.
For example, one and a half months ago, the opposition was brutally crushed.
Two people were killed and 300 were arrested.
This is the political side of the situation, which we frequently most like to discuss in Parliament.
However, there is also an economic side to the problem which is perhaps even more serious.
In Zimbabwe, nearly 4.5 million people are malnourished, one third of whom have been helped by the World Food Programme, and have received food as part of that programme.
This is a country where the average life expectancy is 35.5 years.
As the previous speaker mentioned, Zimbabwe is one of the world record holders (in negative terms) in this respect.
One fifth of its population is infected with HIV, and there 3 200 new cases every week.
Zimbabwe has the highest rate of orphans in the world.
The unemployment rate in this country stands at 80%! Eighty per cent of the population also live below the poverty line!
Every month, a few thousand people flee the country.
Over 30% of its citizens have already emigrated to neighbouring countries.
Zimbabwe is the only African country in which the economy is in decline.
During the last decade, economic turnover in this country fell by 40%, and this year it fell by almost another 6%.
Last year, the average rate of inflation rose to 2 200%.
This year, it will no doubt exceed 5 000%!
Since 1998, agricultural production has fallen by four fifths!
Zimbabwe's two main industries, namely tobacco and gold mining are teetering on the brink of collapse.
These are all just statistics and, tragic and telling though they may be, I am afraid that dry figures, percentages and numbers may obscure the individual tragedies faced by millions of people.
Zimbabwe may be far away, but let us remember the words of Ernest Hemingway: 'Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.'
Zimbabwe is a country which has fallen into a 'black hole'.
It is disappearing before our eyes, it is ceasing to exist economically and socially, and the only sign of a functioning government is political repression.
We cannot remain silent.
We cannot pretend that sympathy, without any political decisions, will be enough.
That is why we need this debate; that is why we need this resolution.
We need a joint resolution, a resolution that is above political divisions.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, it sounds rather ironic and tragic when those who made Zimbabwe a colony, those who plundered its natural resources all these years, are today fighting for its independence and freedom.
Why does the European Parliament keep addressing the subject of Zimbabwe?
Is it because human rights are being infringed?
No, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us call a spade a spade.
It is because Great Britain dreams of making it a colony once again and because the other large countries in the European Union are again dreaming of new colonies on the African continent.
These are the facts.
Zimbabwe acquired its independence through a hard and bloody fight against the British colonists.
Are there problems?
Of course there are.
Is the situation as it is described?
Of course it is, but it is the result of years of colonialism, it is the result of the measures imposed all these years by the European Union and other imperialist countries, measures designed to achieve an economic stranglehold on and the political isolation of the Zimbabwe regime.
In the final analysis, if and how the situation changes in Zimbabwe is a matter for its people and neither the European Union nor anyone else is entitled to interfere in its internal affairs.
Today there is a plan which has been developing for many years.
What is this plan?
To fund and buy out the opposition.
Millions are being given to various persons who stand as political opponents to the regime.
Non-governmental organisations are being funded that consist of paid employees who stand for nothing in the community in Zimbabwe.
There are sanctions and, at the same time, Great Britain does not keep to the agreements it has made with Zimbabwe.
Even the illegal arms trade continued and Margaret Thatcher's son was arrested and that is a known fact and was reported in all the newspapers.
We therefore consider that the European Union has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe or any other country.
Any problems there may need to be resolved by the people themselves as they so choose.
That is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution and we are saddened by the fact that, although you know that all the measures you take and the embargo you impose on Zimbabwe makes things worse and causes thousands of people to die, you continue with the same barbaric policy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr Mugabe and mouse hunters.
Is there a connection between Zimbabwe's President and these people indulging in this rather curious pursuit?
Very much so, because in the immediate vicinity of Mugabe's estate - Africa's largest private residence - respectable citizens keep their heads above water by hunting mice on a daily basis.
Indeed, these animals are, according to them, like beef to us.
This is how deep Zimbabwe, up to recently Africa's grain basket, has sunk under Robert Mugabe's tyrannical regime.
This regime is founded on a campaign that is absurd and criminal in equal measure, as a result of which since 2000, thousands of productive farms have been confiscated from their white owners and handed over to Mugabe's incompetent and indifferent figureheads, resulting in a large-scale famine.
By the way, Mugabe's Zanu-PF Party uses the food shortage as a weapon against the opposition.
The correspondent R.W. Johnson recently levelled ultimate criticism of Mugabe's tyranny.
He reported that in Zimbabwe, people are eliminated on a mass-scale like animals and that most casualties are the direct result of intentional government policy.
This genocide is probably ten times worse than that in Darfur, yet it is ignored by the UN.
Arnold Tsunga, chairman of the human rights organisation Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, used identical words to describe the situation.
Tsunga called Mugabe's policy 'cunning genocide', because it is not being noticed by governments, aid organisations or the press.
My message to the Council, the Commission, and to this House, is that this indictment of cunning, implicit genocide should never give us one moment's peace until such time as it can be withdrawn.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Pafilis, four minutes ago, you gave the most cynical speech on Zimbabwe which has been heard in this House since 1999.
You will actually stop at nothing and are legitimising a dictatorship.
I recommend that you again take to heart the moving appeal given by Bishop Tutu, for I consider him to be above suspicion.
It is sometimes believed that it is impossible to sink any lower in a country if it has the lowest life expectancy worldwide, has the highest rate of inflation across the globe, if unemployment is running at 80%, if just as many people are living below the absolute poverty level, and if the economy has shrunk by 40% over the last decade.
Unfortunately, the power of the regimes in these very countries is still sufficient to hit out at the population, as happened most recently on 11 March.
Many were arrested and tortured.
As members of Parliament, we are particularly horrified by the brutal mistreatment of our colleague, Nelson Chamisa, who, en route to Brussels for a committee meeting of our Joint Parliamentary Assembly, was brutally beaten up at Harare airport by regime thugs, losing an eye in the process.
My thanks go to the Council which clearly expressed its views on the Council situation on 13 and 18 March and in the General Council as well on 23 April, and also expanded the list of travel bans imposed on leading supporters of the regime.
At least the SADC has recognised that there is a crisis in Zimbabwe and has employed President Mbeki as a mediator.
We are aware that unfortunately, Mugabe feels somewhat encouraged following the SADC meeting and repression is also continuing throughout the whole of the country without the international community paying any attention.
South Africa always plays a key role.
President Mbeki must play the role of mediator in a credible fashion.
We know how difficult it is to accept that a liberator can evolve into a tyrant, but it is in Mbeki's hands to go down in the annals of history as someone who, in the end, has also helped human rights and democracy in Africa on the road to success by taking the side of the long-suffering people.
(PT) The Catholic Archbishop of Bulawayo, Pius Ncube, recently condemned the poverty and oppression that Mugabe has brought to Zimbabwe in recent years and called on the people to take to the streets and confront the regime's armed forces.
He said the following:
'Mugabe is mad for power and he will cling to it, even if it means destroying the economy and destroying Zimbabwe.
Mugabe is an evil man, a bully and a murderer.
I will not be bullied or bought by him.
I accept that it may mean that I lose my life.'
(PT) Are the opposition leaders, human rights activists, those campaigning for Zimbabwe's development and this courageous archbishop receiving proper support from the Commission and the Council?
That support implies mobilising the necessary solidarity from other Africans of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community.
In the name of serious debate on Africa's problems and of positive interaction between Europe and Africa, will they too be invited and made welcome in Lisbon on the occasion of the EU-Africa summit during the Portuguese Presidency?
This Parliament resolution is important and timely in order for us to have clear answers.
Madam President, I am in total agreement with what Mr Gahler said with regard to Mr Pafilis.
I have never heard such perversion of the truth in my life as what he just said in this House.
First of all, I welcome the joint motion that seeks strongly to uphold the sanctions against the ruthless violence of the regime that is plaguing Zimbabwe in the worst possible way.
I thank those who have worked hard on this motion for a resolution, and I am pleased with the result.
Isolating Mugabe and other members of his regime is of the utmost importance in showing both the international community and the other African nations that the European Union Member States will not tolerate these blatant abuses of human rights and dignity.
We have consistently opposed this brutal menace and will continue to do so together.
Mugabe should remember his promise to step down and do so now.
This is the only action that he could take to benefit Zimbabwe.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Members of Zimbabwe's illegitimate government are not allowed to enter any EU Member State and I refer, in particular, to the EU-Africa Summit scheduled to be held in Lisbon in December.
The joint motion for a resolution makes clear and reasserts that this move would seriously undermine the European Union's resolve.
It would hamper the future use of soft power wherever we might need it.
The European Union sanctions in place put real pressure on Mugabe's brutal regime.
As such, they need to be reinforced, strengthened and taken to the next level.
As regards the next level, it is well known that Mugabe is seeking financial backing and support from countries, such as China, that are not always as firm on issues of freedom and democracy as I and many others would like.
This joint motion shows Parliament's determination to take this issue to the UN Security Council.
Finally, the money that we give to Zimbabwe must be spent in the proper way and must not swell the dictator's coffers.
I end by stating very clearly that we are for the Zimbabwean people but we are not in any way for Mr Mugabe.
(PL) Madam President, we were all impressed by the fight for independence of the people of Zimbabwe twenty-seven years ago.
At that time, Zimbabwean society was seen as an example of colonial struggle by other developing world countries.
This respect for the people of Zimbabwe now provides the main moral imperative to support the fight for democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.
Exactly a month ago, during the plenary session of the European Parliament, we saw the bloodied face of the democratic opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, on the television screens in this building.
He is now the true leader of Zimbabwean society.
Now, the oppressed leaders of the student movement, civil society, the trade unions, the European Union, the institutions and the European Parliament all have to do everything they can to help the people of Zimbabwe, to help civil society in that country and to help Zimbabwe return to democracy, freedom and the rule of law.
The Republic of South Africa and its president, Mr Mbeki, have a particularly important role to play in this process.
The European Parliament supports all actions to foster democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.
I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
1.
Recent repression of demonstrations in Russia
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on recent repression of demonstrations in Russia.
author. - (LT) As it goes about its activities and in its dealings with other countries, the European Union acts in accordance with its fundamental values, the most important of which are democracy and human rights and freedoms.
When addressing the European Parliament, Russian Duma delegates state they profess the same values as the European Union.
However, Russia is not about to listen to anyone's advice on how to deal with domestic matters.
The brutality against peaceful demonstrations by residents in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod expose the Russian Government's intolerance and fear of independent thinkers, especially as the presidential elections of 2008 approach.
As soon as Russia experienced the political and economic power of its energy supply 'weapon', it ceased to pay any attention to international public opinion and the signals it sends about breaches of human rights in the country.
Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, and for the sake of energy policy we apply a double standard: one for Russia and another for the rest of the world.
As we negotiate a new treaty of cooperation between the European Union and Russia, I invite the Council to take a look at events in Russia and not to make any concessions to it.
author. - (PL) Madam President, it is a good thing that we have managed, in this House, to draw up a compromise version of the resolution on human rights infringements in Russia, as it is important for the European Parliament to have a united position and to address both Russian society and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with one voice.
In the sad days following the loss of the first democratic Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, it is especially important for all those who have been rooting for democracy in Russia and for whom a democratic Russia ought to be an important partner for Europe, to now acknowledge that the Russia of today has not fulfilled all the dreams which we shared when Boris Yeltsin appeared on the political stage in that country.
Unfortunately, these hopes have remained unfulfilled.
We have to acknowledge this fact and that is what our resolution expresses.
I would like to once again point out that I am pleased that the resolution is the result of a compromise between many, diverse political groups.
I have to say that, for me, the images shown on television of how the demonstrations held by human rights campaigners in Russia were repressed, were indeed traumatic, as they also reminded me of the worst times in my country when street protests were brutally crushed by the police.
I would like to point out that, surprisingly, the Russian Human Rights Ombudsman shares this assessment of the brutality of the Russian police.
That is why our declaration contains an appeal to the Russian Duma and to our colleagues, namely Russian Members of Parliament, to set up a special committee to deal with this issue.
In appealing to you, Members of this House, to adopt this resolution, I would like to also appeal to the Russian citizens, who sadly currently do not have access to real information, to be aware that our actions are not a sign of Russophobia, as the Kremlin's propaganda often claims.
In fact, quite the opposite is the case.
Our actions, our struggle to defend human rights in Russia, to bring democracy back to Russia stem from our deep feelings of friendship towards this country and our deep respect for great Russian literature and for Russia as a great nation.
We want that nation to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy in the European Union and I would like the European Parliament to be an institution that is like a beacon of light for Russians, illuminating the path to democracy.
(DE) Madam President, this week, the European Parliament has dealt with Russia on several occasions, in the sub-committee on human rights with Commissioner Piebalgs, at a joint meeting of the Delegation for relations with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and now here in plenary, because the problems are becoming more and more acute.
We have observed the massive human rights violations in Moscow and St. Petersburg with dismay, where peaceful demonstrations against the authoritarian bias of the system were suppressed by violent intervention by the police, with attacks made against passers-by who were not involved and western journalists.
The intimidation and suppression of the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of the press in Russia has become systematic.
We are familiar with this type of disinformation and lies from the war in Chechnya.
Many media are under government control or operate self-censorship.
Independent journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya were murdered.
With 13 journalist murders during Putin's time in office alone, Russia occupies third place after Iraq and Algeria - an alarming result.
The political opposition cannot find any mouthpiece.
The freedom of the press and freedom of speech are under immense threat.
Potential political opponents of Putin, such as Chodorkovsky and Lebedev are sitting in prison without a fair trial and Gary Kasparov was arrested repeatedly.
Non-governmental organisations are harassed by means of laws which curtail the rights of civil society.
The Russian leadership is not only using its courts but the entire security apparatus as well in the meantime in order to intimidate political opponents.
The powers that be in the Kremlin are hitting out.
As a result, progress towards the rule of law and an independent justice system are also under threat.
It is a perfidious strategy to brand people who are calling for genuine democracy in the country as extremists so as to take away their credibility.
Putin is not a flawless democrat.
He comes from the KGB and his origins leave their mark.
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations, yet it violates basic fundamental and human rights.
The EU is negotiating a new partnership agreement.
This agreement must contain a section on human rights which is also a constituent part of all agreements and treaties.
We are showing our solidarity with our friends in Russia who are fighting for a peaceful and democratic future.
author. - Madam President, the clampdown on peaceful demonstrators some weeks ago sends an alarming message about the future of basic freedoms in Russia: freedoms of speech, the media and demonstrations.
The Russian Government committed itself to guaranteeing these freedoms as a condition for being admitted to the Council of Europe in 1996.
Today, 11 years later, the majority of people in Russia feel insecure and have no trust in law and justice.
Sixty-five per cent claim to be unhappy, and more than half disapprove of the Government, which is already heading beyond mere authoritarianism, as one opposition leader put it.
We expect the Russian Government to react to this resolution, which is a unanimous expression of serious but friendly concern.
We also expect the European Council and Commission to make it absolutely clear at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit that restoration of these basic freedoms will be a crucial test of Russia's ability and willingness to be a credible international partner.
At this point, Russia has become essentially an authoritarian state.
EU leaders will share responsibility for the further worsening of the situation there if they are not willing or able to face these new realities with determination and clarity.
Speaking with one voice, on the basis of European values, is the only way to help Russia back to the road of democracy.
It is vital that Russian citizens should enjoy the same freedoms - including freedom from fear and police violence - that we have been enjoying.
author. - (NL) Madam President, for a long time, the countries of the old European Communities laboured under the illusion that the authoritarian one-party state and the violent oppression of any form of organised opposition in Russia were a product of Communism.
I remember that the German radical student leader Rudi Dutschke, who has been dead for a long time now and was nick-named the BÃŒrgerschreck, warned the Left in Western Europe against this position.
In his view, what happened in Russia at the time was completely unrelated to Socialism or Communism, but very much related to what he referred to as an 'Asian' tradition.
This is a tradition in which a small group, using the toughest measures, manages to remain in charge in a large and sparsely populated country.
Every time someone in Russia is put in power who wishes to resolve this unsatisfactory situation, there has, to date, been every chance that his successor would have resorted to the old abuses.
Khrushchev in the 50s and 60s, and Gorbachev in the 80s and 90s failed to change Russia from the top down.
The current President, Putin, like the tsars and Stalin previously, seamlessly fits into this old Russian mould.
He managed to gain power when his chaotic predecessor, Yeltsin, was no longer able to run the country, and, having gained popularity among the Russians by destroying Chechnya, is now in the process of taking away their democracy.
Unfortunate is the country that owns oil or natural gas, because the possession of them, and of the wealth that exports bring in, puts the leaders in a stronger position of power and makes domestic change virtually impossible.
Moreover, the criticism levelled by most of the outside world that wants to buy energy will quickly subside.
Russia now finds itself in the same position as Saudi Arabia or Iran.
Even in the two largest cities, which, so far, offered the most scope for criticism and diversity, demonstrations by opponents are made impossible.
The European countries and their residents should not accept this lying down, but should act in solidarity with those who want to turn Russia into a decent democracy.
author. - (EL) Madam President, the need to develop relations between the European Union and Russia and the creation of a new dynamic strategic partnership, as required under the geo-economic and geo-strategic circumstances, cannot lessen or negate our criticism about the continuing infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia.
I understand and comprehend the European Union's 'Realpolitik' vis-Ã -vis Russia; at the same time, however, we also need to defend the basic principles of our collective European democratic civilisation.
From this point of view, I consider it necessary for the question of human rights to be placed high on the European Union's agenda and within the framework of reinforced political dialogue with Russia and its political leadership.
A first opportunity will be the summit on 17 May and the meeting with President Putin.
However, I should like to comment on something else.
It would be a serious political mistake for the European Union to equate human rights in Russia and the situation that prevails there with just certain circles which are openly funded by specific Russian political refugees within the known clique of oligarchs.
The recent statements by Mr Berezovsky in London are typical of the intentions of certain circles.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a land of culture.
Its achievements in the fields of literature, music and the performing arts time and again gain our admiration and respect.
In this respect, Russia is a true member of the European family of nations.
However, Russia also has its shady side.
The measures currently being taken by the Russian Government against human rights and fundamental freedoms are casting very dark shadows.
To act against its own citizens in the manner it did on 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg is unworthy of a genuine member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.
The freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the cornerstones of a democratic State.
The peoples of Europe, including the citizens of Russia, paid for these rights with their blood.
It is therefore a disgrace that Putin's Government, which lays claim to be a world power and offers its services as a mediator in all international conflicts while strutting like a peacock, is acting against its own people in such a cowardly and violent manner.
Such a government cannot negotiate with us at eye level or as a partner having equal rights.
Freedom is always the freedom to dissent.
This should be impressed on the Russian Government.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my admiration for the great Russian leader, Boris Yeltsin.
He is one of the people we have to thank for the triumph of democracy over dictatorship in the second half of the twentieth century.
Yeltsin represented the real Russia, a Russia that fosters civil society, a democratic Russia, a Russia which upholds the rule of law.
This week, in Strasbourg, there was a special meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, during which we carefully interviewed witnesses regarding what is happening in Russia at the moment.
All agreed that Russia is heading in a dangerous direction.
The careful monitoring of the upcoming elections to the Duma in December of this year and the presidential elections next year are currently most important to the European Parliament.
On our part, we have to do everything we can to bring civil society in Russia closer to democracy, to help these institutions ensure that the elections are truly free, fair and that the results not falsified.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, very sad events are taking place in Russia.
Attempts to bring democracy to Russia are being suppressed, as are demonstrations and freedom of speech.
However, we must be aware of the fact that Russia does not have a tradition of democracy and that those, such as Alexander I, who wanted to bring democracy to Russia in the past, have had to give up or have been widely criticised, as was the case with Boris Yeltsin, as he passed away.
We have to be aware of the fact that, according to surveys, more Russians want order than democracy.
This is why, when we support everything that is positive in Russia and which brings hope, we have to be aware that, in dealing with the Russian Government, we are drawing up agreements with a government which has a different set of values to Europe.
Russia does not have, and has no experience of democracy at home. Neither does it have any experience of normal, civilised behaviour in terms of external relations.
This should serve as a warning to all those who want to build a future for Europe on the hope that Russia will show solidarity and be a good partner.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, moves to repress the opposition, crush peaceful demonstrations, limit the freedom of speech and infringe human rights are worrying phenomena that should be denounced in whichever country they may occur.
Unfortunately, these accusations could be levelled at all powers today, both from the East and the West, who usurp the right to dominate the world, who want to be global judges, policemen and moral watchdogs.
Accusing Russia of anti-democratic practices and human rights infringements today could be described as 'the pot calling the kettle black'.
The harassment of political opponents, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as measures that make it difficult for people to practice their religion - these are all part of everyday political life in many parts of the world, although it is often disguised by lies reported by the media.
Above all, the fundamental right of all people to life, from conception to a natural death, is violated across the whole world, both in Russia and in the European Union.
There are no innocent parties here!
This crime is the root of all evil!
(DE) Madam President, in 1991, I not only got to know the most senior Estonian fighting for freedom, Tunne Kelam, but also Boris Yeltsin when he came here to Strasbourg to bear witness to a new Russia.
In the meantime, there has been a massive relapse.
Russia is an authoritarian state with an increasingly aggressive foreign policy.
I believe we should emphasise with the utmost clarity that fish always start to stink from the head.
The use of OMON militia against demonstrators and foreign journalists such as the German television correspondents would not have been possible without explicit instructions from the Kremlin.
We must be clear on the fact that President Putin should bear overall responsibility for repressing the first tentative shoots of democracy and freedom in Russia.
We need clear language here and should not simply talk about slip-ups.
Putin is responsible; the Russian leadership is responsible.
This is about our credibility because Russia has signed up to European principles in the Council of Europe's Declaration of human rights, the observance of which we must insist on together, and with clarity.
(LT) In recent years Russia has become economically stronger, and opinion surveys show a result favourable to the present rÃ©gime.
Therefore, it is particularly difficult to understand the Russian Government's actions aimed at the opposition in the middle of April.
Being unable to make themselves heard in the mass media, opposition parties and non-governmental organisations have attempted to draw attention to breaches of democracy in Russia.
The inappropriate reaction to demonstrations of just a few thousand people, as well as the actions of the militia and OMON, reduce the already faltering authority of Russia in the West and complicate the forthcoming negotiations for a new treaty between the EU and Russia.
Only a few officials in Moscow dare to admit that the actions of the power structures have exceeded permissible limits.
Human rights breaches and growing tension between the government and the opposition in Russia, as the election campaign is only just beginning, reduce hope that the campaign will be transparent and democratic.
Madam President, honourable Members, first of all, I would like to express my thanks for having the opportunity to participate in the debate for the second time and take the floor as the German spokesperson on human rights.
We all watched the events of 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg with a great deal of anxiety.
Quite a few of us wonder whether, in view of these developments, the freedom of assembly in Russia is in jeopardy.
The Russian Constitution guarantees Russian citizens the right to assemble peacefully, without bearing arms, in order to hold rallies and demonstrations, parades and pickets.
This is obviously contrary to the manner in which the Russian authorities acted recently against demonstrators in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod.
Gary Kasparov reported these actions to me in a personal telephone call.
It also needs to be borne in mind that the demonstrations of 14 and 15 April differed from previous marches in that the militia acted in a more hard-line manner and that, on this occasion, accredited journalists were detained temporarily as well as attacked.
The reporting carried out by several newspapers after the incidents was thoroughly critical.
Kommersant talked about 'Making mincemeat of those who disagreed' and Moskovskiy Komsomolets about 'All power to OMON', while Novaya Izvestiya talked about 'A besieged fortress and unprecedented toughness'.
However, there were also reports in which events were played down.
A similar picture could be seen in the reaction of the Russian Government.
While some government offices defended the action, the spokesperson on human rights, for example, Mr Lukin, conceded that the police had substantially exceeded their authority.
The Governor of St. Petersburg, Mr Matvienko, ordered all complaints regarding attacks by Russian police units to be investigated.
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, adviser to the Russian President on EU issues, made the same demand, while Ella Pamfilova, Chair of the commission, pointed out that the actions of the militia had damaged Russia's standing worldwide.
The Federal German Government also reacted to these events and, on 16 April, publicly expressed its anxiety in a statement given by the EU Council Presidency.
In addition, Germany's Deputy Government spokesperson, Mr Thomas Steg, declared in Berlin on 16 April that the excessive use of force at the weekend was cause for concern.
The action taken against journalists was also unacceptable.
The Federal German Government is awaiting a full account of events from the Russian authorities.
Following the incidents in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the German embassy in Moscow immediately lodged a complaint at a high level and requested an immediate and full explanation.
We will naturally also speak to the Russian authorities with a certain degree of vigour concerning the situation regarding the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly at the forthcoming human rights consultations between the EU and Russia which are scheduled for 3 May.
The development of the human rights situation in Russia must continue to be followed very attentively.
This especially applies to the freedom of speech and assembly and free and fair access to the media.
As a member of the United Nations, including its role as a member of the new Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Russia is obligated to respect fundamental rights.
Respect for these fundamental rights is also of the utmost importance in view of the forthcoming elections in Russia.
We will make it clear to Russia that it is in the country's own interests to do everything possible to ensure that the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly are strengthened and not weakened further.
I believe that a substantial part of the values and human rights on which Europe is founded have been established by Russian intellectuals and artists.
We should remind ourselves of this fact and ensure that we continue to tread along this path and not a different one.
(Applause)
Madam President, the Commission is also concerned at the disproportionate use of force by Russian law enforcement agencies against peaceful demonstrators and journalists, notably in Moscow and St Petersburg on 14 and 15 April.
We are also concerned at a number of arbitrary detentions made at the same opposition protests.
Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly - including the holding of demonstrations - are fundamental human rights.
They are the cornerstones of pluralistic democracy.
Russia has committed itself to respecting those freedoms through its membership of the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
In the period leading up to the Russian parliamentary and presidential elections, that respect is all the more crucial.
The EU raised the above-mentioned concerns in a Presidency statement on 16 April.
We note that the Deputy Presidential Spokesman publicly stated that some over-reaction by riot police had taken place.
The Commission will continue to follow developments in the pre-election period in Russia closely.
We will also continue to raise these issues in our bilateral talks with the Russian authorities, for example in the forthcoming regular EU-Russia Human Rights Consultations on 2 and 3 May.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.

Kidnapping in Gaza of the journalist Alan Johnston
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the kidnapping in Gaza of the journalist Alan Johnston.
author. - Madam President, with your agreement I should like to begin by saying that last week over one thousand BBC staff, friends and colleagues of Alan Johnston gathered at vigils for him at BBC buildings across the world.
I should like to welcome the BBC staff working here in Strasbourg who, in tribute to their missing colleague, are in the public gallery today to listen to our debate.
(Applause)
When a kidnapping takes place anywhere in the world, the victim's friends and family always look to the media to keep the fate of their loved one in the eye of the public and of us as politicians.
When the kidnapped person is himself a journalist, it is our responsibility to cherish their fate as they cherish others'.
Such is the case with BBC journalist Alan Johnston, abducted in Gaza 46 days ago.
Alan's career personally symbolises the outstanding reputation of the BBC for integrity and objectivity.
Having previously worked in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, Alan is passionate about his reporting on the Palestinian people, with whom he has a close connection and for whom he has deep respect.
This has resonated among his audience, 50 000 of whom have this week signed the online petition asking for his release.
Our first thoughts are, of course, with Graham and Margaret Johnston and with the other members of his family, to whom we send our sympathy and support.
I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the BBC management and staff and to journalists, trade unions in Britain and worldwide who have led the campaign for Alan's release.
One of the colleagues here today told me that Alan is known quite simply as someone who brings stories to life.
Today his life is our story.
Alan Johnston's courageous presence, as the only permanently-based Western journalist in Gaza, has precisely enabled him to report the suffering of the Palestinian people, and now he has become the ultimate case of a journalist caught up in his own story - a victim of the suffering itself.
We are told that Alan remains alive and secure, but not who is holding him.
We can speculate whether his abduction was for reasons of politics, money or recognition, but we do not know which, if any.
We can recognise that to prevent what has happened to Alan from happening to others requires a political understanding and solution.
However, today our response is not political - it is humanitarian, to say to whoever is listening: release Alan Johnston without harm and without hindrance.
The European Parliament should welcome the assurances of help made by Europe's Foreign Ministers this week and of 'permanent contact' promised by our own High Representative.
We are sure you will act on these promises.
I understand too that Commissioner Almunia, responding to today's debate, will pledge that his colleague Mr Michel will this weekend press Alan Johnston's case with President Abbas and representatives of the Palestinian Authority.
We thank you.
The European Parliament acknowledges the support and cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and we are proud of Europe's support to sustain your staff and the vital services they provide, but it is your intelligence services who have been able to make contact with those who have abducted Alan, and it is in you that we place our hopes for a breakthrough.
In radio circles, they say that the biggest crime is to say nothing into the microphone.
Alan Johnston's kidnapping is the radio silence that now must come to an end.
(Applause)
author. - (PL) Madam President, there are reporters who carry out their duties to a more or less satisfactory extent, just as there are better and worse media.
Alan Johnston was a good journalist, working for a well-known, popular and respected medium, namely the BBC.
Alan Johnston was kidnapped, in spite or because of the fact that he specifically wanted to work for and among the people of the Middle East, an area currently facing crisis.
He worked for these people as he informed the world of their situation and, by providing us with information, allowed us politicians to also attempt to resolve the crisis, a crisis over which we sadly have very little influence.
Madam President, kidnappings, terrorism and murder are sadly all phenomena that are part of today's world, a world where there are no principles left, not even - if one may describe it thus - the principles of warfare.
These wars are being fought in the most base manner.
Alan Johnston fell victim to this phenomenon.
To a certain extent, we are all victims.
I hope that the relevant authorities will do everything possible to free Alan Johnston.
author. - Madam President, there is no doubt that Palestinians in Gaza are suffering greatly through the gross violation of their human rights by the dreadful siege situation imposed on them by the aggressive Israeli Government actions and the tolerance shown for such actions by Western governments.
At the same time, there is no doubt that the daily plight of the Palestinian people is brought to public attention worldwide through the work of journalists.
These journalists risk their lives in order to serve the cause of freedom of information and consequently assist in promoting the Palestinian people's fight for justice.
The kidnapping of journalists such as Alan Johnston is, therefore, against the interests of the Palestinian people and is severely damaging their just demands.
We call upon the Palestinian people to redouble their efforts to secure the release of Alan Johnston.
We believe that in so doing they will be helping themselves most of all.
author. - (NL) Madam President, Gaza is a small, but very urbanised area, virtually cut off from the outside world.
Opposition from the neighbouring Israel has meant that the port and airport that had been planned with EU funds have not come into being, any more than has the open link with the much larger part of the future Palestinian state along the river Jordan.
Israel was, for a long time, a place that offered employment, but it has largely taken this option away for fear of attacks, and admits far fewer people into the country via the border post of Erez.
Israel also controls the border crossing with Egypt.
In this isolated area, a large section of the Palestinian population live like sardines, with no job, with no income and with no adequate housing.
The wise decision to remove the Israeli colonist villages from this coastal strip may have done something for those who had lived in them and who were hated by those around them, but hardly anything for anyone else there.
Gaza is a disaster area full of people without any future to look forward to, and that makes it a sort of prison or breeding ground for acts of despair.
For a long time, these acts of despair mainly consisted of suicide attacks against Israeli targets, but they also include kidnappings.
Alan Johnston is the fifteenth journalist to be kidnapped in Gaza and in the month following his kidnap, nothing was heard about him for a long time.
All Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the PLO's imprisoned party leader, Marwan Barghouti, unanimously condemn heinous acts of this kind.
A lack of convincing success stories on the path to a state of their own and to provisions and income for their people has meant that they are losing control over events.
Without any prospects for the future, unknown criminals are taking over power.
This does not do anything to make the situation in Palestine or Israel any better.
Journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, are less and less able to follow events on the ground.
This is why we must be vigilant, and this is why the kidnapped journalists must be freed.
author of the motion for a resolution. - (SV) Madam President, last year, journalists throughout the world suffered a record number of kidnappings and deaths.
We now have a duty to ensure that that record is not beaten in 2007, and we have an obligation to help bring about the release of Alan Johnston.
My thoughts go out to his immediate and extended family and to his colleagues, and I have to say that I have high hopes of his being released.
We know that Palestinian leaders condemn the kidnapping and that the kidnappers do not have the support of the Palestinian people.
We know that they understand that Alan Johnston has done more than anyone to report on their suffering over a period of 16 years.
Armed with these factors, we too can help bring about his release.
I have been in Gaza myself and know how difficult the situation is there.
However, it is by ensuring the presence of as many journalists as possible there and making sure that as many journalists as possible write about what is happening that those in Gaza have the best chance of getting us all to help improve the situation of the people.
Because the Palestinian people know that the kidnapping in question is contrary to their interests, I am certain that the kidnappers will not receive any support and that they will, in the end, have to release Alan Johnston.
author. - (EL) Madam President, allow me too to express my regret about this incident.
Yet another journalist who had the courage to work in difficult and dangerous conditions has fallen victim to kidnappers, thereby also depriving us of the information which we politicians and international public opinion can get about the tragic conditions that prevail in the area.
I trust that the fact that this has galvanised public opinion and the political leadership in the Palestinian territories and the efficacy of the National Unity Government, which is becoming more visible day by day, will help to bring about the release of the journalist Alan Johnston, identify those responsible and apportion responsibility.
A mission of members, including me and some of my honourable friends present in the House, shall be going to the Palestinian territories next week.
Within the framework of international conventions and our bilateral relations with the Palestinian Authority, we shall convey our concern and exert all possible pressure - if the matter has not already been resolved - to get Alan Johnston released and to secure as many guarantees for the safety of local citizens and visitors to the area as possible.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I hope this debate and resolution will add, in some small way, to the international pressure to successfully achieve the release of Alan Johnston following his abduction two weeks ago.
We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world's leading media broadcasters.
He has built up a reputation over many years - but in particular during the last three years in Gaza - as a broadcaster who is objective and balanced in his reporting of a very difficult situation.
We call on everybody who has any influence or power over his captors to do all they can to secure his release.
For the Palestinian people themselves, this crisis is adding to an already tragic situation.
It is sending out a message to the rest of the world that not even experienced journalists are welcome or safe in Gaza.
This is a man who has been informing the rest of the world of the suffering, injustice and tragedy that continues there.
Targeting him by kidnapping him is not only an appalling crime in itself, but it is self-defeating in terms of the Palestinian people's cause.
Gaza is isolated enough without cutting off accurate media reporting.
We are calling on the Palestinian Authority in particular to work for his release as an absolute priority and on the Council and Commission to maximise their efforts to that end.
Finally, to Alan Johnston's family and friends, I express my sincere support on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament.
I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - I too would like to offer my support and that of the ALDE Group to Alan Johnston and his family.
I do not think any of us can imagine why he is being held.
He is a man who has consistently spoken up for the Palestinian people.
To kidnap someone like him is unbelievable.
What do they hope to achieve?
It certainly does nothing for the Palestinian cause, as many Palestinians themselves have pointed out.
His only offence is his belief that the story of Gaza and its people should be told in a fair and balanced way, and he has being doing that in an exceptional manner for the last three years.
He was the only foreign correspondent living permanently in the Gaza Strip.
We all hoped that he would have been released by now, as the 14 others kidnapped since 2005 were released, and we are today adding our voices to those calling for the Palestinian Authority to redouble its efforts to secure Alan Johnston's speedy release.
We are also calling for all attacks on journalists to cease.
What more can any of us say?
I am sure that people across the EU are hoping and praying for his release.
All we are doing today is trying to add our voices to those of his parents and his colleagues, and to say to his kidnappers: realise that if anything happens to him, you will have lost a strong voice telling your story to the world.
All you will achieve is to isolate yourself and the Palestinian people further.
That cannot be what you want.
You want your voice to be heard, not to be further marginalised.
These acts make it more difficult for those of us who have always supported the Palestinian cause to persuade people of the validity of the argument, and that is why it is completely self-defeating and betrays the Palestinian people, who continue to suffer.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have signed the MEPs' letter calling on the Palestinian authorities and other organisations immediately to channel all their efforts into securing the unconditional release of the BBC journalist.
We now urgently call on the Commission and the Council to do likewise and to impose sanctions if diplomatic negotiations fail.
The kidnappers who have been holding the journalist for 46 days and President Abbas must know that they are holding back the whole of Palestine on its path to development and are consigning it to isolation.
I wish to emphasise that Alan Johnston's release is vital to the safety of all journalists working in the Middle East.
I should like to express here in Parliament the esteem in which I hold Johnston's work over the past three years in Gaza and to applaud the heroism of the work of all his fellow journalists and their families in upholding journalistic freedom in areas of conflict around the world.
They are an important source of hope for local populations facing appalling violence that could not be brought to justice without journalistic freedom.
Europe must do all it can to ensure the safety of journalists in this area.
Madam President, Alan Johnston has been a BBC journalist for 16 years and has worked in a variety of countries, including Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, so he has not exactly chosen a comfortable life!
During his three years in Gaza he has taken a strong interest in social and political developments there and he has told the story of the people of Gaza.
Therefore, as others have said, it very much harms the Palestinian cause for him not to be doing the job that he loves and does so well.
