Neither the World Social Forum nor the World Economic Forum in Davos, however, is a political actor that can, on its own, turn demands into political decisions.
That is why a body like the European Parliament is duty-bound to pass on and lend powerful support to a number of initiatives, such as cancelling the debt of poor countries, increasing and improving public development aid, instituting a global tax, reforming international trade rules, combating tax evasion and tax havens and defending public services.
A number of Heads of State or Government have already taken initiatives, and other proposals will need to be put forward at the G8 summit.
In this year, 2005, in which we will make an interim assessment of the implementation of the Millennium Objectives launched by the United Nations, these are all positive moves, provided they are not just more empty promises.
That is why more than 100 organisations, NGOs, associations and trade unions will run a mobilisation and questioning campaign at global and European level this year.
This campaign will speak out on the subjects of trade and poverty, in particular, and one of the first of its many initiatives will be a global action week for fairer trade next April.
We already know that, at the rate things are going, the Millennium Goals will not be achieved.
It is therefore down to us to keep the promises made by others a long time ago, by supporting these initiatives and this global anti-poverty campaign in order to emphasise and demonstrate our desire for a better distribution of wealth, in a democratic and peaceful world.
Politicians have let people down in the past.
They may well do so in the future, but under no circumstances must they abandon the idea that they themselves have to fight for a fairer world, and translate this idea into action.
Â Â  . Mr President, I feel that this has been a very interesting debate on issues that are important to our common future.
Your speeches, ladies and gentlemen, have confirmed the richness of the debate and have demonstrated the wide range of viewpoints on the subject of globalisation.
At this stage, I should like to highlight a point that I believe was also aired during Mr DÃ©sirâs speech, concerning a degree of convergence that, despite everything, is becoming apparent â I mean regarding globalisation.
At first it appeared that there were two extreme positions: one consisting of seeing only the negative side of globalisation and the other, initially expressed in Porto Alegre, something of an all-out rejection of globalisation.
What we are seeing today â what is clearly visible â is that, at the Davos Forum, a certain effort at corporate social responsibility is being made and an increasingly strong emphasis is being placed on a programme for global government or governance.
There is also an interest in taking on board some of the concerns expressed by so many non-governmental organisations and by so many protagonists of the movement that initially saw itself even as an anti-globalisation movement.
Many of those people originally in the anti-globalisation movement quickly realised that globalisation was inevitable.
Todayâs globalisation is not the result of a decision made by any one country or group of countries, and nor is it a conspiracy on the part of a group of companies.
Todayâs globalisation has much more to do with the trends of international trade and, in particular, the technological revolution, which no government really controls.
Consequently, instead of just protesting against globalisation, many of these actors and protagonists have chosen, rightly in my view, to seek an alternative form of globalisation, and to try to incorporate some of their concerns into globalisation.
That is our position.
I welcome this because I feel that we can learn from both Davos and Porto Alegre, although proposals have been made in both places that cannot be taken very seriously. There are lessons to be learnt, however, from both processes.
With regard to Europe and the Commission, what can I tell you?
We must, I feel, work on practical issues, from both an internal and an external perspective.
From an internal perspective, are we in favour of cohesion or not?
I am in favour of cohesion and the Commission is in favour of cohesion â economic, social and territorial â and I therefore appeal to you today, ladies and gentlemen, to help me and to help the Commission ensure that all EU governments are also in favour of cohesion and ready to offer their help with, for example, the financial perspective that we have been debating, because poverty does not only affect countries of the Southern Hemisphere, it also affects Europe.
Europe now has greater disparities than ever before â and this is especially true of post-enlargement Europe.
We need more advanced programmes in Europe to fight social exclusion.
Accordingly, if we wish to conduct a coherent debate on the issue of cohesion, we must begin by seeking to implement cohesion â economic, social and territorial cohesion â here in Europe. This forms part of a fast-track approach that is vital for the Union.
Then there is the external perspective: what can the Commission and the EU do on the external stage?
In this context, two areas that I think should not be seen as mutually incompatible or contradictory are those of international trade and development aid.
Some remarks that I heard were against international trade on the grounds that international trade is, to some extent, the embodiment of the neoliberal model.
Let me tell you once again that, in my conversations with the leaders of developing countries, the first request that almost all of them make is in the area of trade â they want greater access to the markets of more developed countries â and so we must also help these countries with regard to trade.
It cannot therefore be said that trade and aid are irreconcilably incompatible.
It is clear to me that we can and must do more for developing countries, in both of these areas.
Yet we can also ask more of them, because when the EU and the EU Member States give considerable amounts of aid, as we do â worldwide, the EU is the biggest donor of development aid â we also have the right to demand good governance on the part of those countries and we want to know if the money given to them is being used properly and above board and if in fact the reforms aimed at better integrating those countries into international trade are being carried out.
This is also a shared responsibility.
Let me tell you that the Commission wants to go further.
We want to make a more ambitious contribution towards achieving the Millennium Objectives.
As things stand, it is clear that we are only limited by the resources available.
We therefore intend to continue to work with the Member States and with Parliament in order to set a more ambitious agenda in the area of development aid, above all by placing Africa at the forefront of our priorities, because Africa has structural problems that other regions have, to some degree, already overcome, particularly because of their more successful integration into international trade.
I should like to assure you that the Commission and I would like to see an attitude of greater decisiveness and greater commitment to the aims of a global world, a fairer global world in which the EU must play a leading role in encouraging more responsible governance of our planetâs resources and creating a fairer society on a global scale.
These are our values, and we are ready to fight for them.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate pursuant to RuleÂ 103 of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
â (A6-0020/2005) by Antonio Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record [COM(2004)0664 â C6-0163/2004 â 2004/0238(CNS)];
â (A6-0036/2005) by AntÃ³nio Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal law in the Member States [2005/2003(INI)].
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I should like to make some comments on both reports: the one tabled by MrÂ Costa and the one tabled by MrÂ DiÂ Pietro.
There are some important links between the two reports and the two initiatives.
The first concerns the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation; the second, tabled by MrÂ DiÂ Pietro, concerns a proposal regarding the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record.
It is my personal conviction, and one shared by the Commission as a whole, that the quality of justice is a fundamental element in the great project â now enshrined in the European Constitution â of creating a real European area of justice and freedom.
It is obvious that the quality of justice is based on the principle whereby a Europe in which internal borders are disappearing has to ensure that the decisions made by its courts are, above all, enforced quickly and simply, because the response that people are awaiting depends on the credibility of the legal systems.
That principle obviously presupposes another, that is to say the principle upheld by those working on âmutual recognitionâ: a decision by a judge in one Member State can and must be recognised by the legal system of another Member State.
That is the essential condition for establishing a European area of justice.
Implementing such a principle of mutual recognition, however, requires a high level of mutual trust: there can be no mutual recognition without mutual trust among the judiciaries, the courts and the legal systems of the Member States.
That is why the programme that the Commission is committed to carrying out contains a specific reference â requested by the European Council, by the way â to the quality of justice, which means decisions being enforced quickly and smoothly and implies a high level of mutual trust among the legal systems and judiciaries.
The rapporteur, Mr Costa, proposes creating a European mechanism for the evaluation of the quality of justice, a mechanism based on a Quality Charter for criminal justice.
I think that is an interesting idea, since we know that in other, less sensitive areas, a mechanism for parallel evaluation and for monitoring the results of measures has worked and has helped to establish the principle of mutual trust.
Thus the rapporteurâs proposal is an interesting one.
Besides, the Commission believes that on such a sensitive subject, which touches on Member Statesâ competences, it is necessary to set up an extensive consultation exercise and, above all, to listen to those involved.
The Commission is working hard and will continue to work hard on both aspects, first of all by listening to the categories involved, that is to say the judges, the associations and the bodies representing the judiciary in the Member States.
By the end of 2005 we intend to issue a preliminary communication on judicial training â that is, the training of judges â and then, in 2006, a communication on the evaluation of the quality of justice.
We therefore intend to work along the lines suggested in Mr Costaâs report.
My final thought on this topic is that no mechanism for evaluating the quality of justice should bear upon or have a detrimental effect on the independence of the judiciary, either directly or indirectly.
It would be a dreadful result if the principle of evaluating the quality of justice â which is a public service â should indirectly harm the independence of the judiciary, which is an essential requirement for providing the public with a quality service.
A judiciary that is not independent certainly cannot be top quality.
That, then, is why our aim will be to achieve high quality in justice while holding to the premise I have just mentioned: respect for the independence of our judicial systems and judiciaries.
With regard to MrÂ DiÂ Pietroâs report, mutual trust, as I have already said, is clearly an essential element in the quality of justice and is vital in making the mutual recognition of decisions and procedures work properly.
It is clear, then, that the proposal for a decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record â a Commission proposal made last October â is a good example, in my opinion, of the real importance of applying the principle of mutual trust.
You will all recall the Fourniret affair, the tragic case of paedophilia that was instrumental in making Europe respond more swiftly.
That case showed how poorly the exchange of information between Member States on peopleâs criminal records was working.
We need strong measures.
I am convinced that the text currently being examined, to which MrÂ DiÂ Pietro has referred and will refer again, is just a first step.
It is an urgent first step, for the short term.
Clearly, the next step that the Commission is considering is to have a faster, computerised system for exchanging information, which, of course, must fully comply with personal data protection rules.
Parliament will obviously have further opportunities to give its views on this more advanced proposal in the near future.
Clearly, in any case, we must now ensure that the register of criminal records in a personâs Member State of origin works as well as possible so that, when it receives a request for information, the register in that Member State of origin can supply all the necessary answers about the situation without delay.
Better relations among the national authorities responsible for criminal records must therefore be established and, clearly, the Commission expects to achieve further improvements in the longer term.
As you all know, we have adopted a White Paper which proposes a rather more effective information exchange mechanism.
We will be listening to the responses to the questions raised in the White Paper.
To conclude, the Commission will work closely with Parliament in permanent collaboration, because in exchanging information we have to find the right balance between the need for security, the need to protect peopleâs right to be safe, and peopleâs fundamental rights.
In that respect I should like to refer once again to personal data protection, because such a balance will need to be debated very thoroughly here in Parliament.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am called upon to explain my report on the proposal for a Council decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record.
This proposal â as Mr Frattini has rightly stated â constitutes just a first step, which needs to be taken urgently.
The aim of this proposal for a decision will obviously be supported by everybody; the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe â to which I have the honour of belonging â certainly supports it fully, as does the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which gave the Council proposal in question its almost unanimous approval.
The aim is to improve the quality of justice in Italy, in Europe and in all the Member States.
The tangible measure put forward in the proposal for a decision is to share the information contained in criminal records.
In fact, such sharing was already provided for in the 1959 Convention.
Technically, however, it is difficult to make such an exchange of information work and to keep it up to date, since at present, under the 1959 Convention, information is only networked once a year and requests are made without a pre-established time limit.
The Council proposal thus has the benefit of making information available more promptly, until, of course, the computerised system that the Commissioner mentioned can provide the information even more quickly, virtually on line.
I should like to clear up a misunderstanding on the part of those who see a problem in the relationship between data checking and privacy.
Criminal record data are for criminals as medical records are for the sick: they are factual data.
The problem is who uses such data and how they use them.
To that end we ask that the data should only be used by judicial authorities and with other judicial authorities, and only in relation to unappealable convictions.
That is why the Council was right to include the concepts of âcriminal recordâ and âunappealable convictionâ among the terms to be defined prior to such decisions.
I therefore agree with this work in progress, which is to be put into effect while we await the decisions that will be coming in the White Paper, just as I also agree with the principles that you have just enumerated, Commissioner.
You said that these decisions and, more generally, the recommendations that Parliament is preparing to make should depend on two principles, which I believe we can all subscribe to and which I certainly subscribe to, as you do.
The first is that the decisions of the courts should be enforced quickly.
The second principle â as you said â is that there should be mutual recognition of and mutual trust in the decisions made by courts in each individual country.
Thirdly, you said that any evaluation of the quality of the work done by the courts must not affect the independence of the judiciary.
I fully agree with that view, Commissioner, and I would therefore ask you to have the Commission move on to more concrete measures relating to such issues.
In particular, as well as listening, I would ask you to state what you will do if a Member State shows that it has no confidence in the courts so that, for instance, there is a Member State which has not yet implemented the European arrest warrant.
We therefore explicitly request that, when similar topics are debated, the Commission should put pressure on Member States that have not yet implemented them, otherwise it might be thought that those Member States have no confidence in the decisions of other courts and other Member States and that they do not intend to implement the courtsâ decisions straight away at all.
Similarly, we believe you are right to say that the independence of the judiciary must be respected, but we would also like to know what the Commission proposes to do when even members of the government in a particular Member State do not respect the judiciary and go so far as to make a mockery of it in the courts themselves.
I believe, then, that the Commission also has the duty to issue directives and recommendations, so that the efforts we are making to improve the quality of justice in Europe and in the Member States are not derailed by a particular Member State for its own very special reasons.
Â Â  . â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, implementing the area of freedom, security and justice is one of the most stimulating challenges facing the EU, of which the most important element, as we proposed in the Hague Programme, is the need to ensure high quality justice throughout Union territory, without prejudice to the plurality of the existing judicial systems in the 25 Member States.
In accordance with the Hague Programme, as is already the case with Tampere, the cornerstone in building the area of freedom, security and justice is mutual recognition, as Mr Frattini has just reminded us.
In order for mutual recognition to exist, however, there must also be mutual trust, and, as Mr Di Pietro highlighted just now, mutual trust is not a matter of faith.
Mutual trust must be built up and must work effectively.
We must acknowledge that among our 25 Member States â among the judicial authorities of our 25 Member States â such mutual trust does not exist to a satisfactory degree.
Mutual trust must be stepped up.
I therefore begin this initiative report by proposing that there should be a mutual evaluation mechanism among the various Member States.
Clearly, such a mechanism will respect the independence of judicial authority, and will involve the national parliaments and the judiciaryâs governing bodies.
Accordingly, our evaluation will be the result of a broad range of views on the quality of criminal justice in each of the Member States.
Secondly, I feel that it is crucial that this evaluation should be an objective evaluation, and in order for this to be the case I propose that a Quality Charter for Criminal Justice should be created.
The Charter should be created on the basis of the interpretation of the right to a judge in the European Declaration of Human Rights, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and on the basis of both United Nations and Council of Europe recommendations.
This Quality Charter must act as an objective reference framework enabling evaluation of the different criminal justice systems in the different Member States.
In this way, we can spread best practice, we can have benchmarking exercises and we can ensure that all European citizens, wherever they may be in EU territory, enjoy high standards of quality.
We are all aware, however, that in addition to mutual recognition, there must also be a minimum level of harmonisation.
The Council has set out the criterion for the harmonisation of material criminal law, and our report proposes that we endorse the Councilâs proposal.
The Council has called on the Commission to prepare for harmonisation of the list of offences referred to in the Constitutional Treaty at the earliest opportunity, so that by the time the Constitutional Treaty enters into force the preparatory work will have been completed and the Council can quickly, in conjunction with Parliament, adopt the harmonisation standards called for in the new Treaty.
With regard to procedural law, we feel that we must be selective, yet ambitious as to the scope of our action.
We therefore propose four key areas: firstly, the harmonisation of standards relating to the gathering and assessment of key evidence, an issue that the Commission has said it is already working on; secondly, harmonisation enabling sentences to be served, and ensuring that any preventative measures applied are executed; thirdly, the minimum rights of detainees in any Member State; and, finally, the consideration of further conviction in respect of acts already subject to harmonisation measures.
With this report Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to speed up their work so that all of us, working together, can make a contribution to an area of freedom, security and justice with higher quality criminal justice in Europe.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
In the political documents of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for example the documents from the congress and other documents of our party in the European Parliament, we stress the importance of the security of people and their property; after all, we promised this to our electorate.
On the other hand we are faced with a growth in increasingly serious forms of crime and terrorist acts.
It is entirely clear that no individual Member State of the European Union can alone ensure its own security any longer.
We need cooperation and joint action, and we need to seek out and promote all those activities that enhance our security.
In this sense my group supports the proposed Council decision on the exchange of data generated from criminal records, as well as the report of rapporteur Mr di Pietro.
We are somewhat surprised, however, that the Commission only intends to establish a new computer system for data exchange between 2008 and 2010.
I have the feeling that the exchange of data is more a political than a technical question, for if serious political will exists, then the Commission should speed up the construction of an adequate information technology system, since it is clear to anyone that we are in the information age and that construction of an adequate information technology system cannot be such a complicated issue.
Obviously this is being impeded by some other, weightier issues, such as trust or the quality of individual branches of power.
In this regard I propose to the Commission that it does indeed speed up the construction of the information technology system.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the main concern of European citizens is that the European Union should guarantee them a high standard of living and protect their rights.
We must therefore ensure that all European citizens benefit from the same rights, the same quality of justice and the same access to justice, wherever they are in Europe.
In this context, it is vital to improve judicial cooperation in criminal and civil matters.
In addition, freedom of movement in Europe enables criminal networks to profit from the opening up of the European Union's internal borders while at the same time exploiting the lack of European coordination with regard to justice and thus evading capture.
We must therefore now adopt the necessary mechanisms to meet the new challenges now facing European judicial cooperation.
The exchange of information extracted from the criminal record provides European magistrates with specific mechanisms making it possible to speed up proceedings so that criminals do not go unpunished.
For example, it will be possible, as you say, to put an end to known cases of paedophilia more quickly.
Such mechanisms and practical measures must be put in place in order to improve mutual trust in Europe's judicial systems, which is an absolute necessity.
This is because the current lack of trust constitutes a major barrier to achieving mutual recognition of current practices and to reaching an appropriate level of approximation of judicial systems.
I also join with AntÃ³nio Costa in calling on the Commission to put forward proposals based on the principles of mutual recognition of decisions and of minimum harmonisation.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my pleasure at the proposal to extend judicial cooperation to certain aspects of family law, which is included in the legislative programme for 2005.
I very much hope that we will continue working along these lines.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Costa, on his report and on the excellent conclusions that he set out, which, by the way, have been approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
In my opinion, this report sends a strong signal from Parliament to the Commission and the Council.
It bears witness to our desire to ensure a higher quality of justice for all European citizens, I would even say for anyone within the territory of the European Union, thanks in particular to the Quality Charter for criminal justice and to the proposed evaluation system.
Mutual recognition of decisions taken in criminal matters in the various Member States assumes that all the States have confidence in each otherâs judicial systems.
That is why we need to define common basic standards that are better harmonised whilst maintaining justified diversity, as Mr Costa has reiterated.
This is more than just procedure, however.
Ensuring and checking that judges are properly trained, open-minded, level-headed, alert, efficient, conscientious and able to manage the existing means as well as possible clearly does not run counter to the essential independence they must have.
We need to increase the transparency of the justice system and improve peopleâs perception of the working methods of judges, who sometimes suffer from a lack of credibility and trust.
Finally, I believe it is essential for us to ensure that our recommendations are followed up.
We need action, not just intentions, Commissioner.
That is why it is important to set up a follow-up committee made up of experts, magistrates, lawyers, users of the justice system and representatives of national parliaments with the task of assessing and evaluating the way in which our recommendations are put into effect.
If we manage to implement these recommendations, we shall genuinely succeed in making the European Union a State under the rule of law.
These are issues that are essential to the functioning of our democracies, respect for the law and respect for citizens' rights.
With regard to Mr Di Pietro's excellent report, I completely agree with the analysis and proposals that it contains, but I would like to stress the fact that the proposal put forward is modest, is limited to the current legal framework, which dates back to 1959, and therefore does not meet the need for the provision of information regarding criminal records.
I think there was a desire to respond to the emotions aroused by the Fourniret case.
We will wait impatiently, as Mr Frattini announced, for more general proposals, which are essential if we are to combat terrorism, serious crime and crime in general more effectively.
The small step we have taken does not release us from moving rapidly on.
Â Â  Mr President, this evening, we are once again discussing the magic word âmutual recognitionâ as the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation.
It does, of course, presuppose that the Member States work together effectively, that they can look beyond their own borders and know how things are done elsewhere, that they are also agreed on a number of basic standards, for example in terms of law of criminal procedure and, above all, build on the trust in each other and on the reasons why they can indeed trust in each other.
Mr Costaâs proposal is of particular importance for building confidence in efficiency and sound administration of justice, whereas the main thrust of Mr Di Pietroâs report is to improve cooperation in terms of information.
My group gives its wholehearted support to both reports and I would like to thank you warmly for all the work you have done on these and the pleasant cooperation, but much more is needed than these small steps forward.
There is a host of new proposals in the making, and they all constitute small steps forward, on paper anyway, for in my experience, Member States very often put the brakes on.
To them, the idea of mutual recognition mainly appears to be a way of not having to change anything at national level.
We all tend to be interested only in our own patch, and others have to respect the decisions that are made about it.
I can tell you that my group is not afraid of looking further afield, although we are a little hesitant about this enormous host of new rules, for such quantities often affect transparency, the defences of people who are forever being faced with changes, and also the clarity of what we are doing here.
I can say that my group is in favour of a European Public Prosecutorâs office; we are in favour of a European criminal code, of Europe-wide rights for suspects and for victims, of the sharing of information and, above all, in favour of a hefty investment in the in-depth training of all police and judicial officers in European cooperation.
The fact is that, ultimately, it is on the workfloor, rather than here, that this will need to be put into practice.
I hope that we can all join forces in a major effort, including a financial injection, in order to ensure that everyone is well-informed about this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, both reports are expressions of the well-known ambition to extend the power of the EU institutions at the expense both of the Member States and ultimately, therefore, of democracy
Of MrÂ Di Pietroâs report, I can only say that it concerns a matter belonging within the remit of the Council of Europe and not of the EU.
MrÂ Costaâs report is full of fine-sounding idealism, but the ideals and the good intentions suffer from the unfortunate defect of generally lacking a basis in reality.
I would first of all point to the fact that, in a number of Member States, criminal procedure and the prison systems contain numerous gross infringements of fundamental human rights.
Should not reality be cultivated over and above airy ideals?
The reportâs single ambition is to cultivate mutual trust in the principle of mutual recognition of the other Member Statesâ legal decisions.
Yes, but what if the Polish, Greek or Italian judge, counsel for the prosecution or prison authority does not deserve to be trusted?
What matters is surely what happens in reality.
The reportâs second objective is to force the Member States to punish specific acts, as per ArticleÂ 271 of the Constitution.
If reality had had a role to play and if the criminologists had been asked, a clear answer would have been received.
What we have here is, at worst, barbarism and, at best, arbitrariness.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have talked about the quality of justice and we have examined the report, which seems to be based on an attempt to bring forward the Treaty provisions, particularly Article III-271 on the assessment of particularly serious criminal acts, such as those connected with terrorism.
It is fair to ask, then, whether we are not pushing ahead too far with this rather optimistic vision of the quality of justice and mutual recognition of judiciaries.
Indeed, precisely on the sensitive subject of terrorism, some very serious things are happening, such as decision number 2849104 by the judge for pre-trial hearings in Milan, DrÂ Forleo, on the subject of terrorism.
The decision, concerning the activities of some people charged with terrorism (whose names were placed on both the United Nations and the European Union lists), makes a strange distinction, invented by the judge herself, between terrorists and guerrillas.
The judge in question specifically writes that âviolent or guerrilla activities, even if carried out by armed forces other than regular forces, cannot be prosecuted even under international law, provided there is no breach of international humanitarian lawâ.
We are faced with Community laws on terrorism that have been stripped of meaning.
We are faced with the betrayal of the civilised stand against terrorism adopted by Europe â including in this Chamber.
It is a very serious matter, and I feel it is my duty to condemn it.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when debates on accession to the European Union were held in the new Member States, including my country, Poland, the key arguments we put forward related not only to economic growth and national security, but also to personal security.
This issue is all the more important because crime is rising throughout Europe, unfortunately also in the new Member States, and radical measures must be taken to stem this constant rise.
A great many new types of crime have appeared, for example the well-publicised problem of Internet crime, and all these developments mean that new regulations are required.
They also mean that there is a need for harmonisation, and this is why we welcome both MrÂ DiÂ Pietroâs report on the exchange of information from the criminal register and MrÂ Costaâs report on the quality of criminal justice in the European Union.
It should not be forgotten, however, that the harmonisation of criminal law, or indeed of any other kind of law, must not merely mean that everyone is brought down to the same level, or that differences are eradicated to the detriment of national traditions, customs and needs.
The latter are the basis upon which national legislation has been established, and if harmonisation were to take place in too mechanical a fashion, local traditions could be harmed.
Most importantly, countries should not have to bring their legislation into line with laws and customs in other countries where criminals are treated with particular care, where they are gradually transformed into victims while the victims are forgotten, and where criminals can in fact expect greater protection than victims.
This relates in particular to the issue of whether detainees should be granted the right to be seen by a psychiatrist, who would have the task of immediately assessing the detaineeâs behaviour, and potentially absolving him or her of guilt.
It may well be appropriate for this to happen at a later stage in the judicial procedure, but it need not occur at the very beginning.
It must not result in criminals enjoying greater rights than victims, even though this is something that is unfortunately becoming increasingly common in modern legislation and judicial practice.
It is unacceptable for the victim to be viewed as already having irrevocably become a victim, while at the same time the criminal is considered to be some sort of new victim who must be rescued, as this is quite simply untrue.
The criminal should always remain a criminal and the victim a victim.
The exchange of information from the criminal register is another issue worth considering.
It should not be forgotten that the lengths of time after which criminal convictions are deemed spent vary between the different Member States, and steps should be taken to avoid situations in which someone is regarded as having a criminal conviction in one Member State, although this is no longer the case in another Member State.
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I have finished, and there is no need for you to use your gavel.
Â Â  Mr President, in the explanatory note to its proposal, the Commission states that recent tragic paedophile cases have brought to light major dysfunctions in the exchange of information about convictions among the Member States.
Commissioner Frattini mentioned the Fourniret case a moment ago.
A French paedophile, having been convicted in his own country, was able to go about his business undisturbed in Belgium, because the French authorities had not thought it necessary to provide the relevant authorities with information about him.
The proposal that is now being debated is far too long in coming.
It is, after all, a supplement to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which dates back to 1959.
Moreover, the proposal is inadequate and does not offer an answer to a large number of problems.
The Member States must update their criminal records and make them available more quickly.
They must also provide information requested by other Member States more promptly and use standard forms to do it.
Those are a few steps in the right direction, but this is all, of course, in anticipation of the introduction of a fully-fledged, automated system of data exchange.
The Commission must set about this at the earliest opportunity, certainly when it claims that the system will not be in place for another few years â itself a bad omen.
There are, of course, a huge number of legal implications, and these will need to be discussed at length.
Once this House has voted on the present proposal, we must certainly not create the impression that the problems relating to the exchange of information have been resolved.
The Commission has used an apt example to illustrate that this is clearly not the case.
Member States are not required to inform the state where convicts live when that is not the state of their nationality.
In other words, these measures will enable Fourniret, whom I have already mentioned, to slip through the net once again.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, both the Tampere Programme, and later the Hague Programme, identified the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases as one of the European Unionâs goals in the field of criminal law.
Effective judicial cooperation based on mutual trust is required to achieve this goal, as a lack of such cooperation can mean that criminals hide in other countries in order to evade responsibility for their crimes.
This in turn leads to a rise in feelings of impunity, which results in increased crime levels in Europe.
It is for this reason that my political group welcomes the Costa report, which contains recommendations to the European Commission relating to the establishment of a quality charter for criminal justice, as the fundamental rights granted to defendants, victims and barristers by the proposed charter may at the same time be used as criteria for a mutual assessment of the quality of justice.
Although a specific legal basis for such an assessment will not be provided until the Constitutional Treaty is in force, I believe that a general legal basis can already be found in the Treaty of Maastricht.
In my opinion, it would therefore be a good idea for the European Commission to comply with the reportâs recommendations by starting to develop the criteria and methods to be used in carrying out such assessments.
This task will be complicated somewhat by the fact that allowance must be made for the varying legal systems which are in place in the different Member States and which are based on different legal traditions and cultures, as well as for the different judicial systems.
The methods for carrying out such assessments should also ensure that credible conclusions are reached based on reliable analyses.
It is worth noting that mutual assessments of justice should also be backed up by other measures, such as those that ensure the independence of the judiciary from political influence is not only respected, but also enhanced.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, criminal justice in Europe needs to be independent but not beyond evaluation and beyond examination.
European citizens need to have confidence in the criminal justice system, they need to be confident that their fundamental rights will be respected, they need to be confident that transparency and quality will be present in any court in the European Union.
We recently had a very bad experience in Greece: the discovery of bribery and corruption in the judicial system.
It is a discovery which has severely shaken the confidence of Greek citizens in their judicial system.
Although the Greek judicial system is now putting its house in order, that is not enough.
As other countries in Europe which have faced similar corruption in their judicial system know, this is very, very difficult.
We are therefore being called upon to bring in European support.
How can Europe provide support?
By evaluating special procedures and best practices.
And where does the problem lie?
Anyone who contests the importance of evaluation is being conniving.
Even if a Member State believes that its criminal justice system is so exceptional that it has nothing to learn from the others, it should at least help the others to learn from it and, as judges themselves are involved in the quality map, there is no problem about their independence with this proposal.
Â Â  Thank you.
In view of the extensive range of the provisions in the Constitutional Treaty for Europe regarding the convergence of national legislations in the area of criminal, material and procedural law, we may conclude that the plan for a single criminal law area is taking on an increasingly clear outline.
Setting it down in the Constitutional Treaty is the result of legislative development since 1990, and not its beginning, and it relies in particular on the principle of mutual trust.
In view of the different constitutional orders and criminal law traditions, this trust must be based on specific, comparable, minimum criteria.
We support this orientation, but parliamentarians also have a duty to monitor closely the methods of unifying legislations, especially in terms of the urgent need to strengthen the protection of basic human rights.
If we were not attentive to the balance between these two elements, criminal law would be effectively unified, but it would not necessarily be democratically legitimised.
Criminal law is also an identity card for the quality of democracy.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I have no difficulty with the sensible exchange of information about criminal convictions between Member States, but only the politically blind could fail to recognise the proposals in the Costa report as part of the harmonisation process that is under way in the criminal justice system across Europe.
That, of course, is in anticipation of the EU Constitution, within which that harmonisation has a key role to play.
I for one am opposed to a criminal justice system established on the continental model, with its inherent assault upon the essential building blocks of our distinctive and historic British common law system, which include not least trial by jury, habeas corpus, and the separation of the judiciary from the investigative process.
This Costa report, despite its plausible verbiage, is part of that process of harmonisation aimed at creating a single criminal justice system.
That is not serving the interests of the British nation in my view and therefore I will oppose that report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sometimes the case that the Commission, the Council or Parliament â or two of these institutions, or all three of them â are too many steps ahead of the public or a particular group; in such cases we act with too much haste and too much ambition, and are then forced to carry the weary upon our shoulders.
The issue we are debating tonight is one for which we all bear responsibility, because what is of vital importance is the results we achieve â or rather, those we do not achieve.
Commissioner, it is not merely that we are struggling to keep up with the real nature of crime today, given that for many years now organised crime has no longer been the only kind of crime that crosses borders; we are also struggling to keep up with individual crime.
In both cases we are also struggling to give the public what it wants.
The public has a right, and indeed the political will, to ensure that twenty-first century crime is not fought with nineteenth century methods.
Unfortunately, the impression is sometimes given that information is requested and delivered by telegram, and it therefore needs to flow better.
Despite the numerous fears that have been expressed, this would not mean any reduction in the level of data protection; after all, information relating to certain types of specialised crime committed in Kehl is just as important in Offenburg as in Strasbourg.
Our priority in exchanging of information of this kind is the publicâs right to protection, and not the criminal's right to privacy.
Nor is the issue at stake here that of trust between Member States; it is quite simply a matter of whether the public trusts Europe, and the extent to which it trusts us to do a good job of handling this issue.
If there is a conclusion to be drawn from all of this, then it is that we are actually asking â as a leading German newspaper has done â whether the public wants a single criminal code, and the answer to that question is âyesâ.
The conclusion that should be drawn from this report is that everyone should state clearly whether they want genuine improvements to be made or not, and that in any case software problems should not be used as a smokescreen.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to add anything to the reports by MrÂ DiÂ Pietro and MrÂ Costa, with which I am in absolute agreement.
I should like, instead, to reflect on a contradiction that we are being called upon to face this evening.
Everyone knows that only a strengthening of judicial cooperation can make a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and that implies mutual recognition of judicial decisions, exchange of information and harmonisation of guarantees relating to legal procedure.
We also know, however, that many Member States do all they can to hinder such judicial cooperation in every way.
Your mandate, therefore, in our opinion, also consists in standing up to the Council and making sure that all the European institutions firmly adhere to that objective.
Greater political will is needed to enable us to carry out what the European Constitution provides for and prescribes, which we do not want to remain unfulfilled.
Precisely for the sake of consultation and judicial cooperation, MrÂ Frattini, we urge you to intervene respectfully but firmly with the Italian Parliament and the Italian Government, partly because you used to be a minister in that government yourself.
Italy is the only country not to have implemented the European arrest warrant.
Something that might have been just serious until yesterday is, you will agree, an absolute paradox today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this debate is about confidence and trust.
In every Member State, every prison and every detention centre, there are nonetheless people who feel they were given unfair trials due to the fact that they did not know the language, that the evidence was not evaluated correctly or that they were brutally treated by the police or while they were in custody.
This is in spite of the fact that we have rules in place in Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and, above all perhaps, in rules forming part of Community law within the EU.
If people are to dare to make use of the four freedoms, we must also have rules governing the security not only of goods and capital but also of individuals.
For people to be able to assert their rights, current rules require national legal remedies to have been exhausted.
A court can request an advisory opinion during a trial, but an individual cannot.
We must, then, introduce the opportunity for individuals to request personal enquiries or special representatives so that they are given the same rights as courts.
Only then shall we be able to talk about confidence and trust.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, there is work for us to do together if we are to improve the standards of quality and efficiency of justice.
We must be mindful that the cornerstone of our European themes is the independence of the judicial system and the protection of citizensâ fundamental rights, at both substantial and procedural level.
In case there is any doubt â and I am happy to say this again â I wish to compliment Mr Costa on his excellent report, which states that European citizens must be guaranteed the right to justice, both by the Union, whereby they are guaranteed comparable treatment, regardless of the Member State in which they happen to be, and by the Member States, depending on their respective powers, whilst ensuring that the differences between the various judicial systems do not stand in the way of attaining high quality justice and protection in the area of freedom, security and justice.
I agree with the rapporteur that mutual trust must be strengthened in order that there can be mutual recognition of judicial decisions, thereby contributing towards the gradual development of a European judicial culture.
I endorse the idea of adopting a European Criminal Justice Charter, which would be the basis for evaluating how well the judicial systems in the Union work.
I also support the idea of setting up an objective and impartial system for mutually evaluating the quality of justice, based on comparable statistical data, which should be put into practice at the earliest opportunity and should involve both the European Parliament and national parliaments.
I should also like to commend Mr Di Pietro for his work and for the proposals that he is putting forward on the reduction of time-limits and the conditions for access to personal data.
In other words, the current system of exchanging criminal record information is not effective.
It is essential that a computerised system be created for Member States to exchange information, offering quick access to this kind of information throughout EU territory, and I welcome Mr Frattiniâs new ideas on the subject.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an important report because it emphasises two key areas which have not been emphasised enough previously.
Mr AntÃ³nio Costa has taken an important step forward in signalling that it is the quality of justice, and not just mutual recognition, which is key.
If anyone in this House doubts this issue, they should look at the 'Copenhagen criteria'.
The quality of justice in many of the accession states and the need for improvements was an essential part of joining the European Union.
Nor should any of the existing 15 Member States be complacent that they have all the right answers and the highest quality of justice.
Look at how we deal with minorities and vulnerable people.
That is where this issue will be tested.
The Quality Charter for Criminal Justice in Europe should not be something that Member States fear.
They should welcome it, because this is one of the most visible areas of cooperation in the European Union that our citizens recognise.
They see it in the media, they want to see solutions at a European level, they want to feel safe in a European Union which delivers swift justice and protection for the innocent.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall confine myself to a few thoughts on Mr Di Pietro's report, which I fully support.
The rapporteur's report contains positive elements because, on the one hand, it specifies the dates and, on the other hand, it highlights the need to speed up procedure, in the event of urgent cases, to 48 hours.
However, the Commissioner's attention should be drawn to the fact that the issues addressed in the reports by both Mr Di Pietro and Mr Costa may be a step in the right direction but they cannot be seen as a daring step.
I believe, for example, that the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the field of criminal convictions must be an immediate priority.
Also, the terms 'conviction' and 'criminal record' need to be clearly defined and the terms 'offence' and 'punishment' need to be harmonized.
I truly believe that the integration of the European Union cannot come about if we do not proceed rapidly to unify rules relating to justice.
However, the Commissioner's intervention today did not convince me that the Commission will proceed at such a rapid pace in this direction and that is a pity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the common legal area is based upon mutual recognition.
In recognising each otherâs judgments, we must be able to rely upon the quality of the legal systems, rely upon equal treatment, rely upon effective due process and rely upon fair trials with counsel and, if need be, interpretation.
Let us compete on an upward trajectory where legal quality is concerned.
Thank you, MrÂ Costa, for a constructive report.
I turn now to the exchange of information, which is a more sensitive area.
MrÂ DiÂ Pietro has improved the proposal, but I should like to emphasise three points.
Firstly, data protection will have to be of the same quality within the sphere of combating crime as it is within the internal market before data is exchanged.
Secondly, the European Data Protection Supervisor must express his or her opinions on sensitive issues.
Thirdly: in addition to the Member Statesâ being informed of how the information is used, the individual too must be told what information has been given out.
We have been given a Commissioner who, I know, listens and who understands these issues.
I hope that Commissioner Frattini will include these three elements in the future when it comes to increasing data protection in order to ensure that we obtain the same quality of data protection in the sphere of combating crime as we already have in the internal market.
In this connection, I really pin a lot of hope on Commissioner Frattiniâs further efforts.
I wish to thank him for the efforts he has already made in the area of data storage and believe that these will also bear fruit in the area of data exchange.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation is a core theme in the EUâs global justice project.
Criminal justice is the most hotly debated area of human rights â its reciprocal nature, its conflicts and the fact that it is based on a principle of essential dignity.
The criminal justice issue therefore goes to the moral core of European political culture.
It is therefore of pressing importance that we pursue an active policy aimed at enhancing the quality of criminal justice and at harmonising Member State legislation.
The emergence of a European Constitution, which incorporates a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights and constitutes a system of values characterised by unity and integration, demands higher quality justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation.
Criminal law is in fact material constitutional law and synthesises all fundamental constitutional values.
The absence of harmonisation in this area will imply non-compliance with the principle of equality among citizens, and, by extension, non-compliance with the Constitution.
The harmonisation of the criminal justice system must not therefore be done half-heartedly, nor must it be merely the basis for mutual recognition of judicial decisions; it should be an end in itself.
A concerted policy, by virtue of the very fact that it is a concerted policy, does not jeopardise the Member Statesâ decision-making powers in this area.
The European Constitutionâs system of values also implies that the harmonisation of legislation must cut across the entire criminal justice system.
It should not solely consider the main strands of the process and the serving of sentences, but should be extended to cover the substantive rules, the politics of defining offences and to the criteria for setting sentences.
Security should not be the sole concern; we should also be concerned with humanising criminal justice.
If Europe does not embrace this scheme, its Constitutionâs justice system will be, to quote Kafkaâs satirical metaphor, a system of open doors through which nobody can enter.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I am grateful to the rapporteurs and the Members who have spoken, even for calling on the Commission to act and to act quickly.
I shall try to give not exhaustive answers â clearly I will not have time for that â but some information that may be useful to Parliament.
By the end of April, the Commission will present a communication on mutual recognition and the development of the principle of mutual trust.
This communication will include and touch on most of the issues covered by the two reports that we are examining today, and will deal with the evaluation of justice, training for judges and the harmonisation of a number of procedural rules.
In that respect, I would also add that by the end of the year we will be putting out a Green Paper on the presumption of innocence: many Members of this Parliament have highlighted the need to reconcile the right to safety, and hence the right to have crime brought under control, with legal guarantees for the accused.
In early 2006 we will be publishing a second Green Paper dealing with the gathering of evidence, which will certainly be followed by more complete initiatives on the implementation of alternative sentences as well as an interesting â and, I hope, extremely useful â initiative: a framework decision, which we expect to draw up during 2005, on alternative control measures to temporary custody.
You are aware that the subject of temporary custody, or detention prior to conviction, is one in which peopleâs rights to freedom have to be weighed against the stateâs right to prosecute criminals.
These, then, are just a few examples of initiatives â but ones I believe to be important â which the Commission will be putting forward over the coming months.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will be happy if the Member States in the Council are as bold as you have been today regarding the exchange of information on criminal records.
The Commission would certainly like to move faster on the computerised information exchange system.
We started a debate last month at the Luxembourg Council of Ministers and we intend to continue it.
There are technical problems, however, as well as the political ones which someone pointed out.
We still lack that degree of mutual trust that we need to allow data on past convictions to be entered into an electronic search engine, which in technical terms could be set up very quickly.
As MrÂ DiÂ Pietro rightly said, it is not a question of new data but of data on convictions, which can be used by judges.
We will therefore be very careful to prevent any use of such data that falls outside the rationale given by the judicial authority â which we obviously have to trust â when it asks to see the information.
To conclude, I believe that this subject needs a more united Europe.
It needs a more united Europe because we have to harmonise our criminal justice systems, which are unfortunately highly diverse, and we have to be sure of the legal positions when â and let us emphasise this â we respect the independence of the judiciary.
Perhaps we should worry about harmonising the rules: the rules about what a criminal association is and how and why the head of a criminal organisation can be punished vary too much from one country to another.
That, then, is what we should worry about: harmonising the criminal law systems a little more.
That is a job that we will do wholeheartedly.
In the end, we will carefully monitor how well the Member States adhere to these principles.
In three daysâ time, I will be presenting the Commission communication on the European arrest warrant to the Council meeting of Justice Ministers, and I will take the opportunity to say quite clearly that unfortunately â and much to my regret â Italy is the only country in Europe that has not yet adopted the necessary national legislation, and that there are also a few countries that have adopted national legislation but, as one of you pointed out, have tried to reintroduce filters that are not in keeping with the European spirit.
The arrest warrant legislation serves to speed up the implementation of certain procedures; if we want to speed it up in the case of terrorism and organised crime, all Member States must have confidence in the system, and we will keep a watchful eye open to ensure that Europeâs rules are fully observed.

Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Jonathan Evans (A6-24/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commissionâs XXXIIIrd Report on Competition Policy â 2003 (2004/2139(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, it might seem a little incongruous that we are today, at the beginning of 2005, discussing the European Commission's Report on Competition Policy for 2003.
That is just because last year was election year, the debate as such is about very much wider issues.
It is an opportunity for Parliament to place on record, as we should, our enormous respect for the outgoing Commissioner, Mario Monti, who was the Competition Commissioner at the time of this report.
It is inevitable that the report itself and Parliament's response draws upon the major programme for the reorganisation of competition policy for which Mr Monti has received so much praise.
This is a debate that had to take place with industry, and not just in relation to the modernisation of the anti-trust rules themselves.
Industry had to recognise the purpose of this reform.
The aim was to do away with a system that was in itself unnecessarily bureaucratic so as to redirect the resources of the Commission to cracking down properly on hard-core cartels.
In addition, we have seen the reform of the Merger Regulation, reorganisation of the merger control task force and the first steps in relation to state-aid reform.
I know our new Commissioner also shares this view in relation to the legacy of Mr Monti, because only recently she has been speaking at Bocconi University and making very similar remarks about Mr Monti's contribution.
It is also inevitable that we would direct our attention not just to this programme of work and the lessons to be learned from it, but also to the way in which that programme of work now affects efforts to improve Europe's competitiveness.
We are not trying to change the rules about competition policy for the sake of it or as a form of bureaucratic exercise.
The purpose here is to act in the interests of consumers to increase Europe's competitiveness and develop growth and jobs.
That is what the operation of an effective competition policy is all about.
I want to say a word about the new Commissioner and I hope it does not embarrass her.
Many people have asked me my opinion about the change we will have now.
I suppose up to four weeks ago we were all asking that, to some extent.
The Commissioner has been very active in the course of the last month.
On 3 February she spoke to Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and set on record her agenda in this role.
I have already referred to her speech in Milan at Mario Monti's university, and on 17 February Mrs Kroes made another speech in Paris.
Taken together, these speeches clearly set out the progressive agenda that the European Commission intends to take forward.
I commend the Commission for being determined to clarify the rules in relation to state-aid reform.
In our report we refer to this as an area where we are seeking further action on the part of the Commission.
This does not mean a situation in which the Commission just sits idly by waiting to see whether somebody is going to make a complaint about uncompetitive behaviour in some part of the economy.
We want to ensure that the whole way in which business operates within Europe is one that encourages free and fair competition and consequently enhances the competitiveness of Europe.
Finally, a further area for which Mr Monti deserves special praise is his work in relation to international cooperation.
We can cooperate even when we are being competitive.
I well remember the reaction of some people in America a few years ago to the GE-Honeywell decision that was taken by Mr Monti.
Today I had the honour of being present to hear President Bush's speech and afterwards seeing him shake the hand of Alex Schaub, the Director-General of Competition at the time that decision was made.
That is an example of international cooperation.
I commend the outgoing Commissioner and I look forward to the tenure of the incoming Commissioner, Commissioner Kroes.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be here for my first debate with you in plenary, and the subject could not have been better chosen.
It is no coincidence that today's agenda started with the Commission working paper.
The President of the Commission underlined how important the work programme is for this term of the Commission.
Mr Frattini took the lead by explaining the priority we attach to criminal matters and justice.
And now it is for me as Competition Commissioner to explain our position on what is in Mr Jonathan Evans' report.
I welcome the support of the European Parliament, and I acknowledge the support you have given in the past to the European Commission, and especially to Mr Monti, as you rightly emphasise.
There is no doubt that I have inherited a great legacy from Mr Monti.
The greatest tribute I can pay him is to continue his work and build on it.
Under the leadership of President Barroso, the European Commission has recently proposed a new partnership for growth and jobs.
Competition policy, as Mr Evans rightly mentioned, has a crucial role to play here.
Competition is the central driving-force for competitiveness and growth, and we badly need that growth.
That was clearly stated this afternoon by speakers from both right and left.
If we are to deliver on the fundamental social and environmental objectives which are at the heart of our European values, then economic growth is a must.
There are three ways competition policy can contribute to partnership.
Firstly, later this spring we will launch a debate on reviewing the state aid rules within the overall objective of 'less and better', which here means better focused aid.
Aid should be concentrated where it can add most value: for innovation, research and development, risk capital and the development of those regions lagging furthest behind.
Secondly, we will maintain a fair and firm approach to enforcement and will remain tough on cartels.
There is no doubt about that.
That was also Mr Monti's approach.
As the report highlights, it is not acceptable to let the global advantages of the single market be undermined by cartels and other unfair business practices among a handful of undertakings.
Thirdly, we will look at new ways of promoting competition in the internal market, by using sector investigations and competition screening to uncover and tackle the remaining, often hidden, regulatory and private barriers to free competition.
In taking these priorities forward, I will take account of the helpful observations presented in the report before us.
I can assure you of my commitment to ensuring an ongoing and constructive dialogue on competition issues with this House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, might I be permitted to express my appreciation of MrÂ Evansâs reports and its conclusions?
I also wish to express my appreciation of MrsÂ Kroesâs contribution and emphasise that I am among those who look forward with high hopes to possible further contributions of hers.
I believe we have to be aware of the fact that what, right now, is the driving force in the European Union and in the work on developing and modernising our society is competition.
We have the pressure of external competition resulting from globalisation and that of internal competition, reinforced by enlargement and the internal market.
Such competition releases considerable dynamism and energy into European society, and not only where development, growth and new jobs are concerned.
I also believe that it is in practice the most powerful tool for European integration when it comes to the spread of ideas, goods and services across borders.
That is what is happening right now, and I believe there is a danger of our underestimating it.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to try also to include this dimension of the effects of competition in future competition reports.
It is not only a matter of economics, but also of European cooperation in its most practical sense.
I believe we have the task of extending the basic conditions of competition to new areas.
What is at issue here is the knowledge-based society, involving research, education and health care.
As MrÂ Evans points out in his report, it is also a question of energy and telecommunications markets.
I should also like to draw the Commissionerâs attention to that part of the report that deals with the importance of also creating sound conditions for European manufacturers to compete globally and with the importance of the need, when making competition assessments, to consider the whole of the internal market and not only national and local sub-markets.
Companies of the future will require a large domestic market.
That is what the internal market needs to be for, and it is with this in mind that competition should be developed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, Mr Evansâs draft report did not give rise to any fundamental disagreements.
I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the spirit of cooperation that led to consensus on almost all of the amendments that I tabled as shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.


These amendments clarified a range of points, not least that competitiveness is an essential factor in fostering growth in Europe, although this is only one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, equally as important as cohesion and the environment.
The next point was that the relationship between competition policy and state aid must be clarified; the third was that the rules regarding technology exchange agreements and research and development aid, particularly in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, must be clarified; fourthly, that the relationship between the financial instruments linked to the Kyoto Protocol impacting at company level and competition policy must be clarified; fifthly, that the new Member States must adapt quickly to competition policy; and sixthly, that close ties are welcome between competition policy and international trade policy, both at multilateral level, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, and at bilateral level with the main partners, including China.
Those are some of the proposals that were accepted.
Two proposed amendments did not achieve consensus: one is to be tabled by Mrs Batzeli, and the other concerns the sentence in which the rapporteur proposes, and I quote, that âParliament expresses its concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electricity marketsâ.
I feel that liberalisation is not an end in itself.
It is a means whereby in this sector, in common with other essential supplies, the consumer enjoys the best possible conditions in terms of price, quality and universality, because those consumers are citizens, first and foremost.
Liberalisation must take place within a framework that guarantees the status of gas and electricity as a public good.
That is the thrust of the amendment that I had the opportunity to table.
What must be remembered, perhaps today more than ever, is that the EU project is a political one, albeit with an economic foundation.
If the supremacy of the market means that the citizens will, on a long-term basis, be prevented from enjoying their fundamental rights ...
Â Â  . â Mr President, the title, which refers to state aid for public services, is a misnomer, because this is aid for companies.
As long as the state monopolies existed in public services, they mainly served the interests of the plutocracy.
However, today, within the framework of capitalist restructurings, most public services have been given â and others are going to be given â to private capital, so that their profitability can also be reinforced in this way.
Consequently, the European Union's main criterion for state aid is not to cover grass-roots needs and resolve grass-roots problems, but to approve it so that big business never loses out and so that there are no repercussions on its profitability.
In addition, the Commission proposal comes within the framework of the capital restructurings promoted by the opening of the markets on which big business will derive even more profit, while the aspects of the proposal about exemption from approval of state aid by the European Union for small services of general interest, airlines and shipping companies, are insignificant.
They do not under any circumstances satisfy enhanced grass-roots needs and that is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all recognise that there is a case for promoting competition in the interests of economic efficiency and Mrs Kroes has promised to continue the work of her predecessor in routing out unfair state aid and cartels wherever she can find them.
I want to suggest how she could do much better than this.
Our rapporteur Mr Evans notes that the competitiveness of European business is one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.
Unfortunately, too often competitiveness in the EU is too often taken to mean that every nation and every company has to suffer under the same regulatory burden or the same 'level playing field'.
This is not really the same as competition.
Dare I extend Mr HÃ¶kmark's remarks and suggest that if the Commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition.
This would be a much richer source of efficiency.
Give nations some freedom to determine their own agricultural policies and to decide for themselves how they want to ensure their own health and safety.
Allow nations to set their own rules over everything that is not directly concerned with trade or other matters of common interest.
A radical suggestion maybe, but it would allow competition from the more lightly regulated economies to provide the spur for lighter regulation elsewhere and we shall all prosper.
For those EU regions that are struggling to converge, relief from over-regulation would surely do much more good than any amount of handouts from the diminishing pool of Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur.
If meaningful deregulation could be achieved then all the sorrow about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda could be turned to rejoicing as EU economies really begin to move out of the sick bay.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
The basis for measures relating to the market for goods and services is coherent action in the field of competition policy.
The report on 2003 shows that good progress has been made in this respect, but that shortcomings remain.
Fresh challenges are presented by the accession to the EU of ten new Member States with varying regulations on competition law.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight several problems.
In a number of Member States, the markets for certain services have been taken over by professional associations or organisations, which create obstacles restricting competitiveness.
The directive must also set out the conditions according to which financial assistance may be granted for public services or production, to ensure that such assistance does not end up amounting to long-term subsidies, as this would damage competitiveness.
Finally, there should be provisions allowing public services at town or commune level to be exempt from all requirements relating to competitiveness, provided that this would mean better solutions for local problems.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, competition policy is one of the Commissionâs key tasks in relation to the internal market.
To judge by the debate that took place a few hours ago, it is apparent that the European Union really is a global player in this field.
It is also apparent that MrsÂ Kroes is acting as a stand-in as far as this work is concerned, since the report that has been tabled and is being discussed relates to the previous Commissionâs work, and I should like to wish her the best of luck in this respect.
For as long as the European Communities have existed, the successful work carried out by the Commission has played a significant part in helping to ensure that a characteristic feature of the European market has been fair competition, which has brought the benefits of quality and reasonable prices to all citizens.
It is against this background that MrÂ Evansâ report evaluates the work carried out by the Commissionâs Competition DG in 2003, even though decisions that were taken during this period were taken under the aegis of the previous Commission.
The aim of the debate on this report should therefore be to examine and evaluate the extensive amendments that have been made to European competition law and the major changes that have taken place within the European Commission in terms of their future effectiveness.
There can be no doubt that the aforementioned amendments and changes are, in principle, likely to maintain the high standard of European competition policy.
As I mentioned in my question, however, I believe that there are a number of areas where improvements would be useful.
These include protection for principal witnesses in competition law cases throughout Europe, the legal status of Internet publications and guaranteed protection against double prosecution under monopoly law.
Irrespective of these concerns, however, the report before us provides an excellent basis for carrying out future work in the usual successful manner.
I wish you the best of luck in ensuring that the decisions you take over coming months stand up in court.
I also hope that you will be able to follow the previous Commissionâs example and to take decisions that are in the publicâs interest, as trust and authority are crucial as far as competition policy is concerned.
I hope that you will enjoy both.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is particularly positive that the Commission in its references to sectoral developments highlights, among other things, the need for additional Community efforts in the sector of the mass media, so that their liberalisation can safeguard pluralism and economic development.
Commissioner, Mr Evans, I really wish to congratulate you in person on your work and, more specifically, on your work in this report.
I should like at this point to draw your attention to the fact that, because of the cultural peculiarity of the audiovisual sector, which is such that this sector cannot be treated as a normal industry, the Commission must clarify the role which the main shareholders play on the basis of competition policy.
We feel that it is important for the Commission to impose pluralism on the media, both at national and at Community level, by consistently safeguarding the free participation of everyone in the audiovisual media sector.
Commissioner, given that the Commission emphasises that competition rules, as you state in your report, are the rules on which the resolution of the problems which derive from the creation or the strengthening of the dominant position on the market will be based in order to address priority agreements, will a policy be approved under which restrictions on the basic shareholder act as a check on the competition policy of the mass media?
I should like us to receive a response so that our rapporteur, Mr Evans, can perhaps accept the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank those who gave me positive feedback.
I also listened, of course, to those who were more critical.
Mr Evans' support for the idea and the faith expressed in his report was a great start.
I set out my own philosophy in my recent speeches at Bocconi and at the OECD in Paris, where all those national authorities from around the world that are active in the competition field were gathered.
Those speeches and this report show, I think, that we are on the same track.
We are all aware that competition is the instrument for getting our economy in better shape, something that we badly need in Europe.
We have both a lack of economic growth and a lack of productivity.
We badly need economic growth because we have environmental and social welfare objectives that we rightly believe are essential within our culture.
I found the remarks that honourable Members have made very interesting and stimulating.
They mark the start of our dialogue.
As I mentioned before, I would be delighted to be invited to EMAC to discuss this item.
Concerning competition in technology transfer, there is indeed a way of developing this within our competition policy.
It is not a separate item, it is all combined in one policy.
Regarding Mr Rutowicz's question about a market definition in merger cases, the Commission welcomes, and indeed promotes greater integration of markets.
There is no doubt about that.
As markets integrate, the relevant anti-trust markets will also become wider.
However, for the time being many markets remain national or regional and this must be reflected in competition analysis, including market definition, so that competition and consumers do not suffer.
Mrs Elisa Ferreira asked about gas and electricity liberalisation.
I agree that it is important to improve the functioning of the energy market.
In close cooperation with our energy colleagues, we are investigating the current status of the market.
We are investigating the conduct of incumbents in certain markets and plan to carry out sector inquiries.
The sector inquires will provide important input as to how the markets function and how they can be improved.
It is important to differentiate between preferences for liberalisation.
I could not agree more about having a positive attitude towards liberalisation.
However, in some cases where liberalisation has taken place there are still activities within that market that we do not accept.
When that happens, one should not say 'I am against liberalisation'.
We have a duty to find out what the actual situation is and who is not acting properly and not meeting our expectations.
Mr Rutowicz made a couple of remarks with regard to state aid reform.
The conclusion of the Prodi Commission, later repeated by the European Council, was that there should be less aid but better aid.
In addition, it was concluded that with enlargement we had a further reason for less and better aid for those areas that had already enjoyed the benefit of such aid.
We now have to realise that within the ten new Member States there is a new territory which we have to improve, where aid could be of great help.
With better focus and a better use of tax-payers' money we can concentrate aid where it really generates the greatest value; where it contributes to cohesion; where it boosts innovation, research and development, and risk capital so that small- and medium-sized companies can also play a positive role as an engine of innovation in stimulating the economy.
We need to ensure that they have access to risk capital because they need to take their ideas forward.
Better focused state aid means better economic results and governance and ultimately, better and more secure jobs and better use of tax-payers' money.
In early spring we will have a chance to present the action plan on state aid reform.
That action plan will include measures to rationalise the state aid framework.
I want to reduce a lot of the red tape, a lot of the bureaucracy and I think that notification requirements for straightforward low impact aid should be one of those items we can get rid of, thus focussing resources on checking the more problematic high-impact subsidies.
Mrs Ferreira said that the title was misleading.
I think that the title of the report just covers what we are really focusing on.
Another question was about audiovisuals.
Maintaining and developing media pluralism is a basic public goal of the European Union, together with the preservation of cultural diversity and freedom of access for the Union citizen to all kinds of media platforms.
The application of competition policy instruments in the media sector is limited to addressing the underlying market structure and economic impact of media undertakings' behaviour.
Nevertheless competition policy can and does make an essential contribution to the maintenance and development of media pluralism both in traditional television and other broadcasting markets and the new media.
Mr Schwab underlined that the European Union is a global player and that therefore it is essential to look at the price, at the quality, and also at the research possibilities to fall in line with our global competitors.
It would be a good idea, to focus especially on increasing efficiency and transparency and to work towards a less bureaucratic one-stop shop for leniency applications.
This will be explained in the new paper I am preparing which will also support greater efficiency and transparency.
I have tried to answer the questions that were raised.
Again, thanks for the opportunity and thanks again to MrÂ Evans and all those who have been involved in the preparation of this report.
Today's debate is just the start.
It is very important to continue the discussion and to feel that you are on the same track as us in the Commission.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mrs in 't Veld on State aid in the form of public service compensation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not doubt that you will be pleased to hear me say that I will keep it brief and will not inconvenience you with my husky voice for any longer than necessary, because I am afraid that as a Liberal, I have to conclude that there is not exactly a level playing field between myself and the flu virus,but that I simply have not survived the competition.
The EU Treaty contains two objectives that are important to this report.
The first one is that on the one hand, we have state aid rules which must ensure that the internal market operates effectively, and on the other hand, the Treaty also states that those rules must not hinder the proper functioning of public services.
The internal market has brought us many benefits, in the area of public services as elsewhere.
We also find that we are all very much attached to the so-called European social economic model with good public services, which has, moreover, provided us with a high level of competitiveness.
The Commissionâs proposals are very welcome and I am pleased to hear that Mrs Kroesâ words do no more than underline what we have written in our report, namely that we aim to reduce state aid on the one hand, and do away with unnecessary red tape, on the other, and that we are focusing on those things that really distort the internal market, which are, after all, detrimental to our economy and also, therefore, to the foundation on which public services rest.
I should like to outline a few key points.
First of all, I should like to underline once again that the focus must be on the citizen as user of the services and as taxpayer.
This may seem a little bit like stating the obvious, but all too often in reality, what takes priority are political interests, corporate interests, institutional interests and all kinds of other interests, to which, quite often, the interests of the individual have to give way.
The second point is the definition of what we term small services of general interest.
The Commission has proposed granting those small services exemption from the obligation of prior notification for state aid and has, more or less, suggested that we use the same threshold of EUR 50 million maximum by way of annual turnover as we do for medium and small enterprises.
Although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has, at my proposal, followed this suggestion in the first instance, I do think that we should review the practical implications in a few yearsâ time, because we have no idea of how many businesses, how much state aid in total, and how many applications for state aid are involved.
I should therefore like to know the exact impact of that threshold.
Another important point for me is evidence-based policy making.
For years, we in this House have been waging traditional trench warfare between Left and Right about the liberalisation of public services.
I think it is important that we should finally have the facts on the table.
In the report, we therefore urge the Commission to present an up-to-date and detailed report on public services every four years, when this regulation is up for renewal.
I should like to finish off with a minor, slightly technical point.
One paragraph in the report was included after we had adopted an amendment, and that paragraph seems to suggest that this House proposes that the task of offering a certain service must, in all cases, be assigned via a tendering procedure.
That is not, of course, what is intended.
I think that there are many people â maybe not all, but many â who will agree with me that that is, in itself, a sound procedure, and one that, in many cases, leads to sound results, but I would like to do away with the misconception that as of today, this House will decide that all services must be assigned via such a procedure.
It is unfortunate that no amendments have been tabled to do away with that misconception, but I would in any event like to make this clear to the Commission in todayâs plenary.
Â Â  . Mr President, many thanks for the clear explanation of MrsÂ in ât Veldâs report; the problems that are raised in it are extremely important, because certainly now that we will, based on the state aid review, examine the best way of achieving the most effective result, it is the observations that have been made here that matter and therefore very much apply here.
As I have said before further to the discussion on MrÂ Jonathan Evansâ report, I agree that we must cover all the angles in order to proceed in a more transparent and more effective way, thereby cutting down on bureaucracy and red tape, which does not benefit anybody, is too time-consuming, and, as Mrs in ât Veld put it very graphically, ultimately, what matters is the public, the consumers and taxpayers, who want to know what happens with their money and to what effect.
That is why, when talking about definitions, and particularly about how to define small services of general interest, it is appropriate in any event not to jump the gun and to say that we know what is to be understood by it for all eternity.
This is an area in which we have to gain experience, to see how things pan out, what the turnover would be in which situations and where, and what level of state aid would be involved.
What is ultimately the extent of state aid that you do not only entertain, but also must take into consideration?
In addition, Mrs in 't Veld stated very clearly that she favours evidence-based policy-making.
We must finally put this into practice and ask ourselves whether it would not be a good idea â I, for one, think it is one, and it is one that I am glad to adopt â to submit a report in four years or so to demonstrate the impact of it all, and check whether it has the desired effect or whether there are maybe better methods for achieving our goal.
If we talk about state aid, then it is not the intention, certainly in our discussion, for that to be a permanent arrangement.
The intention is to use state aid as a way of setting in motion a process that will, eventually, lead to self-sufficiency.
To quote a well-known Chinese saying, it is the intention that, eventually, fish are caught with the fishing rod you give, rather than fish only being handed out to those who need them at the time.
I agree that this is a sound, experience-based report and explores whether state aid works, how it works and whether this is the best way of going about things.
However, we do come up against the Court ruling in the Altmark case, which brings us to the fourth criterion.
I assume that the first three criteria are clear, and with regard to the fourth criterion, we have to establish that tendering is possible in all situations.
In those cases where tendering is possible, it is obvious that we need to apply the four criteria, but in other cases, people need to take the best possible decision under the given circumstances, and we have to conclude that we need to gain some experience in that area in order to formulate the best methodology.
I would therefore like to echo the rapporteur in this and say that we can indeed gain the experience together and submit it in a report.
Four years are a good timeframe within which we can make some valid statements on this score and hopefully reach some conclusions again in a future debate.
Thank you.
Â Â  .
Mr President, my group is committed to open markets with free and fair competition as they will provide the best quality products and services at the best price. They will also best produce the economic benefits that we need if we are to reach the Lisbon objectives and if we are to pay for our social and environmental ambitions.
Another important consideration in our Group is subsidiarity: the decision should be taken at a level as close as possible to the citizen, which is compatible with a properly functioning single market.
There is no need for Europe to step in where a decision is best taken at national or local level.
We are therefore pleased that MrsÂ in't Veld's excellent report succeeds in accommodating these two priorities.
The overall thrust is to call for fair competition in free markets.
Like her, we would always prefer a transparent tendering process.
However, if local authorities, in their wisdom, feel they can do better for their citizens, they can so do without having to notify the Commission, as long as they keep within the rules, which ensure that potential competitors are not harmed and, most specifically, that they are small in scale and very local in nature.
A clear decision was achieved in committee that gives the Commission a strong steer.
We are happy with this and we will support this same line tomorrow.
We wish Mrs in't Veld well with her report.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
Let me start by congratulating Mrs in 't Veld on her report, which I see as representing another step towards the abandonment, by the members of this Union, of the attempt at squeezing everyone into one size, which, in the long run, does not fit anyone.
Instead we are moving towards the principle of subsidiarity, which involves us in recognising the needs of the countries and regions and of localities.
I think that whoever believes in balance, recognises that the market economy has several advantages, although we must, at the same time, recognise that intolerable shortcomings keep occurring, and those who are entrusted with power and leadership do not budge.
Without any doubt, there are cases of abuses, but there are several other cases, where, if properly regulated, State aid will be the social soul that arrives where the cold calculations of the market's reasoning do not.
The ultimate success of this Europe and of its Member States cannot be measured only through the economyâs statistics.
A healthy economy must be the means whereby we are led towards the real ultimate purpose, that of giving our families a decent life and dignified work in a better environment.
Obviously, every type of aid that is given must be given within an agreed framework that takes into account the realities of different countries.
Planning this framework must involve everyone, and here I emphasise âeveryoneâ â the social partners, trade unions, the consumers and the private sector, and, while we are on the subject of consumers, it would be appropriate to also remember the minorities among consumers and the taxpayers.
I will give an example: an amendment I tabled, and that I am pleased to note was accepted in this report, makes it easier to supply aid from the air, as well through sea routes between islands.
Let me give you an example why this is so.
Currently, in order for the citizens of the island of Gozo to cross over to the main island of my country, Malta, using a 12-minute helicopter trip, the market economy requires them to pay much more than they would pay for an airline ticket for a trip between London and Brussels.
Imagine how such a region can develop without some aid from the State.
We must move even further forward than we have done to date.
I only have to look at the shipyards in my country, which the government is trying to close down, while blaming European Union regulations for the need to do so.
Despite the demonisation of the shipyard workers, these sectors and enterprises have a huge load of work and a large commitment to give in terms of an era of greater technical capacity.
Other large countries of the European Union hid behind the military in order to give subsidies to this sector.
We cannot do that.
There are those who say that these subsidies go against the laws of the European Union. I say: then let us change the laws.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her outstanding work, as she has brought a great deal of expertise and enthusiasm to bear on an extremely complex issue, and has presented a very lucid report.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe regard it as self-evident that the public sector must safeguard the provision of certain services.
There is a need, though, for great care to be exercised when using taxpayersâ money, and it must be used only in cases where it provides consumers with genuine added value.
It is for that reason that clear rules are needed.
In principle we welcome the Commissionâs attempts to lay down a framework to make sure that funds are used in a transparent, objective and easy-to-understand way.
What we want is a solution that ensures that competition is effective and that the rules on services of general interest are not used to distort competition.
Completion of the internal market must not be slowed down by an unchecked and indiscriminate distribution of State aid.
What we want is quite the opposite, namely to lend our support to a solution that makes it possible to achieve a number of goals.
These include the drawing up by the Member States of a definition of services of general interest; even if these definitions are not identical, they will be comparable, and we do not regard this as violating the principle of subsidiarity.
In addition, State aid must be used in a targeted and focused manner in instances where it helps to safeguard the future, with its future use being somewhat more restricted than has been the case to date, and the rules on such aid must not interfere with the further implementation of the internal market.
We are opposed to the prevention of a possible liberalisation of services of general interest by means of derogations to the directive on services, such as has been attempted by the Federal Minister for the Economy in Germany.
Finally, I should like to call on the Commission to provide further explanatory documents to ensure that the rules are made easier to apply.
It should develop benchmarks and examples of best practice as points of reference, for the best practice approach can act as a source of good ideas, derived from other Member Statesâ successes.
Â Â  . Mr President, my Group has tabled a number of amendments and requested several separate votes on this report.
This has been done to give Members the opportunity to ensure that the report clearly favours public service providers, particularly in the fields of health and social housing provision.
The report affirms our belief in the importance of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible to all.
It also recognises the right of local authorities to self-government.
So far, so good.
However, recital E contends that 'the internal market, liberalisation and compliance with the rules on competition have on the whole led to improved access to SGIs, new services with more choice, better quality and lower costs for consumers'.
In our view this is questionable to say the least.
The report also asserts that no distinction should be made between public and private enterprises and that all SGIs should be put out to tender.
The rapporteur seemed to suggest that there was some misunderstanding about this, but that is how it comes across.
This would cause problems for in-house services within public bodies such as local housing authorities and health boards.
My Group cannot accept a lack of clarity on this point.
On the contrary, we would support an approach that clearly exempts from the prior notification requirement the kinds of local services that do not affect the development of trade, and do not conflict with the interests of the European Union.
State-aid rules have frequently led to difficulties and uncertainty for local authorities and other public service providers.
We ought to have certainty, and we hope the House votes in favour of that tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, this report highlights the issue of whether it is acceptable for centralised decision-making in Brussels to have an impact on peopleâs lives on an everyday basis.
There is a widespread feeling that practices that used to be well-established are being called into question, in particular in the case of services of general interest and possible compensation for the provision of public services, and this has left a great many people fearing that they will be left with nothing at all.
I particularly agree with the comments made by the penultimate speaker, MrÂ Klinz of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, namely that the priority for Brussels must be greater transparency in order to resolve this problem, and that there is a risk that the smaller Member States will continue to use subsidiarity to their own advantage, either by imposing artificially high prices or by helping their friends.
I am also firmly convinced that unless the Commission speeds up the procedures for assessing internationally comparable best practice models, we run the risk of having to submit a negative final or interim report in four yearsâ time.
The one additional point I should like to make is that I cannot understand why such far-reaching exemptions have been granted to public service broadcasters.
The latter increasingly resemble private broadcasters in terms of their working methods and the way they market themselves, and I believe that their activities in many fields, for example online services, mean that what we are seeing amounts to additional subsidies.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, one of the main problems encountered when applying European legislation on State aid to the provision of services of general interest is legal certainty, or rather legal uncertainty.
It has not always been obvious to decision-makers in local authorities at city, municipality or district level whether compensation for special expenses connected with these services comes within the scope of State aid regulations.
The dilemma these decision-makers face is whether these payments have to be declared to the Commission or approved by it.
There are serious legal consequences if compensation is not declared when it should have been, yet if declarations are submitted unnecessarily in cases of doubt valuable time is lost during this procedure.
Steps will now be taken to reduce this legal uncertainty, and this is something I wholeheartedly welcome and support.
As has already been mentioned, the ruling by the European Court of Justice on the Altmark case is the legal basis that the Commission has used to put forward its proposal for an exemption decision.
This proposal complies with the demand Parliament made in its resolution of 14Â JanuaryÂ 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is a sign that support exists for a control policy that focuses on cases that are key to effective competition in the internal market.
Under this proposal, compensation that only has a very minor impact on the internal market will be exempt from State aid control procedures, which will mean a great deal more legal certainty for local stakeholders.
Compensation for services of general economic interest that have only a minor impact on the internal market is frequently granted on a strictly limited and local basis, and is therefore a good example of an instance where exemption would be decided on.
Provided that other criteria are complied with, such as providing a clear statement of responsibilities and adherence to the principle of transparency, such compensation will also benefit from the planned increase in legal certainty.
The rapporteur has submitted an outstanding report, and ensured that it expressed the majority view by putting it to a vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I hope that the House as a whole will view it in the same way.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time I was among those who believed that the only type of bureaucracy was state bureaucracy.
Now, though, as an MEP, I have discovered an inextricably linked market bureaucracy: State aid.
I believe that the proposal put to us today constitutes real progress, namely â as you just said during the previous debate, Commissioner â the exemption from the notification requirement of minor aid that is not considered to have an impact on the single market.
In my opinion, this is a considerable step forwards.
We need to consolidate this, and it would also be worthwhile to definitively rename it public service compensation, rather than State aid.
This is a new legal category that could be created.
With regard to the report that has been presented to us, I am one of those who believe that there are things that need to be stabilised.
In particular, I do not think that we can vote again as we did in committee: hospitals and social housing must be clearly integrated in the scope.
This, though, is probably not enough.
I am one of those who suggest that there should also be autonomous services within local communities, which other texts are in the process of recognising, in particular the regulation on the public service obligation in transport.
We will probably have to wait for the Commission's communication on social services in order to be able, maybe tomorrow, to include these in this text.
Finally, I think we need to consider the issue of the fourth criterion from the Altmark ruling.
This criterion is so complicated that it would introduce to this document â which is a simplifying document â new complications for local communities.
As you know, it involves comparison with the reasonable profit of a comparable undertaking at EU level.
This is absolutely impracticable.
Consequently, perhaps this fourth criterion could at some point be abandoned, even at the risk of slight overcompensation, so that your aim of simplification can finally be pursued and achieved.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that I welcome this initiative, which clarifies the relationship between, on the one hand, state aid and, on the other hand, the provision by Member States of compensation for the cost of services of general economic interest.
Services of general economic interest are essential for improving the quality of life for all citizens, and these services are often central in helping to attract investment to less-favoured areas and rural areas, thus boosting their competitiveness and leading to greater cohesion within the EU.
At a national level within Ireland, the post office network is under threat, particularly the smaller rural post offices that are not computerised and cannot, therefore, offer an adequate level of service to citizens.
The post office network will require a public service obligation in order to remain viable, and this proposal to exempt small-scale public funding such as this from the obligation of prior notification to the Commission makes absolute sense in that it allows sufficient flexibility at national and regional level without distorting the internal market.
Indeed, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have both said, it also cuts down on red tape.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with those who say that the Commissionâs proposals are a first step and that Mrs in ât Veldâs report is a first step as well as a sound report.
The legal uncertainty is too great at present for the local players.
At the moment, we are leaving it up to the Court of Justice to decide what exactly should be done about state aid.
While that is a first step, we see it as too insubstantial.
Exempting compensation paid to hospitals and social housing is a first step, but we think that others should be added to the list.
Commissioner, we would add care homes and employment agencies, which should be exempt from notification.
As for the fourth criterion in the Altmark judgment, that is totally unacceptable to us and also not feasible in practical terms.
After all, what is the definition of the average well-run private undertaking?
What if there is no private equivalent?
Does making reference to the average private undertaking not oversimplify the task assigned to the public service?
Pretending to be a well-run private undertaking can also impact on redundancies and cause social upsets.
I would therefore ask for this criterion to be deleted.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs in 't Veld, Commissioner, the Commission is continually telling us that it cannot put forward a framework directive on services of general interest because the issue is apparently too broad and is covered by the subsidiarity principle.
With this âMonti packageâ and the proposal for a directive on services, however, the Commission is dealing with the issue of public services.
With one small stroke after another, it is painting a sort of Impressionist picture representing its own vision of public services.
Unfortunately, Mr Barroso is no Manet or Renoir.
According to this picture, any financing of public services is necessarily State aid, and thus by implication contravenes the principle of free and fair competition, an aberration that must be stamped out.
The right of this Parliament goes even further, moreover: MrsÂ in 't Veld's report rejects the Commission's proposal to exempt the social housing and hospital sectors from the notification requirement.
Similarly, if Parliament assents to the requirement for a tendering process prior to any award of public service compensation, it will weaken all the small local public services that are directly and indirectly managed by the public authorities.
In conclusion, we are observing, following the dismantling of the great national public services, the weakening of local public services.
This report is in fact deceptive: it claims to make consumers happier, while eroding their citizen's rights with regard to public services.
This weekend, the Portuguese electorate showed their displeasure at this to their former Prime Minister, Mr Barroso.
Â Â  Mr President, you were right in saying that there are many ladies present in our group this evening, and I know that will be to the Commissionerâs liking.
Following the harsh words which have also been spoken from our side of the House, I will also try to congratulate Mrs in 't Veld and look at how we can, after all, reach compromises on this issue.
I am told that she has indicated a willingness to take some of our amendments into consideration.
I think that the first point is the in-house provision of services, in which respect, we would like to stand by what we said in last yearâs Herzog report.
Therefore, if she could support amendments in that respect, that would help us a great deal.
The second point is public procurement and transparent tendering, which is covered in a number of amendments tabled by Mr Purvis, and also in an amendment by MrsÂ Wagenknecht, who states that this tendering should not take place unless required by law.
This may be a bridging provision to clarify something that has, as you yourself indicate, not been incorporated well.
Based on this, we can subsequently bring the different texts â there are always four different texts â into line with each other.
Lastly, there is the issue about exempting hospitals and social housing, which we, too, regard as a rather random selection.
We too would like to see this examined transparently and would like to see what the implications are, but would also like to indicate that much more is yet to be done and much more thought should be given to the way in which the criteria are determined.
That is something that we believe should happen, not in four yearsâ time, but now, at a time when the services directive is up for discussion, to enable us to draft clear criteria based on a framework directive and services of general interest, precisely where the combination of private and public tendering is concerned.
I would like to continue this discussion with the Commissioner in due course.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to apologise to Mrs in 't Veld for failing to mention at the outset that I was impressed by her report.
I know it was a difficult job, but the result has been worth it.
The contribution this report has made to the debate is really important, so I congratulate her.
One of the key motives behind the Commission's proposal is to increase legal certainty and predictability.
One of the remarks made this evening referred to the need for predictability for those who have to deal with public services and public service financing schemes.
As I have already mentioned, we also want to reduce the administrative burden: to get rid of red tape and a lot of bureaucracy not only at European level but also at national and regional level.
That is why timing is so essential.
The question of the efficient functioning of services of general economic interest is of great importance for the Commission, and for Parliament, the Member States and for the consumer â the European Union citizen.
Contrary to what is sometimes said, Community competition rules do not hinder the proper functioning of these services.
They do not affect the prerogatives and responsibilities of national, regional or local authorities to define, organise, finance and monitor public services.
I very much agree with the idea that we should occasionally review what we are doing.
When we consider the Altmark court case, it is not that difficult to make a clear decision on three of the four criteria.
Therefore, I do not agree with the Member who said that it is difficult to define a true public service.
Nor is it difficult to define a contract or to identify the parameters of compensation.
As Mrs van den Burg said, there could be difficulties when tendering is a possibility.
When difficulties arise, you need to calculate the costs on the basis of a well-run company.
Therefore, as far as the fourth criteria is concerned, having implemented this court case ruling for four years we can take our experience into account.
We know that in reality tenders are not widely used for small services of general economic interest.
Under Altmark, the compensation paid is therefore state aid and needs to be notified.
The Commission's established policy is not to restrict the financing of companies in charge of public service obligations.
However, we ensure that this financing is really necessary and does not lead to undue distortions of competition.
The current proposals respond to the new environment arising from the Altmark case.
The Commission's draft decision seeks to reduce the notification burden as concerns small services of general economic interest.
The Treaty establishes that the efficient functioning of services of general interest is a shared responsibility between the Union and Member States.
The proposals before you today form a part of the Commission's efforts to play its role in achieving this.
I welcome the fact that you support the reduction of unnecessary red tape and I will take that into account.
The draft decision excludes small public services from the notification burden, thereby matching the thresholds set for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
As Mrs in 't Veld's report suggests, the Commission considers this to be the most appropriate approach.
The hospital and social housing sectors will also be exempt from notification.
This is made quite clear, and is justified by the high amounts of compensation necessitated by the nature of these public services.
I very much agree with the idea that the Commission should review the application of new rules after a certain period, and after carrying out an impact assessment.
In line with other state-aid frameworks, such as the regional aid guidelines and the block exemptions, we suggest that the framework should apply for six years and be renewed, on the basis of a review, for four years in this case.
For reasons of legal certainty, the validity of the decision should not be limited in time, but I very much agree with the need to hold a review.
It was also suggested that there is a necessity to consult widely on the definition of the public service obligations, particularly where this concerns users.
The Commission agrees in principle, but it is up to Member States and their regional or local authorities to define public services in practice.
The Commission can only recommend that Member States consult widely on that matter.
I have consulted my colleague, MrÂ Barrot, on the suggestion of expanding the scope of the decision concerning transport.
There are several sector regulations in this field, which make extending the scope of the current package difficult.
However, I understand that a separate package is being prepared, and your comments on land and air transport links certainly constitute interesting input for that package.
A benchmarking exercise, especially the benchmarking of public services and services of general economic interest, would be difficult to carry out.
It might not be technically feasible, since public services are structured in different ways in different EU countries.
Considering the costs â and, perhaps, the limited usefulness â of such a study, I do not think it is a good idea.
I am aware of the problem involving existing compensation when the conditions applicable are not met.
I understand that Member States need a certain period of time to modify their existing schemes.
We will consider ways of granting legal certainty for a transitional period.
The criteria for the Altmark ruling need further work and clarification.
In its White Paper on Services of General Interest, adopted in May 2004, the Commission announced that it would adopt a text on this issue in 2005.
Mrs De Vits asked about social health and care services, and these are already covered by the draft decision.
In the light of the amount of public service compensation generally granted to care services, most should fall within the thresholds for compensation defined in the decision and should therefore benefit from the exemption from notification.
On the points raised by Mrs De Vits, the Commission supports the recommendation that tendering processes should be used wherever possible, and in most cases in which the Altmark criteria have been met there will be no state aid.
But we know that, in reality, tenders are not widely used, particularly for small services of general economic interest.
I agree with Mrs van den Burg that we need to take experience into account.
In the light of experience, we will have a better and clearer view of how to handle this.
If there is no way of tendering, then the cost basis of a well-run company â in this case, a public service company â should be taken into account.
I thank Mrs in 't Veld again.
We will certainly return to these matters once we have had more experience.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  I should like to thank the interpreters for having stayed with us for so long, and also the remaining Members, the majority of whom are women â indeed there are more women in the Chamber than men.
Â Â  Â I declare the sitting open.
Â Â  MrÂ President, although I very much support this request for urgent procedure, I would, however, like to point out that care needs to be taken in implementing this proposal not to destroy the local economy, especially the fishing industry.
Subject to that proviso, we support this proposal and the request for urgent procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, my point of order is not about the vote on tsunami vessels but about interpretation problems in Parliament.
Yesterday I spoke here in plenary.
I had a two-minute speech and my political message was totally turned upside down by the interpreters.
It made me look stupid.
My colleagues could not understand a word I was saying in Finnish.
This is a constant problem for all the small language groups in Parliament.
I shall not use Finnish any more in plenary if the result is that my political message is turned upside down.
The same thing happened at the start of this sitting with Polish, a very nice language.
Interpretation is not up to its task and this is a terrific problem for this House.
I want this noted for the record.
Â Â  Your concerns will be noted in the record, Mrs Kauppi.
I understand why you spoke in English rather than Finnish.
It is a serious matter and we shall look into it.
Â Â  â Mr President, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will let you know how much we appreciate this request for urgent procedure.
We have followed what Commissioner Borg has done since the tragedy took place and have supported him.
On a practical level, we shall hold an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Fisheries at 5.30Â p.m. in order to decide whether each measure, as Mr Swoboda said, is in the meetingâs best interests.
In principle, however, and I believe that this reflects the opinion of most Members, I am entirely in favour of the urgent procedure.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have now heard two speakers in favour and, according to the rules, we are entitled to hear one speaker against.
Let us firstly agree that everyone wants to give aid as quickly as possible in the most efficient way possible.
I would, however, advise against urgent procedure.
It is a nice idea, that of exporting old fishing vessels, but it would not work very well.
The FAO has still not received any lists of the vessels countries want.
Moreover, it is warning against problems involving incorrect equipment and unduly high capacity.
These matters must firstly be investigated.
What is more, a conference of the regional fishing organisations held a meeting last week in Sumatra, involving representatives from, for example, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
They are opposed to the export of old vessels.
They would rather have help developing their local shipyards and fishing fleets.
In order to obtain a proposal that works and that is just what is needed, usual procedures should be used so that local considerations can better be put into the equation.
We need more dialogue with the FAO and local fishermen before we are ready to vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, in adopting this report, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of course supported the Councilâs request for urgent procedure, but at the same time called on the Council, by means of an amendment to the legislative resolution and to the recital in the regulation, to provide every opportunity for diplomacy before finally adopting the text.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore invite this House to follow the suggestion made by the committee that I have the honour to chair, a suggestion that was also unanimously supported by the Committee on Development.
From a procedural point of view, and in order to pre-empt any disputes from third parties, I ask you to draw the Councilâs attention to the need, at the legislative consultation stage, to forward complete texts to Parliament, including annexes.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- (A6-0026/2005) by MrÂ Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European economic situation â preparatory report on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines [2004/2269(INI)];
- (A6-0025/2005) by MrÂ Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Public Finances in EMU â 2004 [2004/2268(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on macroeconomic policy is becoming increasingly ideological.
In this context, a conservative and liberal majority distorted my preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines by removing all references to the need to coordinate European economic policies, even though this is required by Article 4 of the Treaty.
That majority refuses to accept the evidence; the Stability and Growth Pact must be adjusted to the economic cycles and the Commission must also assess the quality of public expenditure by analysing any deficit that a country may have accrued.
Fortunately, the Ecofin Council is soon set to disappoint these devotees of stability at all costs.
In order to confirm this ultraliberal pigheadedness, that majority adopted two amendments, one demanding a reduction in the general level of taxation, the other considering that an overall rise in working time is unavoidable.
For some Members, that probably represents the balance between flexibility and security advocated in the Koch report; more work for the workers and less tax for the wealthy.
Mr President, let us calmly take stock of the European economy.
2004 was a vintage year for the worldâs economy.
The volume of international trade has never been so great.
The new report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says, however, that despite strong economic growth â more than 5% â unemployment across the world has scarcely gone down.
Relative poverty has fallen sharply, though.
The EU has experienced only moderate growth and a very slight fall in unemployment, particularly in the new Member States, yet productivity in the EU of the 25 has, according to the ILO, âimproved at a faster rate than the world averageâ.
This probably explains why the Union is the biggest exporter of goods and services and why Germany alone is performing better than the United States, China or Japan.
A Europe that is the biggest exporter and the biggest buyer in the world â a Europe that manages to balance its books â cannot be in as bad a situation as the prevailing euro-pessimism would have us believe.
I am not about to lapse into blissful euro-optimism.
The Union could do better.
There is not enough growth and there is too much unemployment, particularly in certain large countries, starting with the Unionâs traditional powerhouses, Germany and France.
For these ultraliberals, the root cause is clear; the problem lies with the constraints of the stability policy and the absence of structural reforms.
Yet structural reforms have been implemented in a number of countries; the Raffarin Government has pursued pension reforms and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der has secured the adoption of HartzÂ 1, HartzÂ 2 and more recently HartzÂ 3 and 4.
Without growth, however, the boldest structural measures run out of steam.
This is the view of the Economic Policy Committee, whose annual report on the structural reforms clearly states that governments âwill only enjoy the fruits of their structural reforms in terms of growth and jobs in an appropriate macroeconomic environmentâ.
Whilst it is true that the euro zoneâs overall deficit has increased, albeit remaining significantly inferior to that of the United States or Japan, the result will astonish the defenders of the faith.
The Stability and Growth Pact was designed to prevent public debt from leading to spiralling interest rates and thus to prevent the euro from becoming a weak currency.
As things have transpired, the European Central Bank has been able to set all-time low interest rates, and the euro is performing almost too strongly against the king dollar.
Despite fluctuations and the oil markets, the inflation rate in the euro zone has remained very low, and the purchasing power of those living in the euro zone is superior to that of residents of the US and the UK.
According to the evidence, the euro zoneâs problem is not a lack of stability but a lack of growth.
In Germany and France in particular, but also in Italy, internal demand is insufficient.
All countries have reduced investment in order to limit government deficit.
Because the Germans and the French are not consuming enough, private investment also remains hamstrung.
Why invest if demand is so moribund?
The rate of saving, on the other hand, is at high levels in the euro zone, particularly in France and Germany.
This is indicative of a lack of confidence and a fear of the future.
One major European country, however, is experiencing considerable growth and a less alarming unemployment rate, and that country is the United Kingdom.
Why is that the case?
The UK Government has supported internal demand by means of a more active investment policy and a tax policy which does not become bogged down in blind devotion to the orthodoxy of stability, but which aims for balance throughout the economic cycle.
Furthermore, the British are consuming, even if they are running up almost US-scale amounts of debt.
The one disadvantage for the British in comparison with the euro zone is that they pay a basic interest rate of 4.75%, as opposed to 2% in the euro zone.
The EU, and in particular the euro zone, needs more growth, and that growth can only come from internal demand, from public and private investment and from consumption.
Some 90% of the Unionâs trade is carried out between the countries of the 25.
Even though the Union remains competitive in world trade, growth cannot come from external demand.
Whilst certain small countries live primarily off external demand, the large countries always rely primarily on internal demand.
Furthermore, those clamouring for European competitiveness based on the social lowest bidder and on lower salaries must acknowledge that most trade is with countries with salary levels and social security costs that are similar to those of Europe.
Accordingly, it is not by slashing salaries, and hence consumption, that the Union will move forward.
Consumption and, most importantly, investment must be reinvigorated in a coordinated fashion.
ArticleÂ 4 of the Treaty calls for economic policies to be coordinated.
Thanks to the intelligent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Union will see a regeneration of growth and jobs.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is the job of the two rapporteurs not only to present the position of their parties, but also the report agreed upon.
That both reports led to a very intense political debate in our committee, given that they are reports on decisions concerning the way forward rather than legislative reports, is evident from the fact that although both reports were approved by very large majorities, one group largely abstained on both.
This demonstrates the importance of the fundamental policy considerations and questions of overall direction addressed in both reports.
I will restrict my comments to the report as adopted.
I have three preliminary observations here.
Firstly, the European Union is a legal Community, and although we are a legal Community, 12 Member States have breached the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact or of the Treaty since that Pact was introduced.
Five of them belong to the euro area: Portugal, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Greece, together with the United Kingdom, to which the excessive deficit procedure does not apply, but which is nevertheless bound by the requirement laid down in Article 116(4) of the Treaty.
My second preliminary observation is that we have, in the euro, a successful common currency, one that has turned the internal market into a home market, but we do not have a common budget policy.
That is why we need a common policy framework, so that the euro can achieve its full potential and the European Union can achieve its growth and employment policy objectives.
There is however, a contradiction here: in 2002 only four Member States within the euro area, accounting in total for 18% of the euro areaâs GDP, had a more or less balanced budget, rising to five euro area Member States in 2004.
My third preliminary observation is that the Lisbon strategy provides us with a basis for achieving more growth and employment, and for increasing our competitiveness.
The reality presented in the report is that over the last decade the EU economy has grown well below its potential, with a decrease not only in private investment but also in gross public investment, which in the euro area has fallen from 4% of GDP in the early 1970s to 2.4%.
People draw differing conclusions from all this.
Some people blame the Stability and Growth Pact, because we say that legally binding provisions are not being complied with, and others say that we have not done our homework and that there is a lack of political will.
We need to embark on structural reforms.
We need to make demographic trends the starting point for changing our realities.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a success because it highlights the political debate about the structural reforms that are required, about the failure of budget policies, and about the risks for the euro, and thus leads to political debate.
A majority of the committee supported this viewpoint.
This report, the theme of which was that we need a stronger political will as regards implementation, more courage as regards long-term reforms, a more serious approach and less excuses, also states that we need a greater willingness for reform combined with more honesty towards the public.
Germanyâs present contention that the costs of reunification have so far been left out of the equation is an example of how insincere the debate has become, because Germany has complied with the stability and growth criteria since the beginning of this decade; it has gone along with the Stability and Growth Pact and has had no problems with it for 10 years.
I urge you to support the report before you if you wish to see greater stability, growth and employment, and if you wish to see compliance with European law and with the Treaty.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin, on behalf of the Commission and on my own behalf, by congratulating the two rapporteurs for the two reports subject to debate, Mr Goebbels and Mr Karas, and all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed to producing the text we are discussing here today in plenary.
I must tell you that I largely agree with the analysis appearing in each report.
In the case of the Lisbon strategy, five years after its approval by the European Council, we can all agree on the need to reaffirm the objectives and the pillars of the strategy, to ratify our support for them, and to express our regret that the implementation of the policies necessary to move towards achieving those objectives has been delayed.
In the case of the situation of public finances and the existing framework for monitoring the evolution of budgets and public accounts â the Stability and Growth Pact â we agree with the reference values, with the pillars established in the Treaty.
Generally speaking, the evolution of public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union since the pact came into force has moved in the right direction, but, as Mr Karas said, there are too many countries, ten at the moment, in a situation of excessive deficit; some Member States of the Union have levels of public debt compared to their gross domestic product above the 60% reference value laid down in the Treaty, and we therefore need to reflect and seek improvements in the application of the pact, and we need to strengthen the instruments we rely on to make this framework for fiscal governance a success.
With regard to the first of the reports, I would like to explain the Commissionâs point of view to you.
It is clear that the European Union, and the eurozone in particular, has a lower rate of growth than our competitors, than the other economic regions of the industrialised world, not to mention the emerging countries which have rates of growth of 6, 7 or even 10%.
That low growth creates a situation of high unemployment and lack of jobs and seriously calls into question the sustainability of our social model and the sustainability of our model of society in general.
Structural reforms are therefore necessary and, from that point of view, as the honourable Members know, in its Communication of 2 February the Commission proposed certain guidelines for moving towards a review and improvement of the application of the Lisbon strategy, establishing a series of priorities based around three key elements: firstly, making Europe a more attractive place for investment and work, extending and developing the internal market, improving regulations, guaranteeing open and competitive markets, extending and improving European infrastructure networks; secondly, improving knowledge and innovation as fundamental factors for growth, increasing and improving research and development, promoting innovation and the adoption of information technologies, and contributing to the creation of a solid European industrial base; thirdly, pursuing the objective of creating more and better jobs, establishing policies capable of attracting more people to the labour market, modernising social protection systems, increasing the adaptability of workers and companies and investing more in human capital.
On the basis of these elements, we can restore the impetus that the creators, the founders, of the Lisbon strategy â if I may use that expression â had in mind five years ago, and make up for the time lost; at the same time, we will have to act with greater âownershipâ at national level, because there is no question that many of the actions necessary to make the Lisbon strategy a success basically fall within national competence.
In the Commissionâs view, the role of macroeconomic policy in this regard is to sustain growth.
But increasing growth potential is a basic function of structural reforms.
We cannot rely on macroeconomic policy to achieve it.
That task must be entrusted to the structural reforms such as those appearing in the list that the European Commission has presented.
With regard to the second report â the Stability and Growth Pact, the situation of public finances â which Mr Karas has just presented, I must point out that the negotiations within Ecofin are making very satisfactory progress: further progress was made at last week's meeting.
There will be more meetings, of the Eurogroup on 7 March, and of Ecofin on 8 March, which are going to be very useful in terms of reaching an agreement.
I am optimistic about the possibility of reaching an agreement at the European Council of 22 and 23 March which maintains the principles and reference values of the Treaty, as well as the pillars of fiscal and budgetary discipline laid down in the Treaty, which we must all respect.
That agreement should improve the instruments so that the governance of the Stability and Growth Pact can prevent the failings we have experienced over recent years, contribute to helping the countries with excessive deficit problems to move towards adjustment, to comply with the reference values of the Treaty, both in terms of deficit and debt, to place more emphasis on sustainability and on the long term, because we are going to have to face the challenge of the ageing of the population and, at the same time, to create a better link between the budgetary discipline that continues to be a necessary element for growth and the growth strategy, more employment, sustainability â in other words the Lisbon Strategy â because the two strategies are linked to each other.
Macroeconomic balance is a condition necessary to growth, but more policies are needed: structural reforms are needed.
It will be very positive for the two important issues being debated in Parliament today and being debated in the Commission and in the Council to come together at the March European Council, so that we can reach a forward-looking agreement, improving the relationship between the two strategies and, of course, keeping a clear view of the principles of each of them.
One of them being more sustainability, more social cohesion, more growth, more employment and more competitiveness; the other, better budgetary discipline and greater sustainability of public finances as a necessary basis for economic stability and in order to create the conditions that all investors, all wealth creators, need in order to look to the future with more confidence.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to say that the deficits in the public finances in a number of different countries are symptomatic of the problems in the national economies.
We shall not solve that problem by permitting increased deficits.
We should then, in actual fact, be in danger of undermining the stable condition for growth constituted by low interest rates.
We would risk reducing the boost given to households by low interest rates, and we should weaken that basic condition for long-term growth also formed by low interest rates.
It is therefore important to emphasise the importance of structural reforms, as the Commissioner also did in his speech.
It is European economies that need flexibility, not our common rules.
It is with common basic conditions for companies under construction that we can create new prosperity and new jobs.
It is unfortunate that the Socialist Group in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs chose to abstain when we voted on MrÂ Goebbelsâ report.
The report now contains a number of practical proposals for creating higher potential for growth in Europe.
We believe that improved basic conditions for work should exist, but not by the means mentioned just now by MrÂ Goebbels, namely through increasing peopleâs working time.
We wish to bring about improved basic conditions for enabling more people to be in work and for enabling people to work for longer periods of their lives, as well as, if they so wish, for longer hours at different stages of their lives.
This requires changes in terms of enterprise, research and the internal market.
Right now, we are in a period of change that is significant because of the competition we see.
Now, the important task is to ensure that we make the European economy still stronger through increased competition.
We are concerned here with the Directive on Services and with making competition keener within a number of areas.
That is our task, the goals being higher growth, more jobs and the best wages in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
I think that Mr Karas was right in saying that in this debate, this Parliament is involved in a kind of battle about the direction we should take and in a debate about how to address macro-economic policy in the European Union.
I often have the strong impression that in this debate, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as sections of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are busy fighting the previous battle and are still, while being wedged in old discussions, working out reforms about the Stability and Growth Pact and fail to face todayâs challenges head-on.
Moreover, I often have the impression that we are engaged in national politics and that this House pursues national discussions rather than focusing on the European dimension.
My group prefers the approach for which the Commission has opted with regard to reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and also the approach that the Luxembourg Presidency has adopted in this regard.
I would refer to the decisions taken by the ECOFIN Council on 13 September, which clearly favour reform of the Stability and Growth Pact within the context of wider discussions and also in relation to the Lisbon strategy and the global guidelines for economic policy.
Reform of the Stability Pact should address the preventive aspects, the differences in economic developments in the Member States and the corrective aspects, while also promoting an improvement in the excessive deficit procedure.
What is of key importance in this, though, and that is something which our group would like to emphasise and which President Bush echoed recently in the context of foreign policy, is that we should pursue true macro-economic policy in Europe and, in this respect, treat Europe as an economic unit, a single entity.
I think that that should very much be part of macro-economic policy, that we do not in the first instance compete as Member States against each other, and create distinct profiles for ourselves which also need defending in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, but that we opt for this European perspective and adopt economic policies in line with that.
That is why close examination of the Lisbon strategy and also of its link with the reform of the Stability and the Growth Pact is necessary; that is also why my group is still keen to underline in that discussion that we should focus on investments and also on how we, within the parameters prescribed in that Stability and Growth Pact, should draw a distinction between current expenses and expenses that are really intended for investment in that knowledge economy that we seek as part of that Lisbon strategy.
We do not want to do this in a way that Member States can decide how to do their accounts creatively, but by making choices that are clearly intended for Europe and by setting out a strategy at European level so that it is possible, for example, to depreciate investments made in the long term, as is customary in industry.
We do hope that some of these points will be addressed in those reports and that this discussion will be followed up in the March plenary, when we will be reviewing the Lisbon strategy and preparing for the spring summit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a majority of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed on a largely balanced report, even if MrÂ Goebbels is distancing himself from that report today.
I think it is important for us to ask the Commission to take the following four points on board.
Firstly, there has been a considerable delay in implementing the Lisbon strategy.
One of the reasons for this is that the strategy includes a large number of objectives.
In November, the Kok group recommended concentrating on a limited number of priorities.
That is a sensible strategy and one we support.
We would encourage the Commission to concentrate its efforts on the priorities proposed by the Kok group, and the statements made by the Commission in this context give us grounds for optimism.
We are also calling on the Commission to analyse best practice in the Member States and to learn from it.
This best practice approach will make it possible, on the basis of successful examples in one Member State, to make recommendations to other Member States.
Secondly, the Commission should concentrate even more on the completion of the internal market, in order clearly to demonstrate to consumers the concrete benefits of the European single market, in the form of better and cheaper products and services.
There are still barriers to trade in some areas.
This is indefensible both in terms of a properly functioning internal market and of fair competition.
The public needs to see clear progress on this.
Thirdly, we are not against reforming the Stability and Growth Pact, contrary to what MrÂ Goebbels has suggested, but we are opposed to watering down the pact, which guarantees not only the independence of the ECB but also the stability of the euro.
We support the Commissionâs wish to strengthen the preventive side of the pact, but that does not mean, as MrÂ Goebbels is perhaps suggesting, that it should be permissible to have a deficit of less than 3% when things are going well but to run up a deficit of over 3% in bad times.
When the going is good, reserves should be built up so that the deficit criteria can also be complied with or only marginally exceeded in economically difficult times, so that the overall cumulative level of debt can be gradually reduced.
I now come to my fourth and final point.
The members of the ALDE Group on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tabled an amendment on the necessary structural reforms in the Member States.
Although that amendment was accepted, as the result of an error â on whose part I do not know â it was not incorporated into the final version.
We would therefore like to table this amendment once again here in the plenary, as an oral amendment.
The text of this amendment is as follows: the European Parliament recommends that the Member States should implement the long overdue structural reforms required to achieve the improvement in the investment climate that is a prerequisite for economic growth.
What matters here is that we highlight the enormous importance of structural reforms for economic growth, and make it clear that responsibility for this lies with the Member States.
It is high time that the EU overcame the problem of the continuing excessive commitment of resources to preserving outdated structures.
Furthermore, the Member States should take targeted measures to bring the black economy under control, as it is an obstacle to healthy growth and stability.
Only in that way can we make rapid progress towards achieving the Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, a well-respected French economist has recently published a book entitled ââ (The politics of powerlessness), and I believe that this is a feeling that many of our fellow citizens can justifiably empathise with.
I would add, however, that the politics of powerlessness is in fact a deliberate strategy chosen since Maastricht, since 1992, which is broadly based on three axes: the structural reform of the markets âÂ as we call it in our jargonÂ â the reduction of public deficit and the focus on conquering external markets.
Furthermore, as regards the institutions and the allocation of powers, the EU has exclusive competence in the area of competition law and monetary union; otherwise, the Member States must cope and must compete with one another.
I feel that 15 years on âÂ unfortunately, in my viewÂ â this institutional choice has been given succour by the Constitutional Treaty, a document that I endorse, even though it contains numerous gaps.
15 years on, we have seen the results of this â or rather, a lack of results â in terms of growth, particularly the quality of growth, and in terms of job creation.
Accordingly, Commissioner, our message as the ecologistsâ group is that there really must be a change of strategy.
We have the impression that discussions on the Stability and Growth Pact are conducted on the margins and that if we truly want to achieve the best results, we must pursue a more proactive policy at euro zone level, one in which ministers ultimately share a support framework based on more ambitious objectives and in which efforts are channelled into achieving convergence between the different national economies.
As I do not have much time, I shall mention three of these objectives.
The first objective, in my view, is to implement massive reductions in taxation on labour and to seek alternative ways of funding social security systems, taking account of the diverse nature of each country.
I feel that it is very important, however, to be able to say to the citizens that people who work â people who have the opportunity to work â must be able to make a decent living from their work.
I believe that this can be achieved by means of massive reductions in taxation on labour.
The second objective â you will not be surprised to learn â is that we need high-quality growth, which means saving more energy and polluting much less.
Please look at the Commissionâs documents on the assessment of the Communityâs sustainable development strategy: the results are abysmal, hence the urgent need for a sea change in this regard.
Thirdly and lastly, we must support internal demand in the Union.
There is no need to focus entirely on conquering external markets, as though the economy were made up solely of innovative large companies or small or medium-sized enterprises taking on the Chinese and Indian markets.
Internal demand must be supported, which entails public and private investment and involves sending a clear message to the public authorities, both at EU and Member State level, that we are proud to be European and that we have established monetary union along with an internal market.
What we now need is a genuine economic and social union that offers every citizen a future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, where European economic policy is concerned, we could of course continue on the same course.
We could continue, on the pretext of allegedly necessary structural reforms, to tear Europeâs social structures apart, to force the unions to their knees with threats of high unemployment and ever more low-grade jobs, exposing more and more public services to market forces and thus limiting the services that are offered to those that the private sector can make a profit from.
And we could also create a situation, thanks to a further round of tax dumping, whereby an employee on average earnings will soon be contributing more to the public purse than many a European company with profits running into billions.
Although we could, of course, continue along this path and be guaranteed plaudits from those who gain from a policy of this kind, we should not try to fool the people of Europe into believing that this policy will promote growth and employment.
Who could seriously believe that the extended working hours for which the report calls will create additional jobs instead of destroying yet more?
Who could seriously believe that further cuts in public investment will boost internal demand as opposed to sending more small and medium-sized enterprises to the wall?
Who could seriously believe, on the basis of our experience to date of privatisation, that it increases employment rather than cutting it?
It is true to say that the economic performance of most countries in Europe is unimpressive, but it is a lie to suggest that the cause for this is a lack of competitiveness.
Labour costs have fallen in many European countries in recent years; this trend has been particularly marked in Germany, where employees have had to accept an average cut in real wages of over 2% in the course of the last 12 months.
Has this meant that a particularly large number of jobs has been created in Germany?
Quite the opposite!
The unemployment rate has hit a new record high.
The same, though, is true for exports, and not just in Germany.
I say that because the only thing that the political priorities set out in the report before us can achieve is a further increase in the investment returns of European global players and export companies.
That might please the European Round Table of Industrialists, but for most people it is a disaster.
My group will never agree to a policy of this kind, but we will do everything we can to encourage opposition to it.
Â Â  , .
Mr President, Mr Goebbels' report is a frank admission of much that is wrong with the European Union.
He has recognised that high economic growth is necessary to achieve low unemployment, to pay pensions and to achieve what is here called 'social cohesion' or 'social protection'.
So why is growth so poor?
Several speakers have blamed the Stability and Growth Pact.
Some say it is being interpreted too strictly and that governments are not spending enough. Others say the opposite, that we must stick to the Pact more tightly.
They cannot both be right.
I suggest that both sides are missing the point.
