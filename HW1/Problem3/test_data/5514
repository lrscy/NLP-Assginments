We do not, however, have any representation in Saudi Arabia, nor do we have any representation in the Gulf.
Nor do we have any competence to take any particular steps or to make a stand on an individual level in these particular cases.
However, we participate in the European Union dÃ©marches which are agreed upon regarding human rights issues in the framework of the CFSP.
So the honourable Member is right to raise the issue.
It is an issue - I repeat again - in the framework of the political dialogue that we have with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and we will continue to do so.
Question No 42 by (H-0277/01):
Subject: Deployment of Russian nuclear weapons at Kaliningrad According to several reports in reputable Nordic media, such as Swedish Radio's news programme Ekot and the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten, the Russian military is planning, or has already carried out, a major deployment of nuclear weapons in the Kaliningrad region.
Such action by the Russians would seriously affect military dÃ©tente in the entire Baltic region since it would mean a considerable change in the military threat both to several EU Member States and to a number of applicant countries.
Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov has given Commissioner Patten his complete assurance that no deployment of Russian nuclear weapons has taken place or is planned.
In what way is the Commission monitoring developments in this matter, which is of such importance for the whole of the Baltic region, and what information has the European Union been given recently from the responsible political representatives in Russia such as the President, the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister?
The Commission shares the view that if nuclear weapons were deployed in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad this would have very serious repercussions for cooperation in the Baltic Sea area, particularly for our northern dimension policies.
It would also run against Russia's stated policy in the region.
During the visit which we made in February to Moscow and Kaliningrad - I went there with the Presidency, with Foreign Minister Anna Lindh - the issue was raised.
The Russian side firmly denied the allegations which had been published in the media.
The Russian side gave assurances that there were no plans regarding the deployment of nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad.
I have seen the press and broadcast reports to which the honourable Member draws attention.
That is why we raised the issue with the Russian side, but I repeat the assurances which they have given us.
I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for that clear answer.
I have had the privilege - in another, more informal Nordic context - of addressing this serious problem with the Commissioner.
It is my understanding that the Commission has had assurances at the highest Russian level that no deployment has taken place.
In spite of that, I should like to ask two follow-up questions: how has this information come to be accorded so much credibility by the media; and was this a subject that was discussed at all with President Putin at the European Council in Stockholm?
Mr Putin said quite a lot at the European Summit in Stockholm, including giving the Macedonian leadership the advice to follow what he had done in Chechnya, which, I am bound to say, I did not think was a very wise piece of advice to give them.
It seems to me that the last thing anyone should do is to try to reduce Tetovo to the state of Grozny.
I did not agree with those remarks of President Putin.
The Commission does not, of course, have the means to monitor Russia's compliance with the assurances that we have had, but we would expect Member States to raise any information indicating the contrary in the appropriate European Union fora.
We will be having, in the margins of the General Affairs Council at the beginning of next week, a discussion on the northern dimension on the basis of the proposals which have been put forward by the Commission.
That discussion will involve not only the Member States of the European Union, but also countries affected by our northern dimension policies and aspirations including, of course, the Russian Federation.
And I hope that the Russian Federation will make it clear once again that these press reports and media reports are untrue.
One central part of our northern dimension policies is our attempt to suggest ways in which we can both help Kaliningrad to deal with the consequences of enlargement - that is, of being surrounded by Poland and Lithuania as Members of the European Union; and we have suggested as well, which is slightly different, ways in which Kaliningrad can be helped to deal with problems which have nothing to do with enlargement, but which have an impact on the whole area.
We are keen to play our part in helping Kaliningrad, and it would not be remotely helpful if these media reports turned out even to be a percentage true.
We thank Mr Patten for his cooperation and we wish him success in the Balkans.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 43 to 74 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
People with disabilities
The next item is the report (A5Â­0084/2001) by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Towards a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities [COM(2000) 284 - C5Â­0632/2000 - 2000/2296(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our guests from the organisations who are taking their seats in the public gallery, forgive me if I am speaking somewhat slowly, but today is the first time that our debate will be interpreted using sign language, and I would like to inform the Commission that I have also had this report translated into Braille, and this is the first time that a parliamentary assembly has done this.
The report will be sent by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to all the organisations in all our countries.
It is a joy and a source of satisfaction to me to present this evening to the European Parliament the report written in response to the Commission' s communication. It also gives me grounds for hope.
It is a joy because I am aware that this report has perhaps more influence than others, or at least in a more direct manner, in bringing about the Europe that I have been hoping and praying for, a humane Europe in which we are all involved and which we all hope to achieve, since we are well aware that, having achieved the single market and monetary union, the 21st century will have to try to bring about a humane European Union.
Drafting this report has only served to strengthen my belief that we can only make the future of Europe attractive if we start working on a basis of solidarity, justice and respect for others.
This occasion also provides me with a source of satisfaction because, although my name is on the report, it is above all the product of a new working method in which many useful contacts were fostered with the organisations for people with disabilities, which helped me to write it, particularly the European Forum for Disabled People, and I would like to acknowledge here their extremely valuable contribution to this matter.
I also derive satisfaction from the high level of interest shown by my fellow Members, since they tabled over 100 amendments to the original draft.
In this respect, I would like to say that out of the amendments that were recently tabled, I shall accept two amendments from the Socialist group.
I would also like to thank the Commission' s Directorate-General for Education and Culture for taking part and the European Agency for Special Needs Education, which is based in Copenhagen.
Lastly, the report fills me with hope because, if it is adopted by the European Parliament, it will enable many doors to be opened to the 37 million citizens who live with a disability.
This report will be considered from four perspectives: firstly, 'mainstreaming' and the right to be different, secondly, 'family and disability' , because it is true that a disabled person, whether an infant or an old person, is nonetheless someone' s child or parent and it is within this family environment that the most support can be found.
The third perspective is to overcome obstacles and access problems.
The fourth perspective is that of consultation and information.
On the basis of these perspectives, we put together a number of proposals.
The first is, of course, to start working on the year 2003, which is to be named the European Year of the Disabled Citizens, as announced at Nice.
Secondly, we believe that it is important that a number of measures be taken in terms of access to benefits. If Italian, French, Belgian or Greek workers leave their own country to work elsewhere, they should continue to receive the benefits to which they are entitled as a disabled person.
This also involves mutual recognition of cards carried by people with disabilities throughout the Union.
The issue of access should also be extended to education.
We all know that disabled people are not fully or properly integrated into school life.
That is why I can announce now that on 26 November 2001, the first European meeting dedicated to teaching and disabilities will be held at the Senate in Paris, in conjunction with the European Academy of Medicine.
The issue of access also includes transport and public buildings.
We heard a speech made by Brian Crowley at the inauguration of this building.
In this respect, we can announce a forthcoming directive, for example with regard to lifts.
I hope that, in this directive, mandatory standards can be specified for disabled people.
That is what I wanted to tell you very briefly, by pointing out that the report that is presented to you today is both a culmination and a point of departure.
At a time when we often speak about 'lobbying' , I hope that, in view of the year 2003, along with all the organisations, we can use our influence on all the Commission and Council bodies to translate these recommendations - or at least some of them - into directives, so that a European disability policy can be developed in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Hermange on her work on achieving a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities.
I believe it is necessary to complete the strategy for integrating the rights of people with disabilities into Community policies, particularly the transport sector, access to buildings, the information society and consumer policy.
However, I am convinced that the issue of practically integrating people with disabilities will depend not only on traditional obstacles, such as the physical barriers enclosing public areas and transport, being overcome, but, above all, on the general public taking a new approach to the everyday situation of people with disabilities.
It is clear that, in these cases, psychological factors and people's prejudices may be much greater obstacles than those created by physical barriers.
Another important point to stress, which also featured in the Stockholm Presidency Conclusions, is that of the integration of people with disabilities into the world of work.
We must work towards a situation where companies employ more than the obligatory number of people with disabilities, making things easier for companies by consistently reducing or abolishing both the contribution and tax burdens.
This would have the positive effect of using this social potential, which is currently only partially exploited, and would benefit the entire economy.
Currently, 37 million European citizens suffer from some form of disability and the unemployment rate for this category is over three times higher than average.
Moreover, let us not forget that the quest to achieve full employment in the Union does not mean concentrating solely on job creation but involves providing better jobs for all people, including those with disabilities.
Lastly, I consider it essential for research in Europe to play a fundamental role, through its centres, in the development of technologies intended to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.
In this way, we would be able to close the gap between Europe and the United States of America.
Finally, may I emphasise the role that the Member States must play in improving the skills and promoting the specific professional training of people who cooperate within voluntary associations and the social cooperatives, in order to provide adequate professional training which is suited to the different forms of disabilities.
Mr President, last Saturday I took part in a rally called "Rights Now" by disabled people in Trafalgar Square in London, where disabled speakers told us how hospital consultants denied them medical treatment because their quality of life was not equal to that of able-bodied patients.
The new charging policies for social care services effectively stop them from benefiting from those essential services.
Whereas sexism and racism are well-known terms, disability discrimination is barely referred to in public discourse.
I start my speech with this bleak assessment because in our proper desire to support the Commission in their barrier-free Europe communication, and Mrs Hermange, in her excellent response, we risk forgetting the very real exclusion from every aspect of public life which is the daily reality for disabled people in our societies.
In the strong consensus we have achieved in supporting the bulk of the proposals let us remember we will encounter real conflict in delivering on the aims agreed.
We welcome the European Commission's proposal to make 2003 the year of disabled citizens but its impact will be diminished if the Commission does not, during that same year, publish a general disability discrimination directive which offers comprehensive civil rights to disabled people in Europe, similar to the American Disabilities Act, on the other side of the Atlantic.
We are pleased that the Socrates Programme offers additional support for disabled participants, but point out that there is a long way to go before the extra costs of disability, the provision of specialist transport, personal assistance and sign language interpreters are provided for in all mainstream European programmes to make equal participation a reality.
I welcome the sign language interpretation taking place in both the Chamber and the public gallery. I only wish we could see it regularly in the European Parliament.
We emphasise that the specialist and mainstream provision can go hand-in-hand and can complement each other, that the loss of the tied aspects of the research and development programme were not fully replaced with mainstreaming and that a specialist disability section should be allocated in the sixth framework programme now being discussed.
We point out that fine words about free movement can never be fully realised until difficult issues for Member States, including the protection for social security benefits for disabled workers crossing our borders, can be tackled.
We watch carefully when talk about interdepartmental cooperation in the Commission, on public procurement for example, shows steadfast opposition by DG internal market against awarding public contracts with full reference to companies' equal employment record.
We ask the Commissioner for Employment to identify a clear timetable for binding disability access standards to the built environment to be established, and, equally, to ensure seamless access by disabled persons to all modes of public transport.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on an excellent report.
I would also like to congratulate her for making it available in braille and through sign language interpreters.
This is such a good report because of the cross-party cooperation, similar to the cross-party cooperation there was on the article concerning anti-discrimination, and because of the input from the disabled people's organisations themselves.
We had 97 amendments in committee, and we have only five for this plenary session.
That demonstrates how we have all worked together and particularly that Mrs Hermange has listened to the points that have been put to her and incorporated them into this report.
I hope also that this report will act as a springboard for the year 2003, the Year of Disabled Citizens, but hopefully we can bring forward the disability directive that Mr Howitt has just referred to within that year, so as to actually make a commitment to a positive disability directive.
This report is about breaking down barriers for disabled people, to get rid of the prejudices that disabled people face in their daily lives across the European Union.
That is what we are aiming to achieve.
It is disgraceful that we need this report, that disabled people are not treated like other people.
We must make sure that disabled people are mainstreamed, that they are not sidelined, that they are taken into account in all sectors - in the information society, in public procurement, in employment.
As Mr Mantovani said, the level of unemployment is three times higher for disabled people.
Let us hope that this report, together with the employment directive, will address that issue.
We must look at all the issues.
I would like to conclude by saying again to Mrs Hermange that she has produced an excellent report but one that we must make sure that we put into practice.
Fine words are one thing, making sure that in practice disabled people are treated exactly the same as everyone else is another.
Mr President, if I had an hour instead of a minute I could maybe touch on some of the key points, however, in the European Parliament we have to work within these limits.
At the outset I want to congratulate and thank Madam Hermange for her advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities and in particular for her willingness to take on board new ideas with regard to creating a barrier-free Europe.
Any charter of rights, any constitution will tell you, that all people are borne equal, yet every single day disabled people in the European Union are treated as unequal.
In fact, in many scenarios they are treated as inferior beings to the rest of society.
I can bring hundreds of examples of discrimination, of ignorance, thousands of examples of prejudice.
When we speak about a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities, our main focus is always on legislation, on new innovation with regard to buildings or access to transport.
These are all key and important elements, but the first thing that we have to overcome, the first barrier that has to be jumped is a psychological barrier and the prejudices within each and every one of us.
When we see someone with a disability, instead of focusing on the disability, let us treat everyone as equal, focus on their ability and give them the tools of information, of training, of education and of opportunity to really show how much ability they actually have.
I commend this report to the House and would ask that it should not just be an expression of good intentions or the conscience of the Members of this House or of the Commission, but lead to real action before 2003, so that then when we celebrate the European Year for the Disabled Citizen, we can actually say that we have made progress and moved beyond some of the barriers.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hermange on the quality of her report and also on her generosity in accepting the amendments presented in committee, which will have contributed to enriching the report but, above all, in taking on board the differing sensitivities in dealing with measures for combating a possible situation of inequality: the inequality resulting from disability.
Although we might not realise it, we are not nevertheless mistaken in stating that the number of people suffering some form of disability in the European Union stands at around 10% of the population, which currently means some 37 million people, and that disability is not a homogenous category.
We could say that there is no such thing as disability, but rather there are disabled people and therefore, whether the disabilities are visible or invisible, slight or serious, single or multiple, chronic or intermittent, whether they affect mobility, hearing, sight or speech, all of these people - and I repeat, people - have to face difficult barriers when it comes to accessing the various aspects or areas of their social lives despite these limitations.
I would like specifically to refer to the area of employment in relation to this policy which is intended to create a barrier-free Europe and furthermore a Europe with a high level of employment.
And therefore, to name but a few factors, we should refer to the adaptation of the procedures for examinations and tests of the abilities of disabled candidates; access to specific training activities for general employees and, perhaps, for public officials in particular, with reduced abilities; to measures for the retention of staff who have suffered some incapacity during, or in the execution of, their work; to the reorganisation of work and flexible hours, part-time work, etc.
It seems to me to be extremely important that 2003 be declared European Year of Disabled Citizens.
It seems equally important - maybe more - that each day we reinforce the idea that each and every disabled person is one more citizen, one more European of the almost 400 million Europeans who are protected by Article 13 of the EC Treaty and who expect specific actions, the coordination of policies within the European Union and who expect to see an increase in people' s awareness and sensitivity, since it may be that the main barrier they face is a lack of awareness.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a good report and for the sensitivity she has shown in accepting arguments from the various political groups and in listening to the organisations and the movement representing people with disabilities.
She has been exemplary in the way she has attended to her task as rapporteur.
People with disabilities are discriminated against today.
Freedom of movement, which is basic to EU cooperation, is significantly more difficult for people with disabilities to make use of when it comes to seeking work or, in the case of young people, studying in other countries.
There is clear discrimination in this area. The same applies to the labour market.
Unemployment among people with disabilities is very high.
They also find it more difficult to achieve the kind of access to information we often discuss nowadays.
We must adopt a pro-active attitude, for all this can be prevented.
Disability is not a static phenomenon.
It is the environment which is at fault, and this can be changed.
Nowadays, we have interpretation using sign language, for example.
We can design buildings and workplaces differently, making them more accessible to people with disabilities.
This is something which is possible to implement, because it is about changes to the environment.
We can implement changes.
The change must affect all areas of policy, moreover.
Not only can social, transport or labour market policies be changed, but all policy areas.
In the labour market, where unemployment is approximately three times higher for people with disabilities, it is important that, in addition to devising indicators for improving older people' s, women' s and other groups' chances of obtaining work, we should also include people with disabilities.
Many people have pointed out how important a change in social attitudes is to integration.
I myself come from the world of education.
It is important for people with disabilities not to be hidden away but to be included in the world of education so that everyone can obtain education and training on the same terms and so that we see how people with different qualities are able to work together.
That is incredibly important if attitudes are to be changed.
Finally, it is important for voluntary organisations and organisations representing people with disabilities to be integrated into this work.
Let the Year of Disabled Citizens be a point of departure for an offensive in which we devise new directives and a new action programme, so that we can obtain a Europe without obstacles and with equal opportunities for all.
Mr President, the report by our fellow Member, Marie-ThÃ©rÃšse Hermange, gives some very positive support to the awareness campaign proposed by the Commission for the year 2003, which has been declared the European Year of Disabled Citizens.
We need to change our way of thinking, but I believe that it is crucial to propose a series of measures, as Mrs Hermange has, in favour of a genuine policy of non-discrimination.
To be recognised as being different, but having the right to be fairly treated is the philosophy that runs through all the proposals, particularly those relating to easy access to the work place and to public spaces, the exportability of disability benefits for workers and dependent persons within the EU or the mutual recognition of national cards carried by people with disabilities.
The report also stresses the need for a sense of responsibility with regard to equal treatment in the labour market, vocational training and education.
Professional integration is therefore associated with social integration.
In this respect, the report shows that the value of the work performed by a person with a disability cannot be measured solely in terms of competitiveness.
I believe that these are ambitious guidelines that give a true reflection of the overall thinking of the parliamentary committee concerned and the determination of the organisations representing people with disabilities.
I would add that the proposal to monitor and evaluate the measures adopted seems to be a very positive step, as does the transition from a simple intergovernmental policy to a Community policy in this area.
I can only see two shortcomings.
On the one hand, the report adopts, in my view, an extremely hesitant attitude towards businesses with regard to the employment of people with disabilities, and the proposal regarding the income of people with disabilities who are in employment is much too weak - and I quote 'an income at least equal to the level of benefits received by people who are not in employment' .
On the other hand, the ambiguous nature of the part of paragraph 20 which relates to research into therapies at the beginning of life must, in my opinion, be withdrawn, which justifies the amendment tabled by my group.
Incidentally, this report was much needed and I believe, as do my colleagues, that it is also extremely good.
Mr President, after listening to the Members who have spoken before me and with whom I totally agree, I have had to change my views and alter the content of the speech I had prepared to give during this debate.
Mr President, have you seen how we all agree on this issue?
There is no dissent: we all want society to recognise that people with disabilities should receive what it is right for them to have.
However, people have been saying these sorts of things for 35 years, and still nothing tangible has been done.
In your opinion, who is responsible for this, Commissioner Diamantopoulou?
The answer is clear, for the bench normally occupied by the culprits is empty: it is the Council's bench.
It is the governments which do not want to give people with disabilities what it is right to give them.
And it is the Council of Ministers of the European Union that has the power to do something: its absence tonight is proof of that.
And that means the Swedish Presidency, which we all consider to be one of the most enlightened.
Well then, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I am sending you a message saying that I am sure you are the best ambassador and determined supporter of the rights of people with disabilities: it is the governments and the Council of Ministers of the European Union who have to do what we all agree has to be done.
If nothing has been done thus far, it is because the governments of our 15 States are blind, deaf and dumb.
They are the true disabled in this European society.
Mr President, this communication reflects the European Commission' s intention to maintain and further promote the policy for a European Union without barriers.
All that remains to be seen, between now and 2003, is just how serious the intentions behind this policy are.
This sort of policy can only be implemented through a specific programme of actions, target evaluations, statistics and specific, self-imposed deadlines.
Mrs Hermange' s report is, without exaggeration, a particularly important paper because it captures all aspects of the problem with perfect clarity and proposes a universal policy at all levels and in the broadest possible sense, by setting specific targets.
We need to recognise the importance of this basic position on people with disabilities, irrespective of their individual disability, and of their needs as a whole as citizens, producers and consumers.
We agree that the initiatives taken under this new approach are not tantamount to concessions or generosity or evaluated merely as costs, but form part of our productive system, which they further, and of our social model, which they strengthen.
This new concept should also inform corresponding policies in the Member States.
The point is whether or not the Member States are mature enough to look at it from this angle.
It is no easy task.
If it is to succeed, we must alter entrenched, opposing perceptions and mobilise the public sectors responsible, in order to prove that policies in education, culture, sport, employment and other sectors cannot succeed unless they incorporate the problems of persons with disabilities.
So the message is that we are moving from an awareness to practicalities and that the aim is to ensure that these people play a full part in economic and social life.
In the final analysis, with increasing numbers of disabilities as the result of road traffic accidents and accidents at work, we are all potentially members of this group of people and this issue does not only concern a number of unlucky, preordained people; it concerns all of us.
Mr President, the report quite rightly speaks out against discrimination, of which 37 million disabled people in the European Union are victims.
However, to create a barrier-free Europe for disabled people, to enable them to lead a life and have a career as everyone else does not just require good intentions; it also requires resources.
Yet, if we take just these examples, although the efforts made to provide education are scandalously inadequate, although the most basic facilities are lacking in public places and transport, it really is because Member States, instead of providing the money needed to this basic form of solidarity, spend it on financial support and subsidies to employers.
And how can we not condemn the derisory amount that those who are unable to work receive in benefits?
How can we tolerate a situation in which insurance companies refuse to insure disabled people or overcharge them, which is a form of discrimination.
It is a pious hope to merely ask the Commission to propose that Member States urge companies to employ disabled workers.
Even in the Member States which have financial penalties for employers who disregard the quotas for employing disabled people, the employers prefer to pay the fine and not employ them.
When it comes to commercial contracts, however, legislators know how to impose tough rules.
Well, equally harsh mandatory measures must be taken against employers who refuse to employ disabled people or who do not adapt the workplace as necessary.
Mr President, I should like to offer my special congratulations to Mrs Hermange on her very comprehensive report. I note that, like many of her fellow members, she has identified two basic aspects to the problem.
The first is preconception and relates to cultural and political change and the second is the need for equal opportunities and equal access to all types of activity.
This second objective of equal access means specific policies for 12% of Europe' s citizens.
To give you a clear idea of the numbers involved, 37 million people with disabilities equate to about 9 countries the size of Denmark.
And the Commission communication, like Mrs Hermange' s report, emphasizes the need for a horizontal approach to the issue of disability, i.e. the need to approach all policies and to take account of this aspect in all types of decision, which is why the communication also specifically refers to the need for access to buildings, the architectural dimension, employment, transport, research, technology, education and health.
I should like to point out that we have had three interesting examples of this in the short interval between the Commission communication and the report.
First, the endeavour concerning the rights of airline passengers.
This consultation at European level, which is now ready for signing, involved the airlines and the Commission, as well as groups of people with disabilities, the aim being to agree on specific, binding undertakings to safeguard the rights of all passengers and people with disabilities.
The second interesting example is the e-EUROPE initiative, which incorporates five different specific lines of approach defining the needs of people with disabilities as regards access to all the new technologies and IT systems.
Finally, the third example is the programme for research and technology announced recently, which again includes both specific commitments to special technologies for aids and appliances to assist people with disabilities and social research and studies.
Honourable members, as you have rightly pointed out, we need specific action and, of course, we need to take account of the fact that, at European level, there is the potential to add value to the policies of the Member States, given that this sector still comes almost entirely within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
Nonetheless, I think that there are several specific issues worth mentioning here, such as legislation.
Thanks to the catalytic role of the European Parliament, we recently managed to adopt the directive banning discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace in record time.
This directive represents a truly historic decision by the institutions of the European Union and the challenge now is to ensure that it is applied correctly.
In addition, all the action programmes currently being developed and announced by the Commission contain specific reference to and a commitment towards people with disabilities; this applies to the EQUAL initiative, the programmes against discrimination and exclusion and the fifth women' s programme.
I also think employment policy and strategy are worth mentioning.
Last year, at Parliament' s suggestion, the Commission agreed that our objective should be to include persons with disabilities in training and the employment strategy, an objective which was not, however, accepted by the Council of Ministers.
We shall come back to this again this year, in a bid to set specific quantitative targets at European and national level for the participation of people with disabilities in the employment strategy programme, be it in the form of training, lifelong learning, access to new technologies or subsidised jobs. This will be one of our priorities over coming years.
I should also mention that the Commission is preparing a communication on companies' social responsibilities. This communication will take particular account - and we are already working on this with special networks of companies - of the fact that each company is personally and specifically responsible for applying social policies and policies to integrate people with disabilities.
I recently visited the companies which received Commission awards last year for incorporating people with disabilities in their workforce and it was a most pleasant surprise to see practical examples of small and medium-sized companies increasing their profits by making use of the exceptionally well-honed talents of people with disabilities.
I should also like to mention the specific problem of transferring benefits to other countries; this problem will be very hard to resolve due to the huge differences in both how the systems are organised and the level of benefits.
Regulation 1408/71 does not in fact make provision for transfers or for discussing the question of disability benefits.
And, of course, there is currently considerable reaction on the part of numerous countries to benefit transfers, due to the huge financial costs involved.
Finally, I must say that 2003 will really be a big challenge.
At present we are discussing the political framework for 2003.
Of course, we shall be discussing the matter with Parliament before we draft our overall proposal, but 2003 will be a huge challenge for all of us, because we shall need to show that we are capable of action, not just words.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
On behalf of the Members of the European Parliament, I wish to express my thanks for the excellent work carried out by our sign language interpreter during this sitting, which has enabled us to provide everyone with greater equality of access to our debates.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Public health action programme (2001-2006)
The next item is the report (A5Â­0104/2001) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2001Â­2006) [COM(2000) 285 - C5Â­0299/2000 - 2000/0119(COD)]
Mr President, the health programme on which we are about to vote is the first integrated EU venture in this sector.
This is a favourable time to promote such an initiative, in view of both the considerable advances in information collection and dissemination technology and the increased awareness Europeans have of the quality of life, on which health protection can have a catalysing influence.
In this new programme, an overall approach is adopted, both for health and the methods, mechanisms and practices used to tackle health issues.
Thus, the programme sets three objectives, to be achieved through close overall and two-way cooperation between Member States.
The first objective is to collect, process and disseminate medical data, information, practices and knowledge from all sources.
The second objective is to create a mechanism for a direct, rapid and coordinated Community response to health threats.
The third objective is to tackle factors which are lifestyle-related health determinants, socio-economic health determinants and environment-related health determinants.
These factors will be studied, so that a strategy and policies can be drawn up designed to ensure that individual measures are of a high quality and to make health protection more effective.
However, the programme' s major weakness is the fact that it lacks the coordinating centre which is absolutely vital in such an extended, complicated endeavour in which the national services of the Member States, non-governmental organisations, international bodies, Commission departments, existing and developing programme networks are involved, as the programme proposes, together with numerous other factors.
I focused my attention on this deficiency in particular and, after some consideration and several consultations, I finally decided on a proposal for creating a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre, my proposal being that this centre would operate within the framework of the Community, i.e. the European Commission, and the programme, with the assistance of a committee made up of representatives of the Member States.
This will ensure that all the objectives are achieved in the best way possible.
As well as the coordination objective, several other objectives have been included which are connected with the introduction of an integrated health strategy through the development of an inter-sectoral policy in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities.
The programme to tackle health determinants proposes adding the development of strategies and measures on genetic, antenatal and biological determinants which obviously affect health.
Similarly, supporting action to identify and determine best practices and guidelines for health is a basic factor in safeguarding a high level of health protection and preventing illness.
Obviously, without comparability of information, compatibility of data and interoperability of systems and networks which are being developed or which will be developed within the programme, the measure will have a limited impact and the Community action will not be successful.
For this reason, binding provisions are being introduced for the development of comparable health data and compatible information systems as well as express provision for the protection of personal data.
Another factor which I consider extremely important is the budget.
There must always be a correspondence between the objectives set and the means available to achieve them.
In my opinion, this correspondence is not ensured in the proposed programme for two reasons: first, the programme' s measures, as described, are particularly extensive and ambitious and, secondly, the extension of the existing programmes in the health sector adopted last December has already reduced the original budget of EUR 300 million by approximately EUR 80 million.
In view of the above, amendments have been proposed so that the objectives of the programme can be achieved.
Furthermore, we should not forget for an instant the fact that, after successive crises - bovine spongiform encephalopathy, dioxin, foot-and-mouth - public health is a major EU priority, even taking precedence over its other policies.
This programme has come along at the right time, a time of considerable advances in information technology and surprising achievements in atomic biology, genetic engineering and biotechnology, all of which will radically change preventive medicine and therefore be instrumental in preventing disease.
Finally, I should like to say that, if we are to strengthen the foundations of the European structure, we need convergence not just at strategy and policy level in the economic sector or in the foreign policy and security sector; we also need convergence in individual sectors such as health, education, etc. These are new forms of integration which I refer to as new convergences and which add breadth and depth to the unification process.
I therefore consider that the new programme represents the start of just such a convergence process in the vitally important public health sector.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis very warmly for his excellent report. But thanks are also due to the committee responsible, which accepted all 16 amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights.
This shows that once again, this House is much further ahead than some Member States with their national health policies.
Although we women constitute the majority of the population, and although the double and triple burden of work, family and caring for relatives are shown to take a greater toll on our health, women-specific aspects do not always receive the attention they deserve in health policy.
Our health systems are usually gender-blind.
National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender.
Yet it is telling that in Europe and beyond, the majority of people who are dependent on medication are women. In Germany, the figure is 70%.
So we urgently need more solid data, and above all, a holistic approach to health throughout Europe.
Gender policies must also be granted a central role in health policy in future: in research, prevention and treatment.
The new Public Health Action Programme can pave the way in this regard.
Every 20 minutes, a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe.
It affects one woman in nine.
The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year.
Yet if it is detected in time and properly treated, breast cancer is curable.
So here too, best practice is imperative.
We must ensure that it is not only in early detection that breakthroughs are widely promoted throughout the EU.
After the adoption of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening, the task now is to research and promote best practice for treatment as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a Public Health Action Programme for 2001-2006 is a well-meaning attempt to overcome the current fragmentation of European health policy into numerous individual programmes.
Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have made every effort to incorporate many additional issues into the Commission's text and improve upon it, while our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, has made genuine efforts and worked extremely hard to take all these different wishes into account. This has not only resulted in a great many proposed amendments; in my view, it also presents us with a text which - as an opinion of the European Parliament - is useless in its current form.
It is full of repetition, tautology, rambling paragraphs, contradictory statements, and demands which violate the principle of subsidiary, even though the opposite is claimed in the text.
In terms of content, I have concerns about the Commission's priorities as reflected, inter alia, in the allocation of resources.
Here, I support the rapporteur's proposed amendment.
But in particular, I have grave reservations about the undoubtedly well-meaning proposal calling on the Commission to set up a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre (HCMC) to ensure the efficient operation and coordination of the programme.
I will vote against all these proposed amendments, and also protest vigorously about the fact that we are discussing this report in plenary this week even though the translation was only available on Monday.
A framework programme could create the necessary transparency for the Community's activities in the field of health and offer the flexibility to set priorities in response to current events.
In this way, the limited available resources could be used sensibly and in a targeted way.
But this requires a clear and lucid mandate for the Commission, which - in my view - the current text fails to provide.
Mr President, today is our first reading of one of the most important matters of concern to the citizens of Europe, the action programme for public health.
This is the first time advances in European policy in the health sector have been set out, achievements and weaknesses have been identified and the difficulties in applying a consistent Community policy have been made clear.
The European Parliament must use its vote on the report in question to signal its support for health promotion, the principle of prevention and improved medical services at all levels.
Obviously, sectors such as research and the environment impact directly on public health and proper account must be taken of them in action programmes.
We also feel that the European Union should work with international organisations and non-governmental health organisations so that there is a constant flow of information and exchange of experiences and we can respond immediately to serious threats.
We also need to stress how important it is to increase public awareness and for the public to be actively involved in health issues.
If we are to win the confidence of European citizens in Community policies on issues which affect them, specific problems relating directly or indirectly to health need to be examined promptly and transparently.
Under the new programme, three global objectives replace the eight programmes currently in operation.
We are hopeful that the new, special objectives will be selected not in a fragmentary manner and under pressure, but on the basis of the priorities set by the World Health Organisation and other organisations working in this sector.
As far as creating a European Coordination and Monitoring Centre is concerned, I think that it should work under the aegis of the Commission and should draw up programmes of priorities in the health sector, taking account of international data.
Similarly, it should collect, monitor and evaluate the relevant information so that it can propose and then coordinate strategies and measures.
I must, of course, stress that the confidentiality of personal data on individuals or groups of people must be respected when collecting information.
I think it is very important that mental health has been included for the first time as an area for action under a public health programme.
My congratulations for that to the Commissioner, who demonstrated a personal awareness and responded to our proposition by including this issue in his proposal.
Scientific data clearly show the extent and seriousness of neuro-psychiatric illnesses and our response, albeit belated, must be direct and effective.
Finally, as regards the budget, even though I believe that funding should not be sparing in this sector and am aware of the objective difficulties of the budget, I believe that an increase of EUR 80 million, i.e. the amount spent on extending the operation of existing programmes, is perfectly realistic.
I am confident that, despite all the difficulties, the European Commission and the Council will agree to this increase and finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts to find compromise solutions which substantially improve the initial proposal.
Mr President, I would like to express my warmest thanks to our rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, for having once again very skilfully steered a report through the channels of the committee, a report that has aroused much interest, and one that is very important and, for that reason, has left itself open to the hundreds and hundreds of amendments that we have all tabled.
I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that rarely during a committee' s work has there been so much cooperation among political groups, and for that an unqualified thank you goes to the rapporteur.
As my fellow Member, Mrs Schleicher, criticised this report for perhaps not focussing adequately on the essentials and featuring too many good intentions, I might first of all say that the final result could have been a lot more cluttered.
It could have expressed a lot more in the way of hopes for the future.
I think the rapporteur has seen to it that it covers the whole issue, however.
As for Mrs Schleicher' s own group, it added a totally new area of focus.
Her group asked for the fifth special objective to be adopted, the one connected with gene therapy, diagnosis of genetic diseases, cloning, and so on. My group certainly was not of the opinion that this should be added here.
Mr President, public health is a major area of activity for the European Union as the Treaty of Amsterdam does indeed oblige the Union to take account of the health issue in all areas of its work.
In this respect we face some very demanding challenges.
My group would particularly like to underline the importance of this sort of integration and the Commission is going to have the enormous task of adapting agricultural policy to the demands of health.
Let us just think about the food we eat, for example.
It must mean that in the future we will be eating more vegetarian food and rather less meat, and so on.
In industrial policy it will mean that when we adopt a strategy on chemicals the basic issues of public health must be made very clear.
It will also mean that the food industry will have to accept that tighter regulations will have to be adopted, for example, with regard to the salt content of food.
There are many conflicts to come, and we can only hope that the Commission will work on these proposals and then the Council of Ministers and Parliament will clarify this situation further in the second reading.
Mr President, it may seem surprising that we on the left congratulate the rapporteur and welcome his report, but we are convinced by its content. Mr Trakatellis talks of a principle which we share: health is not a commodity which can be traded.
And he speaks of two objectives: health promotion and disease prevention, and the whole of his proposal refers to these two objectives, and it is essential that a health programme achieves them.
Initially he talks about the necessary coordination, not only in the networks which deal with health, but with the Member States and also with the non-governmental organisations.
And, as an epilogue, he also talks about a proposal which we agree with: to create a centre for the coordination and monitoring of the health situation.
We also agree that we must have the capacity for rapid reaction in the face of the kind of threats to health which we have seen recently and continue to see.
We must also overcome inequalities; there are still inequalities between the Member States and within the Member States themselves, and the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment remind us that these inequalities must be overcome, and place great emphasis on the ongoing training of doctors and health staff, but also on the health education and training of schoolchildren.
We think this is essential.
The rapporteur also speaks of the risks which today are of great concern to the population and which relate to the health effects of mobile telephones and mobile communications in general, with the tall masts that are now all over our towns producing electromagnetic waves.
He also discusses the risks of radioactivity and, specifically, of something which was also talked about - and this is a debate which should continue - of the health risks of depleted uranium and other risks.
I believe that this is a fine report and that its deserves Parliament' s support tomorrow.
Mr President, I welcome this report and the three main elements to it, of which we are already aware.
I fully support the position taken by the Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Byrne, when he states that it is dangerous to assume that a Member State can protect its citizens' health by its own efforts alone.
He is fully correct in his approach.
We know that a single market exists where there is a free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the territories of the European Union.
Communicable diseases which affect the health of our citizens do not stop at borders.
Citizens of each Member State must have access to the wide range of information concerning the factors affecting their health and on the way in which public health systems within that country meet their needs.
This proposal also covers the important legislative initiatives in areas such as safety of blood and blood derivatives, and the implementation of wider anti-smoking campaigns.
The Commission must be given a central coordinating role in public health to deal with illnesses, from detecting their origin to their actual treatment.
It is very important that homeopathy should also be included as a medical treatment within this European Community action plan on public health.
Finally, the European Commission should allocate greater financial resources to investigating the causes of, and possible cures for, Alzheimer's disease.
Mr President, at the end of last year I concluded my contribution to the debate on the extension of the European public health programme with the observation that, in my opinion, the developments in public health in the EU are going too far.
Public health is national policy, and it should remain that way.
I am therefore against public health programmes which can be used as leverage to influence national policy, whilst the programmes currently before us hardly represent any added value compared to Member State efforts.
The current debate on a new public health programme is only feeding my concern.
Although there is a formal acknowledgement that the principle of subsidiarity needs to be observed, it is a hollow phrase.
In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the programme has been padded out and trimmed with all kinds of topics which could possibly be related to public health.
In addition, the budget has been increased from EUR 300 to 500 million, and should partly be utilised to set up a European coordination centre.
Not only do I find such a coordination centre surplus to requirements, it is also unwanted, since I expect it will be used to develop European rather than a national public health policy.
If the EU institutions want to make a distinct gesture in terms of public health, they need to phase out subsidies for tobacco growing completely.
That will generate funds for the European Union, instead of the European Union spending money on projects which Member States could implement and finance.
In the field of alcohol and drugs, it is the Member States which need to pursue a restrictive policy.
Furthermore, the European Union could do more for the candidate countries in terms of promoting public health, where even basic health care is found wanting.
Various diseases can be controlled effectively by means of relatively few resources.
Mr President, it is appropriate, I suppose, that this measure has reached this plenary in World Health Week, with its particular emphasis on mental health.
The week before last, in Parliament, we were launching the epilepsy White Paper.
Some 15 million of our fellow Europeans will be afflicted by that illness during their lifetime at a cost of some EUR 20 billion per year, plus the cost to the individual and families of lost income and the cost to Member States of lost tax revenues.
Multiply that by all the diseases and disorders, physical and mental, add the impact of ending the communist system in Eastern Europe and the two-way cross-border movement of health problems, from environmental pollution to sexual and drug-related diseases, and the economic impact of health problems is colossal.
The European Union has no competence for health services, but it has always had competence for health and safety at work, and then for public health and infectious diseases which have no respect for national borders.
More recently it has been given competence for health promotion and illness prevention and health impact assessments.
Now we have to take this forward with the reforms of our health action programme that this report suggests.
I commend this report, the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's additions to his work.
We shall raise standards of health in the European Union, not by directives, but by research, education and the identification and dissemination of good practice.
It will not cost the tax-payers an arm and a leg: just EUR 83 million per year, if our committee position is accepted - a tiny sum for a massive challenge.
We are told that the Council will not accept EUR 83 million per year for six years, but EUR 63 million per year is what was being spent under the old programme.
If you just add some 5% per year for six years, that would mean EUR 83 million.
If you take the Commission proposal of EUR 50 million and reduce it by the same amount then you would be cutting health budgets to EUR 37 million in real terms when we are taking on these new responsibilities.
If they do, let it be on their consciences that they voted against EUR 20 million per year for health, while endorsing an annual budget of over EUR 1 000 million for subsidising the growing of tobacco.
Mr President, this proposal for an action programme in public health is greatly welcomed by this Parliament.
Health is an issue which opinion poll after opinion poll shows is the number one priority for our citizens across the European Union.
This issue matters to ordinary people: people understand when you talk about health.
As we discuss this report this evening we should never forget this.
We often talk about getting closer to citizens and, with an appalling turnout across the Union at the last European elections, we should never forget what is important to our citizens.
As we all know, Article 152 gives public health greater importance than ever before, so that health has to be taken into consideration in all European Union policy areas.
With this programme we can directly add value to the lives of European Union citizens.
By taking a horizontal approach to public health, we can make the best use of limited resources.
With a rapid reaction unit to tackle communicable disease we can act much more effectively.
With health impact assessments we can detect what works and what does not.
With more health information for our citizens, quality of life will surely improve.
Although I support much of what the rapporteur proposes, I still have concern over the issue of the centre.
I fear that this issue could delay the whole programme because of the legal questions surrounding the proposal.
In addition, I also fear that such a centre would take away much of the budget, leaving very little for the work which actually connects effectively with our citizens.
In conclusion, health connects with the citizen.
We must guarantee that this proposal, which will last for the next five years, is effective.
We must deliver on health and well-being.
After all, colleagues, the European elections are not far away.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and other committees involved for all their work on this important and ambitious programme which is a crucial element in the Community's overall health strategy.
This programme represents a fundamental step forward in the development of effective European public health policies.
It is important because protecting and improving public health is at the very centre of our citizens, concerns and expectations.
As we are all aware, the relevance of our public health policy is fast becoming a litmus test of the European Union's credibility for our citizens.
The programme will address these preoccupations by providing the means, support and actions in those areas where the Community can make a real difference as foreseen in Article 152 as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty.
The programme under consideration today responds comprehensively to the shared concerns which the Commission, Parliament and the Council have expressed in the past about the shortcomings of the previous programming approach.
Consequently, we are moving away from the fragmented disease-oriented, project-driven measures of the past, where resources were spread thinly, the impact on public health was diminished and financial management requirements were multiplied.
In its place, we are moving to improve the health policy focus and streamlining programme management, which will minimise bureaucracy, improve coordination, increase transparency and maximise impact.
The architecture of the new programme will also ensure a degree of flexibility, so that we can respond to unforeseen health policy issues if and when they arise.
It provides a horizontal framework which will allow a policy-driven approach to be taken in the future on the basis of a broad view of public health.
In other words the programme will provide an invaluable support to health policy-making in the Community.
The programme identifies three strands of action that together will enable us to identify and tackle the major health problems that we face.
First, improving knowledge about people's health, about health interventions and about the functioning of health systems.
Second, anticipating and reacting quickly to major threats to health.
Third, confronting the key underlying causes of ill-health related not only to personal lifestyles, but also to other key determinants: social, economic and environmental factors and so on.
I am pleased to see that very many of the amendments you are debating are in line with this broad view of public health and the way that we should address it at Community level.
We can therefore accept, in full, 61 amendments.
There are in addition a further 24 amendments which include valuable ideas that we can endorse, but which as drafted are not fully acceptable. This is either because they contain specific points of substance which conflict with the approach of the programme, or because they raise difficult issues.
With so many amendments, it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them.
I will, therefore, concentrate on four key areas where there are several amendments which we cannot accept and where I believe that some clarification of the Commission's position will be particularly helpful.
First, the scope and structure of the programme.
Even though most amendments respect and indeed reinforce the horizontal or policy-driven approach of the programme, several, such as Amendments Nos 12, 65, 66, 85, 91, 100, 111, 112 and 113, go against this approach.
They introduce into the decision references either to specific diseases and conditions or to very precise actions to be taken.
Providing some illustrations of major health burdens and activities in a recital may prove to be helpful, but the greatest caution is needed to ensure that the programme does not become so overcrowded with priorities and actions that it loses not only its general orientation, but also the flexibility necessary to respond effectively to new developments and threats as they arise.
Events in recent years have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility.
Consequently, it is important to focus on key priorities where real added value can be produced.
Activities duplicating the work of other Community programmes should be avoided, and this will also avoid the unnecessary use of scarce resources.
For this reason Amendments Nos 86, 88, 89, 92, 94 and 110 are not acceptable.
They all touch on subjects such as setting up programmes in eastern Europe, violence against women, risks from mobile telephones, complementary therapies and research, which are covered by other Community programmes.
Efforts have been made by Parliament not to infringe the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, the responsibilities of Member States in the area of public health.
The programme has a clear role in relation to information about how health systems are working, but this should not be interpreted as the Community having a role in the operation of specific health services.
These are matters for the Member States.
For this reason, Amendments Nos 79, 99 and 102 in relation to protecting the rights of patients and setting up centres of excellence on environmental toxicology and on gene therapy and cloning are not acceptable; and whilst I agreed that the right of patients to simple, clear and scientifically valid information concerning their illness, is in itself a valuable objective, regrettably, the Community has limited competences under Article 152 of the EC Treaty.
Turning now to another issue in connection with the basic structure and scope of the programme. Amendment No 106, on the table today, sets out some actions intended to develop links between the programme and other policies.
The ideas it contains, for example on health impact assessment, are welcome, but for me this work should not be approached separately from the other actions in the programme.
In fact, health in other policies is a fundamental feature of the entire health strategy as such.
Activities related to health impact assessment should thus be firmly placed within the proposed structure of the programme and not added as a further separate strand of action.
To be consistent, the mainstreaming of health in other policies should form part of the mainstream of our three programme strands.
Therefore, this amendment is acceptable only in part.
Secondly, on implementation, the precondition for the delivery of all these objectives is implementation capacity.
Let me say at the outset that I fully accept that the Commission does not currently possess the technical capacity to meet the challenge of implementation.
There is no doubt that we will have to make significant efforts to put in place coordination, monitoring and implementation of capacity which is adequate to the technical challenge offered by this programme.
Without any doubt the issue is a priority for the three institutions in this process.
The success of the programme will depend very much on our ability to bring together the necessary resources and expertise at Community level, within Member States and in international organisations.
The Commission will do everything it can to ensure the smooth running of the programme by creating the effective coordination and monitoring capability which is essential to make the programme a success.
I am currently investigating various options for ensuring this capability, for example, ways to strengthen internal capacities or the new possibility offered by the externalisation initiative to establish one or more specialised bodies for different implementation tasks.
However, the amendments include a substantial number of references to the creation of a health coordination and monitoring centre in the programme decision.
Let me be very clear about our position on this.
As I have said, I wholeheartedly agree with the need for an identifiable mechanism to ensure effective coordination and monitoring to make the programme a success.
I also agree that this must be under the auspices of the Commission.
But the proposal of Parliament to set up a centre within the Commission, which is named in a number of amendments to the programme decision, raises a number of serious legal and institutional difficulties.
In particular, it infringes on the Commission's right to determine its own organisation.
Therefore I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11 and 49, nor can I accept those parts of other amendments which contain a reference to a "health coordination and monitoring centre".
To summarise our position, I believe we are largely in agreement on what needs to be done but we need to reflect carefully on how we achieve this, given the legal, institutional and budgetary implications.
In keeping with this agreed objective let me confirm my commitment to work actively with Parliament and the Council in the weeks ahead to find agreed solutions so that adequate structures, expertise and resources will be available for the proper implementation of the programme.
That brings me to the third point - the budget.
The Commission's proposal is for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years.
There are two amendments on the table today to increase this amount respectively to EUR 500 million - Amendment No 72 - and EUR 380 million - Amendment No 109.
The decision on this is for the Council and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority.
At this stage I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal.
This was drawn up on the basis of a cost estimate for the actions included in the programme, and is in conformity with the financial perspectives.
It is clear that any proposals to add to the actions foreseen will have budgetary implications.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 37, 72 and 109 on the total budget for the programme.
In addition, Amendments Nos 72, 103 and 109 seek to set limits on how we spend the programme budget.
Amendments Nos 72 and 109 stipulate that each strand of actions must receive at least 25% of the budget.
Amendment No 103 proposes a restriction on the use to be made of calls for tender and, in addition, raises the ceilings for the percentage of a project's costs that can be covered by a subvention.
Such restrictions undermine the essential principle that the programme must be flexible and able to respond to new challenges, emerging risks and public concerns over the coming six years.
Therefore I cannot accept either a minimum amount for expenditure on each strand or the limit on the use of calls for tender.
I am, however, prepared to raise the limit on subventions to the 70% permissible under the Commission's established financial rules, but I cannot go beyond this.
Finally, on comitology, a number of amendments concern the type of committee to be established.
We had originally proposed an advisory committee as this would minimise the bureaucracy and procedural work required.
Amendments Nos 42 and 73 call for a mixed committee combining management and advisory procedures.
From our existing public health programmes we have experience of working with a mixed committee.
Furthermore this is in line with the Council Decision 1999/468.
Therefore the Commission can accept these amendments.
However, Amendment No 74 specifies a large number of tasks for the committee to perform in management mode.
The sheer number of tasks would be counterproductive with regard to our flexibility, in implementing the programme and the proper functioning of the committee.
For this reason I cannot agree to some of the provisions in this amendment, for example on the annual budget and arrangements and procedures for selecting and financing projects as according to Article 234 of the EC Treaty the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the budget.
Therefore I can only accept it in part.
Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 105 concerning the submission of annual work programmes to Parliament for opinion.
I can, however, accept to submit them for information, as is set out in Amendment No 46.
In summary, for the reasons I have set out, 28 amendments are not acceptable.
These are: Amendments Nos 33, 36, 37, 41, 62, 65, 66, 71, 72, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 97, 99, 100, 102, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113.
I accept only in part Amendments Nos 6, 11, 12, 14, 27, 29, 32, 44, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54, 57, 63, 70, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 93, 103 and 106.
On the other hand, as I have indicated I can accept in full the remaining 61 amendments.
I repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in.
Many of the amendments will improve this proposal.
For those points where difficulties remain the Commission is ready and willing to assist in finding solutions quickly.
I am confident that we can work together to resolve the outstanding issues in the course of the codecision process.
Indeed, the fact that the Commission can accept in whole or in part 85 of the 113 amendments shows our willingness to take on board Parliament's substantial policy contributions and our confidence that together we will be able to get this important programme off the ground as quickly as possible.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Golden shares
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
B5-0166/2001 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission on the 'Golden Share' ;
B5-0167/2001 by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and Mr Huhne, on behalf of the Group of the European Party of Liberals, Democrats and Reformers, to the Commission, on the 'Golden Share' .
Mr President, in 1997, the Commission approved an interpretative communication - and I stress interpretative - on intra-Community investments, which was not submitted to the European Parliament or to the Council.
And under the auspices of this Communication, the Commission has to date begun legal actions, if our calculations are correct, against nine of the fifteen Member States.
Nobody questions the Commission' s duty to pursue alleged infringements of Community Law.
The Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats' criticism is that, by means of an interpretative communication, the Commission has unilaterally set the rules of the game in such an important area, and this is proved by the fact that the Stockholm European Council has dealt with it, thereby side-stepping, in our view, the legislative competences of this Parliament and of the Council.
I assume that Commissioner Bolkestein will be aware that the Court of Justice has already set the precedent of annulling an interpretative communication similar to this one, on pension funds, precisely because the Commission exceeded its authority.
But it is also the case, Commissioner, that this Communication of 1997 has become obsolete because of recent economic developments.
For all these reasons, it is very important to this House that the Commissioner replies clearly whether he intends, in accordance with his competences, to present a legislative proposal on intra-Community investments to Parliament and the Council.
My Group, of course, believes this to be essential, given the current circumstances, and I am certain that, at the end of this debate, the Commissioner will be convinced that this presumption is agreed on by the enormous majority of this House.
Of these new circumstances which I have just referred to, I am going to expand on the opening up of national markets in key economic sectors, in which there still exist within the European Union monopoly systems which create asymmetry.
In fact, in accordance with Community guidelines, certain Member States have made great efforts to open up their telecommunications and other sectors to competition.
However, other States have not taken equivalent measures and their markets therefore remain closed to external competition.
This is why the PPE-DE Group believes that we should permit prevention mechanisms such as the "golden share", because otherwise objective discrimination may arise.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner what measures the Commission intends to present in order to allow the Member States which are working to open up and privatise their economies to free competition to preserve the objective of that privatisation?
Commissioner, on Thursday, this Parliament will vote on a resolution which will establish its position at the end of the debate.
I am convinced that the Commission will at all times apply the interinstitutional agreement which binds us and that you, Commissioner, will therefore act in accordance with your powers of legislative initiative and consequently present this House with a specific proposal immediately.
Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, in this proposal, which shares the concern expressed by the PPE-DE Group, our Group has expressed its unease at this distortion of competition, which arises in practice and which, as has been said, to an extent leaves those fields which certain Member States have opened up to competition and in which they have liberalised their companies unprotected.
We are therefore in an unbalanced situation in which companies which still have the characteristics of public companies, and therefore have a monopoly in a Member State, take advantage of the openness of the external market and indulge in unfair competition in relation to companies which have entered into what we may call the free game of the market.
As Mr Galeote has said, disputes have arisen, and are arising, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom, and infringement procedures are under way in Denmark, Germany and Holland.
This is therefore a widespread situation, which demonstrates that the principles guiding the 1997 Communication referred to earlier, are no longer valid.
We therefore urge that the relevant legislation be updated, with the due participation of this Parliament, and that this should take place, on the one hand, to eliminate these positions of privilege and, on the other hand, to safeguard the actions of the Member States, which have behaved in accordance with the process of the opening up of markets, which are liberalising them and which need the relevant guarantees so that the companies which enter into this European internal market have all the safeguards resulting from being a part of it.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking both Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm for the questions they have put which indeed touch on an important aspect of the internal market.
May I begin by saying that the communication of 19 July 1997 on certain legal aspects concerning intra-EU investments to which both speakers made reference was adopted by the Commission, as was the case for a series of other communications, on the basis of its exclusive competence stemming from its role as guardian of the Treaties.
As is specified in the communication itself, its objective is to indicate to national authorities and economic operators in Member States how the Commission interprets the provisions of the Treaty on capital movements and the right of establishment in order to reduce the risk of divergent legal interpretations.
The principles set out in that communication are essentially based on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which remains, of course, the sole competent institution to provide a definitive interpretation of Community law.
In accordance with Article 56 of the EC Treaty all restrictions on capital movements between Member States, be they discriminatory or non-discriminatory, are prohibited.
The communication, being devoted to intra-Community investment, goes more deeply into the respect for this fundamental principle insofar as two specific forms of capital movements are concerned: the acquisition of domestic securities and direct investments.
All restrictions applied to these capital movements can pose compatibility problems with, in particular, Article 56 which deals with the free movement of capital, and Article 43, which deals with freedom of establishment.
The communication to which I referred a little while ago states that, in conformity with the very notion of direct investments, nationals of other Member States of the European Union should be free to acquire controlling stakes, exercise their voting rights attached to those stakes, and manage domestic companies under the same conditions as are laid down in a given Member State for its own nationals.
While the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital are among the fundamental freedoms of the Treaty, certain exceptions to the general rules exist which allow Member States to impose certain restrictions.
As far as the freedom of establishment is concerned these restrictions may be motivated by the exercise of official authority or on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health - Article 46.
As far as the free movement of capital is concerned they may be justified on the basis of requisite measures in the field of taxation, prudential supervision, or the use of declaration procedures, or by considerations in relation to public policy or public security - Article 58.
Finally, Member States may take measures which they consider necessary for the protection of the essential interests of their security which are connected with the defence sector - Article 296.
In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice it is necessary to interpret those exceptions narrowly in order to satisfy the criterion of proportionality.
All interpretation based on economic criteria should be excluded.
An exception should not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on the freedom of movement of capital.
In the light of the principles which I have just set out, and taking into account that the Treaty is neutral insofar as the private or public nature of companies is concerned, it clearly appears that all restrictions aimed at preventing subsequent purchases by investors of other Member States of controlling rights in privatised companies under the pretext that the capital of these investors is to different degrees in public ownership cannot be justified by the exceptions of the Treaty in the area of capital movements or the rights of establishment, exceptions which I delineated a few moments ago.
In conclusion, may I say that as Members of this Parliament may be aware, the Commission will shortly have a debate on restrictions on intra-Community investment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we are discussing this evening raises two issues.
Firstly, the problem of Community legislation.
If we examine the Community's legal sources, we have the original Treaty law, on the one hand, and directives and regulations, which are adopted with the involvement of Council and Parliament, on the other.
But between the two, there is something else, which is often regarded as a source of law, namely the communications.
We are discussing one of these communications today.
Commissioner, you have rightly pointed out that this communication is merely an interpretation and is based on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.
But it often seems as if the Commission is the only body to interpret the law, without any involvement by the Council or the European Parliament.
The Commission acts as the sole legislator, as in the Byzantium of ancient times under Emperor Constantine.
My law lecturer in Freiburg sometimes described the Commission's methods as the Imperial Byzantine approach to law-making as well.
This is why I think it is absolutely crucial, in these very important cases, that directives or regulations are submitted and - as is right and proper - adopted with the participation of Parliament and the Council.
The problem which we are addressing raises a second issue, namely competition in the European Community.
Liberalisation - i.e. the abolition of monopolies - is one of the EU's success stories.
In telecommunications in particular, we have seen that cutting costs and prices has genuinely benefited citizens.
But there is a substantial danger here.
We face a situation in which some are liberalising and opening up to competition, but others are not doing so.
And we see that those who have not done sometimes win out, even with a monopoly, as long as the others are buying up, until the old public monopoly has been replaced by a private monopoly.
The citizen then still faces a monopoly, as before, and derives no benefit from liberalisation.
I think that the Commission needs to pay greater attention to this fact in its activities in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure Constantine was Byzantine, after all he was borderline between Byzantium and the Roman Empire.
Were it Justinian, of course, it would have been a different matter.
Anyway the issue we are addressing tonight is the extent to which a Member State is permitted under a treaty to place restrictions upon nationals of other Member States or its own nationals, I suppose, from conducting intra-EU investment within the sphere of its economy.
This matter is particularly relevant to investments in privatisation conducted by Member States.
The issue is of fundamental importance for the correct functioning of the European single market and I would like to thank colleagues for raising the subject this time given the number of cases the Commission has referred to the Court of Justice over recent years.
The Treaty establishing the European Communities under Article 43 on right of establishment and Article 56, as mentioned by Commissioner Bolkestein, on free movement of capital, clearly creates a regime whereby nationals of any Member State have the right to invest in other Member States.
This is a right that a very large number of individuals and enterprises have availed themselves of as the European Union has developed.
Intra-EU investment has been increasing by staggering proportions over the last few years.
In 1998, such investment totalled over EUR 132 billion; in 1999, it had increased by over 80% to over EUR 240 billion.
We can reasonably expect that these figures will be easily surpassed and the rate of increase maintained as the establishment of the euro reduces intra-Community transactions, eliminates exchange risk and exchange cost for enterprises whilst at the same time increasing intra-Community investment opportunities.
Such is the success of the European economic project and the establishment of the euro.
However, one can always seek improvements.
There are still many tasks for the completion of the European single market and one of these is, of course, the gradual dismantling of state involvement in enterprises.
This dismantling has only been pursued with great political courage and with grave political risks.
Often it has only been achieved through the legal assurances that governments gave about their continued supervision and special interests in the strategic directions of the enterprises being privatised.
Such legal assurances came in many forms, such as the golden share, so that there is a case, I suppose, to argue that the golden share has not always been an impediment but may have actually helped politically the privatisation process.
In its 1997 communication, the Commission established its guidelines for the existence of these legal assurances.
It did so in a rather non-transparent way through a communication that was not discussed either in Parliament or by the Council.
The legal assurances that governments had created, on the other hand, were established in the full glare of publicity and public debate that necessarily exists in the privatisation process.
It really is rather an uncomfortable situation that such a dichotomy has been created between the establishment of fundamental Community rules and Member State regulations.
The Commission, using the communication as its operational guide, has since taken legal action against six Member States before the Court of Justice and opened infringement proceedings against the others.
None of these cases has, as yet, come to a conclusion.
It cannot be justified that the Commission has set up its own framework of rules under which it has been bringing actions against Member States, which have gone through enormous difficulties in bringing forward necessary privatisation programmes.
I agree with the Commission, when it states that the national interest argument used to justify such legal assurances by Member States, as has frequently happened, cannot be accepted as an adequate justification for such measures.
The national interest argument is simply not sufficiently transparent since it can cover a particularly wide range of economic and/or non-economic criteria.
I can, however, also agree with those of our colleagues who argue that the Commission too has been acting in a particularly non-transparent manner with regard to breaking down the barriers for intra-EU investment. I join with them in requesting that the Commission update its policy in this area with a proposal for a directive, not only for the sake of intra-institutional transparency, but also to provide guidance to Member States so that lengthy procedures before the Court can be avoided.
Mr President, Commissioner, in my opinion, the speeches I have just heard, particularly that of Mr Galeote, could be misleading, for they imply that Parliament is, in some way, calling upon the Commission to consolidate the golden share, to strengthen the special powers of States so that they can, to some extent, protect markets being liberalised against markets in which monopolies with a high degree of liquidity operate which might take over the liberalised markets.
In my view, this would be an erroneous impression, for Parliament must speak out, loud and clear, in protest against the golden share and against all the instruments preventing the establishment of a genuine, dynamic internal market in the sectors which have traditionally, in recent decades, been occupied by the State in Europe.
I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals.
In 1997, we introduced a referendum in Italy against the 1994 law which established the special powers of the golden share in Italy.
Eighty per cent of those who voted in that referendum - almost 10 million Italians - said yes, calling for what we wanted, the repeal of those rules which were hampering - as they still do today - the establishment of a genuine competitive market on the capital market for privatised companies.
I regret to say that, as often happens, those votes were thrown away, destroyed in the Italian climate, where the Constitution and expressions of the citizens' will often count for no more than waste paper.
In 1998, the government headed by Romano Prodi, the current President of the Commission, was subjected to an infringement procedure by the Commissioner for the Internal Market at the time, Mario Monti, for using this golden share.
In 1999, a decree was issued which - in that typically Italian way - modified the golden share without making any substantial change.
Well then, in my opinion, the articles of the Treaty should be sufficient to prevent a State company operating a monopoly from taking over a company on the liberalised market.
This would be abuse of a dominant position, State aid.
There is no need to provide for companies to have the golden share to prevent them from being taken over by a State-owned company from another Member State.
Otherwise - as frequently happens - this excuse is, in actual fact, used to consolidate national governments and majority parties' power of veto over the free placing on the market of public companies; the financial markets are unable to establish the best, most efficient, optimum distribution of power and therefore of the management of companies in sectors which are highly important, key, crucial sectors for Europe, such as the telecommunications or energy sectors in particular.
Moreover, the golden share means that companies which are being placed on the market bring less cash into the State coffers because a company is being bought over which someone who has not invested even a penny has the power to make strategic decisions: governments lose money by privatising the golden share.
There is also the danger, with the golden share, of nationalising private investment: the citizens, the investors, buy companies which are under the thumb of the State, governments and therefore political parties.
The golden share gives rise to a remarkable conflict of interests between the State which remains the manager and, to some extent, the owner of the liberalised companies, and the State which should have the sole role of regulator guaranteeing the competition which protects the interests of the citizens.
This is one of the ways in which some of the European States - Italy, for instance - continue, in actual fact, to manage large parts of the economy of the country and prevent there being in these sectors - the telecommunications and energy sectors, for instance - efficient, competitive companies and markets, companies able to withstand international competition.
The fact that Enel in Italy or Deutsche Post in Germany or France TÃ©lÃ©com exploit positions of monopoly in order to go and grab areas which have been liberalised in the markets of other countries must be opposed as dominant positions, as State aid, but this cannot be used as an excuse to allow countries which are moving towards a market-based economy to keep powers in companies which are supposed to have been privatised.
In fact, the golden share has been in the past and continues to be a barrier to the creation of genuinely European public services companies.
It removes companies from market dynamics and governments continue to interfere, continue to think they know best who should buy a company, following certain lines of reasoning which are not the most effective for the market, thus penalising the citizens.
We must not advocate that governments use the golden share as a shield to prevent companies being bought on the market in order to direct the purchase of privatised companies towards preferred groups because, in the long run, this leads to non-competitive markets, as is happening now.
This is why I have some reservations about the resolution to be put to the vote on Thursday.
I believe that Parliament must speak out, loud and clear, if possible avoiding a compromise, with nationalisers and liberalisers fighting it out, and state clearly that the articles of the Treaty relating to the movement of capital and freedom of establishment must be fully enforced in the light of today's economic market conditions, not those of 40 years ago.
There is the danger that the State monopolies, which still exist, will lord it over the liberalised markets in Europe, a danger represented by the abuse of the dominant position and State aid.
This is the root of the matter.
Mr President, may I thank you once again for giving me the floor to reply to some of the comments made by Members.
Mr von Wogau said, if I understood him correctly, that the communication which has been referred to by Members of Parliament, and which I myself mentioned, is a source of law.
I cannot see it that way.
The source of law is the Treaty.
The Treaty is clear.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and universally recognised as such.
It issued the communication in 1997 in order to clear up certain misunderstandings in connection with the relevant articles of the Treaty.
It did not do so without reason.
I shall refer to two particular instances.
Firstly in 1991 the United Kingdom tried to use golden shares to oppose the acquisition of certain British companies which had been privatised by public entities, public companies, of other Member States.
At the time, in 1991, this was known as the "Lilley doctrine".
The Commission took energetic action. The United Kingdom changed its policy.
The second instance is a more recent one.
At international level my colleague, Mr Lamy, had to oppose an analogous American initiative which was taken against certain public European companies in the telecom area.
So in both these instances one sees that the Commission has taken action against the attempts, whether by a Member State, or in the case of the United States by a third country, to block investments by companies, whether private or public from other Member States, in privatised companies of the home state.
To return to the main point at issue, the Commission has done no more than interpret the relevant articles of the Treaty - basically Articles 56 and 43.
That is what is laid down in the interpretative communication.
So it cannot be said, as Mr Katiforis said earlier tonight, that the Commission is constructing its own framework of rules.
Once again and for the last time, I will say that the Commission has been entrusted with the duty to act as guardian of the Treaty.
In the years running up to 1997 there was uncertainty about the way Articles 43 and 56 ought to be interpreted.
That is the reason for the interpretative communication.
The final instance that decides on what is right or wrong, what is legal and illegal, is the Court of Justice.
Naturally the Commission does not, in the end, decide what the legal situation is.
That is the responsibility of the Court of Justice.
But before the matter can be considered by the Court of Justice somebody has to bring the case to the attention of the Court.
That is what the Commission has done.
This Commissioner has played a certain role in this and has taken a number of Member States to court for making use of the golden share.
So I must reject the reproach made against the Commission that it has arrogated unto itself certain competences that it should not have, that it is framing its own system of rules.
No, the Commission is merely interpreting and stating what the law is.
That is the reason why it has taken some Member States to court.
Hopefully we will soon see what the Court of Justice has to say.
I was asked if I would issue a directive.
There is no need for a directive.
We have a treaty.
The Commission interprets the treaty and the Court of Justice decides.
So we do not need a directive.
Having said all that, the Commission is due to have a debate on this whole issue shortly.
After that has taken place perhaps I can further inform Parliament, but at this moment I see no reason to change the opinion that I have just given.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
I have received four motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.15 p.m.)
Madam President, last month, Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the kidnapping of eight Portuguese citizens by the LFEC.
Yesterday, the LFEC released one of those hostages and I should like to welcome this positive gesture by the LFEC and call for it to be followed by seven more positive gestures, in other words, for the remaining seven Portuguese hostages to be released.
We condemn hostage taking as a form of political action and I wish to emphasise this once again now.
I would like you, Madam President, to act on our behalf in the following initiative: given that the Portuguese hostage who has just been released is in quite a poor state of health, we request that you ask the LFEC to give an international organisation, namely the Red Cross, immediate access to the seven remaining Portuguese citizens, who are still being held hostage in the enclave of Cabinda, in order to assess their state of health.
As you know, Mr Seguro, I did take action and I am keeping a very close eye on the situation.
I shall do as you have just suggested.
Statement by the President
Regarding the election of the Vice-President, which is scheduled to take place during today' s voting time, I can inform you that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has proposed Mrs LalumiÃšre as a candidate.
Outcome of the European Council of 23/24 March 2001 in Stockholm including the situation in the Middle East
The next item is the report by the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the outcome of the European Council of 23 and 24 March in Stockholm, including the situation in the Middle East.
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, when I last addressed this House, it was to present to you the first Commission "Spring Report" to the European Council.
As you will remember, our report takes stock of Europe's progress in implementing the Economic and Social Agenda agreed upon at Lisbon.
The Stockholm Summit was the first summit specifically dedicated to assessing our progress and to setting the priorities for the next 12 months.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, for his firm, calm, enthusiastic chairmanship and organisation of our work at Stockholm.
I also greatly appreciated the opportunity he gave us to meet President Putin and to discuss with him the European Union's partnership with Russia.
This was a very encouraging meeting and confirmed Russia's strategic role.
Indeed, President Putin assured us that Russia and the European Union share common values.
We, in turn, made it clear that we want to help Russia to fully integrate into our community of values; we want to identify the most appropriate means of cooperation, not only on the economy, the environment and energy, but on defence, security and the safeguarding of democratic rights as well.
In this connection, while we welcomed the announcement of another reform programme yesterday, we cannot hide our concern at the way, at the same time, the government is gradually taking control of the television system.
As Prime Minister Persson said, the discussions focused primarily on economic reforms in Russia, but the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia received close attention as well.
As expected, the European Council assured President Trajkovski of its full support for the territorial integrity of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but, at the same time, the Union called upon President Trajkovski to take the grievances of the Albanian minority in his country into consideration.
In any case, it would be a mistake to allow the current crisis in the FYROM to deflect us from our objective of helping the country integrate more closely with the European Union.
Indeed, we are about to pursue that objective further by signing the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I would like to emphasise that the European Union's credibility depends largely on our ability not just to set political and strategic objectives but also to take swift, effective action on the ground.
At the same time, we must strive to bring about long-term stability in the Balkan region, and this means using all the tools available to us to integrate, little by little, the entire region into the European Union.
Milosevic's departure from the scene is an important step forwards in this direction, bringing years of war and hatred to an end.
I would now like to move on to the debate on the Economic and Social Agenda taking place in the European Council.
I agree with Prime Minister Persson when he says that the mood prevailing among the Heads of State or Government at Stockholm was one of rational optimism.
A year ago, at Lisbon, we were still suffering from a sort of inferiority complex before the strength of the US economy.
Now things have changed and we can see that Europe is in a position of strength in three respects.
Firstly, the modernisation of our economy is now underway, secondly, we have a Social Agenda aimed at rejigging the European Social Model while preserving its character, and thirdly, we are making every endeavour to achieve sustainable development which will include the environmental dimension.
The position recently adopted by the United States on the environment is worrying.
Our concern is reflected in a joint letter from Prime Minister Persson and myself to President Bush.
In any event, Europe must continue to act consistently and must take the lead on this highly important issue.
A month ago, before this House, I stressed the problems of the distribution of labour and social exclusion.
It is therefore necessary to step up our efforts to modernise the European Social Model within the framework of the Agenda adopted at Nice.
In this regard, I must stress once again the need to adopt clearer strategies to tackle the issue of our ageing society.
It is with precisely this in mind that the Commission announced its undertaking to issue a Communication on the quality and sustainability of pensions in the light of demographic change.
On the basis of these premises, the Commission urged the European Council to commit the Member States to taking action at the very least in six key sectors in which fresh impetus is needed.
Firstly, we still need to improve skills and training in information technology.
Last Wednesday, the Commission adopted the eLearning Action Plan, which lays down specific measures on teacher training and partnerships between educational establishments, companies and industries.
Secondly, the Galileo programme.
At Stockholm, I outlined the state of play to the European Council, including the fresh undertaking by the private sector to provide immediate funding of EUR 200 million.
This means that the Member States no longer have any reason to hesitate.
In fact, a clear unanimous political commitment has been made by the Heads of State or Government to implementing this project rapidly.
I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate that beating about the bush is no longer acceptable: a project of such strategic importance for all European citizens for the next 20 years can no longer be held up by squabbles over minor details.
Decisions made by Prime Ministers should be implemented by the departmental ministers, who must oversee the practical implementation of projects.
Thirdly, the financial markets.
For some time, the Commission has been arguing for an integrated Europe-wide financial market.
We need a regulatory system which makes it possible for us to keep pace with this rapidly changing market.
I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has emphasised the importance of this sector and its enormous potential for both job creation and reducing costs.
As recommended, a European Securities Committee will be set up, chaired by the Commission.
This body will act as a regulatory committee and assist the Commission in decisions regarding the measures to be adopted to implement practically the legislative acts agreed upon between the Council and Parliament in codecision.
Thus, together, we will be able to push forward to create an integrated securities market, one of the major pieces missing from our internal market. The Commission will therefore be tabling major proposals in this field before the summer and I call upon this House to act on them without delay.
I believe the debate on this should be pursued within the codecision procedure by qualified majority voting.
Fourthly, the Community patent.
Progress in this field has run up against a number of national concerns ranging from language issues to loss of revenue for the Member States' national patent offices.
I have to say that these positions taken up by the Member States seem to run counter to the interests of their own economic operators, who are constantly calling for us to produce a simple, clear, competitively priced Community patent.
I sincerely hope that this situation can be resolved.
Parliament and the Council must take swift, tangible steps to convert the commitments made in Lisbon into action.
Fifthly, the single European sky.
As we all know, a whole series of major proposals is currently blocked until Spain and the United Kingdom come to a bilateral agreement on Gibraltar.
For its part, the Commission will do all it can to help resolve this problem quickly.
Moreover, the two Member States have agreed to resume discussions on the matter.
Sixthly, postal services.
Postal services are to be deregulated by the end of 2001, and the liberalisation of the energy markets will continue on the basis of the extremely clear, precise proposals we have already tabled.
With regard to the demographic challenge, the European Council recognised the importance of ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances, social services, health care and pensions.
In any case, sustainability issues will have to be tackled within the framework of a more general European strategy for sustainable development, which will be one of the main focuses of the Gothenburg Summit in June.
Moreover, in future, the Commission will incorporate sustainable development into its annual spring report.
As of next year's spring summit - and this is a very important point - in fact, the Commission will prepare just one report for each Spring Council, making the preparatory work clearer and more transparent.
In this way, we will, at last, be able to concentrate on political factors rather than technical details. It will also make it easier for the public to understand what is at stake.
Ladies and gentlemen, Stockholm has provided us with a very good basis for action over the next 12 months.
I have said this before and I shall say it again: effective action by the European Union is the only way to win public support for the European project.
The surest way to lose that support is to increase the number of unfulfilled promises.
We have got to close the gap between rhetoric and reality in Europe.
It is all very well and very necessary to agree on targets, to set up task forces and to develop indicators and strategic visions, but what matters is action: action to create jobs and disseminate new skills, action to recruit and train teachers, action in national parliaments to cut red tape, action by governments and industry to invest in people.
The citizens want a Europe that delivers the goods, and the Commission will continue to do so zealously and with total commitment. However, it is up to all of us, to all the institutions and especially this House, to the Member States and the social partners, to ensure that, in the wake of Stockholm, our words are translated into action.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the European Council, our Group welcomes your presence here today.
If you attend plenary after the Gothenburg Summit, as we naturally hope you will, you will have been here three times.
That is a good sign.
I hope that future presidencies will follow your example.
But do not rejoice too quickly; we still have a few words of criticism.
But first let me stress once again how delighted we are that you are here.
We also understand that your presence here - albeit after three months - is the first time you personally will have been involved in the sort of dialogue with the groups of the European Parliament that your foreign minister and Mr Danielsson have already engaged in.
But, hopefully, today marks the start for you.
You still have plenty of opportunity in the remaining three months to implement what Sweden stands for, namely transparency.
We are, in fact, in the process of negotiating access to documents.
Please do something, take charge in the Council so that we achieve a Parliamentary-friendly result, by which I mean a result in the Council which satisfies Parliament.
Please do something in this regard.
The Stockholm Summit - like the Lisbon Summit - used very ambitious language, language which I find somewhat over the top.
A little more modesty would do us good.
We hear talk of the Union as the most competitive and dynamic science-based economic area in the world.
When you choose such ambitious words, then you must expect to be judged by your actions.
You yourself said crucially that you regret the fact that the postal services and energy markets have not been liberalised and that no date has been set for any such liberalisation.
I say to you quite frankly that this was only because a certain Member State, namely France, did not want a date and the Federal Republic of Germany followed suit.
It is a partnership of negation and blockade!
That is not how we see the Franco-German partnership.
It should not be used to block things, it should be used to move Europe forward and that is what I call on the governments of France and Germany to do.
(Applause)
Mr President of the European Council, you are not perceived as someone who is particularly fond of the Community method.
On the contrary, you prefer intergovernmental collaboration.
But this is precisely what happens when we rely solely on intergovernmental collaboration rather than the Community method!
We get blockades.
And it is the small countries which suffer in the end, because the large countries take Europe over, not forward.
(Applause)
We are absolutely delighted that progress has been made on the question of the investment market and financial services.
We are grateful for your commitment, but we also say quite openly - and this is directed at both the Council and the Commission - that we expect the legislative rights of the European Parliament to be safeguarded and for it to be suitably involved in future legislative decisions.
We shall insist on this and these remarks are addressed to both institutions, the Council and the Commission.
A word of criticism on the question of foreign policy problems, Mr President of the European Council.
Yesterday, the widow of Andrey Sakharov, Yelena Bonner, visited our Group.
Just as she arrived, news came in that the last free television station in Russia had been nationalised.
That is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned.
The freedom of the press and media is one of the principles of democracy, in both the European Union and Russia.
What the President of Russia, Mr Putin - whom I am glad you invited - said in front of the television cameras about Chechnya, was an insult both to the people of Chechnya and the dignity of the human race.
We would have welcomed an immediate contradiction from you in front of the media!
(Applause)
We take developments in Russia very seriously because, like you, we believe that stability in 21st century Europe depends on having a strong European Union which can act, on the one hand, and a stable - hopefully democratic - Russia, on the other. Russia is not symbolised solely by the pretty town of St. Petersburg, I agree with you there.
The Russia of the future will also be symbolised by respect for democracy, freedom of the press and human rights and we must make that perfectly clear to the Russian leadership.
I should like to address a further point, namely developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I am delighted that the High Representative, Javier Solana, Commissioner Patten and the foreign minister of Sweden, Anna Lindh, as President-in-Office, are making this a focal point of their work and that - despite all the institutional complications which this entails - they are clearly all working well together.
But that is not the point right now.
The acid test, namely whether or not we help to bring about peace and stability, will be in the former Yugoslavia.
If we fail there, we might as well give up any claim to involvement in world politics!
We must set out our priorities in Europe, especially in the former Yugoslavia.
That brings me to my final point.
The American President, George W. Bush, will be with you in Gothenburg.
Our Group is a close friend and partner of the United States of America and always has been.
And that being so, we feel bound to tell our American allies that we cannot accept America' s refusal to abide by the Kyoto protocol.
We criticise this as emphatically as we know how.
We agree when America demands burden sharing in security and defence policy and for Europe to do more.
But burden sharing also applies to environmental protection.
We cannot leave a few countries to shoulder the responsibility while others shrug it off.
Burden sharing also applies to environmental policy.
(Applause)
I should like to encourage you to speak out loud and clear: we stand for Europe and our values.
If you are again successful - in Gothenburg hopefully even more so than in Stockholm - then we shall all benefit from the success.
I wish this success on both you and us.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the President-in-Office for coming to Parliament for the second time and giving such a clear and concise presentation.
We have seen how good he is with the ball, because the Europe of sport is also a Europe that we have to build together.
I congratulate him on this agreement.
I emphasise that there is a new element in our relationship, which is that you have the opportunity to put the relations between Parliament and the Council on a new footing.
We are still at the level of the Single Act; we have the codecision procedure and we have the common foreign and security policy and we hope to be able to reach an agreement with you for there to be a balanced relationship in the legislative field between the Council and Parliament.
With regard to your report, we see it as a positive step that we are still on the Lisbon road; it is a long road, which you make as you go along, as the poet Antonio Machado said.
For us it is absolutely crucial that there should be a balance between job creation, competitiveness and social cohesion.
You have added a very timely element: that we Europeans need to reflect on our ageing population, develop an immigration policy, and think about pensions.
I believe this is the framework within which we have to work together, and I should especially like to thank the Swedish Presidency for always placing such importance on social cohesion, because I think this expresses a fundamental value for Europeans.
There are a few pending issues: with regard to sustainable development you can count on our full support; on the liberalisation of the capital market, which we believe is necessary, you have supported the Lamfalussy report and have proposed a route which does not include Parliament having the chance of democratically controlling the standards being developed.
Despite that, I believe we are on the right road.
In connection with the liberalisation of services and electricity and gas, the Socialist Group thinks that apart from its inherent worth it brings up a key issue: the power relations in society and the economy.
We must take the citizens into account and the obligation to provide services of general interest.
We do not want to see public monopolies being replaced by private monopolies.
We criticise the United States a lot because President Bush has unilaterally denounced the Kyoto Protocol, but we never ask ourselves why he has done so.
If you look at how the American electoral campaign was financed you will understand why the President of the United States has given in to the interests of the big oil companies: because he received massive donations from them.
This problem faces us too, now that we are debating the status of the political parties.
It is what is called 'soft money' and 'hard money' .
Funding must have limits, and a basic principle of democracy is that there should not be any accumulation of power.
For us it is essential that there should not be unlimited economic powers.
As for our external relations, we are very concerned, not only because the United States has unilaterally denounced the Kyoto Protocol, but also because we notice a growing unilateral outlook in the United States in relation to issues that affect the international community.
This is happening in the Middle East and the Balkans, and I believe it is important that, in this fundamental transatlantic relationship that we Europeans have, we should indicate to our partner that we do not share this view of the shape of international relations.
We should do so at the start of the American Presidency in order to achieve a balanced, positive relationship.
Lastly, allow me to speak of the future of Europe.
The Swedish Presidency has the responsibility of organising a democratic and transparent debate on the future of Europe in the best Swedish tradition.
You have launched the virtual debate on the web page; we did so a week earlier, but we are on the same lines as you.
Yet a debate is something more than just a web page.
A serious, open debate has to be held with civil society, with the social and political forces, but we also have to know how we want to decide and organise the future of Europe.
There is a proposal here that both the Commission and Parliament agree upon, which is to organise a debate in three stages, using a working method inspired by the convention, to culminate in a short, decisive conference.
The Swedish Presidency should consider, support and improve this proposal at the Gothenburg European Council.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, I should like to thank the Swedish Presidency for its skilful leadership and the good start it has made.
We have high expectations in connection with the key issues identified by Sweden, and we hope that Sweden will also make transparency a key issue.
On that point, we can all learn from Sweden.
We must have access to more documents, and it is completely unacceptable that we should sit here in Parliament without knowing what our own ministers are saying and doing in the Council when they legislate.
That is something which must be changed.
We are delighted to see the Swedish foreign minister, who of course comes from a neutral non-aligned country, travelling around with her new travelling companions, the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten and NATO' s former Secretary-General, Mr Solana, and we are delighted when, today, we hear the Swedish Prime Minister speak in favour of a common foreign policy.
We hope that he too will discover the value of using the European institutions, that is to say the Community method, rather than the intergovernmental method he has so far been a little too fond of.
In Macedonia, we sincerely hope for success in ensuring greater equality for the Albanians.
That is the only way to peace.
If only we could also learn to take action before extremists begin to use violence. In that way, it would be the moderates and not the men of violence who obtain the credit for the results.
With regard to enlargement, which is also a Swedish priority, we should like to see still greater commitment on the part of Sweden.
That is more important than anything else for securing peace, freedom and prosperity in Europe.
It is also high time to prepare for the crucial reform of agricultural policy.
We in the Liberal Group hope that you will listen to our colleague, Mr Olsson, who has proposed holding a round-table conference with the new countries on the subject of future agricultural policy.
It is high time we put our minds to the problem.
We wish you every success, Mr Persson, and, regarding the Lisbon process, my fellow Liberal MEP will take the floor later and comment on what you have said.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are some positive elements in the statements by the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, in particular when Mr Persson spoke firmly about the position of the United States regarding the Kyoto Protocol, and when Mr Prodi reminded us of what is really at stake in the Lisbon process, namely an integrated strategy which is economic, social and environmental at the same time.
Having said that, it is very rare, in Parliament, for the plenary session to have in front of it, as it has now, a joint resolution signed by the European Socialists, the ecologists and the European United Left as well.
The significance of this resolution is a clear political signal to both the Council and the Commission.
It is based, Messrs Persson and Prodi, on the established fact that although the European economy is undoubtedly competitive, at the moment it is neither sustainable, nor does it have sufficient solidarity.
This is not a statement before the event: a number of indicators are already set to red, whether in the field of sustainable development, in transport, in energy - not to mention the common agricultural policy - or in employment, where most of the new jobs being created are vulnerable, and where not enough of the added value is accounted for by wages.
You only have to read the latest report from the European Environment Agency.
We therefore need to change direction on development, so as to make it more sustainable and give it more solidarity.
This is the real challenge of the twenty-first century, and it is on this subject that I should like, briefly, to make a few proposals.
Mr Bolkestein, what are we doing about company tax and the Primarolo group?
There must be limits, Mr Persson, to increasing competitiveness: we must not forget our public service obligations.
Mr Solbes Mira, substantial public investment is necessary to meet the Lisbon objectives, particularly on education and training, but also, for example, on transport and the rational use of energy.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, if the social dialogue founders on the issue of temporary work, it is the Commission' s responsibility to propose legislation that will allow people to live their lives with dignity on what they earn.
I heard a woman - a worker at a Danone factory - call for solidarity by saying 'people should boycott Danone' s products' .
I think it would be more reasonable for the European Union to adopt legislation imposing social and ecological obligations on companies.
Our future depends on it too.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, other members of my Group will be speaking on various aspects of the Stockholm European Council.
For my part, I shall stick to just one subject, which should, in principle, have been central to the work of the summit: the subject of employment.
The ink was not even dry on the final declaration by the Fifteen, in which you reiterated, and I quote, 'the goal of full employment' , and in which you welcomed the initiatives taken by businesses to promote corporate social responsibility, when suddenly, like a bombshell, came the announcements that 1 780 jobs were being axed by Danone and that Marks & Spencer were closing all their stores outside the United Kingdom.
These are just the latest examples, so far, of shareholder value, in other words, shareholder law, and just like Michelin, Ericsson, Nokia, Telefonica and so many others, they illustrate everything that is no longer acceptable.
I ask you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are you going to do about these company directors who so brazenly thumb their noses at your declared intentions?
The Commission, you write, in the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit, and I quote, will 'present in June 2001 a Green Paper on corporate social responsibility' and will 'encourage a wide exchange of ideas with a view to promoting further initiatives in this area' .
All well and good, but will you now, in the light of these new facts, be defining precisely what the Commission' s mandate will be?
And will we, Parliament, be waiting, arms at the ready?
I suggest that we should decide to create, perhaps within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a new permanent body - let us call it a 'subcommittee' , since that is the sort of language we use - which will be responsible for monitoring the strategies of major companies in Europe, a subcommittee open to contributions from trades union organisations, works committees, consumers' associations and elected representatives.
We could thus help to create, at our level, an effective monitoring device, which would be able to put some meat on the bones of the intermediate employment objectives that the Stockholm European Council has just set itself.
We already know who the first employees will be: those of the French agri-food group that I have just mentioned, whose shareholders have just seen a 17% rise in the net profit from their shares, and those of the British chain whose shares have just gone to blazes on the London stock exchange.
If we ourselves take action to demolish the divine right of the big companies to sack people as they see fit, we shall, after all, be doing nothing more than defending, by our actions, a European project that is worthy of the name, and a Parliament that is closer to the people.
Madam President, the Stockholm Summit was hardly the greatest diplomatic achievement with regard to the development of the European Union; however, the business conducted at the Stockholm Council did certainly reflect the reality of what is happening in the European Union at this time.
European Union leaders demonstrated solidarity in the face of the problem of foot-and-mouth disease, which threatens the European agricultural sector at this time.
European leaders acted as a force for peace in the Balkans by offering timely support for the Macedonian Government and there was a full political and economic dialogue with the Russian President, Mr Putin.
Some progress was certainly made towards achieving the targets set at Lisbon last year to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010.
The Member States of the European Union are fully committed to the goal of full employment and we also see the achievement of this objective as an important way of meeting the challenge of an ageing population in Europe.
The European Union employment rate targets, which have to be reached by the year 2010, mean that steady progress has to be made over this period if these objectives are to be met.
Increasing employment rates will demand the active implementation of employment policies as foreseen under the European employment guidelines.
We do not want to build a two-tier Europe Union, a European Union of the haves and a European Union of the have-nots.
We want to ensure that all the citizens of the Union are given opportunities to integrate fully into the workplace and to this extent we must ensure the intensification of training and education programmes for those without skills as well as putting in place retraining opportunities for the existing workforce.
Certainly, much progress has been made in the last 12 months with regard to educating and training the European workforce in the benefits which lie open for us all from the use of the Internet and related e-commerce opportunities.
The European Council did address the demographic challenge of an ageing population of which people of working age constitute an even smaller part.
The issue of how best the Union is going to deal with future public and private pension programmes is a serious matter, which must be addressed by all EU Member States as a matter of priority.
Agreement was not reached on how best to liberalise the gas and electricity sectors in Europe.
However, the structures do exist for addressing these outstanding issues on the basis of cooperation between the Member States of the Union.
On this latter point, any further liberalisation of postal service operations in Europe must be fair and must be balanced and postal services play an important social and economic function in rural towns and villages within the Union.
I certainly will not support a structure whereby postal services are liberalised in Europe and this only results in the quality of the postal service operations being diminished within the territories of the Union.
I certainly will not support a situation whereby postal service operations will be cherry-picked by private operators, servicing only key lucrative urban areas which will benefit from such reform programmes at the expense of the rural parts.
Finally, certainly an achievement of the Council at Stockholm was the agreement to fast-track the development of a common approach for the regulation of financial services within the Union.
The implementation of this plan has been subject to delays, which have prevented Europe, in the past, from taking full advantage of the benefits of the single market.
Madam President, the Swedish Presidency began well but will now be remembered for having introduced more secrecy and less democracy.
The Lamfalussy report transfers legislative power from elected representatives in open assemblies to officials behind the closed doors of committee rooms.
Sweden has identified transparency as a key issue and has a culture of transparency from which we can all learn. In the negotiations concerning transparency, however, Sweden has now accepted a new internal set of regulations producing more secrecy instead of more transparency.
On 19 March, the Council also decided that future relaxations in the rules of confidentiality must be adopted by qualified majority voting and not, as is the case at present, by a simple majority.
Thus, it will never be possible for the rules to be relaxed as long as Spain, France and Germany do not want them to be.
It is those three countries which are the villains in the negotiations concerning transparency.
This is something of which the public in our countries should be aware.
How can a German, Green foreign minister accept responsibility for secrecy?
The Council' s new rules on confidentiality are clearly unlawful.
The Council cannot itself alter the Treaty' s regulations from simple to qualified majority voting.
The new rules directly interfere with the section in the Treaty of Amsterdam promising new rules on transparency.
Nor has the Swedish Presidency submitted the rules to the European Parliament.
We must call upon our fellow MEPs from Spain, France and Germany to strike a blow for transparency now.
Those three countries have placed the Swedish Presidency in such a humiliating position that it is having to betray its own key concerns regarding transparency and deliver secrecy instead.
We still have an EU in which neither the ombudsman, the Court of Auditors nor the Committee on Budgetary Control can obtain all documents for perusal.
To that extent, we need the commendable Swedish rules on the right of access to documents and the freedom to provide information.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, President Prodi has communicated his concern about the situation of the press, of the mass media in Russia.
In my view, the President of the Commission is crying over spilt milk.
He is lamenting something which is the result of a policy that he himself helped to develop.
This European Union policy on Russia is a policy of tolerance, a policy of prostituting our values, Mr President.
What is happening now to the mass media has already happened in Central Asia in those ex-Soviet countries in which President Putin is re-establishing a postcolonial policy, a region which the European Union does not see the strategic importance of, just as it does not recognise the strategic importance of the Caucasus region.
I would like to thank Group Chairman, Mr Poettering, who voiced the concerns of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
However, I would urge Mr Poettering to talk to Mr Oostlander, who is the author of a report which, in the main, follows the line taken by the policy proposed by the Commission, a policy entirely focused on the fact that the Union's first priority must be to guarantee supply of Russian gas and oil, with the development and consolidation of the Rule of Law in Russia relegated to second place.
Yesterday, in this very Chamber, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Posselt and I asked Commissioner Nielson for the umpteenth time to produce a policy on Chechnya which is, at the very least, a humanitarian policy, Mr President.
For months, or rather for a year and a half now, we have been urging Commissioner Nielson to go to Chechnya. Just to go to Chechnya, nothing more.
For his part, Commissioner Nielson has told us repeatedly that the situation there is such as to make a visit impossible.
Yesterday, in view of the Commissioner's concern, I asked him to go to Georgia and Azerbaijan to open hospitals at least in these areas, which are not directly under Russian influence, as requested by the Chechen Minister for Health, Mr Umarkambiev, so that, at least, the Chechen people could receive health care instead of having to pay millions of dollars for treatment in a Baku hospital.
Commissioner Nielson made no response.
Mr President of the Commission, I have run out of patience, and I call upon you formally to remove Commissioner Nielson's mandate for humanitarian aid.
Commissioner Nielson is a bureaucrat, Mr President: his travel availability is already booked up for the next four or five years. He pays a quick visit here and there to make sure that the Commission's development cooperation policy is running smoothly, but he has no real time for genuine humanitarian issues.
I am not asking you to kick him out of the Commission, just to take this portfolio away from him and appoint someone else who will pay genuine attention to these issues and who will, at last, do something about the question of Chechnya.
What is currently happening in Chechnya is an outrage.
There is absolutely no difference between events there and what took place in Bosnia, in Kosovo, incidents at which, after years and years, Parliament and the European Union eventually protested.
We must make political investments, Mr President-in-Office.
Our humiliating treatment of the members of President Mashkadov's government must stop.
It is unthinkable that a minister of the Mashkadov government should have to apply for a visa and do so month after month. It is unthinkable that the European Union should not be able to grant a permanent residence authorisation to those whom you will have to visit in the future and persuade to sit round a negotiating table with the Russians.
These are our consultative partners of tomorrow, and all we can do is humiliate them.
And all this while the US government welcomes - as it did last week - the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Akhmadov.
Territorial integrity is not a theory: it is a practical concept in which integrity means that the entire territory is guaranteed, not that anything goes.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has set itself the ambitious target of achieving full employment in Europe by 2010.
However, the Council should be clear on one thing: jobs can only be created if economic reforms are implemented consistently.
What was begun in Lisbon and announced in Nice was not continued in Stockholm.
In Stockholm, the brakes were applied.
In this sense, the lack of agreement on Community patents is disappointing.
The absence of a European patent is a powerful brake on the European economy, as has been confirmed in numerous talks with American researchers.
If we want a Europe which promotes private commitment, risk taking and entrepreneurship, then these long overdue liberalisation measures must be taken.
Competition-distorting aid must be prevented as and where possible and an internal market for services must at last become a reality.
Madam President, I am pleased to be able to welcome the Swedish Prime Minister once more and see him here together with several of the Swedish ministers.
In the Swedish media the Prime Minister has summed up the meeting in Stockholm as an ideal example of a successful European summit.
Considering the meagre results, one might wonder what an unsuccessful summit looks like.
For those of us who read the newspapers and the conclusions, it is uncertain whether anything happened other than President Putin visiting the summit as a guest.
The 15-page conclusion document mainly describes decisions intended to be taken at a later date.
It is true that it was decided to start competing on which country has the most children in childcare and that the Commission will complete a project which is already underway.
No concrete date was set for deregulation of the electricity and gas markets in the Union.
The Swedish Presidency has completely given up on the question of liberalisation of postal services and, as we know, nothing came of the Community Patent idea.
Football was played for longer than the question which most concerns Europe today was discussed, namely the agriculture crisis.
I think that the Council should evaluate and consider what role these summits should have.
Are they to play an important institutional role to resolve and pass decisions on important questions which have achieved little progress at other councils, or should they be developed into gimmicks with ever weaker and more toned down conclusions?
It is worrying that the Lisbon Process, which got off to a good start a year ago, is now being watered down.
The upcoming Spanish Presidency has an important task ahead in ensuring that Lisbon comes to mean something concrete and is not just words on paper.
The situation is precisely as the Council' s acting president admits: Work is not progressing sufficiently fast to maintain the rate of change.
If you listen to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, you understand that the social democrats in Europe are not having such an easy time of it at the moment.
The European economy flagging is no reason to stop the reform.
Instead one has to put in more effort to be able to achieve competitiveness and increased wellbeing.
I have two questions for the Council' s acting president.
One point in the conclusions addresses the upcoming WTO negotiations, and I concur with that stated.
I would therefore like to repeat the question which was dismissed last time as being far too national, and which concerns the Tobin tax.
Has the presidency any view on the Tobin tax or shall we interpret the Swedish ministers' publicly consorting with the Attac movement as indicating their position on an international tax on currency transactions?
My second question concerns enlargement.
It has been said that the enlargement negotiations are progressing and are one of the most urgent priorities of the presidency.
Will you succeed with your goals?
What is actually meant by a 'political breakthrough' in the negotiations?
Will the presidency at the summit in Gothenburg be able to state the EU' s point of view on the sensitive and difficult areas remaining so that the negotiations and a conclusion to them will become possible for the most successful candidate countries during 2001?
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Parliament welcomes the onset of spring at the Stockholm Summit.
Because one thing is clear: the spring summit will become standard practice in the future, so that we not only bank on a future-orientated, knowledge-based society, but can also actually live in it.
We need the ambitious strategy of change decided in Lisbon.
We need to make it tighter and more dynamic and Stockholm has added another brick to this edifice.
And rightly so, given the jitters in the world economy, the shadow being cast over growth in the European economy and the crashes on the stock exchanges.
The successes of the year 2000, with record growth, healthy finances, the lowest inflation and interest rates and 2.5 million new jobs, should not be underestimated.
They say something about the need to continue the process of open coordination and link economic, employment and social policies.
We must hold on to this, otherwise there will be no further progress.
We must also anchor this in specific basic aspects of economic policy for the year 2001.
We must be able to go on reaping benefits here, even if Europe has to overcome other weaknesses, such as excessively low, interrupted growth, unacceptable unemployment and the exclusion of too many people.
The European summit is rightly interested in economic reform, properly functioning markets and regulation, where having qualitative yardsticks is in people' s interests.
We must therefore welcome the fact that the summit was not just a liberalisation and deregulation summit but that, at the same time, it is banking on pan-European regulation, where such regulation is needed in the interest of universal services, fair distribution and consumer protection.
Even the promotion of entrepreneurial initiative, with special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises and the venture capital and start-up finance which is vital to them, is in its infancy.
And the EU summit rightly took account of the importance of research, innovation and new technologies in creating jobs and prosperity.
In this context, we must clearly recognise that the analysis and use of public funding and the quality of such funding - including state aid - must be assessed more closely for its impact on employment.
I think we need to invest still more in people and better quality jobs.
And a further change of tack from a passive to an active employment policy, over and above the previous objectives of the European employment strategy, is still on the agenda.
Mr President-in-Office, the presidency is promising more democracy and transparency in economic policy.
But where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets?
The European Parliament wants speed and flexibility in the legislative area - just as you do - and welcomes the Lamfalussy report.
But we insist on full transparency and proper symmetry between the institutions in the codecision procedure.
We here in the European Parliament want the rights which the Council already enjoys.
Help us to secure them. You too, Mr President of the Commission, can help to make this possible.
Just one more thing: we also want more democracy and a real partnership when the economic policy guidelines are decided.
Both the Commission and the Council really can help in this regard and I call on them to do so.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Group member, Mr Haarder, announced in his intervention, I am going to focus on the specific aspects of the follow-up to the Lisbon European Council.
In this respect our Group is critical, as it sees that the results are poor.
In Lisbon what was agreed upon was a process of economic liberalisation, a process of structural reforms, the consolidation of the single European market and a move towards a single market for services, with the ambition of making the European economy the most competitive internationally by 2010, without, of course, giving up the social dimension or the levels of well-being that characterise the societies belonging to the Union.
At this European Council, however, we have found that the individual interests of Member States have blocked necessary processes of liberalisation.
Others, through internal disputes, as the Swedish Prime Minister has said in his capacity as President of the Council, have not been able to reach the necessary agreement for the single European sky, and so it has not been possible to turn what were good proposals at Lisbon into a reality.
That is why our assessment is critical and we think the results are poor.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, if Europe wants to be more significant in the world, it has to increase in size, but Europe must also be more democratic and more transparent.
This is the view taken by many fellow MEPs.
I would add that the Europe of the Member States is not sufficiently European.
There is also the Europe of the regions which remains hidden away.
For example, you mentioned a shortage in the workforce, but there are regions in Europe which have unemployment of 6% or even of 16% and 20%.
This is where Europe, and also the Member States, fail to come up to scratch.
Additionally, we need a bigger Europe in order to translate the Union' s weight into political clout for the benefit of stability and peace.
We have already mentioned Macedonia.
It is necessary for everyone to be aware that the existence of second-class citizens always leads to difficulties.
I would like to conclude by making an observation with regard to the Middle East, where an escalating conflict is claiming victims in Palestine on a daily basis.
We too have worked hard for peace but, every day, we watch it being increasingly shot to tatters.
We are, in fact, a major donor to the Palestinians and have granted Israel privileged relations.
But we are lacking in commitment to the right to self-determination on the part of the Palestinians.
We do not exert enough pressure to obtain peace.
Mr President, in my view the emphasis at the Stockholm Summit lay on developing the internal market, in other words on economic liberalisation as stated earlier.
The social issues, particularly the question of unemployment, were hardly touched upon.
GÃ¶ran Persson, it was the intention that the meeting was to focus on employment and employment policy.
However, there are two different forms of employment policy.
The first is about increasing provision on the labour market by increasing the labour force, i.e. increasing the employment rate. The second is about reducing the number of unemployed.
These are two different areas of policy.
In Stockholm you devoted yourselves to expanding the labour force by adding new groups to the labour market.
This was to be achieved by reducing the number of women at home in Europe and by retaining the elderly on the labour market for a few more years.
I have nothing against measures to increase the available workforce but no one can claim that they provide any direct benefit for the unemployed.
In fact it is rather the reverse, such that the 14 - 15 million people who are unemployed face increasing competition for jobs by the addition of new groups at the same time as wage-related pressures increase.
It would have been possible to combine both these areas of employment policy, within which the aim is both to increase overall employment and combat unemployment, by also proposing a reduction in normal working hours to 35 hours a week, or six hours a day.
It has been claimed that a cut in working hours would not result in new jobs but this does not apply to low-paid jobs where there is a very clear link between reduced working hours and more jobs.
Cutting working hours would also benefit all those who are already in work and make it easier for them to combine work and family life.
I would like to see actual measures for the unemployed.
It is not yet too late as the Swedish Presidency still has a few months left to run.
I would like to see measures specifically focused on those who are unemployed and which help them here and now.
Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the words of the President of the Commission - moreover, the press was informative on the matter - and I would like to clarify one point.
President Prodi has rightly stressed that the glass is half full and half empty, that some results have been achieved, but not all.
He is right.
However, I would like him to summon all the determination and courage which he has displayed on other occasions and make it clear that the single currency is going to come into force next year and that, if certain large-scale reforms which should have been dealt with at Stockholm are not completed before then, we will be in danger of having a currency but no control over the economy, with the consequences which are already apparent in Europe and the world.
The issues of energy, liberalisation of energy and the European patent are fundamental.
President Prodi, in my view, you would be performing a great service for Europe if, with great courage and determination, you were to declare openly - which I am sure you will do - that these are essential reforms that must be carried out without delay in the interests of all the European countries.
Mr President, a political paradox of the highest order.
This is how we can best describe the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia this coming Monday in Luxembourg.
This is evident from the continuing efforts by both parties to prevent an ethnic division of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM.
We need to see Europe' s wish in that light, namely the wish for the leaders of all parties represented in the Macedonian Parliament - including Slavonic and Albanian Macedonians, therefore - to grace that ceremony with their presence.
The symbolism is crystal clear.
In that way, Macedonia' s entire political forum would demonstrate that it is choosing to walk a peaceful, European course.
Is this symbolism, employed by Europe, misleading and, therefore, dangerous?
The European Council' s lucid explanation in Stockholm seems to contradict this negative interpretation.
This applies equally to the busy shuttle diplomacy on the part of Mr Solana and Mr Patten vis-Ã -vis Macedonia and Kosovo.
The role of NATO in this European policy on crisis management is unmistakable.
However, this encouraging note is not in accordance with the press information I received yesterday.
According to that notification, Commissioner Patten has asked for six extra KFOR infantries to reinforce the border control between Kosovo and Macedonia, a request which is, in fact, entirely in line with the European Council' s declaration in Stockholm.
According to that press report, however, only three countries have apparently responded to Mr Patten' s request.
If Europe is to make every effort to prevent a Yugoslavian scenario in Macedonia, European and American levers will really need to be deployed to the best possible effect.
Mr President, in economic and social terms, the Stockholm Council set itself a major strategic objective: to define the main conditions necessary in order to turn Europe into a competitive area with full employment.
Yet the Council' s conclusions give a rather odd double impression of unrestrained intervention on the one hand and abstention on the other.
As far as multidirectional interventions are concerned, there is hardly any subject in the economic and social field which has not been mentioned, even when there was nothing new to say about it.
This makes it hard to identify the main thrusts, and in particular it is no longer possible to distinguish between what is Europe' s responsibility and what is the Member States' responsibility.
