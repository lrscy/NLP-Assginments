The positive experience of Marie Curie Actions has appropriately been revisited and will continue, breathing life into a project that aims for excellence in the form of added value: it will have an impact on the organisation of the European research area.
We also envisage collaboration and equal opportunities between the public and private sectors.
Last but not least, intellectual property, towards which the Council has behaved a little like Pilate with Jesus of Nazareth: it has taken up the idea and turned it into a general rule.
No, that is not how things should be done.
If we truly wish to motivate researchers, we must give them a cast-iron guarantee that their rights over the intellectual property that they have created will be protected.
This is possible - I shall insist on it when I make the request to the Commission and the Council - through contractual clauses under civil law that would protect the results obtained by research and by the individual researcher.
To achieve excellence it is necessary to motivate people; and to attract researchers from all parts of the world it is necessary to offer attractive conditions.
To combine quantity and quality and produce excellence in basic and technological research, as the People programme and the Framework Programme 7 intend to do, it is necessary to join up all the links and address all outstanding problems, to protect industry and private investments by stimulating them without extinguishing that driving force: the human being that is and remains the heart and mind of research.
I thank you all for your kind attention, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs - particularly Mr Chichester and my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who, by voting unanimously for my report, were sending out a strong signal to the Commission and the Council rather than acknowledging my modest contribution.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of over a year and a half's intensive parliamentary debate, we are about to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme and the specific programmes associated with it, and I am, today, grateful first of all, of course to our rapporteur Mr Buzek for his dedicated work, but also to all the other Members of this House who have made their own contributions to the framework programme and to the specific programmes.
As rapporteur on the specific programme 'Ideas', I am, of course, particularly pleased and honoured that the Seventh Framework Programme, or, specifically, the 'Ideas' programme, sees the long-awaited inauguration of the European Research Council.
Why do we need a European Research Council?
The intention is that it should reinforce basic research in Europe, thus closing a substantial gap in European research funding, which has, up to now, concentrated mainly on applied research, even though almost all the innovative and groundbreaking developments have come about as a result of basic research; one needs think only of such everyday things as digital cameras or CD players, which would have been impossible without scientists such as Max Planck or Albert Einstein to lay the theoretical foundations.
The European Research Council, the ERC, needs to be a success if it is to attract leading researchers to Europe or to keep our own top European researchers here.
If it is to do that, it must be able to do its work independently; this is something that we in this House have repeatedly emphasised, and the Commissioner has also endorsed the idea in his outline.
What that means is that, in this European Research Council, it must be the researchers whose views count, the researchers who decide which basic research projects should get funding.
It really is a new thing for politicians to say that they are going to keep out of the decisions as to what is worthy of support, and instead leave the decision-making to the research community, that is to say, to the researchers whom we vote onto the Council.
I am also particularly proud that we have decided - or rather will, I hope, decide tomorrow - that the sole criterion for the spending of money by the European Research Council should be that of scientific excellence.
This House has insisted from the very outset that the European Research Council should not be a pocket version of the DG Research.
I trust that the Commissioner will understand when I say that I have nothing against the Commission, but, if the Research Council really is to be something new, the people who decide what it does must not be politicians, or, indeed the highly-qualified officials in DG Research, but researchers - and, yes, I know I am repeating myself, but I do think this is important.
We in this House have had a hand in pointing the Council in the right direction, but, following an initial stage in which the Council is to be administered by the Commission, consideration is to be given to whether it is actually capable of operating on its own.
Once that evaluation has been carried out, we will be able to come to a decision on the Council's final structure.
I am very grateful that we were assured, in the trilogue, that this House would have the power of codecision as to what the Council's final structure should actually be like.
We also saw it as important that the Research Council, when it starts work on 1 January 2007, should not become a closed shop, in other words, that it should be open and transparent and work in an open and transparent way.
Our House has brought in a number of amendments to that effect, including stipulations that members of its scientific board should be elected in accordance with a rotation system, and we have, of course, by capping the Research Council's administrative budget, ensured that, at the end of the day, the money goes where it should go, that is, to the researchers, rather than being spent on admin.
The Budget allocated to the European Research Council - amounting in any case to EUR 7.5 billion over seven years - ought, then, to be a good basis on which it can begin its work.
The Research Council has what is needed in order for it to become the model of European success that we need, a beacon for European research.
We also need something that has nothing to do with the Research Council.
Tomorrow we have to send out an appeal to the effect that Europe's research community has to be one of the things whereby it identifies itself.
Europe is a peaceful community; it is perceived as a community of values, a community founded upon the rule of law, with the European internal market as well as the economic and monetary union.
There is only one thing that we lack, and Mr Busquin, with his European Research Area, really has opened up the right path. We must also become a European knowledge community, a European community of researchers.
If the Research Council, the programmes, and that on which we are to vote tomorrow help to bring us closer to that, then we in this House will all have done a good piece of work.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally wish to thank the Finnish Presidency, Mr Buzek and all my other colleagues.
I must of course give special thanks to Mr PotoÄnik, above all for all the work we carried out together on the basis of his suggestions for Framework Programme 7.
I should like in particular to take note of his solemn promise to exclude any proposal involving infrastructure and firms that operate contrary to international law; and also of his solemn commitment to an integral element of Framework Programme 7 concerning the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research.
We have done some important work together and have tried to do what is best for Europe.
Framework Programme 7 offers us an excellent opportunity to set out the far-reaching effort to be made to regain our competitiveness at the level of the whole European Union, by fully implementing the Lisbon scenario.
It is therefore appropriate to emphasise that this Framework Programme 7 demonstrates the pressing need to confront the question of research and development at EU level and should therefore be seen as the core of a socio-economic development policy for the EU.
At present, competition involves actors operating at a continental - or at any rate regional-continental - level, and clearly goes beyond the single Member State.
We must therefore pursue excellence on a European scale: that is the goal set by Framework Programme 7.
All this is what we have been trying to do at European level.
My insistence on this theme has been very kindly emphasised by the Commissioner: our collaboration has had some very personal and extremely important effects, which give one the feeling that for research purposes there must be widespread involvement by all business concerns, especially at European level, otherwise we shall not manage to reach our objective.
Framework Programme 7 stands for our awareness that without a genuine common effort, we shall have to give up the idea of having manufacturing and development in Europe.
This is the substance of what we are discussing today and this has been how we have all been personally involved in the enterprise.
Clearly, certain things have had to be given up, but in the end some important work has been produced.
I should like to clarify certain points concerning the Capacities programme.
In my view the interconnections of Framework Programme 7 at regional level, in other words the ability to put together in synergy the resources of Framework Programme 7 and the Structural Funds, with the possibility of involving the regions in investment, could be truly productive in the future, both in research infrastructure and in the regions of knowledge and the regional districts of production.
We therefore have, in my opinion, a range of instruments that together will help us to identify the approach that best fits all the issues on our agenda.
I should also like to recall in particular the need to acquaint our citizens more closely with science at a regional level, as well as something that for me has become an idÃ©e fixe during my first few years in Parliament: teaching people to evaluate risk as an instrument of political choice, by involving citizens in a sense of overall awareness.
That is what we have done, as effectively as we possibly could, and it is something to be satisfied about.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Buzek, Mr Busquin, the Council and the Commission for the important work they have done, and also my fellow rapporteurs for the other specific programmes, because, ladies and gentlemen, in this plenary sitting we will finally approve the Seventh Framework Programme, which defines the European Union's scientific policy for the next seven years.
This is a fundamental issue within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, since, if our objective is to be a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, research, technological development and innovation are undoubtedly the main tools for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness.
Our main objective has been to respond to the great challenges faced by our science, technology and innovation in order to reduce the gap separating us from our competitors.
Our work has not been without difficulties, particularly following the agreement on the financial perspective which reduced our initial economic horizon.
I believe that, on the whole, we can feel satisfied today, however.
As rapporteur for the Specific Programme 'Cooperation', I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all of our fellow Members for their contributions, which have been crucial to the drafting of this report.
The Specific Programme 'Cooperation', with a budget of EUR 32 500 million for the next seven years, represents 65% of the total budget of the seventh Framework Programme, which is a significant increase on the previous Framework Programme.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the world's largest international cooperation programme for R+D. This programme is intended to make the European Union a leader in strategic scientific and technological fields, by supporting cooperation amongst universities, research centres, companies and institutions, both within the European Union and with third countries.
To this end, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy's proposal takes up ten major priority areas which offer a significant degree of continuity from the sixth Framework Programme, though improvements in approaches are proposed that we are convinced will provide research groups with easier access to programmes.
The final text adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy which we are presenting to this plenum for its final approval essentially endorses the approach proposed by the European Commission.
It includes powerful tools for stimulating private investment in research, though it calls for greater parliamentary control throughout the execution of the Programme.
It also extends and stresses certain fields of research that were absent or not sufficiently represented in the initial proposal, and emphasises a series of horizontal structural aspects of the Programme that we believe to be essential.
In this regard, I would like to stress that our proposal offers considerable progress in terms of the organisation of mechanisms to guarantee the participation of SMEs in all of the Programme's actions.
A minimum objective of participation of 15% of the total budget has been set for them and the maximum contribution of all of the Community institutions, including the European Investment Bank, has been sought for the funding of projects in which SMEs participate.
Our proposal makes the principle of scientific and technological cohesion one of the Programme's objectives and it points to the need to seek the maximum degree of complementarity and synergy with other national and regional funds.
We are calling for mechanisms for establishing joint approaches to scientific and technological issues of interest to more than one field and also mechanisms for dealing with the complex problems of the thematic priorities for which a merely uni-disciplinary approach is not sufficient to produce significant scientific advances.
Many aspects relating to joint technological initiatives have been improved as a result of the passage through this Parliament of the Specific Programme 'Cooperation'.
These new instruments of technical and financial management and of participation in the Specific Programme 'Cooperation' required mechanisms for ensuring compliance with the criteria set for their constitution and transparency in the selection of priorities; they also required sound and efficient management.
This report contains proposals for making progress on all of these aspects.
I shall not go into the details of each of the thematic priorities - a lot of work has been done - but I would like to end by saying that I am one of those in favour of continuing with the funding of research with supernumerary human embryos in their early stages of development, since they are important to progress on infertility treatments and knowledge of the causes of congenital and degenerative diseases, and also to finding alternatives to animal testing.
Ladies and gentlemen, through the work we have done over many months, we have tried to contribute to resolving some of the main problems faced by our science and technology.
I believe that the result, the fruit of the greatest possible consensus, can be described as satisfactory.
I would therefore like once again to thank all of my fellow Members for their contributions, as well as the European Commission, in particular Commissioner PotoÄnik, who is here today, for his constant help and cooperation.
rapporteur. - (ES) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr PotoÄnik, for your open and cooperative attitude; thank you, Mr Buzek and all of the other shadow rapporteurs.
We are all members of the seventh Framework Programme family, and in our family there has been a long and difficult birth, with little in the way of healthcare resources, but the baby has been born healthy, though a little under-weight.
When will we grasp that European research is even more important than agricultural subsidies and building motorways?
That is not a rhetorical question; we must ask ourselves the stark question of what the priority is for the future of Europe, this Europe that wants to act, but cannot.
We have set certain challenges in this Framework Programme and to a large extent we have covered them.
We have made some progress in terms of opening up science, in terms of achieving the maximum transfer of scientific knowledge and technical information and supporting all incentives that promote the transfer of technologies, so that companies, civil society and universities can develop bridges between research and the necessary economic and technological renewal in our current European societies, thanks to this communication and thanks to the rules on the obligatory publication of results, the promotion of free software or the obligation, for example, to promote interoperability; we have made some progress, but we must continue to make more.
We must also ask ourselves whether science is going to be by and for the people, because the opinions of researchers must be in line with those people who are not necessarily experts.
In this regard, we should welcome the support and the important work of the science sector and society in this programme, the financial strengthening of this field and the fact that the programme is being opened up to civil society organisations.
I also wonder whether small is beautiful in European science, because we all talk about SMEs, but is that empty rhetoric or a firm commitment?
SMEs create the majority of stable employment and are a source of economic stability.
The support for initiatives such as that of creating clusters of small enterprises within the technological platforms is very much to be welcomed; it is very important that we have established a framework of 15% for small enterprises within all of the programmes.
This is a challenge that we must fulfil; let us see whether we can turn our rhetoric into results.
Will there be less bureaucracy and more transparency in this Programme?
Will there be clear and intelligible public access to information, which must be guaranteed for all processes of evaluation and funding of European Union projects?
The time has come for the European Commission to reduce the expensive administrative procedures, since they lead to the marginalisation of small research groups and small companies and NGOs, which are unable to afford them because of their size.
We are demanding that they be simplified as soon as possible.
We want no more excuses.
The time has come to act.
This Framework Programme has also meant a return to basics and therefore, with the establishment of the European Research Council, this Framework Programme will provide strong public support for basic research with medium- and long-term social and environmental objectives, led by renowned researchers who will defend their autonomy.
We must ensure that this autonomy is respected by everybody, by both Parliament and the Commission.
We Greens wonder whether, in view of the energy crisis, we will have the science for a good climate, which is what we need.
It is very positive that there should be financial support for renewable energies and energy efficiency and that it has been increased by 250%, but at the same time we regret that it is still only a third of the sum received by nuclear research as a whole.
We are also pleased that, with regard to social sciences, which are also sciences, this Programme offers firm support for socioeconomic research and multidisciplinary research.
In general terms, we believe this Programme to be positive; cooperation amongst everybody is going to lead the European Union in the direction we need to take if we are to have longer and happier lives and if Europe is to play a more important role in the world.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have done it at last; the Seventh Framework Programme on Research is on the way, and, over the next seven years, the European Union will be investing a total of EUR 54 billion in research.
Once we have adopted the specific programmes tomorrow, we - in this House, in the Commission, and the Council - will be able to look back, with our consciences clear, on almost two years worth of hard work.
I would like particularly to thank all those Members with whom I have had the privilege of working, and in whom I had complete trust, as rapporteur on the Joint Research Centre's nuclear research activities over the past few months, and Commissioner PotoÄnik as well.

We have not, unfortunately, achieved all the things we set ourselves - we have not, for example, managed to double expenditure on research - but the marked increase - of 50% - in the budget in comparison with the Sixth Framework Programme is a step in the right direction.
This increase took some tough negotiating with the Council, and sends a positive message to our research institutes and will - it is to be hoped - foster a mood of optimism, but we missed by a mile the twofold increase for which we had hoped, and other economic areas in the world show considerably higher rates of increase in research spending.
We will then fall still further behind in comparison with the USA and Japan.
China and other states are continuing to catch us up.
The consequences of that will hit us hard and also leave their mark on prosperity, the labour market and social peace.
Europe's research programme is not, to be sure, the most extensive in the world, but it is one of the smartest, and the same can be said, in the nuclear research field, of the Joint Research Centre, on which I am reporting.
As Commissioner PotoÄnik rightly pointed out in his introductory remarks, the Joint Research Centre is set to take over a crucial moderating role in many key areas of nuclear activity.
One of these, firstly, is nuclear safety.
Member States have different views on the use to which nuclear energy should be put; some of them are building new nuclear power stations, while others are not.
Some are researching into new fourth-generation reactors, whilst others are not.
These are things on which they are perfectly entitled to decide for themselves, but safety is not bounded by national borders, and that is why the Joint Research Centre must ensure that the necessary know-how is available at European level.
Secondly, there is also the monitoring of security.
Recent developments at international level have made issues of non-proliferation of nuclear technology and weaponry even more acutely important.
These are pressing questions, and Europe must come up with an answer to them, so I am delighted to see that the Seventh Research Programme is to give a shot in the arm to the Institute for Transuranium Elements, which leads the world in this field.
The same can be said, thirdly, of the maintenance and transfer of knowledge in the field of nuclear technology, which is of particular interest to me.
We have to ensure that young and outstanding scientists across Europe can apply new ideas to addressing existing problems, but we also must not lose the knowledge already acquired, and so we have to ensure that existing and newly-gained knowledge is exchanged within the European Union to an even greater degree than it already is.
The Joint Research Centre can certainly make a major contribution to this - and not just in the nuclear field.
Although this House's work will be done once we have voted tomorrow, much remains to be done - by the Member States, by the Commission, and, above all, by the research community.
I call on the Member States to invest even more money than before in research activities; for example, to avail themselves of the opportunity to invest money from the Structural Funds in developing research and development capabilities in their countries.
The creation of new research structures is not a function of the Seventh Research Programme, but rather a task for the Member States and the Structural Funds.
It is fortunate that the Seventh Research Framework Programme can concentrate properly on excellence in research.
I call on the Commission to implement the Programme without delay; I also call on them to establish clear, transparent, well thought-out, effective and fair tendering procedures, to assess them - or cause them to be assessed - in an objective manner, and to implement them in practical and unbureaucratic ways.
I am sure that the approach that we in this House have come up with is far from being the worst.
Finally, though, let me call on the European research community - the people who do the research, the people who work on the details, the people who find things out - to make use of what this research programme offers; Parliament has done its work, and now it is up to you to make progress with your research and do something vital in giving Europe a peaceful, free and prosperous future.

(Applause)
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr PotoÄnik and the Finnish Presidency, which has now been handed the baton in a piece of work that has taken several years to do.
Before I speak about the specific programme for which I am the rapporteur, that is to say Euratom, I should like to express some thoughts about Framework Programme 7 and its specific programmes.
I must obviously congratulate Mr Buzek and all the other rapporteurs for their excellent team work, which has enabled us to launch Framework Programme 7, if only at the last possible minute.
At the same time I feel rather sad that we have not made that leap of quality, namely that doubling on which we pinned so many hopes.
That would have sent out a strong signal of Europe's importance and above all of our conviction that we shall reach the Lisbon objective.
The doubling has not happened, but we are nevertheless trying to produce a result.
I shall start with the last comment made by Mr PotoÄnik on cooperation, in connection with the concern that I have expressed on behalf of myself and my group about the risk inherent in financing organisations or entities, under the aegis of Framework Programme 7, that have been set up or that are functioning in violation of international law.
The matter was discussed recently by Parliament with particular reference to the entity that has been set up in the occupied territories - the West Bank, Gaza and eastern Jerusalem - but it applies more generally.
I must emphasise that this concern relates also to situations that have emerged, for example, in scientific bodies, who can be asked to tender under Framework Programme 7 even if they are founded on national legislation that is in breach of international law, by for example preventing people from certain ethnic and religious groups from engaging in research.
I believe that this is the problem on which the Commission must express a view.
I was not satisfied with the response given in relation to this, since it seems to me to be limited to a very specific sector, whereas I think that it should apply more generally.
As far as the specific programmes are concerned, I am generally satisfied with most of the results achieved and I should in particular like to emphasise the attention given to researchers.
Indeed I consider that a great deal of what is done in our complex present-day society depends more and more on the human factor.
It is clearly impossible to think of European research without thinking of the researchers and their need for mobility, training and status, which are set out in the European Charter for Researchers.
Framework Programme 7 will have to implement the provisions that guarantee the best working conditions for European scientists, not least in order to limit and, if possible, reverse the trend of the brain drain to other parts of the world.
I greatly welcome the effort made to invest in basic research through the creation of an entity that would be independent of the Commission, charged with giving its judgment on the merits of a scientific proposal to be financed under the aegis of Framework Programme 7.
The efficacy of this new body will be measured in terms of whether it can be authoritative in selecting proposals and in earning the respect of the scientific community.
Only thus will it be able to attract innovative proposals and be in a position to finance ambitious projects that will enhance the quality of European research.
Operational transparency, ensured partly through Parliament's involvement in appraising its actions, will be essential for this body's success.
I should now like to devote the remaining minutes to the Euratom specific programme.
I agree with the Commission's position, which was also expressed by Mr Buzek concerning the Euratom framework programme, and I think that Europe must invest in developing fusion so that it becomes an indispensable energy source in the long term: unlimited in quantity, ecologically acceptable, financially competitive and capable of making a substantial contribution to a sustainable and safe form of energy supply.
ITER is a fundamental stage in the route towards the use of fusion energy.
After lengthy negotiations on the choice of the site for the reactor, the project's partners have at last signed the international agreement on ITER.
The positive conclusion of the negotiations, namely the decision to build ITER on the European site of Caradache in France, requires the adoption of decisive and consistent measures on the part of the EU under the umbrella of the present and subsequent framework programmes.
We therefore need to set up a European agency for ITER, in the form of a common enterprise under the aegis of the Euratom treaty, to supply the means for fulfilling our international obligations arising from the ITER agreement.
This means setting up the machinery and projects for collaboration with Japan.
This agency, with its headquarters in Barcelona, should have the setting up of ITER as its primary objective.
However, I think that the agency's remit should be limited to this, and I do not share the Commission's position of entrusting the whole field of research on fusion to a single agency.
I do not wish to weaken the role of the agency, which I regard as important, but I think it is essential to help it to meet its objective - which is complicated enough in itself.
Furthermore, I think that European research needs to be more independent, an opinion that in some ways applies also to the European Research Centre.
That apart, the associated bodies of the European Fusion Development Agreement have proved over the years to play an essential role.
If Europe has the leadership of this programme, that is because it has demonstrated in the field the high quality of the research that it carries out.
Setting up ITER is only the first step, given that we must use it - and use it to best advantage - through a new generation of researchers and high-value research in Europe.
This can be guaranteed by keeping research separate from execution.
Research should be carried out with existing mechanisms alongside the setting-up of ITER.
This is why I believe that it is important for my proposed amendment to be approved by this House, just as was the case with the Buzek report.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs and my colleague in Committee on Budgets, Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou, for her thorough and insightful opinion.
I wish to express my unreserved support for the collaborative research and development programmes in Europe.
I see this as a very important policy area that has direct impact on the way the EU develops as a global economy and the way we are regarded by the rest of the world.
The Seventh Framework Programme, as we have heard, is the biggest EU research programme to date and it pulls all the research-related EU initiatives under the roof of its EUR 53 billion programme.
The Commission's initial request was for EUR 70 billion, which was a huge increase on previous years.
However, we should not forget that this is a seven-year programme, not a five-year one like its immediate predecessor, and that its resources will be stretched across 27 Member States rather than the 15 and then 25 of the previous programmes.
We should also understand that doubling the FP7 reflects the clear importance of science and research to the development of the EU as a global player and as an economic power.
If we want to be competitive, we must walk our talk by investing in the areas that we know are key to our growth.
Unfortunately, I do not think the Council actually believes this and it is a pity that it did not support the Commission's request for EUR 70 billion.
Despite all the hype we have heard from the Council and all the noises it has made about the need to achieve the Lisbon goals and the importance of pushing our research and development spending up to 3% of GDP - which is still a long way behind Japan and the US - is it not incredible that the final figure agreed by the Council takes the spending up to only 1.5%?
What is more astonishing is that the Luxembourg Presidency's original proposal was to cut research and development even more significantly.
Thankfully, this option was rejected by many states, including my own, which saw the clear link between research and development and the growth and competitiveness of the EU.
This policy area was revisited by the UK Presidency, which put forward proposals for increasing spending.
I very much welcome the increase, but I lament, as I said earlier, that it is nowhere near the amount requested by the Commission and Parliament.
The launch of this programme presents us with a real opportunity to learn from and correct past mistakes.
One area upon which we need to focus our efforts is that of reducing the duration of funding procedures.
The present procedure is ridiculously long.
It is not just organisations in my region in the West Midlands which have witnessed this: the European Court of Auditors reported delays of between eight and nine months.
This is unacceptably long and it has to be drastically reduced.
The lengthy procedure causes many problems.
Not least of these is the necessity for a long pre-financing by participants.
It is an issue we need to address urgently.
Moving on, late payments are particularly detrimental to SMEs.
In this House we are constantly talking about SMEs that we want to support, and they are the fundamental driver of growth in the EU.
However, their budgets are hard pushed to cope with such delays.
Yet the Commission tells us that SMEs, as I said, must be targeted and actively encouraged to get involved.
Perhaps before we try to encourage them, we should ensure that we do not actually discourage them.
Therefore, please make the payments promptly.
The late payments also call into question the principle of annuality.
Since the Commission has acknowledged these problems, I would strongly urge it to prioritise resolving them.
The Commission must ensure that it evaluates, selects and awards funding in an efficient and effective way.
Moreover, in order to plan properly, participants need to know in advance the date on which the decision will be taken.
This can be achieved only if future methods and procedures are simplified to speed up selection.
This would lead to a much more coherent approach, it would avoid unnecessary bureaucracy for participants and speed up the negotiation of selected proposals.
It would also lead to increased transparency by facilitating access to the programme to the very many organisations that I have mentioned before.
One barrier to this is the double verification system.
The Commission should set up a single verification and certification system and adopt and publish specific rules that can be seen to be clear and fair to all the interested parties.
In view of this badly needed simplification of access to funding, I support the proposals of the Committee on Budgets to create a database for the submission of applications and encourage the Commission to apply the principle of proportionality as regards the documents it requires.
However, I would also urge the Commission to pay attention to the way the programme is controlled.
Control mechanisms need to be coordinated and, as I have said, we must avoid unnecessary duplication and ensure that the overall cost of control is proportional to the benefit that it brings.
In conclusion, let me remind the Commission and the Council that this programme is supposed to be for the benefit of the citizens and to promote scientific excellence across the European Union.
I do not think that, in view of this, we should try and make all the applicants jump through hoops to participate.
On the contrary, we should rapidly award funding to those in Europe who show real innovation and initiative and help them to discover new funding opportunities to increase our competitive advantage vis-Ã -vis the other areas of the world.
As I and all my colleagues have said, everyone recognises the vital role that research and development play in helping the European Union face the challenges presented by the rapidly developing economies of China and India.
For this reason, I would strongly urge the Commission to put every euro this programme has been granted to the most effective use possible and ensure that there is a one hundred per cent implementation rate.
Finally, I would also call on our leaders in the Council to look beyond the EU borders and compare ourselves with other areas in the rest of the world and try and revisit this policy to increase resources sooner rather than later.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, innovation and knowledge are now enshrined as a pillar of development for the European Union.
For such a provision to bear fruit, however, investment in human resources in the field of science and technology, and particularly in young scientists, needs to be seen as crucial and of the highest relevance if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals that we have set for ourselves in the next financial package for 2007-2013.
The reality is that European brains have been abandoning the EU and taking refuge mostly in the United States, where, more often than not, they are guaranteed better working conditions - one might say better laboratory conditions - as well as better pay.
Thus we are starting out late and at a disadvantage, and we must therefore make every effort to change this scenario.
The aim is to succeed in getting not only new researchers to stay, but also many of those we have already exported to return, and to establish themselves in our old continent, which is trying to put on a new face.
We also have to succeed in attracting researchers from third countries by means of new incentives and the mutual recognition of qualifications.
I should like to end by voicing an appeal: researchers, who are the heart and soul of the Seventh Framework Programme, should not be limited to a mere minute in this Programme, which is all that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been given in this debate.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, agricultural research is getting a chapter to itself within the context of support for research.
Between 2007 and 2013, some EUR 1.9 billion will be available for innovation in food, agriculture and biotechnology.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the explicit reference to agricultural research, which, along with energy research and research into the environment, now has additional options available to it when it comes to getting support from Europe.
In so doing, we are not only making a contribution to sustainable agricultural research and development, but are also helping farmers to implement the 2003 agriculture reform and change over to production systems that are competitive in international terms.
Innovative agricultural and food production pilot schemes, agricultural institutions, ministries, artisanal associations and guilds should now all prepare themselves to benefit from the innovative options Europe affords them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will take under four minutes.
I should simply like to emphasise one point, namely the great importance attached in this Framework Programme to the relationship between science and society: we need only think of the steps proposed to promote equal opportunities for women in scientific research up to the most senior levels, the 'Youth' action programme, the relationship between citizens and science as well as between the education and training schemes inspired by humanist culture and the demands of scientific progress.
I want to emphasise that science - this is a truism - has intrinsic worth: it is not simply worthy in the utilitarian, productive and competitive sense, though these aspects are also important.
Science must be regarded as a common good and its achievements must be accessible to everyone.
I believe that the EU, precisely at the moment when expanding its scientific activity means addressing new issues and aiming at quality, must also keep an eye on the rest of the world and not withdraw into itself: this is an essential part of its role.
In fact the achievements of science must be accessible to everyone: the world situation is highly unsatisfactory and a large part of research and knowledge relates to the wellbeing of 10% of the population, while the remaining 90% derive no benefit from it.
There are clearly important measures to be adopted, including the limitation of patents when these affect the wellbeing of the community, especially in the context of diseases.
I will conclude by saying that as far as the ethical problem is concerned, I fully concur with what Mr Busquin said: there must be consistency between decisions taken in this House and those adopted in all other forums.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I feel rather humble in the presence of this galaxy of rapporteurs and draftsmen.
I understand some kind words were uttered earlier this evening and I should like to reciprocate by thanking the Commissioner, the Presidency and my colleagues, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, for their very constructive engagement in this project.
We have worked very hard and I like to think that we have pressed the Council and the Commission to concede a little more than they would like and perhaps not as much as we would like: that is good business.
I share some colleagues' regrets that we were not able to persuade the Council to dig deeper into our taxpayers' pockets to increase expenditure on research.
It is a pity that it did not match earlier rhetoric.
I strongly hope the compromise package will be adopted tomorrow.
It will give a powerful signal to the research community that we can carry out our business and have the legislation in place on time.
The particular aspects of the framework that I find both new and exciting are the European Research Council and the concept of excellence, because we need both to enable ourselves to compete in the wider world.
I welcome the encouragement for SMEs, early-stage researchers and for women in science, as well as the joint technology initiatives, especially for Mr Prodi.
In conclusion, I should also like to thank another European Union institution, namely the Court of Auditors, for its contribution to the work on the rules for participation in responding to our invitation to give an opinion.
Hopefully, as a result, we will have made participation in the Framework Research Programme simpler, clearer and more accountable.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially Mr Busquin, who is sitting here near me.
Hopefully, the Research Framework Programme will help us take a few steps closer to the Lisbon objectives.
Parliament has given its support to this excellent package, and my group does too.
The billion euros in the venture capital fund will support small and medium-sized companies, and these very SMEs must be able to challenge the big companies and give employment to people.
There is every reason to increase investment in research.
Despite that, only one country has invested more than 1% of its budget in research and development, and that country is Finland.
EU investment in research is more sporadic than that of the United States of America, even ignoring money used there for research into defence.
With the new Research Framework Programme, there will be new areas for research and new initiatives.
The technology initiatives will improve opportunities for the world of business to participate in the Framework Programme.
The European Scientific Council of the European Research Council (ERC) will be responsible for managing the clearest basic research.
The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, for its part, will focus on support for enterprise.
The European Institute of Technology may bring into the equation a top university to compete with other universities.
Even the Joint Research Centre, which now has more than 2 000 researchers, is active in these fields.
I fear that all this work will fragment and there will be unnecessary overlap.
Applicants are confused and wonder where they are actually applying: the moon, perhaps.
I would therefore ask the Commission to tell Parliament how it will attempt to organise the European architecture in Research and Development, so that confusion does not slow down development.
The ERA-NET scheme is an important part of this work, but do we already have too many Community initiatives?
Does the Commissioner on the right know what the Commissioner on the left is doing?
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Research is an important pillar of Europe's drive for the growth of not only the economy but society as a whole, because it attaches value to human capital and the results of research are targeted towards improving social life, health and knowledge.
These positive aspects cannot conceal or make us forget that there is a lack of an ethical perspective in connection with stem cell research, in the way that Article 6 is worded.
We do not wish to impose limits or obscurantist filters: we simply wish to say that science and research must also have rules and guiding criteria.
The guiding criterion is the pre-eminence of mankind, if we are not to reverse ends and means.
The ethical aspect cannot be left out of consideration when research reaches into our genetic inheritance and science comes close to the origin of life itself and thus the beginning of a human life.
The belief that research disciplines itself and finds guidance only in itself and in its development is illusory and short-sighted.
We do not agree with the wording of Article 6, because we cannot accept that European funds should go towards research that could destroy an embryo.
For this reason it was important, Commissioner, to stipulate a cut-off date, a definite time limit on the use of cell lines that have already been extracted.
There has been no such time limit.
But it would have been real proof that there was no desire to use embryos ad hoc for research in future.
That has not been done; this is why I am expressing a critical judgment.
However, there is a point in the annex to the statement that expresses the decision not to finance research involving the destruction of embryos.
We ask the Commission to remain true to these words, so that they are not merely an empty statement, and we also request that the Commission's statement and its annex, which otherwise risk being mislaid and separated from the regulation, should be permanently attached to the regulation at the express wish of the Commission and the Council.
They should form an integral part of the regulation, as it seems to me that the Commissioner stated in his speech.
In addition we should like this wish to be given formal legal force, so that it is not entrusted merely to a political desire that goes no further than the nocturnal records of this House.
Tomorrow will be an important day for research, although in my opinion we must stress that those of us who have sometimes found ourselves facing an insurmountable obstacle in this matter are still unhappy.
We shall continue to oppose any solution adopted for stem cell research that lacks clarity or respect for human values.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, society makes progress not because of institutions but because of courageous and intelligent women and men taking initiatives and then sticking to them.
Commissioner, you are one of these men.
You have understood climate change and the depletion of energy resources.
These are the challenges of the 21st century.
Colleagues, we are in a race against time.
We may have only 10, 15 or a maximum of 20 years to get out of a trap which will definitely cause bloodshed, wars, weather anomalies and diseases.
It will be a disaster for this planet.
The only way out will be to invest massively and rapidly in energy-intelligent use and in renewable energy sources and materials.
We have brokered a deal to get at least 50% of the money for non-nuclear research to renewables and end-use energy efficiency.
We have a deal on three issues.
Firstly, energy efficiency has to be a horizontal priority all over our research - it is about material research and ICT, which has to involve the energy and resource dimension.
Commissioner, you must set up a coordination body to make this happen not only on paper but also in reality.
Secondly, on renewables, we in Europe are the leader as regards technology in that area because we put money into FP4, FP5 and FP6 to invest in wind, photovoltaics and biomass.
I want FP7 money to make Europe the world leader in offshore wind, solar thermal electricity and marine technology.
We have to move towards that.
The third part of our deal is that these issues need to be monitored.
Finally, ITER is the bad decision.
Why?
Because somebody told me that the less chance there is of a technology breakthrough, the bigger the chance to have an international agreement.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when I look around me, I get a sense that one of Murphy's laws is in operation; that is, the more important the issue, the less attention gets paid to it.
This is despite the outstanding work of Commissioner PotoÄnik, and Mr Buzek and his colleagues, who have been among the first ever to look at the needs of the new Member States, where science and research are appallingly under-funded.
One of the tasks ahead of us is to concentrate more resources on areas where they will achieve a multiplier effect, as in the case of nanosciences and nanotechnologies, where the resources are somewhat less than had originally been planned.
Where we must work hardest, however, is in the new media policy, in order to boost the prestige of science and scientists in the Community, to promote what is referred to in America as the pioneering spirit and to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme becomes the flagship of the Lisbon Strategy.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Seventh Framework Programme is a sine qua non if Europe is to become a leader on the modern economic scene, for the benefit of the welfare and health of its citizens and of environmental protection.
The economic and political situation and environmental protection do, however, call for definition of the priorities to benefit from particular financial and organisational support.
One of these priorities is reducing reliance on gas and oil.
Supply problems and increased prices for these fuels have a negative impact on the economy and on living standards.
In the USA, biofuels research and development has enabled these fuels to be developed and engines running on biofuels to be introduced.
It also allowed fuel imports to be cut and created a huge demand for agricultural products, thus increasing the profitability of that sector.
The construction of new nuclear power plants in response to the needs of the European energy system, and also of plants generating electricity from wind, water and solar power will secure economic stability.
They will also reduce the greenhouse effect and limit damage to the environment.
Coal gasification and coal liquefaction have similar benefits.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, no respect is ever shown in this House for the principle of subsidiarity, and no proposal is ever put forward to return political power from the EU to the Member States.
Where research is concerned, however, there are valid economic arguments in favour of more work being done by the EU.
A pure market economy results in too little research because the benefits of research are enjoyed by everyone while its costs have to be borne by individual companies.
It is therefore worth taxpayers' while funding basic research.
If several countries join forces, it is still more worthwhile in socio-economic terms because a larger portion of the benefits then comes back to the taxpayers.
It is an excellent idea to set up the European Research Council and to facilitate the movement of researchers within the EU.
We must, however, reject state intervention and increased bureaucracy.
What are required are more research resources, together with transparency and freedom of movement.
The issue at hand here is research management, yet politicians, bureaucrats and new EU institutions are nonetheless seeing the scope of their activities extended.
Allow me finally to draw attention to the grotesque way in which resources are distributed.
The money available under the Seventh Framework Programme amounts to one seventh of the costs of the EU's agricultural policy.
Research appropriations are vitally important to the future of Europe.
In contrast, the agricultural policy squanders resources, exploits European consumers and exacerbates world poverty.
A doubling of research appropriations, a 50% cut in agricultural subsidies and a 40% reduction in the fee payable to the EU would be blessings to offer a silent prayer for.
Mr President, I do not want to spoil the party here tonight.
I think we can be proud of what we have achieved - the European Research Council, the search for excellence in different programmes - but I think it is necessary to state tonight that this is not enough.
It is not enough if we compare it with what we should be able to do at European level, and it is important for the representatives of the Council as well as for you, Commissioner, to remember that and to underline that we cannot wait for another seven years to step up the efforts we need in order to keep up with other parts of the world if we are to be the world's leading knowledge economy.
As a shadow rapporteur I am proud of what we have achieved from our side.
We wanted to make it easier for SMEs to have access to research programmes, and we have achieved that.
We wanted to have better funding for SMEs, and we have achieved that.
We wanted to ensure that universities were able to get into the projects without losing money through indirect costs, and we have achieved that.
We also wanted less bureaucracy, and we have achieved that.
We wanted to free up opportunities to use intellectual property rights, and we have achieved that.
We are happy about what we have achieved, but that demonstrates that we need to take further steps.
(FR) Mr President, in the nick of time, Parliament has pulled the fat out of the fire by adopting the Seventh Framework Programme and avoiding a blank year for European research.
It also enables us to respond to that most exciting of challenges, network intelligence.
Let me highlight some welcome advances: the adoption of priorities associated with people's everyday lives, such as health, energy, the environment, support for information and communication technology, the impact of which cuts across all the policies of the Union, the increased consideration given to small and medium-sized enterprises, the engine of competitiveness, through the risk-sharing fund, and, lastly, a prospect of future resources that inspires confidence, with the enhancement of the Marie Curie scholarships and the creation of the European Research Council.
As the shadow rapporteur for the Ideas programme, I am delighted that the European Research Council, which is to function through and for researchers, will represent a new form of scientific governance and will fall within the realm of codecision.
The European Parliament has demonstrated unity and responsibility.
At the same time, I regret that the budget is not sufficient to make up the leeway on our American and Japanese competitors, who are investing more than twice as much on research as we are.
The Council must hear our message in support of yours, Commissioner.
The merit of this Framework Programme is that it gives globalisation a human face, and that is surely worth an additional financial effort.
Let us fix a date for the revision of the Financial Perspective!
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we dream of is first and foremost the Europe of human rights, then the Europe of the market; first the Europe of solidarity with smaller nations, then the competitive Europe.
I thank you therefore for the clarifications you have given us this evening, but you know that some explanations remain incomplete, just as the wording of the common position is ambiguous.
You also know that European funds will provide an incentive for destroying human embryos.
I recall with pleasure the moment in 1989 when the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted together for an undertaking that there would never be experiments on human embryos except for the purpose of saving the embryo itself.
Today we are reversing this position: it is said that the money is needed so urgently that there is no margin for further deliberation, and yet all that is needed is for the Council to accept the genuine interpretation set out in the two amendments that many of us have tabled.
I hope that these amendments will be accepted, at the very least in the specific programmes.
(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Members and draw attention to some of the positive features of the Specific Programme, 'Capacities'.
Firstly, investment in infrastructure is an essential precondition of innovation and the development of new knowledge.
With a European perspective on research infrastructure, researchers will increasingly be able to obtain mutual benefit across Europe's borders from new investment.
New and specialised forms of research infrastructure are expensive, and it should therefore be possible for as large a number of researchers as possible to make use of them.
With common resources, we shall be able to secure better access to the most recent tools for all European researchers.
Secondly, I think it important that the programme appropriate resources to better integrate the dissemination aspect into research.
If society is to reap as many of the benefits of European research as possible, we must ensure that the results of research make a difference to individuals, authorities and industry.
High-quality research dissemination also helps to legitimise society's investment in research and to awaken young people's interest in becoming researchers.
In this connection, it is also important to point out that the programme focuses on women in research and on increasing women's opportunities to enter the research world.
The under-representation of women in that world is well documented, especially by the Commission's own units for women and research.
At both Community and national levels, we must therefore work to bring about a situation in which a research career becomes an attractive option for both men and women.
Thirdly, I think it important not only that research staff and directors of research institutes should be exchanged between partner organisations in the Member States but also that the principle should be extended to include partners in associated countries and third countries.
The EU's framework programmes are open to a number of partner countries and, in the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission wants to involve these countries to a greater degree than hitherto.
The partner countries' participation in the exchange of research staff will definitely add value to European knowledge-sharing.
(ES) Mr President, European research has gradually dedicated more room to issues relating to the environment, to people and to culture, thereby attaching more importance to their situations and to their conservation and survival.
The attention paid to historical and cultural heritage is an example of this.
I would like to thank those people in the Commission who have supported it.
The same should be said of the inclusion of the entertainment and multimedia industry, information technologies and social sciences in the programme, as well as the innovation of introducing research relating to intelligence and the fight against terrorism.
I am pleased with the agreements reached on stem cell research: we have set clear limits respecting all sensitivities, the funding of human cloning, the cloning or creation of embryos for research and their destruction has been banned, at all times under the control of regional, national and international bodies.
When I speak to patients and their families, I am moved by their capacity to embrace hope.
They know that it may not be they who benefit from the solutions, but they feel obliged to defend that ray of hope for new patients; I certainly will not be taking that hope away from them.
Research has always been a feature of European culture; the great European researcher, Steiner, said that.
Creativity and research are aspects of our identity.
Mr President, I just wanted to say how delighted I am that we are reaching a conclusion on this.
Science is crucial to the competitiveness of the European Union.
When you see the economic giants rising up in China and India and how many computer scientists are being produced in that part of the world, you know the challenge is on.
The Commission acknowledged this in its initial presentation of the financing it sought for this programme.
It must be said that the Council's response was very disappointing, not the first time under the Luxembourg Presidency.
Thank goodness the Brits were there to save the day and to increase the amount of money allocated to the science budget.
It is crucial to acknowledge Mr Blair's role in that.
However, we must also recognise that it is still not enough: EUR 50 billion is not enough for a seven-year programme for 27 countries.
It is not a serious proposal.
At the very least, Member States need to work together much more constructively in terms of building that capacity, because it is crucial.
I refer to what Mr Turmes said earlier.
Taking energy as an example, it is crucial to look at things like the technology platforms and the zero emissions platform.
That is the kind of thing that will make a real difference to climate change.
Unless we allocate that kind of money and emphasise that link between science, the state and private sector, we will have no hope of addressing these issues.
Ideally, we would develop these things in the European Union in order to roll them out to areas like China and really make a big difference.
Finally, on capacities, it is crucial that regions in the poorer areas of the Community catch up, meaning it is essential to develop the capacities aspect of this programme further.
(FR) Mr President, research cannot be conducted without people, and that is why the research professions are becoming more and more important and why we support the creation of a genuine European research area.
This should be accompanied by due recognition of researchers as a separate professional category, for we need researchers, we need to train good researchers, we need to keep our researchers and bring back those who have left Europe, and we even need to invite those from other countries who wish to join us.
To this end, we must simplify the procedures for access to Marie Curie grants.
We must encourage an approach to research that is more firmly based on the Lisbon objectives, especially by promoting links between universities and businesses.
We must also examine the effectiveness of aid and the use of public funds and promote equality between men and women.
Lastly, we must frame the protection of intellectual property rights, not only in respect of research findings but also as regards the intellectual property of each individual researcher.
In conclusion, we expect the European Commission to convey to us the fullest possible information on the monitoring of this programme.
(NL) Mr President, since the research programme is a key component of the Lisbon Strategy, it is to be welcomed that more funds are being made available.
It is just unfortunate that they are not enough, not by a long shot.
It is important that a great deal of money is being set aside for health and energy research, since there is a huge need for innovative research in those areas.
Two billion has been kept back for energy, at least half of which is earmarked for sustainable energy and energy efficiency.
There are promising ideas that merit further research in the pipeline, and it is important for the Member States to work together much more in this area.
In the area of health, it is important to turn our attention to the neglected diseases and antibiotics resistance.
Since we are marking World AIDS Day this week, now may be as good a time as any to opt for more funds for health research.
It is also to be welcomed that 15% of the research funds are held in reserve for small and medium-sized enterprises.
For this to happen, though, it is of course necessary for the red-tape to be cut drastically in the scheduling of the research programmes.
To date, the involvement of SMEs has been limited because it was impossible for them to wade through all the paperwork.
It is to be hoped that this can now change.
Commissioner, I should like to finish off by drawing your attention to the following: research in fisheries is of huge importance in order to protect fish stocks and prevent overfishing.
Unfortunately, the subject of fisheries has not been dealt with separately in the Seventh Framework Programme.
What guarantees can you give that sufficient time and funds will be invested in this important research work?
(NL) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Seventh Framework Programme is indeed a milestone if we consider the budget and policy as a whole.
As the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have noticed that, in terms of Capacities, we have succeeded in receiving additional budgets and additional scope for deploying the Structural Funds for research infrastructure at regional level.
Thanks to Mr Buzek, Mr Prodi, Commissioner HÃŒbner and the Committee on Regional Development, the budget has in this way been increased by many billions.
This need not be done at European level, and together with the EIB's risk-sharing finance facility, considerable investments can be made.
The roadmap for research and research infrastructure that was published recently is setting out the course for this.
I can see evidence of these common investments, high-tech campuses and open innovation all over Europe.
We must, in the face of cut-throat global competition, look for more focus, more substance and more connection between research and infrastructure.
I am winding down.
In that way, we can achieve the centres of excellence for nanotechnology, micro-electronics, health care, etc. It is not a 'brain drain' we advocate, but a 'brain gain'.
(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Buzek for his report and on the proposed amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme, along with other MEPs for their work on the specific programmes, in particular the specific programme for direct actions conducted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), where I am a shadow rapporteur.
At a time when around 25% of all EU law relates to technical or scientific issues, the JRC has a vital role to play.
As a part of the Commission, this institution is responsible for preparing the scientific background for legislative proposals.
Consequently, it is vital to ensure that research is of a high quality and adequately funded.
I also feel that the amendment to the rules for participation in the Seventh Framework Programme has proved successful in managing to simplify the rules in force, especially for university research.
I hope that this process of breaking down administrative barriers will lead to the better exploitation of our potential for science and research in Europe.
- (SL) I would like to mention the EURATOM programme.
The European Union will also provide financial support for research in the fields of nuclear fission and radiation protection in the years to come.
Its main innovation, however, is the considerably higher level of funding which it has made available for research activities in the field of nuclear fusion.
The construction of the largest test nuclear fusion reactor in the world, which is not just a European project but also a global one, is expected to begin shortly.
This programme is an ambitious one which meets the short, medium and long-term objectives of the European Union in the field of energy.
I hope that Parliament will support the proposal put forward by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and reject the new draft amendments made at the plenary session.
To summarise, we have come to an agreement that the efficiency of the financial administration should be improved and that regular reports on the implementation of the programme should be submitted to the European institutions.
We have categorised nuclear energy as one of the vital resources for the reliability and sustainability of energy in Europe.
We have emphasised the importance of ensuring adequate human resources and providing people with sufficient, accurate information about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
I am satisfied with the contents, but not with the level of financial resources.
At this point, I would like to thank everyone for their participation in the setting up of this programme.
(SK) I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that from the very beginning the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has tried to adopt clear rules for participating in the 7th Framework Programme with as much transparency as possible.
We have taken a similarly responsible approach in devising the simplest administrative procedures possible, with a view particularly to the small organisations that are participating in FP7.
Most of the principles underpinning the rules of participation in Euratom are identical to the general rules applicable to the 7th Framework Programme.
Given the time constraints, I am not going to dwell on the agreements already achieved.
However, the Euratom implementation rules under the 7th Framework Programme have their own specific features, notably as regards research into controlled thermonuclear fusion.
I appreciate the fact that in this Programme, too, we have been able to reach agreement, adopting several specific amendments that will be instrumental in implementing the ITER project more efficiently, as well as in funding a number of other initiatives that the European Fusion Development Agreement regards as priorities.
(DE) Mr President, if I might say something brief in Mrs Morgan's direction, we would of course be delighted if Tony Blair were not only to fight but also to pay the bill.
I believe, Commissioner, that this House has thrown a rock into your garden, and we now hope you will be able to do something with it.
Quite apart from the Research Programme itself, we will also have to deal with the problem of having to weld it together with the CIP and with the financing instruments.
We in this House have done something for which the Council had promised us additional financial aid; we have done it with money from the programme, and that was not an easy thing for us to do.
We did it, though, because we think it right as part of an overall strategy.
We have to say, bluntly, that we are now using money from the research programme to pay for the funding of innovation, and so we feel ourselves under an obligation.
Parliament is still obliged to keep an eye on the risk sharing facility, in other words, we are not backing out; we will continue to support you, but - and I have to spell this out, since this was such a big thing for us to do - we will have to continue to maintain a watching brief on this matter.
It is, then, a great success, but it is you who have the really big task of putting it all together.
(HU) Mr President, one can only welcome the fact that the European Research Framework Programme has met its objectives and that the agreements have been concluded on schedule.
I see significant guarantees that we will be able to retain and motivate our researchers.
Several of our proposals were aimed at making participation easier and more transparent.
Applying strict assessment procedures and ensuring that information is made widely accessible may broaden the circle of those who are able to take part in these European projects.
I regret, however, that the Council and the Commission were rigid in refusing to guarantee that the non-refundable VAT would be accountable as a funded expense, although the Court of Auditors had supported our proposal and its rationale.
However, the mechanism for optional flat-rate financing, which promises to be successful, will open up further opportunities to our universities and research institutes and will guarantee their broad, longer-term sustainable participation.
The rules of participation have thus undergone positive change, and this means great satisfaction and good opportunities for the researchers of the new Member States.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission, for increasing the budget by 63% over against what it was for the sixth programme is a momentous achievement, and shows that the Lisbon agenda, through which we focused, is right.
It got the full support of this House and of the Council.
We have now spent many years working to make improvements to it; the compromises we have arrived at are quite crucial in encouraging job creation and growth.
Today, I am already thinking about the eighth programme.
Having managed a 63% increase this time round, I hope we will achieve a comparable one in the eighth programme.
What is much more important, though, is that the technical work has only just been completed, and now the real work is beginning.
In 2009, we have elections to the European Parliament again, and there will be a new Commission; we still have time before then to sell our successes.
I would ask you to get together with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and the President of the Commission to put together a design for how we can best get the message across to the interested parties for which we drafted this programme - in the universities, in factories, in every branch and sector - that what we have done with this programme we have done for the sake of Europe's future, and that new products and services will enable us to hold our own in global competition.
Since we are spending over EUR 50 billion on product policy, I would ask that we should agree on a budget for marketing and public relations, so that the simplification that has been achieved - this mammoth task that we have accomplished for Europe - may also be got across to its people.
Mr President, at this late hour, I wish to begin by thanking this House, on behalf of all the researchers in Europe, for your words of support during this three-hour debate.
Many of you mentioned funding.
Unfortunately, we have lost the bet, because the number seven would be really lucky - seven years, seventh programme, EUR 70 billion.
In any case, we can still be proud of what we have achieved, because it is a serious increase.
I have no doubt that the programme will be adopted tomorrow.
Then we can continue with our work for the future.
Firstly, on the question about fisheries, I would simply add that we now have theme No 2, named 'food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology'.
This was the last change that was made at the last debate, so it has been included.
I should like to draw your attention to many important things that are part of our achievement.
We will all have to consider in the future how the European Research Council is developing.
It is a major thing for Europe.
It is a major breakthrough that for the first time we are able to gain sources together at EU level, finding excellence without political interference, including mine.
That is a major change in thinking, which I hope will be a source of future decisions connected with the European research area.
We have European technology platforms which go far beyond the framework programme and they have much more potential.
We talk about public-private partnerships in joint technology initiatives, which will be a delicate but worthwhile exercise in the future.
We will also have to monitor these closely.
We will have to deal with a risk-sharing finance facility, which you mentioned, and I am fully aware that you are expecting simplified procedures, which will not be easy to achieve.
I am committed to doing that, but I sincerely hope that I will have the support of all those who can help.
Unfortunately, I have learned that sometimes it is simply impossible to meet all expectations.
If, on the one hand, you have private needs which seek fast solutions and, on the other hand, public money, you cannot come together 100%.
We will do our best and we will try, but I just want to say that in some areas it is simply the logic of the work which does not fit 100%.
We have a major success with the framework programme which we are putting on the table.
However, the framework programme is only the foundation on which we have to build.
We have to go beyond that.
That is why I want to launch the debate on the European research area immediately.
I have three major reasons for that.
Firstly, the area was launched in the same year as the Lisbon Agenda.
That may be a coincidence, but I do not think so, because the European research area is the main part of Lisbon thinking.
Secondly, in 2009 we shall be embarking on a new Financial Perspective debate.
It will be more than a new Financial Perspective debate, it will be a debate about how the future Europe should look.
We should come into this debate with strong potential and only if we truly have a debate about European research area behind us will we be strong enough to show clearly that all the messages I have heard today are the right ones.
Also, the others will understand them.
Thirdly, when we talk about constitutional, institutional changes, we must be present at that debate.
This debate will come alive soon and in this respect it is also important how the European research area and European research cooperation will be treated in future.
Those are enough good reasons when we will be dealing with international cooperation, funding, infrastructure facilities and many questions which concern what we have done up to now and how we can improve in the future.
When we talk about the famous 3% that we all have in mind, let us be clear that we have two major challenges.
One challenge is coming from the developed countries.
Here we are lagging behind in yearly funding for science and research.
When we talk about the developing countries, it is not money that is the problem, but the pace, because they are making rapid progress.
Those are the two challenges we have to face.
When we talk about 3%, we have to be clear that its composition is twofold: public financing and private financing.
In a way, since we can make decisions directly, it is easier to handle public financing.
However, it is not always easy to come to the figures like in FP7 we were like to, but still it is in direct political control.
But when we talk about private financing, which normally consists of two-thirds in normal circumstances, we do not have direct control.
Here we can either go in through direct activities which are clearly linked to that, such as state aid, tax incentives, intellectual property rights, regulations, standardisation, lead market initiatives, public procurement, risk venture capital, and so on.
However, if we are honest, then we have to take into account those things that are connected with competitiveness and the internal market.
On higher education, if we do not make progress quickly, then higher education and universities in Europe are really the engine behind everything: the labour and financial markets and, finally, the coherence between macroeconomic policies and structural policies which have to be in place.
So when we talk about our issues, these are the issues of all the governments, the whole Commission, the whole Parliament.
We cannot settle them alone.
That is why we always have to look at the big picture and why the debate on which we have to embark in the future is that one.
We have to build on a positive climate which I think we have in Europe.
We are now clearly devoting political attention to knowledge, research and development, but it is not important that we get it there, it is important that we keep it there.
Why?
Because only if we have constant strategic attention for a period of some years can we truly count on serious changes in Europe.
It is true that it is almost midnight but, if we work together, I am sure it is not too late.
(Applause)
It is a rare occurrence, Commissioner, that so many Members are still in the chamber at midnight.
That is indicative of the importance of this debate we have been holding for the best part of three hours.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The Seventh Framework Programme is not just another Framework Programme, as it has been designed in its content, organisation, implementation modes and management tools; as a key contribution to the re-launched Lisbon strategy by placing the emphasis on innovation and knowledge for growth and employment.
By bringing and supporting new, innovative ideas through the FP7 via extended transnational cooperation, the aim is to effectively bring science and society closer together.
One has to acknowledge that there is indeed genuine European added value in bringing universities, research centres and clusters, industry, SMEs and other legal entities together to cooperate and participate in research projects around defined priorities within a unique management framework on a multiannual basis.
FP7 will of course have to be implemented in synergy with other Community policies such as the cohesion policy and the structural funds that, to a certain extent, also support research and development.
With the implementation of FP7, there will be a genuine leverage effect on the objectives of other Community policies such as growth, employment and competitiveness.
It will be ensured that knowledge, capacity and innovative technologies will be known, transferred, assimilated and used by businesses around the whole Union.
I am a firm believer in the results science can bring us through non-embryonic stem cell research.
It needs to be supported.
We need to ensure results.
Somatic stem cell therapies, which are those that use stem cells extracted from humans after they are born or from the umbilical cord and placenta, are at a tipping point.
Advanced trials in human subjects are showing promising results.
These advances are found in a wide range of conditions including heart and liver disease, diabetes, blindness caused by cornea damage, brittle bone disease, cystic fibrosis, strokes, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, among others.
Therefore, it is my belief that it is in the best interest of the people we represent to ensure funding priority and stronger incentive be given to researchers capable of finding cures to diseases within the foreseeable future through the use of adult stem cells.
Furthermore, it is my belief that there should be a periodic review of funding to research which may or may not bring about results.
(FR) The Seventh Framework Research Programme is supposed to be designed as a tool at the service of an integral research policy that is simplified, is more accessible to SMEs and strengthens the links between research and industry in particular.
It almost lives up to that aim.
The fact is that concerns and questions remain, especially with regard to the participation of SMEs, where the access costs for participants and access to the risk-sharing finance facility still pose problems, with regard to coherence and the absence of confusion with other Community policies, with regard to the dissemination of knowledge, where quality and respect for intellectual property are issues, and with regard to the role of Member States in the governance of the programme.
The seven-year duration of the programme also seems to be ill-suited to the pursuit of research goals, which are liable to change rapidly in spite of prescribed phases and evaluations.
We also regret that research on embryonic stem cells has not been banned and that Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, has confined itself to mere definitions and restrictions in this domain.
It remains no less true, however, that research, if it is the subject of a policy based on the pursuit of excellence, is one of the few areas in which the European Union can truly deliver better results than national activities could achieve.
The placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Joel Hasse Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles - C6-0312/2005 -.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and my colleague Mr Verheugen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Ferreira as well as the Finnish Presidency.
I am very happy to be able to represent my colleague on these issues since to a great extent it does affect consumer protection and safety.
It is clear that this agreement would not have been possible without intensive efforts from both sides.
It is very timely, coming as it does just before New Year's Eve, a time when the most fireworks are used in Member States.
The directive will create an internal market and thus uniform and better framework conditions for pyrotechnic articles, which comprise fireworks but also airbags and seatbelt pretensioners.
The directive is urgently awaited in particular by the automobile supply industry and by consumer protection organisations.
It does not make sense for 27 Member States to prescribe different technical regulations for pyrotechnic articles, while their citizens within a Europe of open borders can easily shop for fireworks in neighbouring countries.
The protection of consumers will therefore be decisively improved because pyrotechnic articles sold to consumers anywhere in the European Union must in future fulfil the essential safety requirements of the directive and will be subject to conformity assessment.
Moreover, for campaigns which market the products in several Member States, the uniform standards will contribute to a substantial reduction of the bureaucratic burden.
The Commission is well aware that the use of fireworks is subject to different traditions and customs in the Member States.
Therefore we can agree to the amendment proposed by Parliament that certain fireworks do not fall under the directive if they are produced by manufacturers for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself has been approved by the respective Member State.
For the same reason, it was also necessary to grant to the Member States the possibility of taking national measures regarding certain categories of pyrotechnic articles.
This concerns in particular fireworks in categories 2 and 3, which can pose somewhat higher risks.
Therefore, the use of bangers and flash bangers by the general public will remain forbidden in many Member States in future.
Consequently, such fireworks will be excluded completely from category 1, for which the Member States cannot lay down further restrictions.
This exclusion is specified in essential safety requirements and will be taken up in a mandate which the Commission will give to the European Standardisation Committee after the adoption of the directive.
The Commission confirmed this by making a declaration during the negotiations with the Council and Parliament.
I am also pleased that an agreement has been achieved with the Council regarding the labelling of pyrotechnic articles, where a balanced solution between high safety requirements on the one hand, and avoidance of complicated and burdensome requirements on manufacturers on the other, has been found.
In conclusion I would like to point out that, once again, the negotiation process has benefited very much from the close collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Commission can therefore agree to all compromise amendments and I am confident that we can achieve the adoption of this directive at first reading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pyrotechnic market as a whole is far larger than just the fireworks segment.
The major part of the market corresponds to car safety equipment, such as airbags and seatbelts.
Fireworks represent 20% of the market, although they have given rise to most of the proposed amendments to the report that I have tabled.
Marine equipment not covered by international conventions has also been incorporated within this directive.
Furthermore, a category of pyrotechnic articles for theatrical use has been created, and pyrotechnic articles in the aircraft and aerospace industry have been excluded, because of all the control systems already in place.
The market value of pyrotechnic articles used in the car industry is some EUR 5.5 billion, whereas that of fireworks is about EUR 1.4 billion.
Ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of this Directive, we shall be making a significant contribution to the free movement of pyrotechnic products within the European Union.
We shall also be ensuring greater safety for consumers and professional users.
The harmonisation of safety rules among the Member States in the various market segments included here will lead to greater consumer confidence and freer movement of the products.
The possibility of having different rules at national level has, in any case, been retained, particularly in relation to minimum ages for handling certain categories of fireworks.
We have also taken into account the specific situations in Malta and certain regions of Italy regarding the use of fireworks by the people who make them at certain religious and cultural events.
In view of the volume of pyrotechnic products imported into Europe, especially from China, we have also decided to attribute clear responsibilities to importers and distributors of pyrotechnic articles; this is especially important in the case of fireworks.
We have also devoted considerable attention to the labelling issue and to noise aspects.
In the vehicle sector, we have been careful to take account of the international dimension of the European vehicle component industry.
The deadlines for transposing the Directive have been extended in order to allow more time for suitable, harmonised standards to be created or updated, as appropriate.
Mr President, it is also worth highlighting the agreement reached with the European Council, despite the technical difficulties raised by the original text of the Proposal for a Directive, and despite the significant cultural differences that exist between several Member States, particularly regarding the sale and use of fireworks.
Before I finish, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that I should thank Mr OivukkamÃ€ki for the part he played in this process on behalf of the Finnish Presidency, and Mr Schmahl, who represented the Commission in this process.
In addition, we must not forget the work and the follow-up done by Mrs Weisgerber, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs RÃŒhle, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and Mr Brie, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
As Chairman, Mrs McCarthy played a decisive role throughout the process, especially at the trialogue stage.
In addition, we must not forget Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the draftsman for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mr Muscat, for his interest throughout this process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this context I call on you to vote for the set of compromises negotiated with the various parliamentary groups, as well as with the Council and the Commission, so that we can approve this directive at first reading.
By doing so, we shall be ensuring better protection for consumers and enhancing competitiveness in the economic sectors covered by this Directive.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude to the rapporteur for his constructive cooperation.
We have achieved a great success; the directive on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles can be adopted tomorrow at first reading, and we have indeed already reached agreement with the Council.
This directive draws together the 25 different sets of legislation governing explosives within the European Union.
This means that we have done away with another little bit of bureaucracy.
Through this directive, we will be a large step closer to realising the internal market for the trade in fireworks, airbags and other pyrotechnic products.
There will no longer be a need for special products to be manufactured for each Member State, which will give rise to enormous cost savings.
The industry can now focus on meeting uniform requirements across Europe.
I have been calling, in particular, for a simplified procedure for those who use fireworks professionally.
The aim of this simplified procedure is for the manufacturers or importers of fireworks for professional use to implement their own quality assurance systems.
The manufacturers or importers will, however, continue to be subject to regular monitoring by competent authorities.
In this way, we have given more responsibility in this area back to the businesses, thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy.
We were able to introduce specific regulations for the field of automotive engineering, which includes airbags and seatbelt pretensioners.
This area, in particular, requires high safety standards without overlaying these with requirements for the labelling of airbags that are built into vehicles anyway.
It is, in particular, the consumers, and I would like to emphasise this point, who will benefit from the new directive, as it affords them improved levels of safety.
There have been a handful of very serious accidents with fireworks due to the differing safety requirements of the Member States.
A procedure is now being introduced according to which safety requirements will be just as high in every Member State.
Tomorrow, through the vote on the fireworks directive, we will realise the internal market in this area, whilst at the same time providing greater safety levels for consumers.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I must explain that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Fourtou, who has been dealing with this matter for our group but has been prevented from attending by other commitments.
Mrs Fourtou wishes to express her special thanks to Mr Hasse Ferreira for his work as well as to her honourable colleagues from the other political groups.
She found it agreeable to work in an atmosphere where everyone was prepared to listen and to operate in complete transparency.
She took part in the various trialogues and fully supports the rapporteur's approach.
She regrets, however, that a Council amendment removes the obligation on Member States to draw up correlation tables.
In fact, since the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement in 2003, the three institutions have been committed to better legislation and have acknowledged the importance of these tables.
The Council, apparently, no longer wishes to honour that commitment.
Be that as it may, Mrs Fourtou thanks the rapporteur and the Finnish Presidency and notes that both of them tried to defend the correlation tables. Not wishing to block the procedure, she persuaded our group to vote in favour of the compromise amendments and of the report.
Mr President, as coordinator for my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly wanted to come here this evening to pay tribute to the team that has worked on this, Mr Hasse Ferreira, who has led this with distinction, and particularly my colleague, Mrs Weisgerber, who has worked tirelessly together with Mr Hasse Ferreira on this proposal.
From the point of view of the internal market, this is an excellent example of how Parliament can significantly improve a highly technical text.
This may seem an abstruse and perhaps rather marginal sector, but as both the rapporteurs have pointed out this evening, we are talking about a total product range here: there is EUR 5.5 billion in automotive pyrotechnics and EUR 1.5 billion in fireworks.
That is a very substantial market and their achievement has been extremely important, firstly in creating the internal market; secondly by improving standards for consumers and product-labelling, raising the whole standard of quality in the marketplace; and thirdly in improving the procedures.
It is an indication of the fact that if Parliament gets its act together and works in detail on technical improvements, it really can make a significant step forward, both for consumers and for the European economy.
I thank all my colleagues concerned for making that possible.
Mr President, I should just like to thank the rapporteur and the Members once again for their excellent work, and to say that we are looking forward to a first-reading agreement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today - since it is after midnight - at 11 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(MT) By means of the Pyrotechnics Directive, we are enhancing the health and safety both of consumers and of those who are engaged in this type of work.
By means of this directive, as amended by this report, there will be greater safety, especially with regard to the market for pyrotechnic products sold in retail outlets and used directly by consumers all over Europe.
At the same time, the amendments unanimously agreed on in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection acknowledge that there is a market for fireworks that are not sold directly to consumers but that are manufactured for use in licensed activities covered by insurance.
These activities include the traditional festivals held mostly in the Mediterranean, including Malta.
The amendments agreed on do not involve safety regulations, but simply demand that there should be no excessive bureaucracy in these cases.
The original procedures would not have led to any changes in the way work is carried out, but would have brought about an increase in costs.
In Malta's case, these would have been borne by the voluntary bodies that organise these festivals.
These amendments were designed and agreed on with the responsible authorities, including the Maltese Standards Authority.
It should also be made clear that, where the setting off of fireworks is concerned, regulations governing distances and timing are drawn up by each individual country and have never been included in this directive.
Rights of patients in the EU (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the rights of patients in the European Union.
Mr President, the issue of high-quality health services is of great importance to all European citizens.
Moreover, the right to healthcare is a fundamental right recognised by the EU Charter.
Nevertheless, health services are primarily national in nature.
There is, however, broad consensus that there is a clear added value in cooperation on health services at European level.
Together with the Member States, the Commission has been conducting a mapping exercise on common principles and elements of healthcare in the European Union. Special attention was paid to patients' rights.
According to our preliminary results, there are indeed common elements of patients' rights shared by EU health systems.
These include providing timely and appropriate healthcare, sufficient information to patients about different treatment options, respecting confidentiality of health data and compensation for harm from negligence in healthcare.
However, the mechanisms in place across the Member States to implement these principles vary widely in practice.
They range from patients' rights laws to non-binding patient charters, legal obligations for health professionals, patient ombudsmen, etc. Moreover, those mechanisms do not sufficiently take into account the situation of patients to or from other Member States.
This is a particular area where Community on health services could help to improve the situation.
As Parliament is aware, we have recently launched a public consultation regarding Community action on health services.
This public consultation explicitly addresses issues directly linked to patients' rights.
Depending on the outcome of the consultation, issues relating to patients' rights could be addressed through proposals for Community action in 2007, whilst of course respecting subsidiarity.
Whether this would be a legislative proposal or rather take the form of a charter on patients' rights will depend, as I have said, on the results of the consultation.
I look forward to listening to the views of Members in today's debate.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner will not have long to listen to us, but very briefly, there are three rights: the right to treatment, the right to humane and effective treatment, and the right to be involved in decisions affecting one's treatment.
I look forward to seeing the Commissioner's proposals being brought forward very soon, in particular where mental health is concerned.
With regard to the right to safe treatment and care, the fact that 10% of hospitalisations result in medical error; the fact that we have hospital bugs such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile; the fact that we have too many needlestick injuries: these are all areas involving patient safety.
That is a right that patients should have.
As regards the right to safe patient mobility, the Commissioner has said that he is bringing forward proposals in that area which we look forward to receiving.
Among the rights that he will include in that, I am sure, will be the rights to have proper checks on health professionals and on the facilities, hospitals and clinics to which people may be going.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice is being asked more and more frequently to rule on matters concerning the rights of patients who receive treatment in Member States other than their own, and the resulting case law could take the place of the democratic decisions that our institutions should be taking on this matter.
For this reason, I welcome the Commissioner's initiative.
My fear, however, is that the rights established through the proposals you are able to make to us will not become effective in practice for want of adequate frameworks in the Member States.
I am therefore going to ask you a few questions.
How do you intend to realise in practice the universal right to health care to which you referred and equality of access within the European Union, given the well-known gulfs between the health levels and between the health-care structures in individual Member States?
We recently reviewed the breast-cancer situation and regrettably reached the collective conclusion that the recommendations made by the European Union on prevention had not been acted upon in some Member States, to the detriment of the patients concerned.
As far as obesity is concerned, you indicated yourself a few days ago that, if self-regulation did not work, the European Union would take legislative action.
There are also proposals from Members of this House on the question of mental health and on the possibility of legislation in that area.
Do you not think that the European Union should take the lead today on health matters?
It must show greater ambition and, in particular, raise the general quality of health systems, though not neglecting, of course, the parallel issues, for we are well aware of the adverse effects that poor living conditions can have on people's health.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we are truly delighted that this important debate is taking place so promptly after a question on patients' rights was tabled by several ALDE Group members, which was in fact initiated by Dr Parvanova, a Bulgarian Observer colleague.
We are also very grateful to Commissioner Kyprianou for the genuine interest and concern he has shown in speedily and efficiently dealing with the question on patients' rights in the EU.
With regard to the Commission statement which is the subject of this debate, we take the view that it should cover areas like recognition that comparable standards of healthcare and a common set of patients' rights should be discussed at EU level in order to have the added value of the internal market on healthcare issues, and in order to empower patients to fully recognise and exercise their rights.
Furthermore, we have always believed that in the discussions on patients' rights in Europe, the Commission should take into account previous work done by civil society organisations in respect of drafting the European Charter of Patients' Rights.
(SK) I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue.
In the European Union the very notion of 'patients' rights' is purely theoretical, as there is considerable legal uncertainty in this area.
With regard to transborder healthcare provision, patients' rights have been shaped exclusively by the rulings of the European Court of Justice, and that only since 1998, when the ECJ ruled in the Kohll vs. Decker case.
We cannot expect the public to be familiar with the fact that on 16 May 2006 the Court of Justice ruled in the case of Yvonne Watts, clearly stating that where waiting times are exceedingly long and the patient's life is at risk, the patient has the right to receive treatment abroad and to have treatment-related costs reimbursed in the home country.
The average citizen is often unaware of such rulings.
We need legislation which is binding on the Member States, and which will communicate to patients all they need to know about how to find a medical specialist abroad, as well as details of healthcare reimbursement procedures.
We can derive some hope from the health services directive referred to in the Commission's communication, although it is still premature to talk about when this directive might be adopted.
I would like to point out that members of the public may submit comments on this communication up until 31 January 2007.
At the same time, the quality of healthcare and the availability of up-to-the-minute techniques and theories vary among the Member States.
We must offer patients the opportunity to choose where they want to be treated, as unduly long waiting lists may keep people waiting until they die.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this debate and to thank Mrs Parvanova, without whose question this debate would not have been possible.
Commissioner, you have instituted a public consultation process on the issues surrounding patient mobility.
That is the perfect way to clear up questions such as: what gaps in the legislation are there in an internal market for health services that is, in fact, not a real internal market at all?
What shape could common standards on patient rights in Europe take?
What access do patients have to information, and not just information in relation to their rights, but also in relation to their medication?
At present, information of this nature is restricted in Europe, as we all know, and represents a fundamental obstacle to good health.
What arrangements would health tourism bring about when correctly implemented, and what aid opportunities and productivity would it bring the European Union?
We should think of Europe as a single health area.
That should be our vision.
Perhaps the public consultation process could be the first step in the right direction.
Mr President, I should like to thank the House for the debate.
We have the opportunity to exchange views on different occasions, and this is a very important issue.
I will be able to offer more specific replies after the end of the consultation process which, as I have already mentioned, is taking place now.
However, all the issues mentioned by Mr Bowis and other colleagues - the right to treatment, patient safety, patient mobility - are not only part of this consultation process but also in different initiatives as well.
As you know, we have these on patient safety for example or to deal with inequalities.
Part of the debate in this consultation process will also deal with the issue of quality and standards and whether we should introduce European Union level standards on healthcare.
Those are part of the questions that we will be discussing.
This is also linked to the serious problem of inequalities that exist on health, not just between Member States, but even within Member States.
To a certain extent, patient mobility can address some of these problems, but this is not always the solution.
The target should always be to raise as much as possible the level and the standard in the Member States.
Whatever we discuss we should always bear in mind that patients would rather be treated at home where their families and friends are and where they speak the language.
As to the tools, I believe we will be using all possible and available instruments.
It is a complex issue that will require a comprehensive approach and there will be a package of measures, some of which will be legislation - when it comes to creating and offering legal certainty we need to resort to legislation.
As I have said, it is a big and complicated issue that will require a step-by-step approach, but I am optimistic enough to hope that we will be able to present the first proposal before the end of next year.
That will be just the first step.
Others will follow.
Finally, an important aspect of this process will be to create informed and empowered patients - informed as to treatment, medicine, the possibilities of cross-border healthcare and how to choose a physician.
All these are important aspects, otherwise, all the other rights, unless we have an informed patient, will not be taken advantage of and will not be of benefit to the patient.
This is also an important part of our initiative and effort.
As I have said, we are now in the middle of the consultation process.
Today we have had our first ministerial reflection process specifically on this issue.
We will continue the consultation process until the end of January and after that we will be able to discuss it in more detail with Parliament as well.
I am also looking forward to receiving Parliament's views on this issue in the consultation process.
I consider this to be just the beginning of the debate and I expect to be able to go into more detail next year.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(NL) Where patient rights within Europe are concerned, this House must try to retain, and strengthen, its leading role.
Much progress remains to be made, though, in the area of information for patients.
The European citizen has the right to be better informed; after all, the right to information for the patient is enshrined in the European Charter for hospital patient rights.
Patients should be better informed about possible medicines and other treatments.
Why should doctors have a monopoly on this information?
What the Liberals want to see is more information provided to the consumers, if I may call them that, and there have been major developments on the medicines front over recent years.
Patients' attitudes have undergone radical change.
More and more of them believe they are entitled to more information, and more and more of them actively look for information about the treatment of their disorder.
Patients want to shoulder some of the responsibility for their own treatment.
In many cases, they seek contact with other patients suffering from the same illness in order to exchange information.
When citizens are fully informed, they probably make other choices, which is something they have every right to do.

AIDS
The next item is the Commission Statement on AIDS.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years considerable progress has been made, broadly speaking, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including better access to effective treatment and to prevention programmes.
Nevertheless, the number of people infected with HIV or dying of AIDS continues to grow.
By the end of 2006, almost 40 million people will have been infected with HIV, 2.6 million more than at the end of 2004.
It is estimated that in 2006 4.3 million people, both adults and children, have been newly infected with HIV, which is 400 000 more than two years ago.
Sub-Saharan Africa remains at the forefront of this epidemic.
More than 63% of all adults infected with HIV now live in Sub-Saharan African countries, and 33% in South Africa.
The biggest increase in the past two years has been observed in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the number of people infected with HIV has risen by 21%.
The continuing growth in the number of newly diagnosed infections in most EU Member States, together with the results of Eurobarometer surveys from 2005, indicate that levels of awareness on epidemics in the EU and in neighbouring countries must be raised as a matter of urgency and that prevention programmes in this field must be strengthened.
The strategy set up by the Commission in 2005 was centred around the priority of strengthening prevention, treatment and care in certain regions.
Despite these disturbing figures, there has been a reduction in the incidence of AIDS in some African and Caribbean countries and in some regions of southern Asia.
It is possible to reverse the trend.
There are more women around the world infected with HIV than ever before.
In 2006, the number of infected women has reached 17.7 million, a million cases more than in the last two years.
The situation in Sub-Saharan African countries is worse still.
Women account for 60% of adults of 15 years and above infected with HIV.
In addition to biological factors, and the fact that women and girls are much more susceptible to becoming infected with HIV, social and economic factors arising from gender inequality and the neglect of their rights also play a part.
Equal rights for women is a key social challenge and an essential prerequisite for even-handed development and increased HIV prevention.
In order that girls and women around the world can gain access to sexual and reproductive health, health services in developing countries must be strengthened so as to establish voluntary counselling, medical examinations, healthcare and support, as part of an all-round package.
Access to medicines and healthcare has improved considerably in recent years, although in most countries it was starting from a very low base.
Thanks to the increased provision of antiretroviral treatment, some 2 million lives have been saved in almost four years and even in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, some 8 000 people have received treatment.
Nevertheless, despite this welcome progress, the situation gives cause for concern, and the international community needs to devote more attention to it.
The Commission is setting up intensive assistance, for partner countries in Africa and elsewhere, geared towards combating epidemics by means of integrating prevention, treatment and care.
HIV/AIDS cannot be viewed as an isolated problem because it highlights all of the major problems facing developing countries, namely restricted access to basic social services, gender inequality, unequal distribution of resources, ineffective public administration and low levels of economic and technological development.
HIV/AIDS is closely linked with malaria and tuberculosis, which are also poverty-related infectious diseases.
HIV/AIDS can only be combated successfully if the partner countries fight against it in the context of efforts to reduce poverty.
The main principle underpinning the European political framework adopted in 2004, and the European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis adopted the following year, is an integrated approach to HIV.
The European Programme for Action must be implemented and coordinated by the Commission, both at State and at worldwide level.
It is indeed the partner countries that are in the best position to decide the most effective way of distributing resources effectively, fairly and transparently among the various initiatives.
Over the course of the years, the Commission has continually increased its resources in the fight against HIV/AIDS in all developing countries, especially in Africa, where it is providing assistance to partner countries via budgetary support in their efforts to address the structural factors underlying the HIV epidemic, such as healthcare reforms and the crisis in the area of human resources in the heath sector.
Among other initiatives, the Commission has also invested a considerable amount of money, EUR 522 million over five years, in the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries from the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
During 2006, the Commission's role in the global fund was fully confirmed by the fact that the board elected a Member of the European Commission to the post of Vice-President of the fund.
The Commission has traditionally taken the lead in efforts to improve access to antiretroviral drugs in developing countries and to ensuring the full availability of treatment and access to prevention for those who need them by 2010, and has played a central role in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical products.
In some cases, there has been a reduction of up to 98%, which has been achieved by means of introducing a price varying mechanism that enables developing countries to pay less for patented medicines while protecting manufacturers from the re-import of these products into open markets where profits can be made.
Also in the framework of the WTO, the Commission is helping the poorest countries, whose production capacity is limited, to exercise their rights to import cheap generic medicines produced with compulsory licences.
The Commission has also increased investment in the research and development of vaccines and other means of prevention, such as microbicides, with a view to broadening the existing range of HIV prevention mechanisms.
The Commission will continue with these efforts to make prevention and treatment fully available to all those who need it by 2010.
As previous speakers have mentioned, the Commission has, in conjunction with the Member States, undertaken to fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic by means of a range of measures aimed at prevention, treatment, support and care.
We are fully aware that the ultimate goal of a generation without AIDS is unattainable without firm political commitment, informed leadership and increased resources at global, national and local levels.
We face a huge challenge: making further progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and ensuring that prevention and treatment will be fully available to all those who need them by 2010.
We urgently need a more balanced strategy aimed at increasing prevention and treatment and ensuring access to affordable treatment, in particular as regards patented second-tier medicines.
We must therefore mobilise the political will for this in Europe.
We must work more closely with the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on developing new methods of prevention, in particular microbicides, which will provide better prevention for women and will ensure that new medicines are more affordable.
The pharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to carry out research and to develop vaccines and other products to combat HIV/AIDS.
Lastly, we must make sure that the partner countries receive long-term reliable funding to support them in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
In this connection, the Commission will continue to work, on a broader scale, with the help of the financial instruments at both national and global levels, including the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
We need strong support and cooperation from all of the EU institutions, however, including Parliament, as they are responsible for the annual allocation of financial resources.
In the fight against HIV/AIDS, we have the opportunity to achieve better results, but this requires political will.
The Commission firmly believes that the ultimate aims, namely a generation without AIDS and making treatment and care available to all those who need it, are attainable.
I look forward to working with Parliament to achieve those aims.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - As we again approach World AIDS Day, we commemorate, we remember friends and we resolve to do more.
We are now commemorating 25 years of AIDS.
We remember the 25 million fellow citizens who have died from AIDS and we think of the 40 million living with AIDS.
Many of them live in Europe and many in neighbouring countries to the east, such as Russia, Kaliningrad and Central Asia, but two-thirds live in sub-Saharan Africa.
We in the north have promised our support.
We have earmarked money for this and then, all too often, lost it again.
Science advances, but we have not yet delivered.
Only 5% of HIV-positive children receive medical help.
Fewer than 10% of the 15 million AIDS orphans receive financial support.
Every year we have a resolution.
A resolution is two things: a form of words and good intentions, or a determination to achieve those ends.
We need to invest in research and trials for the development of AIDS vaccines.
We need to invest in service delivery and education for drugs and therapies, in mothers and children, in preventative campaigns, in health and care professionals and in NGO support teams.
We need to pull out all the stops to meet the UN target of universal access to services, to treatment and to care by 2010, as the Commissioner said.
The year 2010 is not far away, but we are.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, our funding for HIV/AIDS prevention is still running well below target, falling behind by something like USD 12 billion.
Therefore, as the Commissioner said, there is an urgent need for more public and private funding in order to address the shortcomings.
There is no single panacea for HIV eradication, but there has to be more education and more funding for vaccine research and for microbicides, which the Commissioner mentioned.
The development of a vaginal microbicide has to be our immediate priority, and it is predicted that it could be developed and used within five years.
It is the only way for women to have real control over their own sexual health.
It is a method that does not require the consent of a partner.
In addition, AIDS treatments in the developing world will not, and cannot, be sustainable unless there is a supply of the newer versions of generic medicines, which are increasingly needed as drugs-resistant cases of HIV/AIDS become more frequent.
That means we have to be much more audacious in the way we confront the patents that pharmaceutical companies continue to hide behind, making the price of treatment impossible to meet in many developing countries and under the kind of health systems my colleague, Mr Bowis, mentioned.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, I am pleased that the Commission has devoted the first section of this communication to the need to involve civil society in all aspects of combating this epidemic.
This complies with the requirement put forward in the Dublin and Vilnius declarations.
Information and the appropriate services which are provided by easily accessed support centres managed by non-governmental organisations to risk groups in society affected by HIV can significantly slow down the spread of AIDS in a country.
As rapporteur, I am troubled by the fact that in several new Member States the continued existence of such a support centre is currently directly under threat as a result of a lack of financial resources.
It turns out that, prior to accession to the European Union, these centres received multilateral financial support from various existing funds and organisations, including some outside Europe, which now, following the countries' accession to the European Union, consider their charitable missions to be at an end.
Despite the undertaking of the Minister of Health, expressed in the Vilnius declaration, to use national financial instruments as well as EU funds, including Structural Funds, in the struggle against AIDS, in practice this is not happening in several Member States.
In relation to the Structural Funds, the leaders of civil-society organisations point to the impossibility of obtaining cofinancing.
I think that both the Member States and the European Commission need to resolve this issue urgently.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that, in spite of the as yet minimal progress made when it comes to access to treatment, the disease is, unfortunately, not on the decline. On the contrary: in our own countries, in particular, the epidemic has, rather, gained ground.
We are therefore delighted about the consensus taking shape in this House concerning the need definitely to review the TRIPS agreement on access to medicines, since the arrangements provided for within the framework of the Doha round do not, unfortunately, at present permit real access to inexpensive medicines.
That being said, the problem of AIDS is not only a problem of funding and of access to medicines.
It might even be said that the emphasis placed on access to medicines has no doubt eclipsed the need to go on ceaselessly promoting prevention, which is now in decline both in our own countries and everywhere else.
It is therefore essential to resume the prevention and information campaigns via the media, enlisting the help of qualified personnel, as well as on the social and medical networks, with a view to raising people's awareness.
Secondly - and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve - we also need, if we are really to change the situation, to alter cultural practices when it comes to sexuality and, in particular, to protect women and enable women to protect themselves.
Women now constitute 50% of patients, which was not the case at the beginning of the epidemic. They are also affected in an extremely brutal and violent way not only by cruel treatment and other practices that take place in time of war in conflict zones but also by rape, prostitution, trafficking in women and female sexual slavery - all scourges that help facilitate the growth of the epidemic.
Consequently, the way in which the European Union promotes women's rights and equality also constitutes a very effective way of combating the epidemic and focusing on the transmission of the disease from mother to child - a mode of transmission that is rarely mentioned at present.
Innovative solutions do exist in some countries - for example, Malawi - where, by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves - those whose condition has been stabilised - extremely positive results are achieved. This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken countries.
We must therefore make much further progress on all these levels.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner's speech sounds frankly rhetorical: it is full of fine statements, which are not matched by an equally positive role on the part of the European Commission.
As the latest data from UNAIDS demonstrate, the number of HIV infections is continuing to grow and, in some countries, we are even seeing a fresh outbreak of the virus.
Faced with all of this, patented drugs continue to be unaffordable, and the TRIPS agreements are creating an insurmountable obstacle to access to medicines, condemning almost three million people to death each year.
The ones taking advantage of this situation are the multinational pharmaceutical companies, which recorded a 24% increase in their profits in 2005; these multinationals are protected by the US Administration, which has never stopped using its political and commercial weight to influence the negotiations on pharmaceutical patents.
At multilateral level, the Bush administration's agenda is aimed at making the safeguard clauses laid down by the TRIPS agreements unenforceable, clauses which, in the event of a health crisis, would allow the member countries to bypass intellectual property rights and to have access to lifesaving drugs.
However, while the United States can be rightly accused of attacking one of the most basic human rights, that of health care, Europe certainly cannot consider itself blameless.
The inertia shown by the Commission and the Member States when it comes to equipping themselves with a Community regulation that is genuinely able to implement the Doha Declaration must be well and truly condemned.
Commissioner, you said that a few thousand Africans were receiving treatment, but, in Africa, 30 million people are HIV-positive, 6.5 million of whom require treatment.
Tomorrow is World AIDS Day: global civil society is asking once and for all for politics to shoulder its responsibilities, which concern not only the issue of access to medicines but also the funding allocated to prevention and research programmes.
The creation of an international market in generic medicines, supported by a new system of medical research geared towards people's real needs, remains the crucial issue.
For this reason, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that it is crucial for the resolution on which the House will vote to commit the Commission and the Council to: 1) acknowledge the failure of the decision of 30 August 2003; 2) propose within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreements and the new procedures for granting compulsory licences, which must be able to respond swiftly to health emergencies caused by the HIV epidemic; 3) allocate EUR 1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as was already requested by Parliament on 2 December 2004 and ignored by the Commission and the Council; 4) dedicate more resources to research into medicines designed to treat diseases specifically affecting the south of the world and oblige the private sector, which has always benefited from public research, to set aside a reasonable amount of its own research for these neglected diseases.
Too much time and energy has been wasted on making false promises; it is now time to act!
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard many fine words and statements from the Commission, and a fair amount of demagogy from various Members.
We are confronted here with actions that are not outlined in the Commission document, but that are nonetheless necessary.
The fact is, we must take a decisive stand in fighting the spread of drug use, which means zero tolerance, help and rehabilitation for those who are, to all intents and purposes, sick and should be treated as such.
We should not praise sexual promiscuity, which the mass media and opinion leaders today regard and portray as the path to follow.
We need a policy that educates people but that also discourages high-risk behaviour, and a policy of informed parenthood for those affected.
We also need to launch a serious fight against prostitution, which we are very far from doing in our Europe, and we certainly also need to do more in terms of monitoring, testing and, of course, treating and preventing infectious diseases, as described in the document.
We are not on the right track, however, Mr President, when I still hear my fellow Members and when I read speeches preaching 'freedom', freedom that, for society, means inertia and, for civilisation, in this case, means regression.
(PL) Like malaria and other diseases, the current situation regarding AIDS presents a wide range of challenges involving education, prevention, research, care and treatments.
Firstly, proper sexual health education is needed, especially in poor countries.
The issue is promiscuity arising due to social and economic circumstances, which I learned about, for example, on sugar cane plantations in the Dominican Republic.
Economic conditions need to be improved, and social values and rules changed.
This would create the right circumstances for positive changes in sexual behaviour and there would then be an end to morally controversial procedures on human foetuses.
Secondly, scientific research may be expensive and often a financial risk, but it must be carried out: both vaccines and treatment against the viruses need to be found.
For this reason international research groups must be supported.
Thirdly, society needs to care for those afflicted by the virus, and especially for AIDS orphans whose unfortunate situation is the result of other peoples' sexual behaviour.
Fourthly, only a minute percentage of the 40 million individuals infected with the HIV virus currently has access to medication and medical aid.
This is where we have the most opportunities to act.
Medication can be made available to many more carriers if suitable policies are put in place.
(NL) Mr President, the World Fund is already the biggest fund in the worldwide fight against the diseases in question, and I take pride in the fact that the EU accounts for 65% of the contributions to it.
The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has made out a case for the World Fund and has committed to it, which is enormously laudable.
Europe has a responsibility in respect of the rest of the world, and this Fund fleshes out this responsibility.
Let me let you in on a big scandal, though.
Next year, it looks like Mr Barroso will be unable to deliver on his promise to the World Fund.
It appears that the money from the European Development Fund that was earmarked for the World Fund in 2007 has already been spent on other things.
The Commission wants to plug this hole by extracting funds from the general development budget, which means removing funds from the budget for education, gender equality, the fight against poverty and hunger and the fight against child labour.
Surely, Mr President, this cannot be justified to all those people who rely on our support and on the undertakings we have given.
How can the Commission ask us to choose between the fight against deadly diseases and all other things we stand for, which we have made provision for in the budget, on the one hand and the contributions to achieving the Millennium Objectives on the other?
In matters of life and death, it should not be a case of having to make choices.
If you manage to set aside 1 billion for infrastructure and 3 billion for good governance from the European Development Fund for the next few years, then you may be able to scrape together 100 million annually for the World Health Fund.
Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, should free up this 100 million, not at the expense of education, child labour or care for women, but from the European Development Fund.
Maybe we should allocate a little less for infrastructure and these other items.
If you get your priorities right, you are on the right track; if not, you have neglected to do any sound forward planning and have, as a result, caused quite a bit of damage.
I would call on the Commission to have another close look at this.
The availability of antiretroviral therapy does not just bring hope to AIDS sufferers themselves. It also transforms attitudes to AIDS in the wider population.
The knowledge that effective treatment is available is a key factor in encouraging people to be tested for HIV.
The more people are aware of their HIV status, the easier it is to control the spread of the disease.
That is why it is particularly worrying that the price of new, improved and second-line AIDS medicines remains prohibitively high.
It is good news that the price of some established first-line AIDS drugs has come right down, but figures from South Africa and Malawi indicate that up to one in six patients will need to switch to newer drug combinations within three to five years.
What can the Commission do to persuade pharmaceutical companies to register their newer drugs in developing countries and make those newer drugs available at affordable prices?
Failing that, we will soon be back to square one.
The drugs that still work will be unaffordable and donors, including the EU, will effectively be donating to the pharmaceutical industry.
(ES) Mr President, we are still a long way from winning the fight against HIV-AIDS; all we need is political will, however.
The numbers are clear: the vast majority of new infections occur in the developing countries, which means that HIV is one of the main factors slowing down the progress of thousands of settlements and communities.
We are therefore talking about a global emergency, from both health and from social and economic points of view.
We know what the problem is and we know how to prevent it and treat it.
In order to do so, however, we need resources, political responsibility, responsibility on the part of economic sectors and social and cultural responsibility.
For example, amongst other measures, we must guarantee universal access to vital medicines, something which is still not possible due to the greed of certain economic sectors, especially the pharmaceuticals sector, which has no scruples in this regard, and it therefore clearly shares responsibility for mass murder on a global scale.
Furthermore, certain arguments from ultra-conservative sectors against sexual and reproductive health share responsibility for this situation.
For example, given the information we have, to oppose appropriate sex education for everybody, particularly the youngest people, in this day and age, is, however you look at it, an affront against life and dignity, and is quite frankly immoral.
This year once again, therefore, we must call for actions, for commitment, and above all we must demand that promises be kept.
(HU) Mr President, we all know of the importance of the struggle against AIDS, and should be aware of our responsibility in this regard as well.
It is to this that I attribute the fact that my opinion, submitted last week, has received so many proposed amendments.
Last year there were nearly 40 million people on record living with AIDS, and the illness has truly reached every corner of the world.
There are several reasons for its spread.
Lack of information is first among these, but other important factors have been drug use and the lack of preparation on the part of some countries' health care systems.
In my own country, testing was introduced 20 years ago, and it is to this that we owe the fact that the situation is not bad, yet problems are nonetheless present.
The virus is spread 90% through sexual contact and 10% through drug use.
Two further experiences: untreated sexually transmitted infections increase exponentially the risk of AIDS.
People with HIV and AIDS find it much more difficult to obtain suitable medical care, if they are able to get any at all.
The importance of prevention cannot be emphasised enough, and this includes information.
This is especially important among highly vulnerable social groups and for secondary school students.
We must take action.
We have to help countries outside the Union as well, especially in neighbouring areas.
The number of those diagnosed with the infection is constantly growing in some neighbouring countries.
Reciprocal action is in the interests of us all.
An integrated approach is needed, as the Commissioner has also stated, and we must take action.
We all need to be partners in this effort.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution is a step in the right direction.
I should like to add that the fight against AIDS is also an issue of governance, which must be dealt with at local level.
I would remind you that in 2007, that is to say at present, 50% of the world's population live in cities.
In many African cities, prevention and health care require local authorities to be involved in making those same cities more responsive to local needs and in removing social taboos, which are often very powerful.
We must cooperate directly with the cities in order to help them manage their health services and in order to provide them with increased funding.
I should have liked our resolution to have put forward a larger number of practical solutions to be employed on the ground.
We could have asked the Commission to make it easier to offer combined treatments in the form of medicines combining three types of remedy in one and the same capsule - an arrangement that would have greatly simplified the treatment of patients living in areas in which hospitals, medicines and laboratories are few in number.
We must promote the use of such treatments, ladies and gentlemen, as we have a pressing duty: to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shed light on this serious, worldwide problem from a number of perspectives.
I think I can say that no objections have emerged in the debate that would undermine the broad strategic value of this document, in terms of either the ideas in the statement or the definition of the areas for action and the goals we need to achieve.
I should like to emphasise the fundamental idea that the only way to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic is with the kind of coordinated, holistic approach that is currently deployed in the fight against poverty, in other words, preventative mechanisms that incorporate cultural norms, education, common sense, screening and care for the sick, including appropriate treatment.
I think it is safe to say that the current results cannot be regarded as a success.
Neither can we view them as empty words, since the progress that has been made is not inconsiderable.
As for the fund, there has been a significant amount of financing.
The EU is also providing significant resources to finance a range of projects in all countries and there have been some successes.
The TRIPS agreement has been mentioned.
As of this year, medicines can be produced more cheaply.
I mentioned the fact that there have been times when prices have fallen by 98%.
This is indeed noteworthy progress, but in no way could it be called a success.
There is no doubt that we need to redouble our efforts.
I should now like to turn to two specific issues, which I feel require a particular response.
It was mentioned - though I am not sure I have understood correctly - that in the new Member States there are no suitable centres monitoring this epidemic.
This observation is untrue; these centres are everywhere.
If we compared their quality of course, we might find that some are better than others.
Under the European Treaty there are not many possibilities for direct control, but the idea that these centres do not exist has no basis in reality.
A further problem that was mentioned is the financing of the Fund against AIDS.
The Commission has responded to the fact that the Member States are not contributing anything in 2007 by restructuring the resources.
I think that one could debate whether this restructuring process has been carried out in the best possible manner, and whether different approaches might be considered, but I also think that the idea of restructuring was in essence a good one, because AIDS is a problem of massive proportions.
In spite of this I believe that if Member States have undertaken to make certain contributions, which would not be significant amounts in relation to their GDP, they should fulfil that commitment.
The overall amount of money is very significant, but in relation to GDP it is an amount that can be released in the context of national budgets.
It is up to us to channel our efforts into reversing this unacceptable situation, because failure to do so would be unjustifiable and indefensible.
I should also like to emphasise the importance of equal opportunities, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to overcoming this phenomenon and improving the situation.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange quirk of human nature that we push some things into the background and bring others to the foreground.
Take avian flu, for example, and the attention devoted to it.
I do not wish, in any way, to underplay that tragedy, but HIV/AIDS is obviously a vastly more significant problem and yet we are unfortunately not devoting the same level of attention to it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I feel has enabled us to advance further down this path.
We must of course be aware that however much we channel all our efforts into resolving the problem, it is a worldwide problem and the chances of our making progress are thus limited.
However, as the debate has clearly demonstrated, we must do all that we can to make use of those chances.
To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Situation of people with disabilities
The next item is the report by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Parliament's rapporteur on the disability action plan.
I worked closely with disabled people's organisations, the Commission and fellow MEPs, and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for their cooperation.
I should also like to thank the Secretariat and I extend my special thanks to the European Disability Forum.
I also sought advice from another 100 disability organisations across the European Union.
I sincerely hope the report reflects the fact that it was produced not just by me but by the whole committee.
I welcomed the Commission communication, but I felt there were some areas that could be strengthened.
With regard to employment in particular, it is essential first and foremost to implement existing legislation, particularly the 2000 Employment Directive.
I know the Commission is monitoring that closely.
However, certain grey areas need to be clarified, such as reasonable accommodation or reasonable adjustment.
It is also vital that trade unions inform people of their rights under anti-discrimination legislation.
However, whatever we do in terms of employment, it is of little use to disabled people unless they have access to the built environment or to transport facilities.
That is why one of my demands is further legislation on bus and coach travel, similar to that for air travel.
I know the Commission is looking at that as well.
Education and training are also the key to integration.
I have always said that Member States should work towards including children in mainstream education wherever possible, but, at the same time, recognising that some children may not thrive in that atmosphere, especially if there is no proper back-up.
Children's needs must come first.
We also have to address access to information technology.
That means accessible websites.
At the moment, 80% of public websites are not accessible and we must ensure all documents are in accessible formats, particularly Commission and EU documents.
We must also ensure that disabled children and adults have access to sporting facilities.
However, one of the most important areas is the deinstitutionalisation of disabled people, but this needs a sufficient level of Community-based quality services.
We must also destigmatise people with mental health problems.
When we talk about disability, we must remember that we are talking about all forms of disability: people with mobility problems, hearing impairments, visual impairments, mental health problems, learning disabilities, chronic illnesses and other, hidden, disabilities.
That is why I called in my report for a definition of disability.
I welcome the Court of Justice ruling of 11 July, but we must take this forward.
Another milestone was agreement earlier this year on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, for which I was Parliament's rapporteur.
However, we must campaign now for the swift signing and ratification of the Convention.
We must also continue our campaign for a specific disability directive under Article 13 to outlaw discrimination on access to goods and services.
I make no apology for mentioning this repeatedly, and I have called for it in my report yet again.
There is no point in paying lip service to disabled people's rights.
We have to continue the fight for all EU citizens, disabled or non-disabled, to be treated equally.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for including this important issue on the agenda of today's plenary session.
I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission have very similar opinions on the issue of disability.
I should especially like to thank Parliament for its support in developing and implementing the European strategy for the disabled.
This is not solely about providing disabled people with the opportunity to exercise their rights, the right to human dignity, to equal treatment, to freedom from dependence on others and to full integration in the community.
Disabled people must be given the chance to develop their skills, to take part in the life of the community and to be economically active.
The Commission action plan for equal opportunities for the disabled provides a strategic framework for establishing current priorities.
As Mrs Lynne's report emphasises, the Community's policies and activities influence the situation of the disabled in a variety of ways.
In 2003 the Council therefore recommended to the Member States that they comply in full with the action plan when drawing up their policies.
At the end of 2005, I attended a meeting on equal opportunities for the disabled, which launched the second phase of the EU action plan for the disabled 2006-7 and which is addressed in the Lynne report.
First let us look at where things currently stand.
The figures available to the Commission tell their own story.
There are 44.6 million people of working age - that is to say, every sixth EU citizen - with a long-term health problem or disability, according to their own assessment.
Employment among the disabled is no more than 40%, as opposed to 64.2% among those without a disability.
Even among those with disabilities that are relatively less serious, the employment rate is less than 50%.
It has been established that the 43.7% of disabled people could work if they were given adequate assistance.
The Commission's programme for 2006-7 seeks to address this situation.
