By way of a second example, it is striking how the Commission rejects the common initiative of members of national parliaments right across the European Union in favour of the systematic testing of legislative proposals by reference to the subsidiarity principle.
The Commission regards this system as comparable to nothing other than the familiar yellow-card system for which the European Constitution provided.
Consequently, the Commission says that that system, together with the European Constitution, has died a quiet death and that we no longer need to concern ourselves with it.
When it does suit the Commission, though, other documents of the former European Constitution secretly resurface and are even made legally binding.
Accordingly, the regulation on the Fundamental Rights Agency states that this institution is competent to apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that Member States must respect those fundamental rights when EU law is applied.
This strange Charter of Fundamental Rights is a kind of Bon MarchÃ© or Ikea catalogue that entitles everything and everyone to all manner of things, which makes it a particularly dangerous vehicle.
It ought, ordinarily, to have been buried along with the European Constitution, but instead, and by a secret route, the Commission has made it binding.
If the Commission would like to do more than pay lip service to strengthening democracy, it will need to fundamentally change its working practices.
Â Â  Mr President, first I want to thank the representatives of the political parties for their comments and reactions today.
This is the second time the plenary sitting of the European Parliament has considered the Commissionâs 2006 work programme, and I hope that both sides will become a bit wiser as a result of this procedure.
Let me say a few words about the process.
I think it is worth recalling that the current Commission sets its objectives over a five-year period, and a single annual work programme cannot encompass everything that we wish to achieve under our mandate.
Some things will need to be reserved for inclusion in the work programmes in 2007 and beyond.
I remind Members that it is always possible to make an adjustment to the work programme in the mid-term review.
This so-called catalogue of additional items, which has been and will be communicated regularly to the European Parliament, contains information on issues of particular concern to Members, which some of you have mentioned today, that are not necessarily addressed in the priority list.
The Commission has greatly appreciated the new process of involving committees in identifying priorities and discussing the Commissionâs work programme.
It is now taking shape in a more serious way, so that we get into the political priorities and have a real political discussion, which will be very helpful in the future.
In response to Mr Swobodaâs remarks, the Commission will discuss the review of the sustainable development strategy in its meeting this afternoon.
This represents an integrated approach to the objectives of economic prosperity, environmental standards and social cohesion. This approach is built on the idea that these policy areas are mutually supportive.
We continue to pay full attention to social issues.
The work programme includes a green paper on the evolution of labour law, which is expected to launch a wide debate, in which the EU institutions, Member States, social partners and experts will participate.
The aim is to establish conclusions about the main trends in the recent evolution of labour law, both at EU and national level. It will also identify the most crucial and urgent issues to be addressed.
A communication on social services of general interest is still planned for 2006.
I also underline that the Commission, by giving such priority to the renewed Lisbon Strategy, shows a strong commitment to a Europe of solidarity, accompanied by prosperity and employment.
We will continue to put every effort into an effective and credible action by Member States and all stakeholders.
Without a collective effort, the strategy on growth and jobs cannot succeed.
The credibility of our work depends on detailed preparation, including the necessary consultation of stakeholders and the carrying-out of impact assessments, which I know is also of interest to the European Parliament.
I would also like to underline the importance of the Commissionâs dialogue with the other institutions during the preparation of the 2006 work programme.
The many contacts we have had with the European Parliament in the context of the new framework agreement have provided a valuable insight into Parliamentâs expectations of the Commission for the coming year.
When the work programme was being prepared, Parliament presented the Commission with an important list of priorities.
We have also had very constructive contact with the Conference of Presidents in the context of implementing Plan D. I know that both our institutions are committed to realising its objectives.
I take note of the comments you have made today on the Commissionâs 2006 work programme.
The Commission will examine your resolution with great interest and respond accordingly.
Let me again mention my appreciation of the fruitful cooperation we have had in 2005. I look forward to building on it in 2006 to make sure that our work programme is implemented with determination and success.
I also thank you for the comments on the EEA report, which I was pleased to be able to present.
We know the content of that report very well and it has to be taken into account.
I think that, when it comes to combating climate change, the Commission is showing leadership on the world scene.
I do not see any other partner today playing the same role.
Of course, we will continue to strive to ensure the Commission upholds this important role.
We will have to lead the way on this particular issue as well.
Â Â  â I have received three motions for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Tuesday, at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, we had proposed an oral amendment but we will withdraw it now because we are satisfied, for the time being, with the statement of the European Commission, yesterday evening, that it is committed to fighting all forms of discrimination in all Member States and that it is prepared to urge all Member States to allocate the financial resources accordingly.
However, we will keep a close eye on the Commission and the execution of this programme.
We will talk to the Commission again, should it not live up to this promise.
Under that condition, we withdraw the oral amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to ask for clarification.
You stated that Amendments 1 and 2, which we voted on by roll call, had been rejected, but you also said that we needed a qualified majority.
I have counted the votes against, and 328 votes do not add up to a qualified majority.
I ask you to clarify which procedure we are now using.
Â Â  AmendmentsÂ 1 and 2 were put to the vote by roll call.
309Â Members voted in favour, but we need 367Â votes in favour, under qualified majority, for them to be adopted.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues from the various political groups who have worked so hard and effectively to achieve todayâs first-reading compromise package with the Council and the Commission: in particular, Mrs Wallis, Mr Wieland, Mr Lehne, and MrsÂ Berger from my own political group.
The UK Presidency has been very cooperative and has taken on board many of Parliamentâs amendments, which allows us now to vote on this first reading package of the general enacting terms of the European payment order.
That will now help us to speed up and simplify cross-border payments for business.
It will also assist debt recovery.
In short, we know that companies that do not get paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects for staff and suppliers.
A lack of enforcement systems for payment undermines the internal market and business confidence.
There are, however, some outstanding technical issues involved in drawing up the annexes and finalising our recitals that need to be resolved with the Austrian Presidency.
In addition, Mrs Wallis has asked us to look at a technical legal issue related to the âcross-borderâ definition.
I look forward to working with the Austrian Presidency and finalising this very pragmatic law that will assist businesses and citizens in recovering debts, and to a full plenary debate with the Council and Commission and a vote in the New Year.
I urge Members, therefore, to vote for the agreed negotiated package that is before us today at first reading.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like through you to ask Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz why, of the eight or ten people he nominated, only one could be a woman.
Â Â  Your question speaks for itself, Mr Evans.
Â Â  . Mr President, let us hope that the Member States, who have proposed the members of the Court of Auditors, will bear in mind that there should be a better balance between male and female citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, I request that the Wallis report be referred back to the committee in question immediately, since the procedure followed is not complete.
Only the conclusions were put to the vote in committee, but not the arguments.
I call on my fellow Members to support this request, which constitutes significant evidence of transparency and internal democracy.
Â Â  Mr Romagnoli, you do not belong to a political group; you are a non-attached Member.
You are therefore not in a position to make that request.
It just shows how important it is to belong to a group, especially a large one!
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of equality and rights, I feel that this Parliament shows a certain intolerance towards opinions that are not to its liking.
Yesterday I heard a minister of my countryâs government and even our supreme court attacked, with many respects paid to the much-extolled independence of the judiciary, because it was considered that certain expressions â which were perhaps disagreeable and perhaps impolite â were definitely offensive.
Nonetheless, mentioning somebodyâs ethnic origin or certain characteristics does not always constitute a crime of racism.
In this Parliament, however, it seems to be taboo to talk about certain subjects.
I believe that everyone has the same rights, including the right to freedom of opinion.
Â Â  In all 18 reports, the rapporteurs have proposed that the European Parliament be given a role in appointing the various agenciesâ Executive Directors and in extending their terms of office.
Quite apart from the fact that we very much question the justification for many of the agencies, the June List does not share the view that the European Parliamentâs influence should be increased in this area, since such an increase would entail greater supranationalism.
We have thus voted against the reports.
Â Â  Mr President, the truth about the Roure report is that it again plays us the same old tune that we have heard for years and that was continually in our ears during the recent immigrant riots in France, namely that the constant problems involving immigrants in our countries are down to us and us alone, to be blamed on the repugnant Europeans who discriminate always and everywhere.
It is a tune that is also being echoed in this report and that is a far cry from reality.
If we want to talk about discrimination and lack of equal opportunities in Europe, let us also mention the call from women in the Islamic communities.
In many suburbs in my own country, in Brussels, for example, women are these days systematically abused or called whores by Islamic immigrants who want to inflict their prejudices on us.
Let us turn our attention to this, to the time bomb of the multicultural society that puts the basic achievements of our society at risk.
Â Â  Mr President, I read in the Roure report that one of the messages to be sent out in the course of 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is that everyone is entitled to equal treatment.
The promotion of respect and tolerance is also high on the agenda.
Given the politically correct tenor of the report and given past experience, I will entertain few illusions about the Commissionâs intention to make it clear, to Europeâs Islamic communities in particular, that violence against Jews and discrimination against women are unacceptable.
A study in 2002 showed, for example, that anti-Semitic behaviour is particularly rife among Muslims.
Since this is, of course, not in keeping with the politically correct image that we have, this reportâs conclusions were confined to the waste paper basket.
The most prevalent and blatant cases of discrimination are covered up with the mantle of love.
No one has ever died of hypocrisy, of course.
Â Â  . The Treaty of Amsterdam represented enormous progress in the fight against discrimination, in that it broadened the concept to areas other than equality between men and women.
The principle of equality and non-discrimination is one of the core fundamental rights that lie at the heart of the EU.
This proposal designates 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, with the aim of promoting equality and eliminating all forms of discrimination.
The idea of setting up this initiative was born out of the evaluation of the results of the Green Paper on Equality and Non-Discrimination in an Enlarged European Union.
It will help to promote three priorities: information and awareness-raising; analysis and monitoring of the impact of anti-discrimination legislation; and networking between the people involved in the fight against discrimination.
The promotion of equal opportunities is a crucial factor in achieving a more cohesive, competitive and dynamic society, and a means of reaping the benefits of diversity.
We must therefore spread this kind of awareness-raising initiative in order to combat discriminatory attitudes and to ensure that the citizens are kept informed about their rights and obligations.
It should act as a kind of campaign to exert pressure on those Member States dragging their feet in transposing the directives.
Â Â  . At a time when discrimination, inequality and social injustice are on the rise, we welcome the reaffirmation that non-discrimination is a fundamental principle, which must be upheld in all policy areas, be they economic, social or cultural.
This falls short, however, of what is required in light of the seriousness of the social situation in various EU countries.
Although the report mentions the need for rights and equal opportunities to be upheld, for broader involvement and for increased knowledge and awareness of rights â ones, we would add, that have been acquired or lost or have yet to be won â it fails to condemn the determining factors behind failure to comply with these principles.
Workers are currently facing a concerted onslaught against their social rights and gains â an onslaught that is promoted at EU level by means of awareness-raising and propaganda, and by means of the containment measures that are put forward â and the actual impact of the capitalist onslaught will be felt.
What we are seeing, in other words, is the most blatant exploitation and the destruction of public services, which are being taken over by private capital, leading in turn to poverty and social injustice.
The way to ensure equal opportunities is to fight against the policy that undermines them.
Â Â  .âEqual opportunities for all.
Towards a just society.â
Who would dare speak out against such a report?
It ought even to attract steadfast unanimous support with a title like that.
The problem is this: where equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination are concerned, we are constantly trying to outdo ourselves.
Does this report really add anything new aside from the usual litany of concepts and slogans relating to conventional egalitarian thinking and to non-discrimination?
In fact, the rapporteur proposes the creation of a European Year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007, which would be a âgenuine tool for raising awareness among, and providing information to, the European publicâ.
What a departure!
Once again, equality is provided for through force and through the introduction of quota systems and of positive discrimination.
We cannot go along with that because it is a question here of the very denial of equal opportunities and equal treatment.
We are also against the European Union being able to impose sanctions in the event of a Member State not complying with the provisions laid down in a Community directive.
It is a question here of national powers and sovereignty in criminal matters; these cannot be restricted or delegated.
Â Â  . Equal treatment is enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam and is a fundamental right belonging to every citizen.
In order to take stock of the progress that has been made in fighting discrimination and to gather opinions on how the Union might step up its action in this area, the Commission set up a broad consultation in the form of a Green Paper entitled âEquality and Non-Discrimination in an Enlarged EUâ in May 2004.
This Green Paper gave rise to the idea of setting up a âEuropean Year of Equal Opportunities for Allâ in 2007, an initiative with four objectives, namely to raise public awareness, to encourage debate, to celebrate diversity and to promote respect and tolerance.
The EU now has legislation in the field of combating discrimination, yet many citizens do not know that such legislation exists or know little about it.
As such, I welcome a media event on the scale of a âEuropean Yearâ being organised, in that it is an excellent tool for raising awareness among, and providing information to, the European public.
The European Year is also a means of exerting pressure on Member States that are dragging their feet in terms of transposing directives on equality.
Â Â  . While it is true that, from a legal point of view, discrimination â on whatever grounds â is being comprehensively combated, it is impossible to confirm with any certainty that all discrimination is being prevented and combated on the ground.
The Commission believes that a European Year of Equal Opportunities would be a positive step in this regard.
I have never been keen on big events as a way of resolving problems.
I have always feared that promoting international years or days for one cause or another might in fact have a detrimental effect, in that they only succeed in offloading ignorance of the problem onto other days and years.
There is an increasingly widely held view, however, that there is much to be gained from such initiatives in terms of increased visibility for the cause in question.
I believe that the subject of the event dealt with in this report falls into that category and accordingly voted in favour.
Â Â  . As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome Mrs Roureâs outstanding report.
Since, the âEurodacâ and âDublin IIâ regulations are not part of the development of the Schengen , Denmark cannot resort to an opt-in to participate in those regulations.
Hence the need for an international agreement between the Community and Denmark, along with a Protocol to the Agreement between the Community, Iceland and Norway.
These proposals are aimed at extending to Denmark the provisions of the Eurodac system and the procedure for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.
This is a welcome step, although such agreements should be concluded under special circumstances and for a limited period of time.
These situations raise major question marks regarding the differing guarantees which asylum seekers will enjoy depending on whether their asylum application is dealt with in Denmark or in one of the countries participating in the European asylum policy.
This is because Denmark will be implementing these two regulations but staying outside of other measures in this area.
I share the rapporteurâs view that the applicable legal basis should be the second subparagraph of Article 300(3), namely that Parliament should have been consulted under the assent procedure.
Â Â  . This proposal warrants our agreement.
The activities of the different fleets of the Member States operating under the fisheries agreements and protocols between the EU and third countries should not be interrupted for administrative reasons, such as the lengthy negotiations and the legal ratification procedures to which those agreements are subject.
These interruptions often last several months, which means that vessels lie idle, fishermen are unemployed, and problems are created in the supply of fisheries products at national and Community level.
This proposal makes it possible for third countries to issue fishing licences on the date laid down in the exchange of letters between the two parties, even if the Council decision has yet to be adopted.
We hope that this proposal will enter into force at the earliest opportunity, and that its implementation will ensure that the fleets can remain in operation or at least that the current periods of inactivity will become shorter.
In any event, it should not be the fishermen who foot the bill for the lengthy negotiations and renewal of agreements.
Mechanisms for economic and social compensation should be put in place so that the fishermen can survive.
Â Â  . I welcome the report before us for two reasons.
Firstly, it is clearly much-needed in order that administrative and bureaucratic difficulties do not exacerbate the problems facing the fishing industry.
The other reason why I have lent my backing to this report is that, as the rapporteur says, this entire process is excessively bureaucratic, inefficient and unjustified.
I would even go so far as to say that this whole plethora of agreements and provisional licences, implemented by means of a terribly cumbersome mechanism, verges on the Kafkaesque in its absurdity.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur that the situation is ripe for review.
The competitiveness of a European industry such as fisheries must not be constrained by the bureaucratic inefficiency of the Communityâs institutions.
Â Â  The EU has an important role to play in strengthening democracy and human rights in the countries in its immediate neighbourhood.
Enlargement contributes to this positive development.
We are therefore voting in favour of MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶mâs report.
We are, however, opposed to the attempt to use the EUâs Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument for strengthening and developing the common foreign and security policy.
Nor do we believe that the instruments should be used for extending the EUâs sphere of interest to areas that cannot be described as its neighbourhood.
Â Â  . The goodwill and good intentions underpinning the programme under discussion are naturally worthy of my support.
As for whether or not it is being implemented effectively, I must say I have my doubts.
Nevertheless, given that we are discussing a provisional programme, I feel that our priority in shaping the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) should be the timely adoption of this programme, with the new framework with which it is now equipped.
Our efforts should also be channelled into revising and, more importantly, evaluating past programmes.
The EUâs external policy, which is at the root of this issue, must work efficiently, and one can only discover whether efficiency is being achieved by examining results.
This should therefore be one of our major priorities in the coming legal steps taken on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the important objectives of European environmental policy is the prompt introduction into the EU of systems for collecting batteries.
It is unfortunate that Amendment 26 was not accepted, and the target we are now setting ourselves is a certainly less ambitious one.
The fact is, though, that the introduction of recycling quotas will enable us to achieve very high environmental standards, and we will be able to reuse raw materials.
The bans on nickel, cadmium and lead are also means towards this end, enabling us to exert pressure in favour of the replacement of hazardous substances, while nonetheless allowing a small number of exceptions.
Â Â  . UKIP cannot support amendments that are tabled with the purpose of increasing restrictions on Member States.
UKIP take environmental issues very seriously, however, we cannot accept that the EU impose legislation on Member States and believe these decisions should be taken at national level.
Â Â  . On Amendments 1 and 2 to the Blokland report on batteries and accumulators, I have decided to vote in favour of a single environmental legal base of Article 175 EC.
As with the debate on the fluorinated gases regulation, although this is a less clear cut example, I have concerns about the lack of certainty we are introducing into our legislation through dual legal bases following ECJ judgments in this area.
What industry needs more than anything is legal certainty and, given the precedent case law, this is not the direction in which we are going.
Article 175 has inbuilt safeguards (in Article 176 EC) against unilateral trade distorting decisions that may be protectionist in nature rather than environmentally justifiable.
It is not necessary to complicate EC legislation further by founding it on multiple legal bases.
Â Â  .
I support the views and objectives of the batteries directive, but two points must be borne in mind.
First, recycling targets must be realistic and achievable and practical for both retailers and the public, which is why I did not support some amendments tabled by the rapporteur and others.
Second, it is clear that nickel-cadmium batteries only contribute between 1% and 3% of cadmium in the environment compared to 27% from fertilizers.
The drive to outlaw them seems driven by a refusal to confront this statistic in the interests of certain national battery manufacturers and the inability to confront public misconceptions as to the real situation of cadmium pollution.
I have no problem burdening industry where there are real advantages to improving environmental standards, but such perverse decisions like today's only threatens support for future environmental legislation and public support.
Â Â  The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety makes it clear that the purpose of this directive is, in the first place, to limit the use of heavy metals in batteries and accumulators.
The position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety contains clear priorities and clarifies the objectives of the directive.
The June List supports EU efforts regarding cross-border environmental issues.
Heavy metal emissions are one such issue.
We have thus voted in favour of this report and, overall, we support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on this issue.
We are not, however, in favour of individual amendments.
We are, for example, critical of the European Parliamentâs stating that public information campaigns on the collection and recycling of batteries should be conducted and of its putting forward views on how such campaigns are to be paid for (Amendment 33).
We have every confidence that the Member States are capable independently of meeting the requirements laid down by the directive.
Individual Member States must decide whether information campaigns, research or other measures are needed in order to achieve this aim.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted in the way that I did on various amendments on the Blokland report on batteries, accumulators and their waste because I believe that this directive will reduce heavy metal waste from batteries and improve recycling in my London constituency.
I support the prohibitions in the common position and believe that any further prohibitions must be the subject of full impact assessments.
I also believe that recycling targets should be realistic and achievable and collection systems practicable for retailers and the public and cannot therefore support some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and other colleagues.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, which forms part of a balanced approach to environmental protection, consumer protection and the promotion of energy efficiency.
Of all the aspects mentioned in the report there is one that deserves particular focus.
I am generally in favour of a free and open economy in which there is complete access to information â or at least in which such access is promoted â given that consumers only have true freedom of choice when they are provided with information.
This report prioritises the provision of information to consumers, and that led me to vote in favour.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the adoption of a new European directive on batteries and accumulators and on the management of their waste.
This is a text with a twin objective in an area in which the disparities between the 25 Member States are huge: on the one hand, to make batteries and accumulators cleaner by substantially restricting any traces of heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury in them and, on the other, more effectively to organise the collection and recycling of these products.
Belgium can, I might add, take pride in a system serving as a model in Europe: the country has a 59% collection rate, where a large number of Member States are languishing at rates below 10%.
By drawing inspiration from the successful experiments carried out by the Member States, this directive sets ambitious targets in terms of collection: 40% after six years and 60% in ten yearsâ time.
These are targets that cannot be achieved without a balanced policy taking account of the economic chain from every angle and including in the economic chainâs scope each and every actor: from the producer to the consumer, via the distributors.
This is a basic rule so that, in future, we can produce better and collect more in Europe, for the sake of the environment and consumers.
Â Â  .Â Â The soon-to-be-repealed Directive 91/157/EEC, which sets targets for the recovery and disposal of accumulators, formed part of the body of environmental legislation incorporated into the accession treaties following negotiations.
The European Commission is currently proposing that a new system be put in place for the collection, processing and neutralisation of battery and accumulator waste.
Poland has transposed the provisions of the previous Directive into national legislation, and is now in the process of implementing it.
All of a sudden, however, new solutions are being proposed and collection targets being set that are much higher than before.
There can be no question that this is the right way to guarantee safety and to make the environment in Europe cleaner, but this process should be compatible with the solutions that have been implemented to date.
It is an unfortunate fact that most of the rapporteurâs amendments are not backed up by any studies or assessments of the impact that the new directive will have on business development in this sector.
After all, it is business owners who will bear the costs of introducing the new legislation.
The majority of Member States will find it impossible to achieve the collection targets proposed in AmendmentsÂ 26 and 27 of the report.
The new Member States are still at the stage of putting in place complex schemes for spent battery collection, pursuant to the Directive.
There is no rational explanation for collection targets of 40% and 60% at the present time, and the proposal to increase the recycling target to 55% is equally intolerable and unjustified.
Moreover, schemes for effective battery collection necessarily involve awareness raising and the fostering of a culture of battery collection at grassroots level.
What this means is that a long-term approach is needed when proposing new solutions.
Â Â  . There is no doubt that we need to reduce pollution from batteries and improve recycling of batteries.
Nickel-cadmium batteries are particularly polluting.
The compromise on nickel-cadmium is realistic giving a four-year breathing space before a full ban would be introduced.
This would mean that the power tool industry would have time to introduce alternatives which are less polluting.
I hope that there will be no headlines tomorrow saying that the EU bans power tools.
Â Â  Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am relieved that the outcome regarding the energy services directive improved in negotiations with the Council.
The Council thus adopted a realistic approach to the proposals by Parliament and the Commission.
I hoped that this directive would be an opportunity to correct the distortions of competition which the failed emissions trading directive entails.
I opposed common savings targets binding on all Member States right to the last, because I saw them as punishing countries where energy savings measures had already been practised for a long time.
It is perhaps paradoxical, but when we treat Member States the same way, we give them unequal status.
For some, the Commissionâs proposed target was actually quite tough, while for others it was ridiculously easy.
It would have been a competition-distorting factor in the single market.
A criterion of savings measures now is cost-effectiveness, which gives Member States some much needed leeway.
This is my interpretation of the outcome.
Now there will not be any over-prioritisation of measures: instead, voluntary agreements, for example, could also be employed.
The final outcome will also carry a risk, however, if the comitology procedure does not adhere to reason and fairness as the guiding principle.
There is a risk of excessive bureaucracy.
The method by which we should start to calculate savings needs to be fair and flexible, and it should above all treat fairly those countries where savings have already been made for years.
Â Â  . The compromise for which the House voted was a step back from the initial proposals, although attempts to achieve greater energy end-use efficiency are to be welcomed.
We therefore backed the measures that sought to implement that objective effectively.
The final proposal acknowledges the key role that the public sector can play in this area, for example by setting up energy efficiency pilot projects, awarding public contracts, establishing energy efficiency criteria and, in its investments, offering incentives for meeting energy efficiency improvement targets.
Nevertheless, it places the accent on free competition.
Accordingly, our decision to abstain from the final vote was based on our objection to Amendment 60, which as much as anything is entirely out of place.
We cannot accept that, when it comes to energy efficiency, the accent is placed on market liberalisation, as in the report, which emphasises âequal competition and a level playing field for all energy suppliersâ.
We feel that this is a key sector in which the State should remain the key player.
Â Â  We have voted against all the amendments since we do not believe that the European Parliament should have views on the actual way in which energy is to be saved in the Member States.
This matter is best dealt with by the Member States themselves.
Â Â  . The EU must be more proactive when it comes to energy efficiency, both from the point of view of being true to its word and its stance on environmental issues, as in Kyoto, and in terms of economic and environmental common sense.
In areas such as this, the emphasis should, to my mind, be placed on efficiency and common sense.
These should be the very cornerstones of our environmental and energy policies.
Â Â  . Draft amending budget NoÂ 8/2005, amended by the amending letter of 16Â NovemberÂ 2005, is worrying because it cancels the original extra payment request of EURÂ 650Â million for the Structural Funds â bearing in mind that EURÂ 380Â million had already been obtained via transfers from other headings â and cuts the same amount from aid in respect of agricultural markets.
The alarming part is that the appropriations used and the few applications received from the new Member States fall way short of full use of the structural appropriations available.
Indeed, we are nearing the end of the current financial framework and the so-called N+2 rule will apply, whereby authorisation expenses are automatically cancelled when they are not implemented within two years.
The return of own resources to the Member States will rise to around EURÂ 3.9Â billion, which will naturally benefit the main net contributors.
What we want to see is conditions put in place for complete, effective implementation of the Structural Funds.
These returns will once again make it possible to tackle the constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby helping to reduce deficits in some countries.
Â Â  . In this vote I abstained on Amendment 11 because of London constituency concerns.
Â Â  .The proposed procedure reveals some significant legal shortcomings.
The procedure takes place in two stages:
1.
Firstly, after a request has been made, the judge issues a European payment notification to be served on the debtor, who has three weeks in which to submit a statement of defence.
2.
Secondly, in the absence of a statement of defence, a European order for payment is delivered.
According to the authors, this two-pronged approach is justified by the potential risk involved in issuing an irreversible claim at the outset.
In aiming to simplify the procedure and to safeguard the debtorâs rights, it would therefore seem wiser to keep just the one stage, that is to say to provide for the delivery of the European order for payment at the outset and to make it enforceable.
In return:
- the time limit for lodging a statement of opposition must be extended;
- and this time limit must only begin when the debtor has actually received the notification.
That is why we reject Amendment 12, which allows a defendant to be sentenced without his or her being able to know the decision.
Finally, the choice proposed in Amendment 20 between the notice being served by a bailiff or being delivered by post should not exist.
The notice must be served by a bailiff, given the flaws in the postal systems in certain countries, such as France.
Â Â  . There is enormous economic benefit to be gained from simplifying and speeding up procedures, as countries that benefit from legal systems that are both replete with safeguards and prompt are well aware.
A European procedure for issuing payment orders is a step forward in this regard, because it would promote greater legal certainty in business transactions and better justice, as proven by similar national instruments.
As various Member States have said, however, there is a need to ensure that the remit of such a procedure would not go beyond what is reasonable and feasible in terms of cooperation between sovereign Member States.
With the above in mind, I voted in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that a grave injustice has been committed today in not upholding MrÂ Gollnischâs immunity, since â and I will not go into the merits of what he said â he was speaking as a Member of the European Parliament.
We ought to be protected â and I deliberately say âwe ought to beâ rather than âwe areâ â when we speak as Members of this Parliament, regardless of what we say.
This would not be the first time that a Member had enjoyed protection when speaking, writing or intervening outside Parliament.
That has not applied in MrÂ Gollnischâs case, however, probably not because of what he said but because of his political affiliation, which is disliked by someone who has forgotten that all of us in this House have equal dignity and equal rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have democratically and transparently succeeded in extracting a few seconds from you in the only way possible for a Member who does not belong to one of the so-called large groups.
That does not remove the fact that the instrument of parliamentary immunity should be subject to very different rules.
What I said before is a very serious matter, and all Members, irrespective of the ideas and political aims that they represent, should bear it very much in mind.
What is happening today to MrÂ Gollnisch â just because he dared to make statements with which others did not agree during a debate in which he was speaking as a Member of this House â could happen to them one day.
It is disgraceful.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted against the suspension of Mr Gollnischâs parliamentary immunity, regarding as I do his prosecution as an undisguised attempt at character assassination waged against one who is a non-conformist both as a Member of this House and as an academic.
Free expression of opinion is guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 19 of the Charter of Human Rights and Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights â something that the majority in this House has evidently forgotten.
Mr Gollnisch addressed a political press conference in Lyons on 11 October 2004, and he did so, self-evidently, as a politician who is first and foremost a Member of the European Parliament.
One may well find the historical statements he made on that occasion reprehensible, but they were of course made in his capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, and as such he ought, under the terms of every law on the subject, to enjoy the protection of immunity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, parliamentary immunity is designed to protect Membersâ freedom of expression.
According to the settled case-law of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs, therefore, it is laid down as a basic principle that, when the actions for which a Member has been criticised form part of his or her political role or are directly linked to it, then immunity is not withdrawn.
That includes â again, according to this case-law â the expression of opinions said to be closely bound up with a Memberâs political activity, opinions that are voiced at demonstrations, at public meetings, in the context of political publications, in the press, in a book, on the television and even before a court of law.
In our colleagueâs, MrÂ Gollnischâs, case, there is no doubt whatsoever that this well-defined case-law has been unfairly circumvented in this House.
MrÂ Gollnisch is in the wrong where the law is concerned because he is in the political minority.
You have a âvariable-geometryâ take on the law.
What are you doing in this place where the values and the principles of democracy and of the law are embraced?
Because the parliamentary immunity of our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, has not been defended today, this Assembly is unworthy of the principles it proclaims â unworthy of them, and unjust!
Â Â  MrÂ President, the majority of this Parliament has just decided, for political reasons, not to defend my immunity.
I do, however, note with satisfaction that my defence was supported by a large number of fellow Members not belonging to my political group, and I am all the more satisfied because all of the allegations featured in MrsÂ Wallisâ preliminary draft report have disappeared, as was insisted on by the majority of the committee, no doubt to ease its conscience.
This decision was taken for an absurd and unusual reason: I am alleged to have voiced my opinion outside the context of my parliamentary activities, something that is untrue.
In the current political circumstances, though, the fact that I have succeeded in eliminating all the passages that might have been hostile to me in relation to the content of my remarks is a semi-victory.
With hypocrisy being the homage vice pays to virtue, I consider the procedural trick used by my political opponents to be the proof of the awkward position they are in â âawkwardâ being a weak term â in relation to the content of this matter.
The fact remains that all this comes at the very time when a large number of voices, including those of MrÂ de Villepin, MrÂ Chirac and âŠ
Â Â  You have had one minute, Mr Gollnisch.
These explanations of vote are for one minute only.
One of the remarks you made and for which your immunity has been lifted was 'it is up to historians to discuss whether the gas chambers existed'.
That remark encourages me once again to go and visit the camp of Natzweiler-Struthof in the Vosges mountains, which I shall do in January.
This is not the , Mr Gollnisch. It is the European Parliament.
The floor now goes to Mr Vanhecke.
Â Â  Mr President, I am, quite frankly, disgusted by the idea of this House, in the present circumstances, awarding the Sakharov Prize given the level of hypocrisy, because not only does lifting Mr Gollnischâs parliamentary immunity bring shame on this House, it is also detrimental to democracy.
We need not even go into the detail of the matter, because anyone who calls himself a democrat must in the first place hold dear the right of free expression of opinion on the part of all those with whom they disagree.
This House has a habit of upholding parliamentary immunity; that Mr Gollnischâs is now being lifted is something I find frightening.
Clearly, the world is not yet rid of the Robespierres, the Freislers, the Berias and their cowardly accomplices in this House.
Â Â  Mr President, I have voted against the Wallis report because it goes against the tradition that Parliament does not address the question of whether immunity should be lifted where opinions constituting an offence are expressed, or are alleged to have been expressed.
If we go down this road, we might as well abolish the concept of parliamentary immunity itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this report, which concludes that the immunity of our colleague, MrÂ Gollnisch, should not be upheld, disregarded all of the general principles related to privileges and immunity, as well as the settled case-law of the competent committees.
The report also engaged in an out-and-out witch hunt, thus conveying the position of the French judicial and political authorities, because there was no reason at all why MrÂ Gollnisch should not have made the remarks he did about the Second World War at the press conference held after the summer recess.
They were improperly and scandalously taken out of context.
If these same remarks had, in actual fact, been made by someone else, they would not have provoked an outcry; they would not even have been revisited.
Proof of this was recently provided by MrÂ Chirac, the French Head of State.
This entire matter has all the hallmarks of sordid political manipulation, with the sole aim of removing an irreproachable man from the political scene.
Â Â  I should like to point out that I find Mr Gollnischâs remarks offensive.
Â Â  .At a press conference held on 11 October 2004, MrÂ Gollnisch made remarks seemingly questioning the existence of the gas chambers.
These crimes are nevertheless historical facts.
To deny or to dispute this is a crime.
It is up to French law to give its verdict in accordance with the Gayssot law, which forbids public speeches disputing the existence of crimes against humanity.
Obviously, freedom of expression must be guaranteed for a Member of Parliament.
Yet, the issue at stake in this vote is that of bringing a man, a university lecturer, face to face with his responsibilities.
That is why I will vote in favour of withdrawing MrÂ Gollnischâs parliamentary immunity.
For the very large majority of MEPs, this vote conveys a message: revisionism has no place in the Europe of ânever againâ.
Â Â  .Bizarrely, a crucial aspect of the affair of our colleague, MrÂ Gollnisch, which was nonetheless present in the first three drafts of MrsÂ Wallisâ report, has disappeared in the final version.
This point refers to .
This is the presumption that criminal proceedings are brought about with the intention of prejudicing the Memberâs political activity.
One of the principles of the European Parliament is that immunity is not withdrawn when there is a suspicion that the motive behind the criminal proceedings is the intention to prejudice the Memberâs political activity.
Well, evidence of such nevertheless abounds in this affair.
It is not a question here of simple guesswork.
The intrusion of political power in this matter is evident in the intervention of the then Minister for Justice, MrÂ Perben, who is a direct political opponent of MrÂ Gollnisch, given that MrÂ Perben is standing in the municipal elections in Lyon.
It is he who personally ordered the start of proceedings, even though the investigation had cleared MrÂ Gollnisch.
The Attorney General of Lyon acknowledged this in a communiquÃ© issued at the time by the entire press corps.
It is therefore unclear why the rapporteur ultimately ruled out this .
It emerges, however, from the facts and the circumstances of this affair that the measures taken by the judicial authorities are aimed at hindering the political activity of this Member.
Â Â  Mr President, our concern, in the Fourtou report, was with events in Spain, and specifically in the region of Valencia, where many European citizens have felt themselves very unfairly treated in consequence of poorly-framed regional legislation and its faulty interpretation on the part of the regional, local and state authorities.
It is to be welcomed that the Valencian regional authorities have taken a very cooperative attitude towards and are even now amending the law.
The new law is in the process of being drafted.
We should make it plain that the European Parliament is not competent to deal with the annulment of poorly-drafted local legislation.
We must, of course, intervene in those cases in which European law is affected, but this House is not responsible for everything.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall make three observations and a final comment.
Since many of the amendments drawn up by the rapporteur have been rejected, the report that we have just voted on contains certain absurdities which this Parliament cannot ignore.
Paragraph six, as it is now worded, and not as it should have been worded according to the rapporteurâs report, obliges the national and regional legislator to introduce a series of specific actions which fall within their exclusive competence.
I am not invoking the principle of subsidiarity here: this is a clear encroachment of competences.
This is also true of the , which is intended to suspend the application of a legitimate law, approved by a legitimate regional parliament and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court: this is a blatant encroachment of competences by this Parliament.
Secondly, recital J, also contrary to the amendment by the rapporteur, and on the instigation of the Spanish Socialists, refers to the existence of illegal actions.
As the President knows, under any rule of law, any action as a result of illegal actions must be applied, determined and enforced by a court, in accordance with a very ancient principle: .
Â Â  UKIP MEPs have voted against this report - not because they do not have sympathy and understanding for those property owners in Valencia who have been deprived of their property rights under an unfair law - but because they strongly disagree with the EU Charter for Human Rights which does not have legal force but is used as an argument in the report for EU intervention in this matter.
Â Â  Land development issues in the autonomous region of Valencia are not a matter for the European Parliament or the European Union at all.
To judge from the report, all political issues come within the responsibility of the EU institutions.
This means that the Member Statesâ elected assemblies, different kinds of elected regional assembly and quite a few of the local assemblies elected by popular vote could be ridden roughshod over.
We are voting against this report.
Â Â  I do not believe that the EU should interfere in the way in which a country conducts its detailed planning.
In this case, the Green politicians of the country concerned have, however, appealed to me to vote in favour of such intervention, since their democracy is under threat.
Building contractors are bribing politicians and not bothering about either legislation or democracy, and my colleagues believe that attention must be drawn to the problem outside the country if there is to be any reaction from the establishment.
I am therefore voting in favour of the opinion concerning the petition signed by 15Â 000 people and delivered to Parliament.
This does not, however, mean that I want the conclusions to become legislation applicable throughout the EU.
Â Â  . We as a group refute that the EU can continue in this way outside the remit of any treaty which would open jurisprudential breaches in order to ingest itself in town and urban policies, architectural issues of member states and the financial situations of property owners and renters.
In any case it is illegal to give legal character contraining to a text of a political nature. (Consideration L) This is why we have voted against this report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just voted on the Bersani report, which I, as shadow rapporteur, had a part in guiding through this House.
The report represents a good compromise between those who want the European Union to have more powers in fiscal affairs, and those who do not, be it in relation to the tax base for businesses or to the rate at which businesses are taxed.
Even while we were voting, though, I was informed that the European Court of Justice has handed down a ruling in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer.
The situation now is that this company, in the United Kingdom, can, by way of consolidation, consolidate gains and losses from Europe, and the United Kingdom will have to pay the firm tens of millions.
I do not wish to discuss the caseâs merits, but only to make it plain that what we want is a single system of law, with laws made, as they are now, by this Parliament and by us as its members.
Here we have, yet again, a case of law made by judges, the fundamentals of which need to be debated.
I do not believe that this is what the future of the European Union should be like.
Â Â  The delegation supports minimum tax rates and a common consolidated tax base for companies operating in at least two countries.
A common consolidated tax base and minimum tax rates for companies will make the internal market more efficient and, at the same time, combat the trend towards tax competition, which threatens our social models in Europe.
The delegation does not consider that the home state taxation principle is a good idea because it can lead to a distortion of competition between neighbouring countries with different tax rules.
Â Â  . The taxation of undertakings was one of the areas covered by the so-called Monti Package of tax harmonisation measures.
The adoption of the Lisbon Strategy gave fresh impetus to the idea of an internal market without fiscal obstacles.
The proposal before us, under Article 94 of the Treaty on the approximation of laws, advocates the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax base.
The objectives are clear: to remove tax barriers to companies carrying out cross-border transactions and to create conditions in which the large multinational corporations operate within a single regime covering the distribution of dividends and cross-border offsetting of profits and losses, thereby facilitating cross-border restructuring operations and merger and acquisition operations.
Accordingly, this helps to strengthen the Statute for a European Company, by increasing the possibilities of loopholes through which these companies can escape taxation and failing to prevent tax evasion, which is quite the opposite of what it purports to do.
In its maximalist approach, Parliament is even considering promoting stronger cooperation, if some Member States do not want to follow this path.
We have always objected to this path, because it is an attack on the Member Statesâ tax sovereignty, and because it fails to solve the key problem of work bearing the brunt of the tax burden.
We therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  . I welcome the work of the Commission in this area.
However, I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the EU Technical Working Group which has been set up to look at this issue by calling for any legislation in this field.
I believe that the EU must look at all methods of attracting investment and is not convinced that a harmonised tax base will attract further foreign investment particularly to the City of London.
Â Â  . I am resolute in my belief that tax competition is vital.
I absolutely reject the assertion that levelling up tax in the direction of harmonisation, can offer any solution to the un-competitiveness of Europe.
A consolidated tax base would have the effect of placing the fiscal policy of Member States into a straight jacket.
If a government wanted to kick start an economic activity, through the granting of tax credits for Research and Development, that Member State would have to gain prior approval from the Council under unanimity.
Is that our vision for Europe?
Where a consolidated approach means that the prior approval of all 25 Member States is necessary when formulating domestic fiscal policy?
And while Europe busies itself with such decisions, the competitiveness of the global markets will mean investors simply move on.
That is not my vision for Europe.
Fiscal flexibility is paramount to improving European competitiveness.
R[amp]D is one element in the overall mix that determines competitiveness.
Let us not forget that tax is another.
And tax competition is healthy.
According to this report "the trend towards tax rate competition may lead to a drop in income tax".
This is a very short-sighted view, not least because the Polish and Irish examples disprove it.
Â Â  . The EPLP welcomes the work of the Commission in this area however does not want to pre-empt the outcome of the EU Technical Working Group which has been set up to look at this issue by calling for any legislation in this field.
The EPLP believes that the EU must look at all methods of attracting investment and is not convinced that a harmonised tax base will attract further foreign investment.
The EPLP opinion is that this harmonisation of tax base could possibly lead to higher rates, with harmonisation at a later stage which is not desired.
The EPLP supports enhanced cooperation if Member States wish to pursue this consolidated tax base approach, as long as the proper procedures are followed and precedence is not set for future tax cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise reached on the proposal for a directive that the Commission put forward only three months ago is the outcome of serious, professional, intense work carried out together by the three institutions of the European Union.
It is also the result of their joint determination to stand shoulder to shoulder in fighting terrorism and organised crime.
If, as I sincerely hope, this Parliament comes out in favour of the compromise that has been reached, the 25 European Union Member States will have joint legislation on the retention of telecommunications traffic data.
The efforts made by the courts and the police to protect the right of European citizens to security will thus be made more effective.
That in itself is an important result, an initial but fundamental step towards the gradual harmonisation of national legislations.
Furthermore, if agreement is reached, it will emphasise the fact that issues of major importance to Europeâs people may now be addressed within a Community framework and no longer an intergovernmental one.
There will thus be the possibility, or rather the right, for not just the Commission and the Council but also the European Parliament to participate fully on an equal footing.
I should like to state publicly here that it was due to Minister Clarkeâs personal commitment and brave determination that we reached agreement in the Council on changing the legal basis to a proposal for a directive, as it is now; only a few months ago that did not look at all easy.
In my view, this result â this compromise â strikes a balance between the need for security and the need for freedom.
That is a key objective that the Commission and I myself have pursued.
This compromise meets some of the most important requests made not just by the Council but, above all, by this Parliament during the intense debate of recent months.
We have taken account of fundamental demands, such as the protection and security of personal data, imposing penalties on the illegal use of retained data, and restricting the application of the directive to serious crimes.
I also wish to emphasise here in this House, as I have already said to the Council, that it is vital that the principles of necessity and proportionality should always be observed in applying the much talked-about Article 15 of the 2002 directive currently in force.
These are important results aiming at the protection of the fundamental rights of European citizens, and they comply with the general principles of Europeâs legislative action.
MrÂ President, as a closing consideration at this point, I should like to gratefully acknowledge the quality of the work done by this Parliament under difficult circumstances and in a very short time, compared with the average time taken by parliamentary work.
It must also be recognised that certain aspects of this subject are highly complex in legal, technical and economic terms, and the initial positions on some topics appeared to be substantively very far apart.
That is precisely why I should like in particular to express my personal gratitude and appreciation for the work of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which I took part on several occasions, and of its chairman, MrÂ Cavada, and rapporteur, MrÂ Alvaro.
MrÂ President, the Commission is thus very pleased with the compromise that has been reached and recommends that the European Parliament support the compromise by accepting particularly Amendments 51 to 92 signed by MrsÂ Roure and MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by MrÂ Reul for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I believe that this consensus can and must go beyond the amendments tabled by the two main groups in the European Parliament, and I am sure that an even broader consensus in Parliament would demonstrate to the people of Europe the full ability of this great institution â and indeed of the three European institutions â to work together to provide tangible answers to our fellow citizensâ demands.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by associating myself very strongly with the sentiments expressed today by my friend, Commission Vice-President Frattini.
I believe there has been very substantial and constructive work, both between the Council and the Commission and between the Council and Parliament.
I particularly want to express my appreciation to Mr Cavada and everybody in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, including Mr Alvaro, and the leaders of the groups for the way we have worked to discuss these questions.
As we come to the end of the UK Presidency, I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.
It has been one of the most important items on our agenda and I hope that we can agree that these proposals represent a chance for all three institutions of Europe, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to stand united in the face of terrorism and organised crime and to send a message that we are determined to work together to achieve these things.
I am proud of what has been achieved in this Presidency.
We have agreed a European Union counter-terrorism strategy.
We have taken steps to improve the exchange of information for law enforcement.
We have adopted a strategy to address radicalisation and terrorist recruitment.
We have established a European Union programme to protect critical infrastructure against terrible attacks.
We have established a peer evaluation of counter-terrorism practice and development.
We have adopted a money-laundering directive.
We have agreed proposals to enhance the sharing of information between law enforcement agencies and we have developed a European plan of action to tackle human trafficking.
In that context, let me draw attention to the fact that we have also placed the issues of migration much higher up the European Union agenda.
This is a very substantial range of achievements.
But I personally attach the greatest importance to the one we are debating today: the aim to achieve common standards for retention of telecommunications data.
As Mr Frattini said, this has been a frank debate â with everybody ready to participate in discussion â but also a difficult debate, because the issues of principle and the technical issues have not been at all easy to resolve.
My own commitment has been to listen as widely as possible to the views expressed within Parliament and to discuss with my colleagues in the Council how we can work together.
To be candid, there was some scepticism in the Council at the idea of going down the course of a first-reading deal and a process of this kind.
People were not certain that it would be possible to get an agreement.
That is why today is so important.
To make the statement that the European Parliament in particular, not just the Council and Commission, commits to proposals in this area seems to me very important.
The tools we are talking about, the telecommunications data we are describing, are vital to investigate and detect terrorism and crime.
It is essential, in my view, to provide a proportionate and balanced legal basis for the retention of data that would otherwise be erased or anonymised.
Variations in data retention practice mean that the ability of investigators and prosecutors to detect and prosecute criminals and terrorists to stop them causing harm, or to catch them after they have caused harm, is dependent on which communications service provider a suspect, a victim or witness has used or which Member State they were in.
That variation gives an open goal to our opponents in criminality, and it is that we are trying to close with this directive, which I hope we will adopt today.
We have many examples, some of which I gave to the Civil Liberties Committee in September 2005, where communications data has been used to trace the members of terrorist cells, to help identify murderers and free kidnap victims and to deal with those who organise very serious crime.
The position of the Council, supported by the Commission, aims to find a compromise between Parliament and the Council, in particular, the need to balance law enforcement needs with individualsâ right to privacy by including specific rules on data protection.
As amended, the directive would oblige Member States to ensure the retention of data for the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime only.
This was a call that came specifically from the European Parliament.
Many told us that we had to ensure that this was limited to serious crime at Community level.
We have responded to that point in what is being put forward, which the Council accepted.
On periods of retention, the proposed period in the compromise, six to twenty-four months, represents a compromise between those in the Council, who wanted a much longer maximum period â and there are some in the Council who did not believe in principle that we should legislate on this basis at all â and those in the Parliament, who would have been happier with a shorter retention period.
I believe the compromise will enable law enforcement authorities to obtain the data they need without disproportionately infringing privacy rights.
The Presidency took account of concerns expressed by Member States and industry and by some in Parliament about costs, particularly those incurred by storing types of data such as unanswered calls.
That is why the list of data in the directive has been restricted and why unconnected call data is outside the scope altogether.
It is also one reason why I supported the commitment, given by the Commission and Council, to regularly review the effectiveness of the application of the directive together with the European Parliament, the European Data Protection Supervisor and representatives of industry.
This is a fast-moving picture and it is important that all the institutions work together to keep us up to date on the best way to deal with it.
As I mentioned, the Council also took very seriously the concerns expressed in Parliament about data protection and security.
That is why the amendments include articles on data protection, data access and sanctions in the event of data abuse.
I agree entirely with the representations made by the Parliament that data must be kept safe and secure and can only be disclosed lawfully to people lawfully entitled to see it.
There should not be overall access.
I know this has been a difficult negotiation and the subject matter is technical and complex.
I welcome, therefore, the requirement that the Commission must fully evaluate the application of the directive and its impact on industry and consumers.
Our right to privacy, our right to property, our right to free speech and our right to life are all threatened by terrorists and criminals.
I believe that, particularly in this democracy, democratic politicians have a duty and responsibility to protect these rights through the kinds of practical measures we are agreeing here.
I hope we can say at the end of this debate that we have achieved that.
I believe the Commissionâs proposal, as amended by the Council and with the support of Parliament, would secure an instrument which strikes a better balance between the need to retain data to protect our citizens and the need to protect and respect individualsâ privacy.
We are embracing new technologies that offer great opportunities for learning, for doing business, for communicating.
But those same technologies can be used and misused by those who do not respect the rights of others, and by their victims too.
It is right, therefore, that we do all we can to deliver justice and to protect citizens.
It is what they, our electors, demand of us and it is why we must act, proportionately and democratically, of course, but hopefully with unity.
I am pleased that tomorrow Parliament as a whole has its chance to express its view on the proposal for a directive.
The Commission, in Mr Frattiniâs excellent contribution, has already indicated its support.
The Council gives its support.
If you, the Parliament, also give your support, we can celebrate an historic achievement, which will send a powerful message to all European Union citizens about both our determination and our ability to combat terrorism and serious crime and the importance of the European Parliament in that fight.
I believe the message that would send would be important in its own right, but it will also be important for the future arrangements within the European Union as to how we develop these questions in a positive and constructive way.
I conclude by again thanking all my colleagues in Parliament, many of whom are in the Chamber now, for the very friendly, positive, thoughtful and constructive approach they have taken in trying to debate these matters.
I believe that your wisdom can take us to a new frontier of fighting crime, criminality and terrorism for the European Union as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Clarke, I am glad of your presence here, and also of that of the distinguished colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working for over a year.
You cannot, however, expect me to be jumping for joy, since the line I take differs from the one you have just put forward.
For a start, I do not believe that we ever really had a decision to take on which legal basis was actually being considered, for that is obvious; there are treaties that spell it out in black and white.
Moreover, the Commission also brought in a proposal, under Article 95, for a directive that would have required codecision by this House.
To celebrate getting something that is rightfully ours is something I regard as derogatory to the dignity of this House, but, fair enough, I dare say that others take a different view.
Speaking personally, I believe that we knew perfectly well what we were letting ourselves in for, and we know from the legal services â including the Councilâs own â that the Council would not have been well advised to take a decision.
We also know that there was no unanimity at Council level, and so it made perfectly good tactical sense for unanimity to be established here in this House.
I also wish to dispute much of the substance of what you said.
The decisions we took in Committee were taken together, without regard to party allegiances, and sometimes unanimously, and the amendments we drafted were excellent.
A final vote of 33 to 8 with 5 abstentions accurately reflects the position taken by the second-largest committee of this House, and the only one of its constituent bodies to take a decision on the matter.
I take a different view where the time limits for storage are concerned, but you know that.
I have travelled a much greater distance and have gone a long way in reaching these compromises, to which we in the Committee have agreed, in order to show some sort of backbone.
Now, along comes this Article X, which makes provision for the Member States to extend the time limits for storage for as long as they like, provided that they inform the Commission and give it the opportunity to spend six months assessing whether their doing so could result in barriers to trade or disruption to the internal market â interestingly enough, not whether there might be any objections of a legal nature or from the point of view of fundamental rights.
One result of this is that Poland, the Federal Republic of Germanyâs much-valued neighbour, has plans to retain data for 15 years.
What an interesting idea!
We have not, however, managed to come to any agreement about the costs involved.
The fact that the companies and the public have to foot the bill for what the states order sets a precedent.
I do indeed note the inclusion of provisions on the protection of data and of the public, as well as of sanction mechanisms, but, much as I welcome these positive steps, they require the Council to do no more than snap its fingers, since they refer to national legislation â which, as you must surely be aware, is not difficult to implement.
As regards content, we also consulted with the Commission, which took a similar line to our own, and came to the conclusion that:
âIt is quite clear that the text is divergent from our original proposal in a number of important areas.
While the adoption of our proposal would have resulted in almost complete harmonisation in this area, the compromise text represents only a partial harmonisation.â
As we have not resolved the issue of the retention of data once and for all, which is what the Committee and the Commission had had in mind, I do wonder to what degree we can call this an outright success.
What we have done is to hand over to the Member States a measure that Directive 2002/58 did not empower them to implement.
Precisely what shape it takes is now largely for them to decide, since we have provided for an enormous degree of flexibility.
I do not believe that, in so doing, we can justifiably claim to have acted as European legislators.
I also believe that there are continuing misunderstandings as to this Houseâs competence and future powers.
A press communiquÃ© dated 8 December from the Socialist Group ends with the following sentence:
In future all dossiers in this area will be treated on the basis of codecison with Parliament, including the revision of the present directive.
In the latter case, that is certainly true, but the idea that, in future, everything serving to combat terrorism will be dealt with in accordance with a codecision procedure, is something I find highly doubtful, since this is an area in which the Councilâs decisions must be unanimous.
I also know that Ireland will take any decision we make here on appeal to the European Court of Justice, and will raise the question of whether this is possible in terms of competence; this is a very interesting turn of events.
I would like, finally, to tell you that I am very disappointed with the way the procedure has gone and with the contributions made by the two big groups.
I regard as in unbelievably bad taste the manner in which they behaved after we had spent eight weeks discussing these matters in great depth and considering our next steps, with everyone having given some ground, an enormous number of compromises having been made, and the Committee having come to a very clear and definite decision.
I think it was in bad taste for a handful of members of the big groups to prejudice in this way a compromise proposal that the Council had not yet officially produced, there having been as yet no official negotiation with the Council on the grounds that the Council representative had, in principle, negated his own mandate and believed himself unable to negotiate!
It is true to say that I am disappointed, but I look forward with very eager anticipation to tomorrowâs vote and, all things considered, will say that the willingness to work together in a rational manner will always be there.
Not everyone has to find the results to their liking.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Clarke, ladies and gentlemen, what people expect of us is that we should not cross swords over who is responsible for what, but instead ensure that their problems are resolved as speedily and promptly as possible, and what they expect of those who shape European policy is that they should not address the issue of how to combat organised crime and terrorism by simply adopting yet another resolution and going back to disputing among themselves, but instead by coming up with results.
That was our problem.
Here, on the table before us, we have something that might improve the situation â the retention and storage of data.
It may not be the answer to everything, but it is an answer.
Our problem was that of how to protect data and how to prevent blameless members of the public being obstructed more than circumstances warranted, and in addressing it, we were reflecting peopleâs justifiable concerns.
Rather than this being allowed to become a never-ending story, what we wanted was a prompt result.
People are entitled to have results put in front of them without delay.
I can tell Mr Alvaro that it was for this reason that it was incumbent upon us, even in the short time available to us, to seek and find a solution.
I will be quite frank in saying that the one we came up with is not 100% perfect, but it does help now and it does equip the police with instruments that they did not have before.
It helps us to do whatever we can to ensure the protection of human life and of data on members of the public.
The Council would have moved no further; the whole thing became a never-ending tale of framework decisions and disputes.
Mr Alvaro has accurately described how Parliament kept asking questions, for months on end; it got us nowhere, because the Council was unwilling to give way, until the Commission came up with a proposal that helped us to prepare the way for a consensus.
What we have now is a consensus that was reached only because Parliament changed position and made the attempt to bring together various forces.
That was the right thing to do, and in doing it we also gained something, in that there is now no doubt about this projectâs being subject to codecision.
I do not think it relevant to ask whether the same result might have been achieved in some other way and at some other time.
What interests me is that this project can be completed at the end of 2005 and can thereby enter into effect.

To this instrument I say âyesâ; to the arbitrary collection of data I say ânoâ, and that is why I say âyesâ to the restricted conditions that we have ended up with.
Not every kind of data is included; not everything is capable of being stored, but only a very limited category, on the Internet: storage of movement data applies only to the onset of movement, unsuccessful calls are to be recorded only where this is already in place at national level.
Nothing there has changed, and the countries that do not have this sort of data do not have to do this; they are not forced to do anything; they are free.
We have reduced the requirements.
We have set six months as the minimum period for retention â it is one about which I think we can certainly talk some more â and 24 months if the time limit is to be extended.
I still have a question to put; it is the one raised by MrÂ Alvaro, and one to which I would very much like an answer, perhaps from Mr Clarke.
Commissioner Frattini said, in one consultation, that the 15 years being considered by Poland could not be regarded as an exception.
I cannot imagine that it would be either, but I would be rather happier if Mr Clarke were perhaps to say something about this, which cannot be the answer.
I will, of course, say that we did not get the deal on costs that I would have liked us to get, but the costs issue is no longer as relevant as it was at the beginning of the process, since the types of data in the batches are no longer being considered.
I do think that changes in the facts during the course of a procedure have to be taken into consideration, and that has an impact on other areas, for example on costs, which are no longer as considerable.
The truth of the matter is that we have made enormous improvements to the security of peopleâs data as regards its monitoring and potential abuses.
All the things that Mr Alvaro described have been achieved by our joint effort.
It was very laborious, but now the job is done.
It has now been set down â and will, it is to be hoped, tomorrow be adopted â that people are to be protected against the misuse of personal data and that provision is made for sanctions and penalties, that no content shall be stored, that access to the data shall be permitted only in cases of serious crime, and more besides.
And Parliament remains a key player, with no comitology and revision after two years!
The police are given new scope for action, the public enjoy new and extended protection of their data, and Parliament has extended its influence.
I think people are entitled to see us taking serious the ways in which they are protected against crime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, democracy and freedom are not defended through restrictions on human rights.
In totalitarian states, people are guilty until proved innocent.
In states governed by the rule of law, suspicion constitutes grounds for restricting freedom.
We are now debating a law that would make it possible to spy on those whom the law says are protected.
At least carry out an independent impact assessment, and do so before the legislation enters into force.
Human rights are not something to be skated over and neglected.
Legislate honestly.
Do not pretend that what we are concerned with is terrorism if it is really a question of file sharing, national registration, taxes, trade and refugees.
Do not create new problems of competition in Europe.
Comply with the requirement for harmonisation in the Data Protection Directive, and act in accordance with Article 95.
The measure proposed would not prevent terrorism.
It would be in danger of damaging confidence in the EU if it proved to be in conflict with freedoms and rights and with the state governed by law.
If the need for the measure cannot be substantiated, it will be a case of the EU forcing the Member States to vote against their own constitutions, in which Article 8.2 of the Council of Europe Convention is incorporated.
A constitutional crisis could arise.
It is necessary to establish freedoms and rights in the EUâs founding Treaty before matters go too far.
I realise that it is easy to be seized by hatred towards terrorists.
To tamper with freedoms and rights is, however, to give in to the attacks on the state governed by law and to depart from our values.
Retain the right to privacy.
Do not make large holes in our provisions for protecting data.
Our European data protection is a European right to be proud of.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Clarke, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we will, tomorrow, be passing an important European instrument for the combating of terrorism and the most serious forms of criminality.
This House having rejected the original framework decision as having been founded on the wrong legal basis, the Commissionâs draft directive now provides for this House to possess the power of codecision.
Just like the Member States in the Council, we started out with very diverse views and a different understanding, but sustainable compromises emerged from our discussions.
From the very outset, with quick and efficient work in mind, we negotiated with the Council on an informal basis, as is the customary procedure.
What is also customary in arriving at democratic decisions is the seeking of majorities for a position and the negotiating of compromises, and those produced by the two major groups enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House.
The rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, may well find this way of going about things to be in bad taste, but it was not possible to reach any agreement with him, as he was not in Brussels during the final stage of the negotiations, but the UK Presidency was informed as soon as the two major groups had reached informal agreement on a position, and it was on this basis that agreement in the Council was made possible.

This House can claim to have achieved various successes, in that we were able to substantially reduce the number of types of data over against what the Commission had proposed.
Where the criminal offences were concerned, opinions ranged from âapplicable to all offencesâ to âterrorism onlyâ, and we agreed on: âserious crimes as defined by national law, by reference to the European Arrest Warrantâ.
One of our great achievements has been to incorporate data protection into the directive wherever possible, striking a happy medium between the protection of the public against serious crime and terrorism on the one hand and the safeguarding of the private domain on the other.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite reports to the contrary, we will not, tomorrow, be voting on the Councilâs document on data storage, but on a compromise reached, and laboriously, by a majority of the members of the Committee and the Council in the run-up to the last vote in the latter.
Now, for the first time, the European Parliament is involved in the third pillar, that of internal security, to which codecision applies, something that was not wanted by all the Member States, and certainly not by the government of my own.
Deciding where the European level can and may influence the national level and where it cannot and may not, without, in so doing, needlessly curtailing the rights of the national parliaments and/or voiding their powers, will be a veritable tightrope walk.
This is what has prompted the German Federal Minister of Justice, Brigitte Zypries, to initiate a parliamentary review.
This House has, in any case, succeeded in getting the Council to come to an agreement and in making crucial improvements to important aspects of what the Council originally produced.
Data retention is one â but not the only â important instrument in combating serious crime, internationally organised criminal activity and terrorism, and some Member States are already using it â the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden, for example.
We therefore saw it as all the more important that appropriate minimum guarantees be incorporated at European level before national legislation â over which we have no influence â went much further than the present proposal.
It was, then, with considerations of cost and data protection concerns in mind that we were successful in inserting the requirement that standard data relating to the beginning, but not the end, of the mobile telephone call be stored â the operative term is âprofilingâ â but that traffic data relating to what are termed âunsuccessful callsâ would not be included, except where the companies retain this data in any case.
It is also left to the Member States themselves to determine the period for which data is to be stored, within a range from 6 to a maximum of 24 months.
It is only where a longer period is already applicable â as in Italy, for example â that the existing rules can be maintained, and I would very much welcome some information as to what is being done in the case of Poland.
Data protection, though, has been tightened up in comparison with what was initially proposed, and national legislation continues to apply to access to data and the use made of it.
My group will be voting by a large majority to adopt this compromise, even though some of us would have settled for less and others would perhaps have preferred to see rather more.
The last thing I say I shall say to Mr Alvaro, and it is this: a miss is as good as a mile!
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like, in connection with this group work, to pay tribute to the intelligence of Mr Frattiniâs initial proposal and to the courage of the President-in-Office, MrÂ Clarke, in this area.
You have been able to work while showing respect for Parliament, even though, at the start, there was nothing to suggest that this would happen.
Tomorrowâs vote is not only important, it is crucial.
Firstly, because it is designed to create the beginnings of a Community framework and to leave it to the Member Statesâ discretion to establish certain limits with regard to the volume of data retained and the length of time it is retained in order to meet the requirements of the fight against crime and terrorism.
Secondly, because when reasonable limits are set, everyone can accept them.
The minimum six-month retention period is broadly applied by telecommunications operators in managing their contracts and their marketing.
This six-month limit had already been suggested by the national authorities to protect data when the first directive on data protection had been approved.
Thirdly, because Parliament wanted to demonstrate to the Council, but also mainly to its own people, that it is ready to take into account not only economic interests, but also the requirements relating to the protection of its peopleâs security and fundamental rights.
I myself do not know of any cases in which economic interests would take precedence over the general interest in such a tragic situation, whatever the price to be paid, and this in spite of the current legal frameworks of the treaties, which are, I might add, somewhat schizophrenic.
The Constitution would have spared us this multiplicity of pillars, but we must confine ourselves to the legal bases available to us.
The Court recently half-opened a door for us; let us seize this new opportunity to draft the Community legislation that we so desperately need.
Tomorrowâs vote will undoubtedly reveal the inconsistencies and limits of the current legal situation, but it will mainly propose something new in an area that affects public opinion, which is itself capable of recognising that we work in harmony to safeguard its interests, far removed from any power struggles and legal specificities.
On behalf of the committee that I have the honour of chairing, I will conclude by stating that, in different circumstances, we are ready to rise to this intelligent challenge wisely overseen by the three parties, and I hope that this excellent cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament will continue.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have often said in discussions here with fellow Members that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, too, does not regard the right to privacy as sacred, and that intrusions can be justified if the measures in question prove really necessary, proportionate and effective.
It is clear to me that what we need in the fight against terrorism, the fight against organised crime, is more investments in specific investigations, more investments in analysing existing data and better cooperation between intelligence and security services.
Money, even our euro, can be spent only once.
Funds are currently being channelled into large-scale surveillance, the big fish, instead of those specific investigations, and I think that that really is a wrong choice.
I could have just about endorsed the storage of telephone data, and all the underlying reasons which Mr Clarke gave only pertained to telephone data, so that was nice and easy.
What are we to make, though, of the plans to record the time people spend on the Internet along with their logon and logoff data?
We live in an era in which people often have the computer switched on all day.
Registration of that nature would therefore be rather pointless.
We in this House are always talking about better lawmaking, and then along comes this sort of nonsense.
They have not even worked out the financial implications for industry.
If I were to draft a proposal on the environment or social policy without thinking it through properly, that would be unacceptable, but it appears not to be a problem in this instance.
I would now like to turn to the large groups.
My group was also in favour of bringing this discussion to a prompt close, namely after first reading in this House, but as, you have now done a deal with the British Presidency before Parliament has even adopted a position, we are now faced with a .
The small groups were not even informed and even the rapporteur for this subject, Mr Alvaro, knew nothing about this.
It is all very well for Mrs Klamt to say that they were unable to reach him, but Mr Alvaro has a telephone, and informing the person in question would have been the decent thing to do.
What we now have is a backroom deal on citizensâ rights, and that is just not good enough.
My group will therefore simply vote against the proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I regard what has gone on over recent weeks in relation to the retention of data as quite simply monstrous.
Ever since the Commission produced its proposal, this House has been under extraordinary pressure of time.
From the word âgoâ, we were given to understand that this proposal had to go through, come what may, by the end of the year; this alone meant that really credible and comprehensive work on it was scarcely feasible, and it is obvious that the intention was that there should not be any!
As I see it, further evidence for this is to be found in the fact that we will not, tomorrow, be voting on the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but are, in essence, supposed to be merely nodding through what the Council resolved on at the beginning of December.
Speaking as my groupâs shadow rapporteur, let me say that I find it quite simply unacceptable that the two big groups should disregard the Committeeâs vote and deliberately â let Mrs Klamt take note of this â go behind the rapporteurâs back and hatch schemes with the Council.
The compromise that the PPE-DE and PSE groups have negotiated with the Council is rotten to the core and stinks to high heaven.
My group rejects the compromise proposal outright, and so I, together with Mrs Buitenweg of the Group of the Greens, have already submitted a minority report to the Committee and moved that the Commission proposal be rejected tomorrow.
I propose to tell you why I have done this. I have done this because the introduction of mandatory and systematic storage of data, data obtained on whatever occasion and for whatever reason, knocks a hole through the wall that protects the data of innocent citizens who are not suspected of anything.
In essence, the Commission proposal tends to place 460 million EU citizens under general suspicion.
The plan for the storage of collected data goes hand in hand with blatant assaults on Europeansâ fundamental rights and freedoms, along with the threat of disproportionate restrictions on the privacy of communications and the protection of the private domain, the very essence of both of which is at risk.
The freedom of the press, and its protection of sources and informants in particular, is jeopardised, and I doubt â let my German fellow-Members take note â that this would bear scrutiny in the light of the German constitution.
The object and purpose of this measure remain unclear to this day.
Even now, no evidence has been produced to support the belief that serious crimes can indeed be more successfully cleared up with the help of a vast mass of stored communications data of the widest possible variety.
Yes, of course, the law enforcement authorities have to be equipped to combat terrorism and the graver types of criminal activity, but that does not justify disregarding the rights of the individual and collecting â in a situation in which it is not absolutely necessary to do so â data and information and collating and exchanging it, to the point where, in the not-too-distant future, every detail of our citizensâ lives will be laid bare.
Is, then, this Europe of ours to become an Orwellian surveillance state?
I, for one â particularly as a Member from the eastern part of Germany, will have no part in any such thing.
Citizens under general suspicion, combined with the obsessive collection of data and information to which the police and secret services then had access at any time â there was a time when people, quite rightly, took to the streets in demonstrations to rid themselves of this sort of political thinking, and it is a good thing that they did!
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a difference between you and the honourable gentlemen sitting on the front benches: they are selected by their governments to serve authority.
You are elected by the people to defend democracy.
What do the selected come and ask of us, the elected?
That we tie down our peoples, that we overturn the right of free speech.
That is what they are asking of us.
Shall we do so?
Just imagine if this technology had existed in 1940 and if Hitler had had this directive in his hands.
He would have killed far more than the 6 million Jews.
Just imagine if the Stalinist regime had had it in their hands.
It might still be doing the same.
That is what they are asking us to do today, at the expense of the people of Europe.
We must not allow it.
They tell us, 'for the sake of combating terrorism'.
In other words, Bin Laden and his ilk will use public telephones, they will buy prepaid cards and, if they want to use the Internet, they will go to an Internet cafÃ© to do so.
What are they talking about and who is the final recipient?
The final recipient will be the CIA.
Will you hand the peoples of Europe over to the CIA?
Think according to conscience, not according to the instructions of your groups or parties.
Long live freedom!
Â Â  For your information, I would point out to you that, contrary to what you might think, everything that you say today is remembered forever and retained forever as it is all filmed and recorded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament and the Council have made an admirable effort to reach agreement at first reading so that an urgent measure to tackle terrorism and crime can be adopted swiftly.
I have always been of the opinion that, when faced with a recurrent threat to undermine world peace and stability, people will, under exceptional circumstances, willingly accept restrictions to their privacy if the other side of the coin is greater peace of mind and security.
I believe that it is legitimate to temporarily restrict privacy when it may be for the good of society.
I think we can in any case be pleased with the positive compromises that have been reached, despite the customary obstructionist attitude of a certain part of the Left, which often pays lip-service to safeguarding individual freedoms merely for convenienceâ sake.
It calls for freedom and security for the people but then does not follow it up with concrete action, thus showing that it is more interested in demagogy and facile propaganda.
I think it has been shown that targeted, restrictive measures are needed in the fight against terrorism, in keeping with the principle of proportionality.
The outcome of these negotiations will, in my opinion, be a directive of undoubted importance if it also includes the corrective measures on which the EU ministers have already reached agreement.
The directive would combine rigour with the protection of civil liberties, by ruling that data may be retained for long periods, while, at the same time, containing a series of provisions designed to regulate aspects relating to protection, laying down penalties for those who use such data illegally.
The directive would allow Member States to decide whether to retain data on unanswered calls, while providing for technical restrictions to keep down the cost of doing so.
In this regard, I should like to mention the example of Italy, one of the few Member States already to have adopted specific legislation on data retention.
Since Italyâs legislation is proving effective, I think it is acceptable for data to be retained for two years, if particular circumstances so require.
I therefore hope that Italy, which is always willing to share its experience, can keep its own legislation in the context of the harmonisation of the various national systems.
Its legislation has been proved effective and, above all, the Commission has acknowledged the fact by saying that Italy could submit a derogation notification.
Â Â  The report by Mr Alvaro is of exceptional importance, and particularly today, when the entire population of Europe faces the daily fear of terrorist attacks.
The attacks in London and Madrid alarmed the population because they hit civilian targets and unsuspecting citizens on their way to work, school or hospital.
On the one hand, people are threatened by those who employ terrorism as a means of fighting against governments.
On the other hand, however, governments use people, or infringe upon their right to privacy, when combating terrorism.
We cannot allow people to be monitored in the manner of Big Brother-type TV shows.
People elect governments in order to free them from having to decide on day-to-day public affairs.
Governments, however, have no right to use peopleâs privacy as a public affair.
That is why I think the report should be amended, placing greater emphasis on the obligations of the state with respect to the implementation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to privacy, so that no part of the proposed directive may be in contradiction with this Convention.
Â Â  â Mr President, the issue we are debating today is one of the most difficult and important issues, because we are being called upon to strike a balance between the right to personal freedom and the right to public security.
I consider it a huge success, which is due to the efforts both of Parliament and of the Commission and the Council, that the initial draft has been improved considerably.
It leaves the Member States a great deal of room for manoeuvre, firstly to define periods of data retention of between 6 and 24 months; secondly, to define the offences for which they will use this information and, thirdly, for the law enforcement authorities to have access to this information, for which prior permission must be obtained from the courts.
These changes are most important and might have encouraged me to waive the objections I formulated from the outset, given that all the amendments which I proposed have been accepted.
However, despite this, I cannot vote in favour, because I believe that these measures alone will prove to be totally ineffective in practice.
It is certain that criminals will easily circumvent them or will find other means of communication and will thus achieve their criminal objectives, while the measures will remain in place.
In addition, we need uniform and unanimous action by the global community, better coordination of measures, proper evaluation of data and, more importantly, improved cooperation between the national law enforcement authorities.
Finally, as the European Data Protection Supervisor says in his report, the technical difficulties in the application of the measure are insurmountable, and that is why I cannot vote in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Frattini, MrÂ Clarke, we tried to take the heat out of the debate, but doing so was extremely difficult.
I believe that things need to be made clear and the truth told.
A directive is required in the area of data retention, as all the data related to trafficking is already retained and used by the law enforcement authorities in the large majority of the Member States.
That is the truth, and that is why current practices are in urgent need of regulation to ensure that Europeans are better protected.
The debates on this report have been very difficult.
I am therefore pleased and proud that my group is in a position to support the compromise proposed by the Council, not because we are ready to accept just anything but, rather, because my group was able to maintain its firm stance throughout the negotiations in order to secure the better protection of Europeans.
Limiting the scope of the directive so that it includes serious crimes, protection of data security, access to data and the recourse to criminal sanctions for misuse of data â these are real achievements!
We made our requirements clear and we did not give way.
Admittedly, what we have here is a compromise, and we too would have hoped to have taken things further.
That is why, I might add, we tabled an amendment to the legislative resolution providing for access, in the third pillar, to be regulated in the framework decision on data protection.
I myself am draftsman for this framework decision and I will submit my draft report to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the start of 2006.
We consider that this is a reasonable compromise, which allows a balance to be struck between the protection of fundamental rights and the fight against serious crime and terrorism.
Finally, an agreement at first reading, under codecision, is a victory for the European Parliament.
Our institution proved that it was mature enough, and we can be proud of this outcome.
I would in fact point out that, at first, we had rejected the framework decision on data retention as it precluded all democratic debate.
We have opened the door for the years to come.
All matters pertaining to this same area â I repeat â will be dealt with under codecision with Parliament, not least â I would emphasise â the revision of this directive, which will most certainly be carried out, as technologies evolve rapidly.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Klamt said earlier that she was unable to contact the rapporteur, and I can understand her being increasingly hesitant about picking up the phone or sending him an e-mail.
Being opposed to the compromise struck by the two big groups, I shall endorse the rapporteurâs line.
Do the proposals that are now before us make our world a safer place?
No, we are, to a great extent, being lulled into a false sense of security, because the proposals are not proportionate.
They are ineffective because they are easy to circumvent.
They offer insufficient guarantees for the protection of innocent citizens and finally, they offer insufficient guarantees for good cooperation and exchange between the Member States, for that is the key to effective policy, and we still have not seen enough results.
The Council has reluctantly agreed to codecision but I have to tell Mr Clarke that codecision is not a favour; it is a democratic right, and the Councilâs democratic instincts are not terribly deeply rooted, to put it mildly.
I would like to say to the Council that pushing this legislation through in a hurry is not a judicious way of going about things and is not, therefore, in keeping with the âbetter lawmakingâ that we are always talking about.
I have to admit, therefore, that I am disappointed to see how the critical stance of this House has, in the past four months, melted like snow in the sun.
Sadly, I have to say that the compromise, which will undoubtedly be accepted tomorrow, does not make me feel any safer.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I was wondering why the UK Presidency wanted to fast-track this directive at all costs.
Clearly, its keenness to achieve at least one result in this disastrous presidency has also determined the debating time for this directive.
I should like to express my solidarity with MrÂ Alvaro because I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have made the text put forward by the Commission worse.
Basically, they demonstrate two things: first, Parliamentâs subordinate position in relation to the Council and, secondly, that the major German coalition also casts its shadow over this Parliament.
I believe that this directive is disproportionate, because it places security above freedom and democracy.
We are faced with a slow, gradual and inexorable shift away from the rule of law towards a police state, and this Americanisation of the European Union has to be stopped by every possible means.
We have asked a single question: âCan you demonstrate to us that data retention can curb terrorism?â
We have not been given an answer.
Â Â  Mr President, in early October, it became apparent that more than 200 officers of the Rotterdam police force tried to read the dossier of the ex-Feyenoord player Robin Van Persie.
The computer denied them access but did â since âBig Brother is watching youâ â record their names.
So the database contains the names of not only well-known citizens who are suspects in criminal cases, but also police officers.
What worries me the most in this proposal is the misuse of databases by staff of the competent authorities.
My fundamental objection to this proposal is that the long-term storage of data on every citizen not only encroaches upon their privacy, but also means that they are, in fact, being treated as suspects, yet without having the rights that suspects enjoy.
Is this remedy not worse than the disease?
In the absence of any proof as to the effectiveness of this proposal, I should like the Commission and Council to spell out clearly how this directive will be tested and evaluated.
Mr Alvaro has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and the deal struck between the major groups without reference to the House is unprecedented in its serious undermining of our working practices.
I endorse the rapporteurâs line and I should like to finish by quoting George Orwellâs words to the effect that âSome groups are more equal than othersâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work that has been carried out on this very difficult matter.
Listening to the debate here today, I am somewhat reminded of 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London.
This Parliament rightly objected very strongly and criticised all those who were involved in terrorist acts, called for solidarity amongst Member States and amongst all the institutions of the European Union and sought to ensure that we could cooperate to fight the evil of terrorism.
One of the ideas to emerge is the question of data retention.
Sometimes when we hear the differing voices in the course of the debate, we have to return to the following fundamental principle.
Firstly, democratically elected governments have come together and agreed on a proposal; secondly, the Parliament of the European Union has come together and will hopefully agree on these proposals; and, finally, the desire to ensure that accountability â ensuring that the guardians and custodians are watched over by others â is being borne in mind.
I think everything is contained within this overall report to ensure that we can give those guarantees to individuals.
Let us not forget that every time we use a computer, whether it is to buy Christmas gifts or to book flights, data is already being retained by companies on those websites to target marketing and other products towards us.
What is emerging here is not a new alien creature: information is already being stored via cookies. There is no control over that.
The one concern I have â and maybe the Commissioner or the President-in-Office of the Council could respond to this â is doubt with regard to the legal basis for this directive.
There has been some dispute, as this is an issue dealing with counter-terrorism and serious crime, over the fact that it should be done under a framework decision and not a directive.
There is a potential clash of legal opinion in this regard.
It is important to preserve the rights of Member State parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained.
We all know that citizens prefer to deal with their own government, rather than the European government, to protect their rights and guarantees, so it must be a balance between the two.
Â Â  Mr President, instead of protecting the citizenâs rights and his private sphere, the confidentiality of data relating to telephone and media use is being more and more undermined, and this is of course done always and only in the service of the noble cause of counter-terrorism.
I simply wonder why it is that more and more action is being taken against inconvenient journalists, and in what way the private citizen is protected when the non-conformist elements in our society get to feel the heavy hand of state power.
The real criminals, organised in gangs and terror groups, are not only planning their acts further ahead â which makes plans for a time-limit on retention obsolete â but are also constantly finding new ways of evading prosecution by the state.
I do not believe that this new surveillance measure will do anything at all to prevent terrorist acts; on the contrary, it endangers those who have access to confidential information â doctors, lawyers, and journalists, for example â in the practice of their professions, and unashamedly makes incursions into the private domain of countless members of the public.
If the retention of data is to become another step on the road towards the total surveillance state, then I regard as indispensable a minimum of protection for the citizen, in the shape of sanctions that really have teeth in the events of the data thus stored being misused.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr Frattini, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the March European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council of April 2004 advocated the implementation of standards relating to the retention of data, given that modern telecommunications, with all of the benefits that they bring, can be used for the purposes of international crime, and, more seriously, terrorism.
Following these decisions, a framework decision was presented to us and was rejected by Parliament.
This was followed by the proposal before us, which, as MrÂ Cavada said, is a welcome one in that it takes account of Parliamentâs prerogatives through a proposed new legal basis.
I must express my disappointment, however, that we were forced to work within a severely truncated timeframe.
We did our best in the circumstances.
The negotiations were difficult and the compromise that was reached is far from perfect, yet we did what we had to in order to reach a compromise at first reading.
Unlike some Members of this House, I welcome the decision on a period of retention of six months minimum to 24 months maximum.
We cannot run the risk of backsliding in our efforts to fight crime because data were eliminated too quickly or were not retained at all.
It is crucial in my view that data be stored securely and that there be no room for abuse; the rules on data protection, security and access must be strengthened.
Member States must establish appropriate penalties, in line with their national laws.
If we fail to implement these rules effectively, we will be endangering peopleâs human rights.
We need a clause ensuring that within three years we assess the system that we are currently adopting, and in this regard I welcome the calls for transparency and for the Commissionâs eventual assessment to be made public.
I trust that this assessment, to be provided by Mr Frattini, helps us to make a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of the adoption of these instruments.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, finding a balance between the protection of peopleâs private lives and the retention of personal data in order to respond to the terrorist threat is difficult because the temptation is so strong in our Member States to transform exceptional measures into general rules.
The compromise reached with the European Parliament is a positive step, but it should not make us lose sight of the objective of having a directive providing a legal framework and identical guarantees in all countries, for all citizens.
I emphasise the recommendations made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in relation to businesses.
Businesses must neither become an instrument for governments to monitor their citizens, nor be hindered in their work, and their cooperation must go hand in hand with strict guarantees, not least in relation to the full reimbursement of extra costs.
Finally, it is vital that the arrangement be as well adapted as possible to the functioning of the Web and that it hinders neither the development of the Internet nor access to ICTs in the Union.
Neither can do without its freedom.
Â Â  Mr President, the present national variation that Mr Clarke says gives an open goal to criminals will persist and even grow under the Council Conservative-Socialist deal.
It is a pretext for gold plating to allow, for instance, the 15 years storage that Poland wants, a wider list of data used for purposes far removed from law enforcement and access for any public or private agency, and all with a convenient Brussels stamp of approval.
In contrast, the agreement of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is a reasonable and proportionate response to fighting terrorism.
If MEPs tomorrow accept the Council take-it-or-leave-it deal, they will have fallen victim to a vast con trick.
This Parliament could give up any pretence to care either about civil liberties or about European business competitiveness.
It is not too late for individual Members to rebel against the sell-out agreement by their leaders to a charter for mass surveillance and state snooping.
Finally, I deplore the attacks on Mr Alvaro; he delivered a resounding near-consensus in Committee.
To use his three day absence on an official trip to Israel at the end of a phone and fax is a cheap alibi for a stab in the back by Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure.
Â Â  â Madam President, the proposal for a directive being debated reveals in a characteristic and, I would say, cynical manner the character of the European Union itself, which has no hesitation in abolishing â I repeat abolishing â and not, in your words, restricting the personal and democratic rights achieved as a result of the fight of the peoples.
In this particular instance, it is abolishing â I repeat abolishing â freedom of communication, personal data protection and privacy.
It is abolishing the core of confidentiality of communications.
It is safeguarding and introducing legislation imposing across-the-board monitoring.
Everyone is under surveillance and provision is even made for criminal and administrative sanctions for companies which fail to comply with monitoring.
The breadth of monitoring includes every detail of communication and the impudence of the directive is so great that it calls on those being monitored to pay the cost of monitoring.
Apart from anything else, the directive also infringes constitutional provisions, for example of the Hellenic Constitution, and provisions of international conventions and obviously paves the way for abolishing personal rights and freedoms.
We reject the draft directive, which will not brook improvement.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, this debate centres on an issue that is of supreme importance for all of mankind.
For many years now, Members of the House have reiterated the point that freedom is mankindâs most valuable asset, and that human civilisation cannot develop properly without it.
It is true that terrorism must be fought by all available means and methods, but such a fight must not be waged at the cost of human freedom.
This directive does not in any way accomplish the goal it sets itself.
Technologies are already in existence that will make it possible for genuine terrorists and genuine criminals to be highly successful in avoiding checks.
What the directive will do instead is help bring about the total surveillance of millions of free citizens.
I should like to remind the Commissioner that such data will inevitably leak out.
I also have to say that the Commissioner is a hypocrite.
The comments he made yesterday before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, when defending himself against accusations that the CIA had transported a number of terrorists to Europe and interrogated them there, were of a very different tenor.
Today, however, he has come out in support of a solution that quite clearly curtails civil liberties.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction with the agreement finally reached on an issue that is so complex from technical and political points of view.
Much has been said about the implications of this issue in terms of restricting freedoms, but disguising powerful, unacceptable and worrying economic interests; a proposal that has been the subject of successive and complex debates, with voices against, but also with powerful and justified voices in favour.
I know that it has been difficult and also that the agreement contains significant concessions and abdications.
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to disagree with those people who do not feel that the measure is timely, effective or proportionate.
Whether we like it or not, our society of values is under threat and, whether we like it or not, the instruments available to us so far have not been entirely effective in dealing with this threat.
I therefore applaud the initiative that we are debating today, ladies and gentlemen, as I have always done, and I hope it will receive the majority support of the House.
Security over freedom, no.
I would say: infinite freedom, but with security; and that is simply because without security we cannot fully enjoy our freedoms.
Terror and crime exploit our doubts and hesitations and seek out our weakest points so that they can attack our societies.
We must fight them with all the power of our democratic system, a system that always advocates the full observance of legal guarantees.
To doubt that this is the case is to call into question, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by our judges and police and is to doubt the vitality of the democratic system.
The victims deserve all of our efforts.
And unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, I have not heard anybody talk about them this afternoon.
Â Â  â Madam President, today's compromise abolishes all the protections imposed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is a monument to non-harmonisation.
With what is now the standard pretext of combating terrorism, the Council is harmonising just one thing: the obligation for data to be retained which are currently retained voluntarily, in the expectation that a few criminals will be caught in this way.
At the same time, it refuses to make provision for anything tangible in order to protect millions of innocent citizens and their rights.
Thus, while Mr Clarke is talking about harmonisation, his proposal leaves the exemptions in Article 15(1) of the previous directive untouched.
As a result, the Council is giving the Member States the go-ahead to retain any information they want, for any purpose they choose and for any period of time they consider expedient, without the slightest material European presence, restriction or control.
My party, PASOK, will be voting against.
President-in-Office, on a personal note, it has been a great pleasure to work with you, both professionally and personally.
This is not personal, this is political.
What we have in the end is a proposal with a roar for police access and with a whimper for the protection of fundamental rights.
It is shame that we missed this opportunity.
Â Â  Madam President, the reasons given for this directive are the usual ones about the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but this is a red herring.
Governments already use the most sophisticated means to monitor national and international communications.
The United States of America has the Echelon system that enables it to intercept every form of international communication.
The British Government has GCHQ in Cheltenham.
Terrorists and organised criminals are well aware of this and do everything they can to avoid being tracked and caught by these means.
This directive is really about formalising the creation of a surveillance society and the control of individuals.
More and more powers are being concentrated in the hands of the state, at the expense of the individual.
The UK Presidency is trying to use this Parliament to implement a policy that has already been rejected by the UK Parliament.
This directive represents another step on the road to a police state.
I hope this Parliament will reject it.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, there can be no doubt that regulations on data retention can help us a great deal in our fight against terrorism and dangerous crime.
The efforts of all those involved in achieving a consensus on this issue should therefore be acknowledged.
At the same time, however, I have serious doubts about the interpretation of ArticleÂ X of the Directive.
The period of data retention may be extended to more than two years pursuant to this Article, provided that the appropriate procedure is followed.
MrÂ Clarke responded to a Polish journalist who had asked whether a data retention period of 15Â years would be permissible by saying that a period of this duration would still be compatible with the directive, even in such extreme cases.
The draft amendments that have been tabled to the Polish Telecommunications Act by the governing party in the Polish Parliament do in fact provide for a retention period of 15Â years.
As I see it, this is a test of sorts of the scope of the directiveâs application.
I do not believe that a 15-year retention period is compatible with the concept behind the directive, the aim of which is to protect individualsâ right to privacy.
A retention period of this duration also blatantly violates the principle of proportionality, and means that the directiveâs impact will not be commensurate with its goals.
Furthermore, there is a risk that procedures resembling those of a police state could be used, which would further the governmentâs short-term political goals while subjecting citizens to long-term and far-reaching surveillance.
There is every chance that data stored in such large quantities for such long periods could leak out.
This would provide criminal groups with even more opportunities to use it, which runs counter to the directiveâs fundamental goal.
I should therefore like to receive a clear answer from the Commissioner, and also from the Council representative, to the question of whether the Commission regards a 15-year data retention period as acceptable in line with the procedure outlined in ArticleÂ X.
I hope that MrÂ Clarkeâs response to the Polish journalist was founded on a misinterpretation of the directive, although it may well be the case thatÂ he has made some sort of concession to the Polish Government on this matter in order to achieve a compromise at any cost.
Since we are adopting joint regulations, however, we have a right to call for them to be interpreted similarly by all of the EU institutions.
Â Â  Madam President, this is a very difficult debate because, interestingly, groups that are normally homogeneous are split; political allies who normally work with one another are split.
I have absolute respect for those who have their reservations about that which is being proposed.
I ask that they have respect for those of us who believe that this is a way of protecting fundamental freedoms.
It is important to restate that this is not about the data within the calls or on the internet; it is about traffic data, and it is arguably to allow us to protect fundamental freedoms.
Of course, there are costs; there are costs to businesses, there are costs to each and every one of us, but the cost if we do nothing is cataclysmic.
We have to deal with the real and imagined threats.
There are people who use the Internet to entrap young women and children into prostitution rings.
If we can break one prostitution ring with this directive, that alone would have been worth it.
I and my group are proud that we have achieved a compromise that delivers and protects fundamental freedoms.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Council and the Commission have recently come to an agreement on the retention of stored data, and I am glad that it has proved possible, following long and intensive negotiations, for a compromise also to be reached between this House, the Council and the Commission.
This compromise is one that I can support.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend especial thanks to those who conducted the negotiations on Parliamentâs behalf, for they really did do their utmost.
We must also, though, be aware that we find ourselves caught between the desire to protect fundamental rights and the need to fight against international terrorism and organised crime.
I am also, in principle, glad to see the obligation imposed on telecommunications enterprises to store certain traffic data for the purpose of combating organised crime.
While I do believe that a three-month limit on their storage would have been perfectly sufficient, we do now have this compromise, and I find the flexibility acceptable.
Our democracies cannot, and must not, aim to make everything in a personâs life visible; whatever needs to be done in the fight against terrorism, the principles of the rule of law must be upheld, and so I very much hope that we, in Europe, will at last line up together to fight terrorism and organised crime.
In the same way that the international organisations opposed to law and order are interconnected, we too must combine and fight them together.
I very much hope that we need never again experience such tragic events as those that occurred in Madrid and London.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to address those Members who have spoken against this compromise.
We are worried about abuses, but we are also worried about a lack of protection for citizens.
Since democratic society is made up of personal restrictions and personal abdications, I would like us to consider one question: how much individual freedom must we surrender in order to guarantee fundamental rights, freedoms and collective security?
I believe that the immense majority of citizens are prepared to surrender some of their freedom for a certain amount of time, provided that equality is not affected and provided that democratic control and prosecution and punishment of any abuses is guaranteed.
We must not choose between security and freedom.
There can be no freedom without security.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know what I am talking about: I have been living with bodyguards for fourteen years.
It is not possible to be free if one cannot take oneâs children to school, if one cannot walk the streets, if one has to look under the car in order to safeguard oneâs daily life.
Freedom and security are part of democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not neutral.
I am passionately in favour of human rights.
I would therefore ask you to support this directive and this compromise.
Â Â  Madam President, from a Finnish perspective, I must say that I am slightly worried about the British debate here because, on the one hand, we have Mrs Ludford from the Liberal Democrats who agrees with Mr Batten from the UKIP Party and then you have Mr Cashman who is widely applauded by the British minister.
It is not very often that you get applause from a British minister in the European Parliament, so Mr Cashman should be congratulated for that.
Nevertheless, I wish to make three brief points.
The first concerns the balance between freedom and security.
We have taken the issue too lightly and we are not finding the right balance.
Perhaps we are rushing things.
I have heard people say that those who come from countries where terrorism is a threat must take this issue in a different way to those from a country where there is no threat.
I disagree: this is a common problem and we should all look at it from a broader perspective.
My second point concerns cost-efficiency or efficiency in general.
To me it seems that we have to calculate every piece of legislation carefully, we must make an estimation and base our legislation on that.
I do not think we have done that yet.
We have not gone far enough in trying to estimate how much this legislation costs.
I think we are also chasing the wrong crooks, because if you are a crook who does not have the brains to use hotmail or prepaid mobile phone networks, then you are a stupid crook and we are really chasing the stupid crooks.
My third and final point concerns procedure.
It might seem that I am against this whole initiative, but I am not.
What came out of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was quite good.
It was a good compromise.
Therefore I would urge this European Parliament not to be bullied by the Council or the UK Presidency but to find a compromise and push it through.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to focus on the internet part of this directive.
Mr Clarke, you think that the lack of massive quantities of traffic data is a threat to our security.
I disagree.
Practice shows that it is the lack of online security that offers unlimited opportunities to criminals and terrorists.
I will give you a practical example.
Last month, a group of three criminals who control a network of over 100Â 000 hacked PCs was rolled up by the Dutch police.
Control over those unsecured PCs gave the criminals the power to perpetrate all kinds of crimes, from massive identity theft, attacks on vital infrastructure and the unlimited opportunity to grant anonymous access to and use of all services of the internet, for whoever was willing to pay.
Imagine what could happen if these men offered their services to terrorist networks.
Imagine also how useless traffic data is, because it points at innocent people.
The methods used to track these criminals down are specified in the Cybercrime Treaty, which has been signed by all Member States but implemented by only a few.
It is those methods that we need to fight terrorism.
It is indisputable that this directive is intrusive.
It is questionable whether it will help.
On the internet side, it is even technically unfeasible.
I completely agree with my colleagues Mrs in't Veld and Mr Lambrinidis.
I fear a false sense of security.
I fear that part of this directive could even pose a threat to our security.
Â Â  When we debate the draft legislation tabled before us, we must take into account four issues.
Firstly, human rights must be upheld.
Personal data protection must be guaranteed in all circumstances.
Secondly, when crimes are committed with the use of new technologies, we cannot leave European criminal investigation agencies without the necessary resources.
Thirdly, bearing in mind the importance of competitiveness, we cannot place unacceptably high and unjustified burdens on the service industry sector.
And fourthly, we should only resort to the use of European-level regulations in areas where Member State regulations are less efficient.
To summarise it briefly: human rights, efficient criminal investigation agencies, competitiveness and subsidiarity.
These are targets we can probably all agree with.
Our orders of preference may be different, and they are indeed different even within our factions, as clearly proven by our debate today.
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to share a personal reflection.
As a young Hungarian MEP, my memories of the Socialist autocracy had been accumulated when I was very young, but I remember the recurring warning my parents gave me whenever I tried to talk politics on the phone: âThis should not be discussed on the phone!â
Everybody knew that the dictatorial authorities were monitoring telephone conversations.
This may sound familiar to my fellow Eastern and Central European Members.
I cannot deny that, partly due to this memory, my order of preference has the protection of personal data in the first place.
Therefore the only compromise I find acceptable is one that upholds to an equal extent all four aspects mentioned above.
A compromise that â while leaving room for manoeuvre for Member States to make their criminal investigation agencies more effective â does not affect human rights.
One last thought: due to the sensitivity of this issue, the newly created legislation cannot be set in stone.
I believe that a periodical review of the directive would be justified, particularly in respect of the range of data required by the authorities.
Â Â  Madam President, when, tomorrow, plenary votes on a minimum directive on data retention, we shall do so by means of an agreement with the Council and the Commission in which Parliament has the right of codecision.
Citizens put the fight against crime and terrorism high on the list of what the EU should tackle successfully.
People also want us to solve problems jointly, and that is something in which we have succeeded.
We have protected personal privacy and human rights.
Moreover, European police forces are being given modern aids to combat crime, including organised crime such as child pornography, the drugs trade, terrorism and trafficking in women and children for the purposes of prostitution.
That is something I am very pleased with, so I wish to thank everyone very much for their constructive cooperation.
We must succeed in these areas together.
We must also monitor what everyone in this Chamber is concerned about, and we must do it together.
Â Â  Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Alvaro for his excellent work as Parliamentâs rapporteur on this issue; MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld too has done excellent work as co-rapporteur.
I sincerely hope your efforts will not be in vain, as the hard work accomplished was circumvented at the last minute by a deal between the Council and the Commission and, shame to say, by the two biggest groups in this House.
The idea to rush this proposal through is not a good one.
Yes, we all agree that terrorism should be fought efficiently.
Yes, we all agree that electronic communications data can be very useful in tracking terrorists, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
Yes, that kind of information should be retained and used against those who are threats to our society.
But no, all citizens should not be treated as criminals.
No, I am not convinced that the compromise package proposed is a balanced one.
And, no, I do not think we have enough information available about how this proposal would affect the privacy of individuals and what kind of threats might be posed to civil liberties.
I am against this proposal.
Firstly, because the so-called compromise allows the use of retained data when investigating serious crimes, without defining these serious crimes.
Are infringements of intellectual property rights in peer-to-peer networks serious enough crimes for the data retained to be accessed?
One could suppose so when reading the statements from the content industry.
If we are passing terrorist laws and, at the same time, fulfilling other objectives, we should then at least have a chance to debate and examine them properly and have the right to proper procedures.
Secondly, we are leaving too much decision-making to the Member States.
However, in electronic communications the frontiers are artificial.
According to which jurisdiction would the seriousness of a crime be assessed when a packet of IP data circulates in different Member states, for example?
Thirdly, I am opposed to this proposal because it leaves completely in the air what kind of costs it brings and who should bear them.
Various estimates have been presented, and it is without question that the costs to operators and internet service providers are high.
These costs should at least be reimbursed if we were to impose any new data retention requirements.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, some speakers have attempted to create the impression that this directive might have been drawn up in a police state.
That is not a perspective that I share.
My opinion is that this directive, which was drawn up jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission, will in fact help to safeguard human rights and the rights of citizens, in particular their right to life and their right to a life in safety.
I shall therefore be supporting the report in tomorrowâs vote.
I feel that there is no contradiction between upholding such values as the citizensâ right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the fight against terrorism, on the other.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it can be said that a debate and a political process have taken place in this Chamber in recent weeks that have not only given Parliament a greater role in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but have also enhanced the overall image of the three European institutions.
In one of the many speeches, I heard someone say that this directive is an undemocratic instrument; some people even mentioned Stalin and Hitler.
This directive is a victory for democracy: it is an important, balanced instrument that serves both the people and, above all, those engaged in the fight against crime who pay the price even on a personal level.
I am referring to the investigating authorities, the police forces.
Besides, as MrÂ Cashman very clearly put it, what is the cost of not deciding, what is the cost of not doing anything?
Do we want to carry on with 20 different legal systems, in which each Member State does substantially what it wants, or is it not better instead to come together for the first time with a European approach, a directive, the first step towards harmonisation?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive firmly based on the principles of necessity and proportionality.
I have heard certain demands, for instance those made by MrÂ Reul and MrsÂ Kudrycka, who mentioned an idea that the Polish Parliament is examining.
I can certainly say that retaining data for 15 years does not seem to be in keeping with the criteria of proportionality and necessity.
Even though each Member State has a duty to demonstrate why its request is proportional and necessary, 15 years frankly seems to me a really extreme case.
I should still like to make two final considerations.
I am grateful to all those, particularly MrÂ DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra and MrsÂ DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, who have chosen to remember the victims of crime and have sought to emphasise that the fundamental freedoms of the person must definitely be assured â something with which I fully agree.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, if someone uses a mobile phone to set off a bomb, as unfortunately has happened, or to give instructions to a gang of paedophiles, is it not right that the police and the courts, that is to say the legitimate institutions, should have the tools to prevent and to tackle such crimes?
I think it is right that that should happen, and at the same time I think it is right that any abuse of the system should be punished, as we have stated in the directive.
The police forces need more tools, as do the courts in our countries, which are democracies, as well as more checks to see whether anyone has abused the system.
To conclude, the European institutions have unfortunately been divided, and still are, on major issues, but it is highly reassuring â and I hope tomorrowâs vote will confirm this â to see that the European institutions will not be divided on the subject of peopleâs security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
Instead, all three of them together will have the ability to respond extremely quickly to our fellow citizensâ needs.
Â Â  . Madam President, firstly, in our capacity as Presidency, we have tried to work with all groups within the European Parliament.
I pay respect to Mr Alvaro as rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; I have been to that committee on a number of occasions to have discussions on these points.
They are difficult matters, which is why there are differences of opinion, but they are differences of opinion based, I hope, on mutual respect.
Secondly, these proposals are about networks.
Networks are the modern criminality, whether they are terrorist, paedophile, drug- or people-trafficking networks.
It is not a question of the content of the communication, but what the network is, who is in it.
It is very important to understand that.
As far as the point about Poland is concerned, MrÂ Frattini is completely correct in what he says.
There is a clear procedure if Member States want to go beyond the period of time.
They can consult the Commission and the Commission will then make a judgement on the proportionality issue, which Mr Frattini has mentioned, also as regards the criteria of the single market and competitiveness within the single market.
Those are the procedures and that also is clear.
On the question raised by Mr Crowley from Ireland, it is certainly true that Mr McDowell, the Irish Minister, raised questions about the legal basis.
We took opinion from the Councilâs legal services, which were very clear, on the basis of the legal advice, that this is the right course to follow.
My final point: people have talked about a police state.
This is the opposite of a police state.
We are all democracies, both the European Parliament and each country.
It is the rule of law that determines how this technique is used, and what we are doing here is proposing the rule of law.
Those who talk about Hitler or Stalin or police states are utterly wrong.
This proposal goes in exactly the opposite direction.
I hope, when the vote takes place tomorrow, we will agree that the democratic European Parliament will stand by the democratic Council of the European Union, will stand by the democratic Commission in that process, to defend our democracy against the criminality which is working to weaken us and our societies at all times.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to make it plain, for Mrs in 't Veldâs benefit, and in order to nip in the bud any potential legends on the subject, that the rapporteur was in Israel until the evening of the Wednesday prior to the crucial meeting of the Council.
It was on Wednesday that I had recourse to the telecommunications facilities and informed MrÂ Alvaro of our proposals by email.
As far as I know, Mrs Roure did likewise.
Mrs Kaufmann and MrsÂ Buitenweg were of the opinion that a deal had been done behind the backs of the smaller groups, but I would like to remind them that the European United Left and the Greens had already rejected the Committeeâs compromise, and it is hardly productive to initiate negotiations with groups that are categorically opposed to a proposal; after all, they, as a matter of principle, will negotiate on all other matters with any group other than the Group of the European Peopleâs Party.
So let them stop talking about âdealsâ and accept the democratic majority opinion in this House.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
