Furthermore, what is the purpose of using tax money to set up a new separate institution which caters for such a restricted set of tasks?
However, as already stated, we can only talk about the statute of the Supervisor and his assistant today, a role which I also question.
In my view, the fact that a Supervisor is accorded the same status as the Ombudsman is neither here nor there, but to give his assistant the same special status is both costly and difficult to justify.
The assistant simply belongs in the organisational chart.
The Commission has underlined the analogy with the Ombudsman at every opportunity, but the Ombudsman has no assistant and has no other official who will be paid as handsomely as the assistant to this Supervisor.
Since, of course, the Ombudsman and Supervisor will subsequently need to be independent, the official positions will simply need to fall within the remit of the budgetary authorities and not be laid down in a statute.
I hope that we can at least get this right.
I can only endorse what my colleague Mrs Buitenweg has said, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee.
I have to say that it is rather disappointing that the two opinions from the committees have been largely ignored in the Committee of Citizens' Freedoms.
It is important that we say here and now that the mere fact that we strongly approve of the principles of protecting data and that we want to move forward, and also the fact that this needs to be done quickly, does not absolve us from the job of scrutinising this proposal properly.
Normally, as he knows, I am very supportive of what Mr Bolkestein does, but in this case I do not feel that the Commission has in any way justified to us the salary and status of the staff that it proposes to administer this work.
I very much echo what Mrs Buitenweg has said.
If this goes through as proposed, to carry out the task that we have set down here, we will be appointing someone who is substantially higher graded and better paid than someone running a major Community institution such as the Trade Mark Protection Office in Alicante - a major autonomous institution.
As Mrs Buitenweg said, we do not yet know how many staff will be engaged in this process.
I asked the Commission to give me more details about the establishment, the organisation, and the responsibilities and particularly the role of the assistant.
Yet the Commission is proposing that we should appoint an assistant on the basis of someone who manages 1 000 staff in the European Court of Justice - now that does not make sense.
Frankly, I have to say to Mr Bolkestein, if this goes through tomorrow - and I hope that we will actually have the opportunity to discuss in more detail and look at some amendments that you will accept - the fact we have come in at the end of the process has made it very difficult for those of us who want change to put forward acceptable amendments.
If this goes through, you will have got off pretty lightly and I hope you will give us assurances, firstly that you will properly justify this grade and position, and secondly, that we will be scrutinising every move you make when you put it in place, to make sure that it is done properly.
Mr President, first of all may I say that I have much sympathy with the remarks that have just been passed by Mr Harbour.
He has spoken very clearly and I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein has listened carefully to what he had to say.
I take this, however, from a slightly different tack.
The position of the Data Protection Supervisor is of enormous importance.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights which I helped to prepare states that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her and the Amsterdam Treaty called for the establishment of an independent supervisor by 1 January, 1999.
This deadline is, of course, well past and our main priority, therefore, is to create this post as soon as we possibly can.
The urgency of the matter should not in itself be an excuse for us to rush it through without proper discussion.
Indeed, the salary of both the Data Protection Supervisor and his assistant has resulted in numerous discussions within our committees.
Many people, myself included, were unhappy about the unreasonably high salary of the supervisor, which will of course be comparable to that of the Ombudsman.
But I contrast this discussion with the kind which one might have in a national parliament where, frankly, the issue itself is of such dramatic importance to the establishment of this role that it ought perhaps to be dealt with not in this particular plenary but elsewhere.
We are not as flexible as I would like.
Most of the matters relating to the post have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and published in the Official Journal.
I know that the Secretariat has also declared a number of the amendments to be out of order for various reasons and this has caused concern among many colleagues.
Internal politics has also been a feature of this debate.
It is unfortunate, that there is no single data protection instrument for all the pillars.
As a member of the Future of Europe Convention, I do hope, indeed I might even anticipate, that at the conclusion of the work that we shall be doing, it may well be that the protection of the private citizen and the interests of the private citizen, both in terms of the work of the Ombudsman - which I highly value and respect - and also in connection with data protection issues, will be spelled out very clearly as something in need of development in the future.
I hope, therefore, that whatever we decide - and I do hope that we decide to proceed with this post when we vote on this week - we will return to the matter and at an appropriate moment, perhaps, during discussion of the next Treaty or before then, we will look at ways of endorsing the position of citizens and making sure their relationship with institutions in Europe is a properly balanced one.
Mr President, it is precisely because I am concerned with internal affairs policy that I observe that the European Data Protection Supervisor plays a most important role in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is he who creates public trust in the institutions of the European Union.
He must work where the majority of the institutions are permanently based, that is, in Brussels - if that is the point at issue.
If he works elsewhere, the impression is created that he is of only negligible significance.
If the public get the impression that the Data Protection Supervisor is nothing more than a paper tiger, they will not trust the European Union.
If they have no confidence in the way their data is protected, our internal affairs policy will never enjoy the public approval it needs for freedom, security and justice to be allowed to grow.
That, though, is our objective.
We want internal affairs policy to have a European added value, which will be achieved only if the citizens put their trust in us.
It is for that reason that we, and, in particular, the Commission, must show them that we take data protection seriously and that it is not in a merely symbolic sense that we are putting it centre stage.
Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate is really about a struggle between openness and secrecy.
We are surprised at how much in terms of resources it is proposed should be allocated to this area, compared with how much the Commission has invested in turning the regulation on transparency into a reality.
It is the lack of balance that surprises us.
Naturally, the way in which the Commission interprets the regulation on transparency also surprises us.
Parliament and the Commission do of course disagree about the Bavarian Lager case and about the way in which the Commission interprets the concept of data protection in that instance.
That is why this issue is so difficult.
As a Scandinavian citizen, I am also very disappointed at the fact that the Commission never refers to the supplementary clause, incorporated into Directive 95/46/EC on Sweden's initiative and stating that account must always be taken of the public when processing personal data.
I would also say to some of the participating MEPs here that there are forces in Sweden which believe that the law concerning personal data should be repealed.
I myself have also had experience of not being able to obtain information from the Commission in terms specifically of the law on personal data when I wanted to know who had complained about my country to the Commission.
I would also quote what our legal adviser said about why it may not perhaps be possible to publish the list of assistants, legal advisers and members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Net.
The reason was as follows:
(the speaker continued in French)
There is a Regulation No 45/2001 relating to the protection of personal data.
It is doubtless possible to be called before the judge by the European Data Protection Supervisor who has very wide powers, greater even than those of the European Ombudsman.
(the speaker continued in Swedish)
These are the facts.
I hope that we shall support transparency and that, here in Parliament, we shall at least be able to question those proposed for the office in question.
Mr President, let me say one thing at the outset, namely that I am no great friend of ombudsmen.
I still feel that we, as elected members of Parliament, should be the primary ombudsmen of the people of Europe.
Why do we need a Data Protection Supervisor?
My esteemed fellow MEP, Timothy Kirkhope, justified it on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and by reference to data protection's significance.
I do not believe that one can argue in this way, as we would next need a family ombudsman, a women's ombudsman and a children's ombudsman as well.
All these groups have an important place in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In Schleswig-Holstein, the province of the Federal Republic of Germany from which I come, we have developed a veritable abomination; we even have a bicycle ombudsman.
Anyone, though, who believes that cyclists come off better out of this, even in the planning of the budget, is, as we say, barking up the wrong tree.
No, data protection really is important, and the reason why it is so to us is that we parliamentarians find monitoring difficult - even the monitoring of the Commission, and especially of what goes on within it - and so, of course, we need an auxiliary person in this field.
He or she, as Mr Ceyhun rightly said, must be based in Brussels, where he or she is to carry on the work of monitoring.
Let us move on to remuneration.
No matter how important the position may be, I really cannot see that an ombudsman, who is to monitor this data, should, in salary terms, be on the same footing as a judge at the European Court of Justice.
Why that should be the case completely eludes me.
A judge at the Court of Justice occupies a significantly superior and more important position.
The judges are, in any case, the guardians of our treaties.
Why, then, should we pay a data protection supervisor as much as a judge at the ECJ?
I think that in this respect our yardsticks of value have shifted a bit over the years, and they need to be put back in order.
We should rather think about bringing the Ombudsman back to the right pay level instead of going straight ahead with allocating too much to the next position.
On this point, I appeal for a bit more of a sense of reality.
Mr President, the Commission has argued that the right of access to documents and the right to privacy are both legitimate rights and that when they both enter into consideration, a balance has to be struck.
However, the idea of striking a balance between them on a case-by-case basis whenever a name is mentioned misrepresents the nature both of dealing with openness in the public sector and the right to privacy.
The principle of openness means that public bodies should take decisions as openly as possible and is now defined in the public access regulation.
That regulation provides for exceptions to access.
The point of this exception is that a public body may, in carrying out its public duties, come into possession of information about the private and family life of individuals.
However, there is nothing in Article 286 of the EC Treaty or in the Data Protection Directive to suggest that data protection rules should be applied as a general principle of confidentiality in public administrations so as to require a public balancing exercise whenever a document mentions a name.
Such an over-interpretation would damage not only the right of public access to documents, but also the genuine purpose of data protection and the performance of the duties of the Data Protection Supervisor.
Mr President, I welcome the fact that the EU is on the way to introducing its own data protection supervision.
If there is no effective, independent supervision of the ways in which legislation is formulated and applied, people are in danger of having their human rights infringed in terms of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights - the right to respect for private and family life, as well as to the protection of personal data.
More and more people handle ever greater quantities of sensitive personal information.
The amount of such information will expand further, especially when Schengen has been fully integrated into Community legislation.
Other sensitive information, of a kind as yet unknown, may be anticipated in the long term.
The first EU country to introduce effective data protection was, interestingly enough, the country with the most far-reaching rules when it comes to openness and transparency.
If it is to be possible to introduce a strong and generally applicable principle of transparency, it must be understood that any such principle needs to be strong where both these aspects are concerned.
The rights balance each other out.
We have the basis for legislation on transparency in place.
The legislation must also be respected and be designed in the way that is intended and not restricted through other methods.
Through data supervision, the EU also shows that it is serious about guaranteeing people their fundamental rights.
The right of access to documentation and to information, together with the defence of fundamental rights are both legitimate.
Neither takes precedence over the other.
They also balance each other out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, supported by this House.
Logically, this position must also be reflected in the status of the data protection supervisor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should emphasise the fact that the protection of personal data is essential to ensuring that every individual's rights, fundamental freedoms and right to privacy are respected, throughout the European Community.
This proposal is intended to respond, as has already been said, to two fundamental issues: the performance of the duties of this European data protection supervisor, which have already been laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 45/2001; in other words, the issue of the pay of the European supervisor and deputy supervisor and the issue of where they are to be based.
With regard to the location, I agree with those who have said that it does not make sense to have it anywhere but Brussels, for the reasons that have already been stated and which I shall not repeat.
There are, however, other issues which, perhaps due to the highly technical and abstract nature of the regulation, still remain open and which should be responded to.
For example, provisions on procedural aspects and on the way in which the authority should exercise its powers of investigation should be included here.
Furthermore, it is to be regretted that there is no instrument for data protection that could apply to all the Community pillars.
The duties of this supervisor will be limited to the first pillar, but Europol and Schengen - for which data protection instruments are also planned, with the creation in 2000 of a joint secretariat - are currently excluded from the post's scope.
This means that very little data of a more sensitive nature will fall within the scope of this European supervisor's mandate, which gives legitimacy to the criticism of those who say that the pay package is probably excessive for a post with such limited duties.
I sincerely hope that in the near future, the current structure and organisation of this European Data Protection Supervisor can be adapted to also include, under the responsibility of a single European authority, supervisory authorities within the European organs created on the basis of Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty, in order to prevent the unnecessary duplication of functions and resources.
At the same time, it would be good to alleviate the risk of a possible duplication of some functions between the Ombudsman and this European authority, with a view to optimising the use of Community resources.
Mr President, the aim of this draft decision is to ensure the full implementation of Article 286 of the Amsterdam Treaty and of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies, adopted under codecision procedure on 18 December 2000.
Before going any further may I stress that the regulation we are now debating was adopted by this Parliament in codecision in a single reading, so it is a little late for some Members of this Parliament to complain about the contents of this regulation, for example where it stipulates that there should be an assistant regulator in this area.
It is a little late to start complaining about that, but today we are dealing with other issues and, therefore, I should like to continue my contribution to this debate by saying that it concerns the place of data protection in relation to the right of citizens to transparent administration.
Some Members who have spoken tonight have expressed concern that this initiative might impede, or even reverse, the significant progress made towards achieving the greatest possible transparency in Community administration.
I must assure these Members that the principle of transparency, and in particular the principle of public access to documents as enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is applicable to the Community institutions and bodies and in particular to the European Data Protection Supervisor.
On the other hand neither of these two principles - data protection on the one hand and public access to documents on the other - has absolute force or takes precedence over the other.
The Human Rights Convention as interpreted in the case law of the Strasbourg courts and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union require that a balance should be struck in specific cases in order to reconcile the various interests at issue.
Any attempt to change this by putting an artificially narrow interpretation on the field of application of the fundamental rights governing data protection by denying the representatives of the new body to be set up the institutional status they need to assert their independence, would be on shaky ground.
The European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has built up a body of case law on the interpretation of the scope of protection of private and family life which cannot and should not be called into question by this decision.
In accordance with this case law the professional life of individuals - employees and employers alike - is not excluded from the field of application of data protection.
Amendment No 1 would introduce an unacceptable ambiguity in this respect.
The status of the European Data Protection Supervisor and his deputy, who together form a sort of mini-committee, must, above all, ensure their independence in the Community institutional context beyond the mere budgetary aspects.
The Ombudsman is a good Community-level reference, given his role in monitoring administrative procedures.
At national level - I should like to say in particular to Mr Harbour but also to others - a judge or even a chief justice is often taken as the reference.
The draft decision takes account of the two references.
Any reduction in the status of the deputy would mean loss of independence without any corresponding budgetary savings.
Amendments Nos 10, 11, 13 and 14 are not sufficiently precise to determine the level of remuneration of the President and his deputy.
Amendments Nos 12 and 16 contain excellent ideas but the present decision's legal base of Article 43, Regulation 45/2001, is not sufficiently large to carry them.
Amendments Nos 9 and 15 refer to parts only of the evidence and need redrafting with a view to achieving more balance.
Parliament and the other institutions concerned have a great responsibility towards the citizens of Europe to ensure that the data protection system, including the supervision provided for in the Treaty as long ago as 1999, is put in place as soon as possible.
With that in mind the Commission intends to be very flexible with regard to the amendments accepted in the Civil Liberties Commission in the tripartite dialogue with a view to establishing a final text of the decision by agreement between the three institutions.
It also hopes that the Council, which has already expressed its agreement with the Commission proposal, may be able to act likewise.
I feel I should raise a point of order in relation to what the Commissioner has just said.
He referred to a number of texts on the definition of privacy and he referred to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the protection of privacy and family life.
As the rapporteur on the Regulation on Access to Documents, I feel it only right to point out that in the judgment of 16 February 2000, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed its earlier case law, that it is data relating to the private life of an individual that falls within the scope of Article 8.
The preamble to the Data Protection Convention and recitals to the Data Protection Directive also make clear that their purpose is to protect the fundamental right of privacy, not to restrict the information available to citizens about public activities.
If the Commission pursues the line indicated tonight, it is on a collision course with Parliament.
Mr Cashman, whether that is strictly a point of order or not I am not prepared to rule at the moment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0046/2002) by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the European Commission's legislative and work programme (amendment of Rule 57 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure) (2001/2110(REG)).
Mr President, Commissioner, the annual legislative and work programme is an incredibly important tool for decision-making and planning here in Parliament.
It is on this basis that we proceed when we prepare our work - work that has consequences for ourselves, for the parliaments of our Member States and for our citizens.
We know how important it is that it should be possible to monitor the decision-making processes in the European institutions.
That is the purpose of the work of reform in our Parliament.
It is on President Cox's agenda, and this ambition is the basis of the laudable work being done by Mr Corbett when it comes to reforming the methods of working.
Increased openness and accessibility are also the basic ideas behind the Commission's work on the White Paper on European Governance.
Unfortunately, work on the annual programme has not always proceeded so well.
In a majority of cases, Parliament has criticised the procedures.
The programme has been late in arriving.
The priorities have been unclear.
There has been insufficient follow-up, and many proposals have been recycled.
Parliament's role in preparing the programme has been unsatisfactory, in spite of the fact that the framework agreement states clearly and unambiguously that the Commission must take the maximum account of the guidelines proposed by Parliament.
Parliament has, however, responded with extremely long 'shopping lists' which have perhaps not always been realistic.
Immediately before Christmas, when the Commission's proposal was presented, Parliament chose, of course, not to regard it as a legislative programme on the grounds that it was a text with only general objectives.
The development of the co-decision procedure makes it necessary not only for Parliament but also for the Council to play a greater role in preparing the programme, even though it is of course, as stated in the Treaty, the Commission which has the right of initiative.
As the Commission takes more and more legislative initiatives, it may be difficult for Parliament to keep up, and we shall sometimes be blamed for legislation's being delayed.
It is therefore important that the Council and the two countries holding the presidency during the year should play their part in planning the annual programme so that it can be synchronised better.
Now, following nine months of negotiations and a great many meetings, we have agreed upon how to improve the procedures.
I believe that we have made a very great deal of progress in the best interests of ourselves, the institutions and the people.
The agreement involves quite a long process involving staging posts, regular dialogue and checkpoints, as well as close cooperation and partnership.
The year is to begin with a kind of 'State of the Union' debate for the coming year, involving all the institutions including the Council.
It will be based upon a draft work programme prepared by the Commission and, during the spring, there will then be discussions between the Commission and the committees affected so that priorities within the relevant areas might be debated jointly.
Those of us who sit on the committees and work with the issues on a daily basis naturally have a feeling for which issues are topical and for what supplementary legislation and what common positions are needed.
By involving the committees at such an early stage, we shall be better prepared when the legislative proposal is, in fact, submitted, and the work can then proceed smoothly and easily.
The agreement also includes a mid-term review of the ongoing legislative work, a feature I think is very much to be welcomed if a situation is to be avoided in which proposals are recycled.
The forthcoming programme will then be taken stock of at the time of the Conference of Presidents. The Commission's proposals will be presented in Parliament in November.
All this is to be found in the appendix to the proposal we are to vote on tomorrow.
The annual legislative programme is to be presented with reference to a calendar, to the legal base and to any budgetary implications.
It is also important to think of the priorities and of the need for the principle of subsidiarity to have a major impact.
These are obligations for the Commission, but they are also based upon Parliament's taking responsibility and demonstrating self-discipline when it comes to the number of proposals we ask the Commission to take up.
We cannot draw up long lists, but we must show that we know how to prioritise.
We should also become better at appointing rapporteurs promptly.
We have everything to gain from creating a good climate of cooperation with the Commission.
To make it easier for the electorate, ourselves and the mass media to follow the legislative work, a common database should be set up showing who in the Commission and Parliament is responsible for a particular proposal.
The database should also contain information about the calendar, budgetary implications and legal base.
The database should be publicly available.
I believe it should prove to be of very great help to our colleagues in the national parliaments.
Mr President, I hope that, no later than in the course of the next few days, the Commissioners will begin to visit Parliaments' committees so that a start can be made as soon as possible on following the agreed timetable and method of working.
By changing the procedures in this way, I believe we can obtain a method of working and a legislative cycle which are more effective, more transparent and more comprehensible.
It will then be possible to improve considerably European forms of governance.
Finally, I want to thank Mrs de Palacio who has really made an effort to enable us to bring about an agreement.
It is obvious that she has been a parliamentarian herself and understands Parliament's problems and concerns.
I should genuinely like also to thank the other political groups for cooperating with us in reaching this final result.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, not only for having familiarised herself with these difficult processes but also for having conducted the negotiations on the subject with the Commission with the rigour, prudence, but also the friendliness that they call for.
I believe that this result will, both for the Commission and the other institutions have a calming effect on procedures which, over and over again, have led in the short or long term to disputes that might well have been unnecessary.
For us, this result makes it possible to make debate on the Commission's annual work programme more political, getting away from listing individual projects somewhat in the manner of a book-keeper, indeed, it makes it possible for us to set out at the start of the year, what we see as the European Union's most important projects in the coming year.
One might say that this procedure and the preparation for it make this annual work programme interactive.
I believe that this represents a move forward in terms of the reliability and predictability of the processes we are considering.
As Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has rightly emphasised, this result also makes demands of us ourselves, for we really must refrain from constantly repeating what we wanted already, and must instead actually limit our deliberations to a period of one year.
It is also necessary for us to become more closely involved than before in the actual planning of the half-year presidencies, which may go against our own priorities.
Involvement in the preparation of the legislative programme is important to us also because we still do not possess the right of initiative in the European legislative process.
On that, let me say something about my personal assessment of the position. Our spontaneous reaction when the Commission's sole right of initiative is called into question is always a cool one.
Above all, the Commission itself reacts understandably with great reserve on that point.
Despite that, we must of course consider whether we should raise the issue anew, perhaps within the framework of the Convention's discussions, for it is the case that the European Union's great acquis communautaire, consisting of some 10 000 instruments, can be amended only on the Commission's proposal.
I will say here that I doubt whether that satisfies the requirements of a democracy.
To that extent the decision we are drawing up today, is also a crutch, helping Parliament to move towards enhanced involvement in initiatives.
Mr President, my group will support Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m's proposals, and I would also like to offer her our congratulations for the hard work she has put in for more than nine months and in negotiating intensely with the Commission.
Parliament and the Commission have long recognised that legislative planning is a matter of common concern.
The Commission has the right of initiative.
My group does not seek to change that.
We have the right to call upon the Commission to make proposals already given to us in the Treaty.
It has the right of initiative.
We are a parliament that is master of its own timetable, unlike some national parliaments.
We both therefore have an interest in reaching an understanding on the legislative programme coming up in any given year so as to plan our work, so as to exchange views on priorities, so as to reach agreement and convergence as much as possible.
That has long been the case, but the actual procedures by which we have done it have not always been working satisfactorily, and I welcome this updating and rationalisation that has been put forward.
Given the number of times that we will be discussing and looking at the following year's programme in the different fora over a year, my one fear is that, if we are not self-disciplined, we will spend an enormous amount of time looking at what will come up well over a year ahead, without being very concrete.
We must be self-disciplined and make sure that problem does not arise.
There is a ghost missing from this feast, namely the Council, and the role of the Council presidency.
Council presidencies often present a programme to Parliament as if they were assuming executive office.
Council presidents must remember that they are not taking over executive office when they become president of the Council.
They are merely chairing the body which is the co-legislative body with Parliament for a short period of six months, with an inherited agenda.
We must make sure that this legislative planning works without upsetting the whole balance of the system by delivering it in the wrong way.
I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m on this report.
It is an important proposal because it introduces a more formal structure into the process of Parliament's scrutiny of the Commission's legislative programme, which is, after all, a very important component of one of our most important functions - that is to say, scrutinising and holding the Commission to account.
Following what the Commission is up to is always slightly difficult unless one is a true initiate of the workings of the European political system.
Most people are not, and so to introduce a more formal structure into this process is, in my view, a very desirable development because it should assist those outside the circle of initiates, by providing as it does a series of markers for the cycle of the year's business.
Ignorance of the way in which the European Union works, coupled with the failure of national parliaments to oversee and scrutinise European matters properly, are two of the great weaknesses in the European political structure as it has developed.
Now, while it is for national parliaments themselves to determine their own agendas, I as a Member of the British second Chamber as well as a Member of this House feel that the formal structuring of the way that the European Parliament scrutinises what the Commission is doing may well be a very useful template for scrutiny by national parliaments and at the same time for disseminating accurate facts about what is going on at European level, to the benefit of all our citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you warmly for offering me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the reform of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure and specifically the proposed revision of Rule 57, which takes up the agreement we have reached between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the methods for presenting our legislative and working programmes.
The contacts we have maintained throughout these months have allowed us to reach a solution for structuring a constructive dialogue on this issue, which is important.
The text which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes including in an annex to European Parliament's Rules of Procedure respects the institutional role of the Commission and Parliament and honours the mutual commitments we have made over the last two and a half years.
I would firstly like to thank Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m for her cooperation and constructive work - which has not always been easy, but the results of which have made it all worthwhile - in our debates and discussions, and that of the whole of the Parliament's team and the representatives of the various political groups, since I believe that this has allowed us to achieve a proposal which I hope will be beneficial to the functioning of the European institutions.
The College of Commissioners has held in-depth debates on this matter and has agreed that the right of initiative laid down in the Treaties must be retained in its current form, with the collegial responsibility of the Commission.
Furthermore, Parliament must be informed on time, and not only informed, but it must also be in a position to be able to contribute its ideas and suggestions on the best definition of Community policies.
In this respect, I believe that the agreement, which I am not going to explain, since Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has done so magnificently, includes the ideal procedure for combining these elements.
As for Mr Corbett's point, it is true; we should consider how we can involve the Council in this process.
We will have to seek a formula which, of course, must be acceptable to the Council.
In any event, we in the Commission hope that this structured dialogue can focus our attention, as Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m rightly said, on the political and strategic aspects in relation to the broad approaches of our action, with realism, as the new President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox, has also said on a previous occasion.
The Prodi Commission fully shares this objective and we want to prevent this process from becoming a mere bureaucratic accounting operation, which should not stop us from applying the relevant rigour, and the debates should be accompanied by general approaches and political considerations which, as has been said previously, can be turned into concrete proposals and political approaches.
I hope that, by means of this dialogue, we will discuss our political priorities for 2003, in order to define concrete courses of action for the enlarged Europe.
In any event, the Commission, as it has been doing since 1999 when it came to office, will fully comply with the agreements with this Parliament and we hope that the trust and cooperation between the two institutions will lead to the better functioning of the institutions and that, furthermore, when the time comes we can also seek a formula to incorporate the Council as well.
Congratulations once again to Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
The discussions have been long but the final result has made it worthwhile.
In any event, we will soon find out, because within a couple of months a first round of participations by all the Commissioners will begin - by means of the specialised committees - in relation to our future projects for next year.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
I declare closed the 2001-2002 session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)
Opening of the session
I declare open the annual session of the European Parliament for the year 2002-2003.
I have received a request for a topical and urgent debate on the Council's proposal to change the legal basis for the European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (?EC) No 218/92 on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation (VAT) [C5-0103/2002 - 2000/0147(COD)].
Mr President, two years ago the Commission presented two proposed modifications, one of the sixth directive and the other of the Regulation on administrative cooperation.
The aim of both was to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with those of third countries, particularly American ones, in terms of the provision of services.
This discrimination is due to the fact that companies from outside the Union do not pay value-added tax when they provide electronic services, while European companies are obliged to pay it.
Since this is an urgent issue, Parliament produced two reports very quickly.
At the moment, the Council are asking us for a change to the legal basis exclusively for the Regulation on administrative cooperation.
I am not going to expand on this issue, but I wish to say they are two different things.
The Committee believes that we should not proceed with the change of legal basis, but that the issue should be studied with the greatest urgency, in order to put an end to this discrimination and, furthermore, as Parliament has requested, in order to facilitate the use of electronic means for identifying clients, putting an end to the costs which are faced in particular by small and medium-sized businesses.
I would therefore advise the House to accept the Council's request in relation to the urgency procedure, and not accept the change of legal basis in relation to this issue.
It is one thing to deny a material request and quite another to deny it an urgency procedure so that these two proposals can be implemented very quickly.
Mr President, the information on the vote on request for urgent procedure on administrative cooperation was not supplied to me in due time, or rather, it was not delivered at all, and, for that reason, I am unable to vote in favour of it.
Mr Ilgenfritz, I appreciate your request.
However, I can tell you that Parliament's services have been trying to get the translation since last night.
If you insist, we shall have to postpone the vote until the relevant document has been distributed in every language.
Last night, I attended the coordinators' meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
It is unfortunate that the chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath, is not here today.
Otherwise, I am certain that she would have told you that the meeting of coordinators last night decided to advise against urgent procedure.
The reason for that is that the Council would like to decide on this matter before 1 July, which leaves us plenty of time, even if we do not decide on urgent procedure today.
It can be discussed reasonably quickly, but there is no need at all for urgent procedure.
It is, indeed, correct that the legal basis still causes some difficulty, but we can discuss this in due course.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs therefore advises against urgent procedure.
Mr President, I want to raise a point of order on a very serious matter dealing with Scotch whisky.
A year ago, this Parliament selected two whiskies to be put on sale to Members of Parliament, to visitors and to people visiting our shops in Brussels and Strasbourg with Parliament's own label and own brand placed on the bottles.
The College of Quaestors has agreed all of the conditions necessary for having these whiskies placed on sale in our shops, yet the Administration is still blocking their sale in our shops.
This is a serious matter because it raises the question of who runs this Parliament - the Members or the Administration?
I would ask you, Mr President, to intervene in this matter to ensure that the request of the College of Quaestors taken on behalf of the Members is carried out and that these branded whiskies are placed on sale in our shops.
Thank you very much, Mr Stevenson.
May I assure you that the Quaestors will look into the matter tomorrow on the basis of what you have just said.
Mr President, yesterday, in one of the Palestinian refugee camps, Ariel Sharon's troops killed twenty-two people.
I do not know whether to feel horror or shame at the Israeli Government's treatment of the Palestinians, which reminds me of the treatment the Jews themselves received in Europe 60 years ago.
I believe this must end and that the President of Parliament should lodge a protest and condemn such acts.
Thank you very much, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n.
Your comments have, of course, been noted and will be examined by the relevant parliamentary committees.
Mr President, on the issue which Mr Nogueira has just mentioned, I would like to refer to an issue which affects this House even more directly.
As the House knows, a few days ago a special representative of the European Union - the institution to which this Parliament belongs - Mr Moratinos, was detained against his will for some minutes at the residence of President Arafat, due to the bombing of that residence by Israeli troops.
Mr President, I would ask you to communicate this Parliament's indignation to the Spanish Presidency of the Council at this blatant aggression against a diplomatic representative of the European Union in the fulfilment of his duties, while he was in Palestine with the President of the Palestinian Authority, something which the Israeli authorities had prior knowledge of, as the honourable Members and the President know.
Thank you.
You may be sure that your comments will be passed to the proper authorities.
Mr President, yesterday the Group of the Party of European Socialists requested the deletion of Chechnya from the subjects for topical and urgent debate on the basis that it is an urgent subject of major importance, to be dealt with when the time comes, which I hope it will.
Today, the political position of Parliament on a very serious, extremely important situation that cannot be resolved is being presented as a point of order.
Naturally, we are all sorry that Mr Moratinos was present when these events took place.
We are all aware of the situation in the Middle East, which deserves an in-depth discussion, not just a point of order and request to the President.
I therefore invite you, Mr President, to ask that a debate take place, if necessary, but not this type of attitude asking the presidency to do things that, under other circumstances, we do not want Parliament to do.
Mr President, having listened to the speeches by the two honourable Members on the crime being perpetrated in the Middle East against the Palestinian people, I totally agree.
My problem is that, at some point - and I would suggest immediately - we need to stop making declarations and verbal accusations and do something and the first thing we need to do - and do at once - is to cut all funding from the European Union to Israel and all supply lines, because there appears to be a fairly dense network of supply lines between Israel and the countries and arms industries of the European Union.
So an end to hypocrisy!
We must do something to put an end to this heinous crime.
As I am sure you understand, this is not the time for an in-depth debate on the problem in the Middle East.
Your comment has been noted and I thank you for it.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2003 budget procedure:
A5-0068/2002 by Mr FÃ€rm for Section III
and
A5-0064/2002 by Mr Stenmarck for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII (A) and VIII (B), and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the budget process looks a bit different this year than previously.
We are on the way towards an activity-based budget.
Of course, we hope that, in the long term, this will lead to simplification and increased clarity, although this year we will be working with the old and the new methods in parallel.
Another new feature is that all three institutions are producing political budget guidelines at roughly the same time.
The Commission now produces an annual policy statement, and the Council makes decisions on guidelines.
In my view, this should mean that we will obtain a better political dialogue on the priorities and that the Commission's preliminary draft budget can be based on deliberations by all three institutions, not just those of the Commission itself.
This should naturally lead to a better budget process and to simplification.
The greatest difference as far as the European Parliament is concerned is perhaps the increased emphasis now being placed on follow-up and implementation, for we cannot merely be content to pass decisions on a mass of figures in the budget which then just remain on paper.
As a Parliament, we must also make sure that our ambitions and priorities are being realised.
The wording of the guidelines which the committee is now submitting to the European Parliament is more precise in many cases than before.
This applies to statements on the importance of ensuring that the budget is followed, as well as to decisions of the European Parliament or budgetary authority.
It applies to the actual amounts involved, as well as to budgetary remarks, etc. However, on a number of occasions, the Committee on Budgets has had to point out that a number of remarks which the European Parliament made in various contexts did not, however, lead to the Commission's actually acting in accordance with the decisions made.
On a number of occasions, we have also pointed out the importance of the amounts in the budget actually taking effect.
Naturally, it is worrying when, year after year, the budget produces large surpluses which have to be paid back to the Member States because important work is not carried out.
This is particularly serious in terms of areas to which political priority is given, such as regional policy assistance under the Structural Funds or aid to prioritised recipients in other parts of the world.
We have already been warned that it will be proposed that the Member States receive early repayment of EUR 10 billion from the 2001 surplus.
This is a tenth of the entire budget.
This surplus arose primarily because the Structural Funds did not manage to implement their programmes.
In our opinion, this must lead to greatly increased pressure on both the Commission and the Member States to take the problem of implementation seriously.
In reality, this has to do with confidence in the EU as an institution.
This has led to our attempting to introduce a somewhat different budget process.
We are attempting to bring the committees on board in a quite different way than before, for example by means of hearings involving Commissioners and through each committee's checking its part of the budget and seeing how it is implemented.
This will ensure that the entire European Parliament is involved in the budget process more actively than before.
The budget debate will also be a little different.
During the July session we shall have a debate which will largely be to do with implementation but which will take place at the same time as the debate on the mandate for the conciliation negotiations on the Council's first reading.
In the Committee on Budgets we had a great many amendments, 129 to be precise.
Here in the plenary sitting, the number has been considerably reduced, and the reason for this is of course that we have been able to compromise on a consensus approach towards the most important priorities.
We are entirely agreed that the most important political priority is EU enlargement.
For us, this means, in more concrete terms, the preparations we must now make if it is to be possible for this historic task to be carried out.
Enlargement itself creates no problems for the 2003 budget, but we are still affected in various ways.
We must begin the debate on the long-term effects of enlargement, and the European Parliament wants to be involved in this debate.
The agreements now being made in negotiations with the Member States will affect the budget for a long time into the future.
This is therefore a very important concern for the European Parliament too.
We must also set in motion a debate on the principles of how we are to prepare for accession.
This will apply to pre-accession aid under heading 7 and to our own costs in terms of administrative expenditure for preparing for the interpretation, translation, buildings and premises required because of enlargement.
The urgent, and largest, problem is of course the administrative expenditure under heading 5.
If nothing radical is done, we run the risk of hitting the budget ceiling as early as 2003 as well as a major risk of considerably exceeding the ceiling in 2004.
We are therefore attempting to put pressure on the Secretaries-General of our institutions so that they really come up with practical proposals for co-operation and savings.
If this does not succeed, we will have a discussion on either painful reprioritisations or the injection of completely new funds.
I am convinced that no one in this Parliament wishes to jeopardise the enlargement timetable for reasons of this kind.
Changes such as increased co-operation and rationalisation are, moreover, completely in line with the ideas for which we ourselves press when it comes to reforming the institutions of the Union, reforming the Commission, etc.
Great emphasis will also be placed on the Union's role in terms of foreign policy and aid policy.
Where these are concerned, we are this year in danger of further exacerbating the problem which dominated the debate last year, that is to say the fact that, on top of our traditional priorities, we constantly heap new tasks such as those involving the Balkans, Afghanistan, the Global Health Fund and the common foreign and security policy.
In the end, it will become impossible to constantly squeeze in new tasks under the same budget ceilings, especially as the old tasks are often linked to practical undertakings involving recipients in other parts of the world.
Even though we have not adopted a position on the Commission's proposal for a new flexibility instrument, it is quite clear that we welcome debate on this instrument or, alternatively, debate on a more planned use of the emergency reserve.
I would also like to mention a couple of different areas where we are adopting a very aggressive approach.
Regarding heading 3 - internal expenditure - there is now the opportunity, in the wake of the Barcelona process, to make considerably more active use of funds for trans-European networks, for the development of small enterprises, etc. I believe this is vital.
We are also attempting to press for a situation in which the review of agricultural policy, the midterm review, really does lead to actual change.
To conclude, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck.
There is an unusually large number of Nordic rapporteurs this year, and the budget will also undergo its final reading during the Danish Presidency.
In that spirit, I would like to remind you of what the then Chairman of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, said in his last speech before retiring.
He said that the most important thing you can do with the EU budget is to make it simpler, more direct and clearer in the eyes of the people.
I hope we are able to take these words to heart.
Mr President, let me also begin by thanking my fellow rapporteur, Mr FÃ€rm, for his sound cooperation so far.
There are three priorities in the guidelines for the administrative budget on which we now have to adopt a position.
The first is enlargement.
That is the most important priority and the greatest challenge for the entire EU, and it is therefore also the most important issue for which the European Parliament and the other institutions have to prepare.
The second priority is institutional reforms, which will become vital in an enlarged EU which will soon comprise 25, rather than 15, Member States.
Thirdly, it is about completing enlargement and the institutional reforms within the financial framework laid down in the financial perspective in Berlin in 1999.
We must respect these limits and manage the EU's budget within them.
Because we have a deficit in the region of EUR 130 million to EUR 140 million so far, we need a strategy for managing this.
In the short term, it is entirely possible to deal with this.
The solution will involve cutbacks in all the institutions.
This is also the most important message I have the opportunity to convey at all my meetings and in all my contacts with the various institutions of the EU.
It gives them the chance to set their priorities in a way that respects the fact that they themselves know best what can be done in their own areas.
If they are unwilling to do this, we will have to set the priorities ourselves but the result may not be as good.
In the longer term, more systematic changes are needed in the budget in order to cope with a constantly increasing deficit.
We had an informal trialogue in Madrid just under a week ago.
There is no doubt that, at least in terms of putting it into words, there is a broad understanding of the size of the problem in both the Commission and the Council.
Despite this, the Commission is clearly prepared to look for the simplest possible solution, namely that of using the flexibility instrument to inject extra funds into heading 5.
I must emphasise that this is a solution with an extraordinarily large number of drawbacks.
For all of us who do not work within an anonymous Commission but instead have to meet our voters on a daily basis, it would in actual fact be impossible to look these voters in the eye and, at the same time, explain that the EU needs more money to employ more bureaucrats in Brussels.
That would just not be on.
With precisely this in mind, it is incredibly important that the European Parliament demonstrate firmness and consistency in its position and in encouraging all the institutions to contribute to budget reductions.
Let me say a few words about the most important priorities in the report.
When it comes to enlargement, a number of issues are particularly important.
The first is language and the right of every Member of this Parliament to be treated in the same way as all the others.
There are in fact only two options.
Either we must all speak the same language or each of us must be allowed to speak our own language.
If I, as a Swede, have the right to speak Swedish and a Portuguese Member has the right to speak Portuguese, then a Hungarian Member must be allowed to speak Hungarian and a Lithuanian to speak Lithuanian.
The Committee on Budgets has backed what the PodestÃ  Group calls controlled multilingualism.
At the same time, we urge the working party to revise its proposal and produce its conclusions in time before the budget for 2003 has to be adopted.
Enlargement will also entail the need for investment in buildings, offices and interpreting booths.
All of this is particularly difficult as we are unaware of what the scope of enlargement will be.
We will not be aware of this until the Copenhagen Summit in December.
If enlargement is to begin to be implemented with ten countries in January 2004, we have an incredible amount to do in the space of only 21 months.
In fact, we have even less time as the new Member States will be entitled to send observers immediately the agreements are signed.
This means we might only have just under a year.
A great deal remains to be done in this time.
Therefore, everything that has to be done must also be given the absolute highest priority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to keep to the timetable for enlargement - which we all do - 2003 will be essentially characterised by the need to make preparations for enlargement.
That has already been underlined in this House.
In the candidate countries, assuming that negotiations have been concluded, 2003 will see the referendums being held, and, in the Member States, the processes of ratifying the Accession Treaties will be in progress, the Convention will be presenting its recommendations on Europe's future in an enlarged EU and the European institutions, their personnel and structures, will be having to make very real preparations for the increased membership after 2004, from which date they will exercise their responsibilities on behalf of a good many more people and on behalf of more Member States.
All three of the reports before us on priorities for 2003 are therefore right to highlight this essential task.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, for these conclusive reports, which also lay very definite emphasis on this.
On 27 February, the Commission decided on its priorities and annual strategy for 2003.
In it, we agreed on three priorities: firstly, preparation for enlargement; secondly, measures to enhance stability and security in the European Union and also outside it; and thirdly, on the priority to be accorded to the promotion of sustainable economic development.
The President of the Commission has already had the opportunity to present this strategy to Parliament, and there will be a plenary debate on it in the next part-session, in order that we may also discuss together the consequences this will have on the programme of legislation.
We are focusing today on issues of budget planning and on the effects that the setting of priorities will have on them.
The maximum funding allocation for 2003 has been set by the Financial Plan at EUR 102 billion, precisely one third of which is laid down as being for structural assistance and for the principal support instruments that are at our disposal for the purpose of achieving the important objective of matching living conditions across regions, improving the employment situation, improved protection for the environment and the promotion of gender equality.
Most of the resources will, on the other hand, accrue to the sphere of agricultural policy, subject to the creation of the relevant legal basis.
We will of course be presenting the agricultural policy's mid-term balance sheet in 2002, which will be linked with further proposals for reform, although I believe it rather too optimistic to assume that these proposals for reform will take tangible form as soon as the 2003 Budget; Agriculture Ministers are simply not in the habit of deciding on agricultural reforms at that speed.
In the context of the priorities set for 2003, therefore, new initiatives focus primarily on the policy areas of internal and foreign affairs.
The Commission is proposing to make available an additional sum of approximately EUR 270 million in the coming year, that is, 2003, for these pressure points.
Let me give the following as examples of what is proposed in the area of internal affairs policy: Firstly, redoubled efforts towards an integrated common civil protection strategy, for 11 September opened the eyes of all of us to how important this is as a task for the Community.
Then new actions with additional resources in the area of the Refugee Fund and a programme from the area of sustainable development, and a programme for smart energy to continue previous support programmes in the energy sector with increased resources.
In the foreign policy field, as has indeed been our experience from the very beginning of this parliamentary term, greater demands will again be made on us.
We will have to continue our commitment in the Balkans, in order - among other things - not to put at risk the successes we have already achieved, and, as a European Union, we will be taking on new tasks.
To be precise, I refer here to the police operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
It is the Commission's view that the international Police Task Force, at least as far as the operational costs of the joint operation are concerned, should be at least partly funded from the Community budget.
That, again, is of course a new step.
Mr FÃ€rm has pointed out, though, that it represents a new measure, but the Commission takes the view that it should also be seen to be a joint one.
The Council conceded the highest priority in 2003 to the issue of how this operation should be financed, and I believe that all three institutions are agreed in principle, but we must of course also agree on the conditions, that is, on how the resources from the common foreign and security policy are to be provided.
What, though, can of course very well happen with further measures for 2003 in the common foreign and security policy area is that the resources in category 4, that is, in the foreign policy budget, will be insufficient to cover further measures for civil crisis management, and so it is my urgent appeal to the budgetary authority that they speedily examine the Commission proposal on the creation of a new financial instrument.
I think we should, in the coming months, as a matter of priority, discuss what ideas the budgetary authority have as regards further development of the budget line for the common foreign and security policy.
On foreign policy, I would further like to mention that we have promised Afghanistan that we will make aid available for the reconstruction of the country.
This year, in 2003, and in the years to come, the people who, for 20 years, have lived through war and suffered oppression by the Taliban, will be in urgent need of aid.
This will continue to be a priority for the next few years.
Still on foreign policy, I would like to mention that we - or so, at any rate, I hope - will, in 2003, be faced with a new task in respect of Cyprus.
Any political solution that we manage to bring about there will of course need to be backed up by financial resources.
Let me remind the House that the budget for assistance with preparations for enlargement includes only resources for the southern part of Cyprus and not for the northern part.
This, too, will confront us with a new challenge.
The Commission is also proposing, as overseas aid, to make a further contribution to the Global Health Fund.
It takes the view that its commitment to support the Barcelona process in the Mediterranean region should be reinforced, in particular by more offers of funding for the development of the private sector.
The Commission has therefore proposed to the Council the significant possibility of establishing a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, and has already made provision in the Budget for a capital investment of EUR 25 million.
To return to preparations for enlargement, these mean for the institutions of the European Community definite additional human resources and tangible administrative measures.
Taking just one of the tasks as an example, the Commission must, starting from the first day of enlargement, audit State aid in the candidate states.
We also, of course, want participation in the Structural Fund or in the Agricultural Fund to work virtually from day one, so that there is no excessive time lag.
This means in real terms that administrative reconstruction must start as early as in the run-up to enlargement.
The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of 500 non-permanent positions within itself.
Why temporary staff?
We would welcome the option of, as early as 2003, appointing staff from the candidate countries to serve in the Commission.
Of course, we have to bear in mind the constrained position in category 5, that is, the area of administrative expenditure.
On that, the Commission is in complete agreement with Mr Stenmarck's report, and we have therefore included in our proposal the suggestion that staff should be made available for the new political priorities by means of reassignment, which makes it absolutely necessary - on which point, too, we agree completely with Mr Stenmarck - that the report submitted by the Secretaries-General, which is on the table, should be checked exhaustively to see where savings might be possible.
The Commission has submitted the first such 'screening' and has nonetheless come to the conclusion that, in all probability, additional resources over and above category 5 will be required in 2003 in order to fund the measures in preparation for enlargement.
I see the proposal that the flexibility reserve be used for this purpose as being wholly concordant with the wording of the interinstitutional agreement, dealing as it does with a temporary situation, that of no resources having been set aside in the Financial Plan for the European institutions to prepare themselves for enlargement.
It is of course not acceptable to use the resources allocated to enlargement for that purpose in 2003.
The Financial Plan does not permit it.
I do think though that the peculiar situation in 2003 means that we should check closely whether the instrument of the flexibility reserve can be used in this way.
One last word on the flexibility reserve: use will be made of it in any case, as, when dealing with the 2002 Budget last year, we had agreed that the last tranche from the specific restructuring programme for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets would be made available in 2003.
I think we are all aware that, just as in recent years, the European Budget will face fresh demands made on it in 2003, but I note - and this is something I would like to underline - that the priorities set out in Parliament's reports coincide to a marked degree with those set by the Commission.
I am therefore working on the assumption that the budget procedure will again see us summoning up together the flexibility and willingness to compromise that we need in order to meet the challenges of 2003.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament's rapporteur, Mr FÃ€rm, for his extremely cooperative and helpful approach to the budget this year.
For the first time in my parliamentary career I can honestly say I am looking forward to working with the Committee on Budgets on this year's budget.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy fully supports the Commission's reforms, which have increased its effectiveness and efficiency of delivery in the field of foreign affairs.
We have some concerns, however, for the 2003 budget.
Firstly, as we take on more responsibilities and as the Council goes around the world promising support here there and everywhere, insufficient thought seems to be given to where we get the money from.
If we are to maintain the ceilings as they are, the only ways we can pay for increased responsibilities are either through the increasing use of flexibility instruments - and we have reservations about that - or quite simply through cuts in other lines.
How can we maintain long-term programmes of support for the poorest parts of the world if we are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul?
We must try to address that question, or at least get the Council to address it.
Secondly, we must have greater transparency in the budget, and that has to begin with this year's PDB.
Far too much time is spent playing hide-and-seek, trying to work out what the Commission is actually proposing and why it is proposing to do it.
It may be understandable to our budget junkies in the Committee on Budgets, but for us normal human beings most of it is incomprehensible.
We cannot have cooperation between Parliament and the Commission unless we have greater transparency.
Thirdly, we need to work harder still on implementation to make sure that we are spending the money and not just committing it, and that we are spending it in accordance with the priorities which are set out by Parliament during the budgetary procedure.
Fourthly, we must have greater clarity in financing the CFSP - particularly the difference between administrative and operational expenditure.
I would support the Commission's proposal on civilian crisis management and oppose the Council's clear intention of cutting Parliament and the Commission out of that.
Finally, we must take more effective action in the field of small arms and light weapons; and if that is to be achieved, I believe it has to be moved into the first pillar.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there will again be elections to Parliament in 2004.
European citizens, every one of them, will be wondering which piece of the cake they have got, and whether that cake had been fairly shared out.
I take the view, as a representative of the Group of the European People's Party, that the cake that is being shared out is a big one, for the bigger the cake, the more fairly it can be shared out.
When theorising about how the cake should be shared out, we should, then, always consider the way we support and promote those who bake it.
As a matter of course, most of Europe's bakers of cakes are small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce the cake by the sweat of their brows.
I believe that our most important future concern must be with those people who work in these enterprises, and, let me underline this, two thirds of workers are employed by these firms with fewer than 250 on the payroll.
What is of the utmost importance to us in the political world, they produce 80% of taxes.
I believe, then, that we must get started where we have the best chance of future success.
We have all set ourselves the goal of becoming, in eight years' time, the highest-performing and most competitive region in the world.
All I can say to that is that we urgently need to step on the gas if we are actually to achieve this objective, for our citizens' sake.
We have had a few crises in recent years, such as, for example, the support given to the former Yugoslavia, the BSE crisis, and Afghanistan.
Now a package arrives in this House that gives me a lot to think about; I mean the provisions of Basle II.
In essence, the provisions of Basle II are quite right.
We have to see to it that firms have sufficient equity and venture capital.
If these conditions are incapable of being fulfilled, regulations cannot be enforced.
If we want these provisions to be capable of being complied with - as we all do - then we need a Green Paper and a plan of action in good time, so that our small and medium-sized enterprises will again be able to pay their wages in 2005.
In the event of Basle II entering into force without our having either a Green Paper or an action plan, then, in 2005, when it enters into force, there will be mass lay-offs and mass bankruptcies.
We do not have much time left to us, and action is urgently needed.
This applies especially to firms in the countries that want to join the EU; mention equity capital there, and you find that most firms do not have any at all, and that there, the borrowing of capital from outside sources, along with bank credit, prevail to the exclusion of all else.
If a liquidity squeeze means that small and medium-sized banks are unable to make cash and its equivalent available, then big problems are coming our way.
That we still have matters outstanding as regards a secure future was shown to us by 11 September.
We must see to it that we press on with security of energy supply by means of the Synergy, Energy, and Altener programmes.
We must look to research to make resources available for the post-2003 era.
Training and continuing education will demand enormous effort of us with 'e-learning' and 'e-business'.
The Trans-European Networks, too, are waiting to be made reality.
We must also see to it that the European Union becomes more active in the WTO.
We must ensure that its Parliamentary Assembly takes on a monitoring role as soon as possible, and we need financial resources for those parliamentary delegates from the least developed countries, who at present cannot even afford to travel to its meetings.
We must engage in training and continuing education there, for these are people we must integrate.
We have to show them how they too can make the cake as large as it can be.
of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. (DA) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I too should like to thank Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck for their work and willingness to cooperate.
We are particularly delighted that Mr FÃ€rm has supported the committee's conclusions.
Those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are somewhat concerned to see the 2002 budget for our area down by 10% on that for 2001.
We believe that the decisions taken in Lisbon with a view to creating the world's most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010, together with what will happen in this sphere in Barcelona at the end of the week, show that this is a high-priority area, and this must be reflected in the budget for 2003.
We have noted that the Commission has this year attached importance to improving health and safety in the workplace, and we should like to see this too reflected in the budget for 2003.
With regard to enlargement, it is important for us also to create funds for developing the social dialogue, or cooperation between the two sides of industry, in the candidate countries.
This too is a high-priority area for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I should particularly like to say something about the agencies.
We have four agencies, whose work we follow closely in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we think it important to remember that the agencies are different and should be treated differently.
They have different needs in terms of budgets.
Enlargement will also be of significance to how they develop, and the agencies' tasks will change.
That is something which needs to be considered carefully when we look at the budget for 2003.
It is important that the agencies should be treated individually and not all lumped together.
Moreover, we shall call upon other committees to cooperate more closely on how we are to look at the budgets for the agencies.
Finally, it is our view that we should attach importance to how the individual budget items are used, and there are some areas in which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will monitor carefully whether the Commission is seeing that matters are implemented.
Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, from the point of view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the most important aspect of the budget is the codecision issue.
We need a decision by the Convention to the effect that agricultural policy is to be included in the full codecision procedure, so as to overcome the separation of compulsory and non-compulsory resources.
We must reach the point where we have full competence as regards the budget, including in agricultural matters.
When that has been achieved, we would like to be given the option of flexibility in the items in which the resources have not been used up.
Although that is already what we expect of the 2003 budget, we of course know that we have to reckon with resistance on fundamental decisions.
We take the view that the law of budgetary discipline has already cut back on the re-use of the compulsory resources or their use for other purposes, so that, if we increase outgoings, we have to have recourse to legislation, whilst the resources left over revert to the countries' Ministers of Finance.
I can imagine that they would like that, but that can hardly be what Parliament intended.
Secondly, it is always being said that a lot of money is being spent.
I favour a thrifty budget, even in the agricultural sphere, but we must again point out that our EUR 20 billion puts us under the 1.27% ceiling.
It is not advisable for a parliament to financially restrict itself in this way.
Politics always has to do with money - I mean that in a positive sense - and hence it would be sensible, and, from Parliament's point of view, also in the Commission's interests, not to overdo the austerity policy on these countries.
Thirdly, there is one point to which I would like to refer. You said, Mrs Schreyer, that preparations for enlargement need to be intensified; to date, EUR 30 million, which is hardly anything, has passed through the SAPARD programme framework.
Here there has been no preparation, and that is highly regrettable.
Let me again mention the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, however, taken up by the Committee on Budgets, and under which we are this year instigating an INPARD and a LEADER programme, as could have been done last year.
Our intention with this is to facilitate the induction of the candidate countries into this bottom-up programme, so that they will be able to draw on the resources they need from the previous programmes after they have acceded.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am taking up this position on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee - we may well have the lowest outgoings in terms of the EU's overall expenditure, but, on the other hand, we have, since 11 September, been working in an area that should have a very important role to play.
It is for this reason that I am very happy that both rapporteurs were very frank and that Mr FÃ€rm ended up by accepting our proposals and taking them on board.
This also shows that, after 11 September, we are dealing with concepts such as the combating and prevention of terrorism in such a way that we are taking this matter very seriously and are making our readiness clear to strengthen our own European authorities in this field such as Europol and Eurojust, and our will to be successful through them in this area.
My Committee saw as a second important point the theme of enlargement and the important issue of how we deal with borders in the first place.
This was not just through a desire to reinforce borders.
Of course, we do not want people to die at them - the Home Affairs Committee is very sensitive in matters concerning the combating of illegal immigration, and looks closely at what is actually achieved in this area and how effective is the form that the measures take.
On that, there are naturally certain things that we expect of 2003.
Yet, despite counter-terrorism and police efforts on the one hand and action taken by border guards on the other, there is one thing we do not want to forget under any circumstances, that, in a democracy consisting of 15 states, soon indeed to be 25, in the European Union, we also have an obligation to the people who travel to the European Union and live together with us.
This has led us to make a number of proposals relating to integration policy.
I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their willingness to accept these proposals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address just three issues, three key words, in our debate today on the guidelines for planning the 2003 Budget.
Issue No 1: enlargement, which will of course play a larger part in 2003's Budget procedure than it has done in previous years.
Looking closely, though, at how much pre-accession aid can drain away today - and we have heard a certain amount about this in agriculture - there are still things that must be done both by us and by the candidate countries.
It is not enough to enable them to get the hang of the programmes and the management structures as well, and then require only 3500 posts up to 2008, all of which is described as 'enlargement costs'.
I wish, though, also to appeal to my fellow Members of this House, and warn against using budgetary sleight-of-hand to take money intended for enlargement under category 8, shove it under category 7 and fund pre-accession aid from it.
That is not the Commission's doing, but rather an amendment proposed by Members of this House.
I would ask them, in that event, to be honest, go home and tell their own Ministers of Finance that we need the Financial Perspective to be revised, and that enlargement is underfunded.
Using such tricks to try to fund enlargement is something I can only warn against.
I wish to express my gratitude to the Commission for the position they have taken on this subject, which also expresses the view of the Group of the European People's Party.
Issue No 2: foreign policy.
I will keep this very brief, and tell you once and tell you clearly that I am slowly getting steamed up by the fact that a lunch for the European Union's Foreign Ministers costs us on average EUR 100 million.
That is just not practicable in the long term.
There is more to come.
We are now suddenly supposed to take over further activities, whereas the Member States said months ago that they would finance them themselves.
Let me mention only 'Amber Fox' as a key example.
Now they are suddenly supposed to be funded by the Community budget, which is utterly extraordinary.
Let the Council state which of the European Union's activities it can do without, and then funding can be provided on a serious basis.
Issue No 3: agricultural policy.
I think we do not need to use the Budget procedure to reinvent agricultural policy, but I do of course expect the Commission to submit its proposals on the Mid-Term Review in good time, so that we are in a position to incorporate whatever is of budgetary value into the framework of the 2003 Budget procedure.
On that point, let me observe that, as the budgetary authority, our participatory roles in the rural development programmes and in the area of traditional income aid are different and that the Commission should please bear that in mind so that it can go ahead on time.
Let me conclude by thanking Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck most warmly for their good cooperation.
I am sure that we will be able, by the end of the year, to present a sound Budget.
It should not be left to Parliament.
I hope that it is not left to the Council either.
Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, let me, of course, start by thanking both our rapporteurs for the work they have done, which is outstanding.
I would like to take today's debate on the guidelines as an opportunity to pause and do a sort of interim report.
We have completed the first half of our parliamentary term, and when we recall the tasks that faced us at its outset, what had to be funded by the Budget, what was made available to us and what we allocated to others, we see that the world has, of course, changed a great deal.
We have to deal with the problems of the world, which are not without their effects on us.
Europe has closed ranks, and we stand alongside the world.
We have taken on hitherto unmanageable tasks, and there are yet others for us to take on.
The field of foreign policy has been mentioned: extensive aid for reconstruction in the Balkans, aid for Afghanistan and for the people persecuted and harassed there, the fight against the global scourge of AIDS, the disarmament measures that we need to reduce not only the number of landmines but also chemical and biological weapons, and also, for example sending a police task force to the Balkans to ensure that peace can enter there.
The field of home affairs and judicial policy has, of course, see us agree, in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, to strengthen Europol and Eurojust and speed up their introduction; one of the Commission's new proposals is the expansion of civil protection in the event of emergencies.
In the Convention, we are discussing cross-border structures and future developments.
In the field of home affairs and judicial policy, we are discussing immigration and how to control it.
Enlargement has been described as a problem area, and in it we have a number of things to sort out both internally and externally; whilst Mr Ferber says that there are calls to rethink the relationship between Categories 7 and 8, we must also note that, as opposed to the original estimates, on the basis of which we assumed that the first six States could be added as early as 2002, this position has of course changed, and that is something we have to be allowed to discuss.
We, too, see of course that there is a lack of uptake, and, where too little is taken up, we must not heap up even more.
Budgeting is not about demanding more; it is about making proper use of the taxpayers' available resources.
There is a need, though, to take note of realities as well; everyone - including those Members of this House who even want to bake bigger cakes - has described the points we want to discuss together in order not to stage enlargement as a sort of cataclysm with the expectation of dramatic overnight change; rather, we have to prepare ourselves.
We have to prepare the countries, and part of that involves, of course, our making appropriate provision and discussing it.
The capacity for taking the right decisions presupposes that we talk about them.
It is, in my opinion, irresponsible to simply stand up and say, for whatever simplistic reasons, that 'we cannot even think about that'.
In the last few years, we have had to move reform of the Commission forward, but we also have internal problems that have to be discussed further.
The combating of unemployment must not be forgotten; it is one of our central tasks, and one in which the cooperation procedure has of course enabled us to make progress already.
We want to prevent social exclusion.
We want to promote technological development and, to that end, to make promotional funds available for 'e-learning' and the new technologies.
These great challenges, which have arisen in recent years, do not find us in a state of fear.
We face this challenge with a confidence which we want to make visible.
It is a good thing that this European Union of ours is working together, that we are increasingly trying to present a composite picture to the world we want to work with.
We are not sitting here or standing up and simply calling for more money.
We must look closely to find what options we have in this Budget.
This is, of course, something that any serious housekeeper must do, but we must also highlight the fact that we have other things to do; if they are to work, if, on the one hand, the poor are not to be victims, if we want to help others who endure persecution, then we have to give some thought to how we treat each other.
This is not a demand for more money on tap; it is about the purposeful use of money. We have to look carefully at where our money is being spent.
Is the best possible use being made of it? If not, then we must redirect it, and apart from that nothing should be declared to be unthinkable.
It is not more money that we want, but its purposeful use, and we seek the resources that are needed for Europe to continue to develop in the way constantly, and rightly, called for in all their resolutions by members of the European People's Party.
Mr President, I first wish to thank my Swedish colleagues, GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Per Stenmarck, for their excellent reports.
Strengthening the guidelines for budgetary procedure is the first step in the drafting of next year's budget.
My group stresses the importance of strict budgetary discipline.
This means that the budget should not include unnecessary appropriations and that economy should be a feature of financial management.
Proper budgeting leads to a decrease in payment arrears and promotes the implementation of budgeted programmes.
In this respect the figures in recent years have been disheartening.
In the year 2000, EUR 8.5 billion in appropriations were unused, and last year the amount was as much as EUR 12 billion.
The situation is therefore alarming.
In no way does this reflect rigorous financial management: it is symptomatic of poor administration.
The Commission is unable to implement those areas of policy that Parliament has held to be important and for which it has authorised appropriations.
As a result, areas of policy are implemented unsatisfactorily, while at the same time the arrears - the unpaid commitments - grow.
There is no such massive degree of underutilisation in the administration of any Member State's budget.
For that reason our group not only supports budgetary discipline but is also strongly in favour of the Commission's programme of reform.
This is lent additional weight by the recent so-called new disclosures in the Commission's administration.
The matter of personal accountability must be clarified and the power of decision-making delegated downwards in the organisation.
Accountability and result-oriented management are the key words here.
There are special requirements associated with enlargement.
The budget for 2003 may be the last one drafted for a Union of 15 Member States.
In this regard our group also believes that the appropriations connected with enlargement are absolutely crucial.
I wish the rapporteurs for the budget every success in their future work.
Mr President, our group can support the guidelines at this stage, but will make a judgement on the overall budget later in the year, depending on the outcome of various policy debates that are of key concern to us.
Firstly, the EU must be able to welcome new member states in the best possible circumstances, meaning that they must be able to fully benefit from the funds originally earmarked for them at Berlin by switching, if necessary, underspends from accession to pre-accession, depending on the pace of individual countries.
Secondly, another matter related to enlargement is the reform of the common agricultural policy.
Instead of getting into a heated debate about whether or not to give the new member states direct payments, would we not do better to concentrate our energies on reforming the common agricultural policy by encouraging integrated rural development schemes and sound environmental working practices suitable not only for the existing Member States but for our applicant countries too?
The third area of concern is the funds available in category 4 (external policy).
Every year we face new international crises and we want to help solve them.
We have a duty to help solve them, but if this has to be done year after year without new money, then of course we will run out of money and will have to make difficult decisions such as cutting off aid to one poor area to help another, or spreading our aid so thinly that it does not have the desired effect anywhere.
Surely this cannot be our aim.
Also in this respect, we would like to know to what extent countries which receive aid will be encouraged and enabled to tender for contracts in public works and services themselves, so as to give long-term benefits to their economies.
Mr President, the important area of focus in the draft budget for 2003 is enlargement.
Our group supports the view that savings from the budgeted enlargement expenditure for 2002 and 2003 can be used to finance enlargement in later years.
The rapporteurs think the important area of focus is the administrative reform of the Commission.
We are prepared to allow those Eurocrats who cannot be made fit for work through retraining to retire prematurely.
A sense of moderation will have to be observed when determining their pension benefits.
I would also like to draw your attention to how the Commission has managed to get round the staffing ceilings by employing officials whose salaries are paid by Member States.
There are 800 of them.
It is our group's opinion that the rapporteurs do not insist forcefully enough on the clearance of the backlog of commitments that have not been forwarded for payment - the so-called RAL.
From one year to the next, the gap between commitments and payments is allowed to grow.
That means the Commission may well disregard implementation of the areas of focus specified by Parliament.
Our group would like to see the Commission include the RAL question in the areas of focus in its preliminary draft and safeguard the implementation of programmes to a greater extent than is now the case, including the implementation of Structural Funds programmes.
Our group sees immense problems with the margins in Section 4 of the budget.
There are none.
That is why the Commission must propose action in next year's draft budget to ensure the implementation of political areas of focus under Section 4.
While a certain amendment calls for considerable financial support for Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, we should remember that all the former Soviet Republics, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, are their presidents' dictatorships, where there is no respect for human rights.
We also have to insist on democracy in those countries that are supposed to be our allies.
Our group also considers important the reconstruction of the Palestinian areas in the wake of the havoc wreaked by Israel.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, on their work thus far.
I feel that before us are two sound documents which identify precisely what the budgetary priorities should be for the coming financial year.
Five political priorities have been identified: enlargement and preparation for enlargement, external assistance, internal security, reform of the institutions and reform of the Commission.
I feel that we can all agree on these points, particularly in view of the imperative need to provide the Union with adequate financial instruments for it to be able to see its priorities through.
In fact, to be honest, the growing battle against the Council and the Commission itself is not over which actions we should concentrate more on, namely combating terrorism and the reform of the institutions - which are indisputable priorities; the problem arises when Parliament and the Council have different views on how these actions should be financed, when the Council refuses even to contemplate revising the financial perspective, when we continue to treat the flexibility instrument as an instrument whose use can be planned from year to year.
Clearly, there is something wrong!
In my opinion, this is the principal battle that Parliament will have to fight in the coming months, a battle in which we will have to succeed in presenting a united, fighting front.
Then at horizontal level - to use a technical term - three particular needs have been identified: the need for further budgetary monitoring at technical and political level, for example by means of budgetary hearings; the need for the Commission to improve its spending capacity and, consequently, implementation considerably, in an attempt to prevent the creation of new RALs at source; lastly - what the rapporteur wanted to point out to the Commission and the Council - the fact that they are bound to consult the European Parliament on all initiatives with significant budgetary impact, particularly in the context of non-compulsory expenditure.
On all three matters, I feel that the rapporteurs should be able to count on the support of us all.
Mr President, I note with satisfaction that enlargement is now being given top priority.
This is not a day too soon.
After all, if the negotiations run as the European Commission has envisaged, 10 countries will be joining the European Union from 2004 onwards.
The report by Mr Stenmarck, in particular, excels in terms of its clarity and effectiveness, and can count on our support.
Mr FÃ€rm, too, is right to accord enlargement the prominence that it deserves.
With regard to his report, I should like to comment on the recommendations pertaining to category 4.
This section conveys an excessive tendency towards political influence at global level, under the pretext of safeguarding the Union's credibility in the world.
Is the aid that is now being proposed for Afghanistan more than a fig-leaf for the half-hearted support to the United States, which, together with Great Britain, pulled the chestnuts out of the fire?
This is a politically and financially risky operation, for with economic assistance, which Mr FÃ€rm advocates, comes political support to the Middle East.
The Union appears particularly sympathetic towards the Palestinians and not towards the Israeli citizens.
For a start, the foul methods which Palestinian terrorists use to cause death and destruction are worrying.
The counter attacks by the Sharon administration, however painful they are, are a response to this.
Furthermore, there is reason for great concern with regard to the Commission's policy.
How can the Commission make annual contributions to the Palestinian Authority to the tune of EUR 180 million, while corruption is at its highest?
By using racist and anti-Semitic language, the Palestinian schools teach hatred rather than reconciliation.
How long can the Commission wash its hands of this?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I in turn congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, on their work.
I also think that these are two good documents that will enable the budgetary procedure to run smoothly and that constitute a good working plan for Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
In particular, I would like to say a few words about the Stenmarck report, first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, and also to express my pleasure in seeing my idea accepted, that of increasing our use of the Internet and making this institution truly transparent by eventually broadcasting our debates, and even debates in our committees, in full on the Internet.
The Secretary-General, who is present today, is familiar with this document.
I think this is a step forward that we must follow through.
Parliament is an institution which, let us say, is a symbol.
It runs the risk of not being very visible, as, for security reasons, a subject we are very familiar with, access to our work itself is somewhat restricted, although we maintain the principle of public meetings.
I therefore think it is important to use the Internet.
However, let us say that I am a little surprised to see an amendment by the PPE-DE, I think, which is the new version of paragraph 15 stating that the administration of Parliament would be held in greater esteem if it were efficient, coherent and politically balanced.
I find the concept of political balance very interesting as this basically means that employees must be chosen so as to maintain a balance between the groups.
However, to my knowledge, for the past 20 years or so, the only transfers that have taken place have been between the two main groups and, as a result of this, at least one third of the Members of Parliament did not benefit from this.
I think that the administration is fine as it is and that it does not need to be rebalanced by means of a system that, in Italy, we call the 'Cencelli' system, which, moreover, worked very well at the time of the last nominations.
Ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE, I think that that is sufficient and that we are balanced enough as we are.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believes that Parliament, as the budgetary authority, must be regularly informed about the execution underway for structural actions so that the alarm can be raised in terms of the application of the sunset clause.
With regard to the application of the additionality principle, which is an extremely important issue, the Commission must establish the means for its verification and control on the ground.
Halfway through the period of application of the funds, the Commission should inform Parliament about the evaluation of its compliance on the basis of objective criteria.
Furthermore, we ask the Commission, by means of appropriate solutions, to support the idea that the structural allocation should be considered a spending objective.
In relation to the budget line for the trans-European transport network we note that the level of budgetary implementation over recent years is satisfactory and we recommend giving priority to projects with a clear European added value, stressing the importance of the funding of projects which provide a rebalance between modes of transport.
We in the European Parliament also urge the Member States to use the Structural Funds while paying more attention to transport infrastructures, in particular intermodal transport and less polluting forms of transport.
Naturally, in the case of land transport, they must pay particular attention to the railways, from the point of view of respect for the environment.
Commissioner, at this decisive point for the European Union, prior to enlargement, the Member States, with the support of the Commission, will have to achieve greater efficiency in the application of the Structural Funds with the cooperation of the regions and local groups they are destined for.
Only in this way will we come closer to the economic and social cohesion which, together with political union, is the great objective of the European institutions and citizens.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr FÃ€rm, who is a true friend of development.
I look forward to working closely with him during the course of this year.
In my contribution I should like to refer to paragraph 26 of the report, which states explicitly to the Commission, on behalf of this Parliament, that we are not satisfied that development aid is sufficiently focused on poverty eradication and that we need to build on the agreed benchmark system.
Let me explain that for everyone's benefit.
Two years ago Parliament voted a series of input targets on development aid to ensure that the large amount of spending that takes place through the regional budget lines was actually held to account and to insist that more be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education policies.
The extent to which the Commission took action in this regard is questionable, particularly as Mrs Schreyer herself issued a so-called reservation, something that this Parliament does not recognise.
Last year, therefore, when we undertook the same discussions, we had further and more intensive deliberations with both external relations Commissioners, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, and agreed that a minimum of 35% of EU external assistance would be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education.
I say to the Commissioner this morning and to this Parliament that we are relying on this being implemented this year within the budget and we will, as we say in this resolution, be looking to build on it next year.
I would also like to say in relation to paragraph 33 that it is a matter not just of development aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, but also of the funds to Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean and other regions.
All of it should be poverty-focused.
The Commission has brought forward a development policy statement and it is time, through the budget, that it matched its words with deeds.
Mr President, I would like to join those of my colleagues who have already thanked our two rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, for their very helpful contributions to our debates this morning.
On the Commission, firstly, I would like to see us having an ongoing monitoring of the budget to follow up the work of our colleague Mr Costa Neves in last year's budget.
I think this is particularly relevant as we have now changed the way in which the work programme of the Commission is formulated so as to have more input from our specialised committees.
I fully support that particular point.
Secondly, I would like to join with what our colleagues and in particular Mr Titley have said so far about foreign affairs expenditure.
I guess it is the big spenders from the Foreign Affairs Committee who are seeing all these commitments being made and we in the Budgets Committee who are querying where the money is coming from.
It seems to me that we need a priority-setting, forward-thinking agenda, which is why we are supporting the idea of a study, so that we in the Budgets Committee should have an idea where the money is coming from.
Lastly, we would like to know if the reform of the institutions has continued.
I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect a final decision on the early retirement scheme.
Insofar as the Parliament budget is concerned, we support those colleagues who have criticised the Administration for trying to suppress the EP-rom study.
We need a proper resource management discussion in this Parliament, and, particularly, we would like to see a coherent, effective and politically balanced Administration.
The reason for that comment, Mr Dell'Alba, was precisely because there had been parachutages.
There is an imbalance in the Administration and I would like to be sure that the Administration is seen from the outside as being effective and politically balanced.
Secondly, insofar as the political groups are concerned, to ensure effective control of the Administration, we would like to see them strengthened.
Lastly, in terms of enlargement, we would like to be sure that in interpretation we have controlled multilingualism; that in translation, we are looking at the aspects of teleworking; and, above all, in the buildings, that we do not take on any commitments to construct new buildings until we know they are absolutely essential.
Mr President, I add my congratulations to the rapporteurs on the work that has been done but have one criticism to make on the guidelines in general, which is not necessarily the fault of the rapporteurs, but of the committee and the other committees.
Guidelines should be just that and they should be concise.
They should not form a volume on the scale of Great Expectations, which is what they invariably turn out to be.
There are 41 paragraphs in Mr FÃ€rm's report, 34 paragraphs in Mr Stenmarck's report and another 38 amendments to vote on later on.
That is my gripe.
I would like to make a couple of points on each report. The first is on the FÃ€rm report.
The problems highlighted concern categories 4 and 5 and I would like to bring to Members' and Parliament's attention the fact that these issues were raised with the Spanish presidency at the trialogue meeting to try and find some sort of solution.
On category 4 the Commission has made proposals for a new flexibility instrument for humanitarian aid.
I said then, and I say again now, that as far as the Council is concerned hell will freeze over before it agrees to a new flexibility instrument.
What we did propose - and what may be negotiated with the Council - was to use existing humanitarian aid reserves and to find wording, without changing the legislation, to make sure we can use them for the problems we find ourselves with in category 4.
Regarding category 5: how do we fit everything into the existing ceilings?
With great difficulty, unless we make some radical changes.
The one thing we have asked the Council to do is to try and find an agreement on these two items during the July conciliation procedure.
Rather than drag them out until the conciliation procedure in November or our second reading in December, it would be beneficial to everyone if we could resolve those two issues, in principle, in July.
I now turn to Mr Stenmarck's report.
One part relates to category 5, where the Committee on Budgets has created a working group to look at administration expenditure in all the institutions. The reason for doing this was to get some political commitment from the Council to do exactly the same thing or to do it with us.
That has not yet been forthcoming, but we live in hope.
For those Members who have seen the comments in our working documents, do not be too fearful of them.
We are trying to look at things that people would not normally touch, but to at least stimulate some debate.
Finally, the Stenmarck report touches on what Mr Elles has just mentioned, that is the reference in paragraph 15 to a politically balanced Administration in Parliament.
Sometimes we vote on things which on reflection we regret.
To have a comment asking for our Administration to be politically balanced would not give the right signals to the outside world.
The term 'politically neutral' would be far more acceptable.
I am one of those people who think that civil servants should be politically neutral. They should not wear political colours.
I also believe that people in the civil service should win promotion because of their ability, not because of their political allegiance.
A split vote has been asked for on that matter and I would ask all groups to consider carefully how they will vote.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
I wish them every success.
I concur with the Commission in terms of the priorities.
I share the views of others and particularly those of Mr Wynn, who said a moment ago that categories 4 and 5 will cause the greatest difficulties.
As far as I am concerned, category 4 should not contain any holy cows.
It must be possible to use money that has been budgeted, and we should not end up in a situation whereby we receive various claims in the course of the year on unused funding that was budgeted for a specific purpose for which it may not be used.
I would therefore urge the Commission to assess the needs very carefully.
The same applies to category 5.
From the most recent trialogue meeting, I understand that there is a shortage of only 48 million.
Given the total, this is a very small amount.
I have seen a draft letter in this respect.
The Commission should check with all institutions whether it is still possible to find an amount of around 48 million that can be saved elsewhere.
If this is the case, we would remain within the financial perspectives and the flexibility instrument would not be needed for the time being, which means that it can be used in other areas.
Mr President, it goes without saying that I can support the guidelines in general terms, but I would wish to observe that it is, in my view, to be welcomed that the EU is preparing well for the planned enlargement.
We must not, though, overlook the fact that the costs of this should not mushroom, as explosive growth in cost would jeopardise Europe's stability and that of the euro.
This would happen, for example, if enlargement were to increase the burden on the Member States' budgets still further.
Support should also, of course, be given to agricultural reforms redirecting resources from the market promotion to rural development.
A particular concern of mine continues to be the reinforcement of small and medium-sized businesses, and so I hope that Amendment No 5, which deals with this, will be adopted by a large majority, so as to prevent the implementation of Basle II having adverse effects on SMEs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my group would like to congratulate both rapporteurs and vote in favour of their reports.
As the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, has said, our group also wants very specific budgetary guidelines and not a shopping list.
The guidelines are a political message which we send to the Commission and the Council regarding the form we want the budget to take; the more specific the message is, the more chance there is of it being understood.
For next year, the situation of categories 3, 4 and 5 is very worrying; we have already mentioned it: we are very close to the upper limit and in category 5 we are really above it.
My group still defends the Berlin financial perspectives, but we accept the strictness of the figures, especially those referring to enlargement.
Therefore, the Costa Neves report on the 2002 budget proposed real alternatives, in particular an improvement in the quality of budgetary execution both in the Commission and in the Member States, and we want to see results this year.
Furthermore, we must stress that there is a lack of a genuine spirit of interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary field.
The budgetary procedure should not be a game in which some institutions seek to gain power at the expense of others.
We will not achieve anything that way.
The financial Regulation or the response to Parliament's demand that the legislative and budgetary procedures be updated are two clear examples of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation is still unsatisfactory.
We expect a more positive response from the Commission and, in particular, the Council, in those two areas which are so important to our group and to the whole of Parliament.
I would like to end by mentioning an example of the opposite: the good example of interinstitutional cooperation provided by the funding of the Convention's budget, on which the three institutions have come to an agreement in order to move ahead without conflict.
Mr President, I suppose that the total absence of the Council must be a mark of respect so that we feel more comfortable during our own debates.
Mr President, I will focus on the aspects relating to the financial perspectives.
The 2002 budget has hardly begun to be implemented and we are already preparing for the launch of the 2003 budget and we can see that many of the problems of the last three financial years are reappearing, perhaps even in a more serious form.
The financial perspectives are even less sufficient for the requirements.
An exponential increase in activities is expected within a financial framework which has seen hardly any arithmetical growth.
Ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, the great innovation of the 2003 procedure is that heading 5 - administrative expenses - is also bursting at the seams.
In 1999, when we negotiated the current interinstitutional agreement, we managed to modify the figures in heading 5, but with perspectives which, as a result of shortsightedness, are now insufficient.
The general forecasts, including those of the Council, exceed the ceiling of the financial perspectives by EUR 125 million, with the contribution of a growth of 9% for the budget of the Council, which will now ask for cuts, while criticising the bad execution of some policies.
I would like to avoid cheap demagoguery, amongst other things, because there are no vast numbers of officials in Brussels, where the number of bureaucrats is less than those in the municipal authorities of Berlin, Stockholm or Madrid.
Heading 4 - external policy - is still inevitably doomed to failure.
Every year we have forced the flexibility instrument in order to implement external policy.
Now we are attaching increasing importance to the fight against poverty, which is a great thing, but which is essentially, in the current context, a reflection of the bad conscience of the wealthy Europeans, but we are not implementing external policy.
And that is an issue of enormous concern to me.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, heading 7 poses a serious problem which is very easy to understand.
Heading 7 - pre-accession - since 2002 only had to assist the five countries which were not then Members.
And now, Mr President, we have ten candidate countries which are sharing the money intended for five, without taking account of the fact that Malta and Cyprus, on a whim of the Council, come within heading 4.
All of this should be reviewed, Mr President.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the opportunity to speak on Section III of the 2003 budget, having monitored the report in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on behalf of my group, that of the European People's Party.
I therefore want primarily to set out the concerns behind the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's amendments to this report by Mr FÃ€rm, whom I will take this opportunity of warmly thanking for his work.
Today we are not discussing the 2003 budget, but the budget guidelines which express our fundamental thinking, and I am here to present that of my group in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
For a start, we want, in the first instance, resources from Chapters B1-1 to B1-4 to be capable of being carried over individually to the following year.
In the long term, though, we also want compulsory and non-compulsory resources to be able to be carried over, something that presupposes Parliament's right of codecision in agricultural matters.
Secondly, we have a further demand with regard to the increase in the flexibility reserves with a view to potential crises and emergencies.
Thirdly, even though the majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted differently on this point, we are opposed to the introduction of the INPARD programme, which will lead only to a further fragmentation of the resources, demand for which on the part of the candidates for accession has been slack.
A supplementary programme of this sort will, moreover, bring only additional bureaucracy in its train.
Fourthly, and - for us - most importantly, the 2003 Budget is not to be used to prejudge the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.
In this report, we do not want agricultural reform right now.
What we need is a further development of European agricultural policy.
The resolutions on Agenda 2000 are for us the binding foundation.
The agricultural budget must not become a quarry for every kind of desirable commodity, but must set forth a reliable agricultural policy option.
Mr President, 2003 will be a key year in terms of preparation for enlargement.
Therefore, it is disappointing that the report on the other institutions does not really grasp this challenge and, I believe, has missed an opportunity to build on the reform agenda that Parliament had embarked upon in the last few years.
I have three main issues I wish to touch briefly on.
Firstly, I am concerned about the lack of perspective and the narrowness of the focus.
There is far too much concentration on Parliament, and the other institutions do not appear to merit much comment.
I understand that the rapporteur did not have an opportunity to visit Luxembourg before the vote in the Committee on Budgets; that might explain the lack of emphasis.
I hope this is not seen as a negative message by them.
Secondly, it is imperative that we iron out some of the contradictions and inconsistencies in the report.
With reference to staffing, the report calls for a politically balanced Administration.
This is a ludicrous statement and I completely disagree with what Mr Elles said earlier.
My understanding of the Executive of this and of many other Parliaments across the world is that the Administration is generally neutral.
I have grave concerns about what has been suggested and the implication that the Administration is not neutral or that it should not be, and I shudder to think of the consequences of this.
Are we really going to ask the staff to tick a political affiliation box before they are appointed to a new job?
Even more fundamentally, this runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis that the Committee on Budgets has put in this report, on the staff appointment or promotion always being based on ability and merit.
That is the principle I wholeheartedly support.
Therefore, I would urge the rapporteur to distance himself from such negative statements.
These sentiments, if carried, will be to the detriment of the standing of Parliament.
Thirdly, with respect to the freelancing of translation and interpreters, I have no problems with improving efficiency and exploring ways to achieve this, but the statement we have here is an ideological standpoint with no evidence to support the assertion that freelance translation will be more cost-effective and of the quality required to meet Members' needs.
This also runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis in the report on developing the PodestÃ  report further with regard to the linguistic regime for enlargement.
Speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, we are interested in working in cooperation with the rapporteur at the next stage when we get to estimates, to strengthen the report and to achieve consensus in this key budget area.
However, cooperation is only achievable if it is a two-way process.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate rapporteur FÃ€rm on his initial ideas.
However, as the PPE-DE's shadow rapporteur for fisheries, I do regret that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has not decided to issue a report on the fisheries budget at this stage.
I should still like to highlight a few salient points which will prove important in future discussions.
The year 2002 was marked by the failure of the fisheries agreements with Morocco.
As a result, less than EUR 200 million were set aside for the regions in Spain and Portugal.
On that basis, it was decided to take 243 vessels out of circulation.
For the 2003 budget, it is important to find out whether this is actually being done, whether this is being monitored and how the Commission reports to Parliament on that score.
Why?
Because the 2003 fisheries budget will be based on this year's Green Paper and because the discussion about future fisheries policy will be concluded this year.
It is very likely that the Green Paper will be a painful document, considering the situation of cod fishing in Scotland and the far-reaching implications of that.
Some form of restructuring will be needed there.
It is also important to find out how the programme in Spain and Portugal will be implemented in 2003.
As a second point we also have, when we consider biodiversity, the problems in aquaculture.
Here too, it will be necessary to examine the budget very closely and to assess to what extent it can be used for this purpose.
This is also in anticipation of the discussion on the Green Paper and the implementation of existing programmes.
On that basis, it is important for the Commission to take elements of this kind into consideration, to link the 2003 budget to the Green Paper and particularly to make political choices in that area, also with regard to the budget.
This will be the PPE-DE's main issue and line of thought.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their hard work.
I would particularly like to congratulate Mr FÃ€rm on the part of the report which concerns internal policies, which includes a clear, explicit reference to policies for the elderly, who represent an increasingly significant proportion of our society.
The report rightly focuses on both social integration and the importance of ensuring dynamic economic growth.
However, I would like to draw your attention to and focus on a different matter.
I refer to Argentina, a country which does not currently appear to be following the path of economic growth that we are but which merits a special effort on our part.
Argentina's current situation raises disturbing questions regarding the future of the country, a land of immigration which, in the past, has absorbed thousands upon thousands of citizens from all over Europe.
I feel that, not least in order to prevent the crisis spreading to the neighbouring countries, the European Union needs to give a specific sign of its commitment.
I have tabled an amendment to that effect together with Mr Naranjo Escobar, which I hope the House will adopt.
With regard to the Stenmarck report, I would like to thank its author for incorporating so accurately the sense of controlled multilingualism, that is the need to balance the requirement that all the Members should be able to express themselves in their own language with indisputable budgetary requirements.
Lastly, one more point: there is a phrase which should perhaps be expressed differently.
I refer to that part which states that the administration must be 'politically balanced'.
In my opinion, the expression 'politically neutral' would certainly have been much more acceptable.
Mr President, Commissioner, in view of the initial positions of the Council and the Commission, this budgetary procedure deals with the challenge of being capable of contributing to the historic task of enlargement and funding the reform of the working methods of our institutions.
The reports by Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck reflect Parliament's concerns and priorities in relation to these issues and I therefore join in congratulating them on their excellent work.
The budgetary guidelines must be based on elements which are of interest to the citizens: the objective of full employment and the Union's solidarity policies.
And, before mentioning other aspects, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her expressed commitment for 2003 to fund the last stage of the structuring programme for the fishing fleets.
The budget for 2003 faces difficulties similar to those of recent years and rather more serious in the field of administrative expenditure.
Furthermore, the Union's commitments in external aid and the continuous demands of the security and defence policy must receive a budgetary response compatible with the rights of Parliament and the financial framework in force.
In this respect, we must carefully analyse the Commission's proposal on the creation of a new budgetary mechanism to confront the implications of the crisis.
In the field of management we may come across difficulties in payments, despite the fact that year after year we have a surplus.
It is therefore necessary to have detailed knowledge of the final amount resulting from the non-execution of the spending commitments and, likewise, to know the evaluations necessary in the medium term of the multiannual commitments of policies funded by means of heading 3.
This could provide us with a margin for flexibility in order to more efficiently adapt political priorities to the available resources.
Finally, I would point out that the citizens have offered an historic example of confidence by accepting the euro without hesitation and they have shown us the way forward.
The Union's budget must reflect this confidence and contribute to strengthening the policies of the States aimed at full employment, solidarity and economic growth.
Mr President, I would just like to go over again a number of remarks made in the very interesting discussion on the priorities for the budget year 2003.
First, the issue of the low take-up of resources in the last two years of the structural policy. Mr Puerta had called for the Commission to be constantly giving information about the use to which Structural Fund resources are put.
Let me again point out that the Commission supplies information on this to the Committee on Budgets and to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis.
The Structural Fund stipulates that the Member States must be reimbursed in respect of the resources provided by them; if the implementation of the Structural Fund in the Member States is held up, we cannot of course carry out the refund.
It is with regret that we note here that the new Structural Fund programmes have taken longer to implement than the Financial Perspective had originally envisaged.
I see the consequence of that as being that the next Financial Perspective will require the Council's and Parliament's decisions to be produced earlier in order to guarantee better implementation.
As regards the issue of bottlenecks in individual categories, I would just like to point out that the European budget for 2002 faces us with a situation which is out of the ordinary and will assuredly not continue in the coming years.
The fact is that this year we are far, far below what financial planning estimated, to the tune of EUR 4.6 billion below it!
None of the Member States comes near matching us on budgetary discipline of that sort.
Next year, then, we will need more resources for the Structural Fund, as the Member States are demanding that all the programmes should run for longer, something which should actually have been concluded a long time ago, and hence the situation will look rather different.
It is, despite that, possible to state already that the Agricultural Policy will probably not require all the resources estimated.
This means that economies are to be reckoned with.
Budget technique does not, unfortunately, make it possible to use savings in any one sector to fund new foreign policy requirements or the preparation of the institutions for enlargement.
Such a redirection is not possible, and the only means available to us is the flexibility instrument.
With reference to enlargement, I would once again like to clarify that what financial planning provided for the financing of new Member States in 2003 was provided exclusively for that purpose.
We cannot redirect that, and also reject the option of doing so, but we do have the flexibility instrument.
Let me again point out that, as soon as enlargement is completed, new resources will be allocated to administration.
It is only for the preparations that they have not been set aside.
If enlargement is to be successfully handled, though, preparations for it will be of fundamental importance, and they must be made in 2003 by all the institutions - Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, and by the Commission as well.
We are not talking here about excessive sums of money, but in terms of amounts that would still leave room in the flexibility reserve for other measures.
We should subject this instrument to serious testing in this respect.
It is the citizens of the new Member States, above all, who are entitled to European institutions that are prepared and ready to make a success of enlargement.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
A5-0077/2002 by Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 96/92/EC and 98/30/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas (COM(2001) 125 - C5-0184/2001 - 2001/0077(COD));
A5-0074/2002 by Mr Mombaur on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (COM(2001) 125 - C5-0185/2001 - 2001/0078(COD)).
Mr President, I assume that the Commissioner with responsibility for these matters is in the building.
Should we not perhaps wait half a minute until Mrs de Palacio is here to listen to us?
Mr Turmes, as you yourself can see, she is not here at the moment, and so I would like to ask Commissioner Schreyer to carry on representing the Commission here until Mrs de Palacio arrives.
We cannot, though, have a break, as that would disrupt the timetable.
Mr President, your reminder a moment ago to us to keep strictly to our speaking time leads me to make my fundamental observation and ask all of you in the Bureau to give consideration to how Parliament works.
The law we are drafting will completely overhaul the market in energy, which is one of the key markets in Europe, one that is worth billions, and we allow each rapporteur to speak for just five minutes - five minutes in which we really cannot make any sensible points.
That, then, we even have to divide up again between the two rapporteurs, because, strictly speaking, we have only one directive, but its two dossiers mean that there are two rapporteurs.
The Commissioner, who is just entering the Chamber, will then have the opportunity to say something, provided it is something amusing!
There is no doubt about it, I do not begrudge her that, but our having to limit ourselves in political debate in such a way strikes me as positively catastrophic.
I have just said that we are going to change the structures of the market.
What we actually have in the European Union is not an internal market; rather, we have 15 submarkets which, in themselves, are more or less open, but which vary widely as to their degree of openness.
That is still much more the case in the market for gas than in the market for electricity.
If, though, we want to exploit the efficiency gains of an internal market, then what we need is not the addition of 15 submarkets, but an integrated, common, internal market.
Efficiency gains to enable business - especially small and medium-sized enterprises - to improve its competitiveness, efficiency gains for consumers in terms of favourable prices, and efficiency gains for the environment, gained through the careful use of resources.
The open market that we want is not a matter of 'laissez-faire' or of everyone doing as they please.
We need rules for all the participants in this integrated market, rules that they can make sense of, rules that they can apply in a similar manner.
We need, then, the access of all market participants to the networks and other system installations to be utterly transparent and free of discrimination, as otherwise distortions of competition will come into being.
We therefore need a unitary regulatory framework, such as we do not as yet possess, the consequence of that being that we have a divided market and a system that in practice works virtually nowhere, with the possible exception of in one Member State in an island situation; it is not yet working anywhere else.
We need a regulatory framework that sets objectives, lays down binding standards, and creates machinery and applicability across the board.
Our problem is now that we have, of course, 15 different Member States, and the structures of these 15 Member States differ widely.
The overall conditions of a country with 700 or more network operators are quite different from those of a Member State with only one network.
What matters, though, is that the regulatory framework should have binding effect, with its application being monitored and with sanctions being imposed in the event of non-compliance.
That is what is at stake, and, that being so, we must correct some of what the Commission originally proposed in its amending directive in order, on the one hand, that the objectives of the different systems in the Member States should be standardised, and, on the other, that their home-grown structures should remain compatible to some small degree.
How the institutions and authorities in a Member State then guarantee that this happens is a matter for the Member State itself.
All that is needed is for it to be clear and reliable for all participants in the market.
So much for what we, as legislators, can actually regulate.
I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something.
It so happens that we currently have different conditions applying to electricity and gas respectively.
On the whole, we produce electricity ourselves in the internal market.
For gas, we are increasingly dependent on imports from third countries.
I believe that, from the competition and competitiveness angle, we will have the important task of introducing competition among producers.
I know this is a problematic issue, as the suppliers are generally from outside the EU, but this would be a task on which, as a whole, we would have to work together, as, without supply-side competition of this kind, we will never have more than restricted competition in the European market.
Mr Rapkay, I share your unease about how much time we have to spend on such an important matter.
I might take the liberty of pointing out, however, that it is the Conference of Presidents which draws up the agenda and not the Bureau.
In my experience the great and the good spend much more time on so-called political matters than they do on things which have to do with real life.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to address cross-border trade in electricity.
As the committee's rapporteur, may I say that the committee supports the Commission's proposal for a regulation.
Cross-border trading must finally get underway so that producers can supply other Member States, enabling competition to be introduced between existing suppliers across the EU.
There are five preconditions for this.
Firstly, the networks which operate the transit flows need to have their costs reimbursed from a fund.
Secondly, it will only work if the same conditions apply throughout Europe, that is if there is regulation.
Thirdly, both producers and consumers have to pay into the fund.
Fourthly, these producer payments need to be standardised in the Member States to avoid any party being at a competitive advantage.
Fifthly, there must be no internal duties, so no payments by so-called importers and exporters - which are in any case an odd concept in an internal market - and there must be no distance-related tariffs.
What counts here is physics and not the law.
I should like to make three concluding comments on this issue.
The place where the electricity is generated is significant.
This depends on many factors.
The committee will no doubt be flexible, even if additional so-called price signals, which meet the criteria that I have mentioned, are developed and applied.
In Florence, the regulators, the networks and the Commission are of course reflecting on this.
The committee is not proposing to change the competences in the comitology procedure or in the fora.
Since this is codecision, however, we propose that the situation be reviewed after four years to ascertain whether the procedure advocated here meets the requirements of codecision.
After all, the regulators in the Member States and the experts, for example the network operators, should be involved in a regulatory process.
The regulation should not come into force before the directives which also legislate on changes in the electricity and gas markets.
This brings me to my second subject. Here I should like to make a few comments not in my capacity as rapporteur but as a member of the committee, and specifically, Madam Vice-President, for you to take with you to Barcelona.
Firstly, the Member of the Council which still only wants partial market opening - and we know exactly which one this is - is in contravention of the Treaties.
I should like to make this absolutely clear here and it is also in the committee's motion for a resolution.
These Treaties guarantee all EU citizens the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services and the freedom of movement of goods across the EU.
These freedoms will only be implemented once all electricity and gas consumers are able to select their suppliers from across the EU.
Only then will we have achieved conformity with the Treaties.
Secondly, if a Member State wishes to treat all the households in its country equally - for example all those between Lille and the Pyrenees - it may do so; it is free to make that decision. However, it can invite tenders for the work and ask which competitor is the most suitable and best qualified for the job.
A supply monopoly cannot be justified. This too violates current law.
It lends credence to the suspicion that people are lining their pockets illegally.
Perhaps I might make the following additional points on the reports.
We support free choice for all consumers across the EU.
We are in favour of all suppliers having access to the technical networks, which need to be managed in separate companies to prevent discrimination against certain types of supplier and to prevent abuse of dominant position within a company.
We are in favour of having regulatory systems in the Member States to ensure that this is the case.
So far - and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Rapkay - this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State.
Like the Council I support a solution which takes account of the heterogeneity of the national network structures.
Mr President, the Commission's proposals for fully liberalising the internal market in electricity and natural gas in the Member States of the European Union are, in our view, on the right track, which is why the rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkei and Mr Mombaur, basically endorsed them.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the same position and unanimously approved my opinion and my amendments, almost all of which were included by the rapporteurs in their reports, for which I thank them.
The prevailing view, I think, is that the liberalisation of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is: one, way behind schedule and is being systematically obstructed by monopoly interests on the part of the private sector, the trades union and the national governments, and not just in France; two, that there are huge differences from one country to another. For example, Great Britain has fully liberalised, while France is doing exactly the opposite and the same applies, unfortunately, to my own country; three, as a result of the foregoing, there are serious disruptions in the working of the internal market, competition is being distorted and, consequently, prices are being squeezed at the expense of competitiveness both in the energy production sector and between European companies and in the consumer sector and, four, this delay is hampering cross-border transactions on these markets.
There is no single market, nor do I foresee one in the immediate future.
The Lisbon objectives of a dynamic and competitive European Union with full employment depend on a competitive internal market in electricity and natural gas.
And the proposed independent authorities and the abolition of state intervention, which uses pricing policy as a way of exercising social policy will help here somewhat.
Instead of prices which undercut production costs and block competition, it is better to find other ways of exercising social policy, for example by reducing taxes.
Finally, any delay in opening up these markets will deter private companies and foreign investment in the energy sector and in the European Union in general and will not therefore increase employment, which is supposed to be the ultimate objective.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market first and foremost studied the comitology procedure.
This committee was of the opinion that it was preferable to include the annexes in the regulation and the directive so as to create clarity, and to safeguard public access to legislative documents.
This appears all the more justified since the annexes contain a number of regulations which protect the end user.
With regard to the gas directive, the great importance of effective and non-discriminatory access to natural gas production markets for all operators in the European energy industry should be underlined.
By extending the principles of the internal energy market to countries which possess raw materials, producer countries can be developed and the internal market objectives met.
The gradual and mutual harmonisation of legislation is crucial for the internal energy market to reach completion.
A common minimum framework of standards must be available by means of which the regulatory bodies of the energy markets can be granted authority and given responsibility.
In addition, I should like to underline that the sole purpose of gathering information on companies, both at Member State level and at Commission level, is solely to fulfil the tasks prescribed in this regulation and this directive.
Since this information is partly confidential, restrictions on the distribution of the information obtained are urgently required.
Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the present directive amends a whole host of regulations in the existing directive, and it appears useful to me to seize this opportunity to publish a consolidated version.
Mr President, the completion of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is a wonderful opportunity for further development in the European Union in terms of the economy, the environment and also society.
For a long time now it has been clear that the energy issue plays a central role, above and beyond security of supply.
It is inextricably linked to the fate of our generation and future generations.
The rapporteurs recognised this and have extended the Commission proposal to make it more forward-looking.
Slowly but surely, more and more people are realising that the future lies in renewable sources of energy.
They are the only sources which will guarantee a clean and secure energy supply in the long term.
That is why we need to lay down some ground rules for these renewable sources of energy.
The most important point here is that the true cost of supplying all energy is reflected in its price.
To achieve this, when energy is supplied from traditional nuclear and fossil fuel sources, the external costs for insurance and the subsequent costs in terms of pollutant emissions need to be internalised.
We need undiscriminatory access to the networks for electricity and also for biogas.
This is a new concept which has been accepted here for the first time.
We need fair transmission charges for all sources of energy and in a free market we also need the primary energy sources to be labelled.
We owe this to our consumers.
I would even go so far as to say that it is not only bills that should be labelled; energy sources should also be disclosed in the energy supplier's promotional literature.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate our three fellow MEPs, Messrs Turmes, Rapkay and Mombaur on their sterling work.
What is on today's agenda?
On today's agenda is a fresh step for Parliament in the process of total liberalisation.
And after the successful first opening we have had, it is important to take that second step.
We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner and the Member States to ensure that this is achieved in Barcelona and that we do not try to frustrate the process, as we usually do - and you know which Member State I am referring to.
As Mr Mombaur has already indicated the principal arguments, I will not elaborate on these any further.
So what are the key points?
Firstly, we must ensure that a level playing field is established. In other words, we must remove obstacles and ensure that everyone is given equal opportunities.
Secondly, we need to ensure that the role of the supervisors is framed in such a manner that we ultimately work towards a single European market.
This is why Amendments Nos 53 and 130 to Article 6(1) of the directive are of prime importance.
My group is keen to see these amendments adopted, because we can thereby ensure that we work towards this single European market.
The third key point is that we can allow competition actually to take place, thus ensuring transparency and non-discrimination.
After all, we have seen that the instrument of reciprocity does not work.
The consumer must have free choice.
My final point is this: it is of great strategic importance for us to start with an assemblage of information.
We are keen to support the amendment that is now before us by Mr Westendorp, among others.
We have nothing against the Mombaur report, but we struggle all the more with the report by Mr Turmes.
Allow me to say at this stage that the PPE-DE Group will request a split vote for Amendment No 69 and will withdraw Amendment No 181, so that there will be no question of negotiated third-party access.
For the rest, we have great difficulty with the Turmes report.
In our view, it contains too many rules, too great an administrative burden and too little respect for the market economy.
We also believe it is not right for responsibility to lie with industry and not with the supervisors or national States.
I should like to note that liberalisation is not promoted in this way, but that new obstacles are raised, so that it is difficult for liberalisation to get off the ground.
And this could never be the intention.
Needless to say, we must carefully consider the environmental aspects.
However, we should bear in mind that with regard to combined heat and power production and telecommunications, we can regulate many of the points on this topic in other directives too.
We would therefore urge Mr Turmes to withdraw amendments in this area.
