I have two reasons for the profound conviction that leads me to abominate terrorism; not only does it kill innocent people along with the so-called enemy, but it also always bears within itself the seeds of self-destruction.
It is not only Israel's retaliation attacks that I have in mind; I also believe that a society built upon terrorism possesses an inherent capacity for self-destruction.
Whilst I understand why the Presidency is taking the initiative in having certain organisations blacklisted, the one thing I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us is what we are to do about this shameful wall that runs through Israel.
On what list are we going to put that?
The fact is that there is violence other than terrorism in the traditional sense.
Perhaps we ought to maintain a list of actions that are detrimental to peace but do not constitute terrorism.
This wall - God knows - should be on it.
Mr President, on the subject of the role the European Union can play in the Middle East, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the role played for many years by its representative in the region, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who has worked with few resources, but whose work has been and must be deservedly valued.
I hope that his successor will have more resources in order to take action there.
I believe that the war in Iraq has contributed to worsening the situation in Palestine.
A decision such as the war in Iraq, a unilateral one, has led to a worsening of the situation and an increase in acts of terror.
I believe, therefore, that the European Union must strengthen acts of multilateralism such as the Quartet and the establishment of the road map.
We must demand from the leaders, both Israeli and Palestinian, the political commitment to seek peace.
Selective assassinations must come to an end and terrorist attacks must also come to an end; we must remember that not only terrorists are implicated in an attack, but also those who provide them with resources and those who perhaps turn a blind eye to the preparation of those attacks.
Commissioner, a sine qua non for the end of international terrorism, and thereby a more peaceful world order, is the cessation of hostilities between the Israelis and Palestinians.
The deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken.
The two protagonists and their international supporters can argue interminably, and sometimes even convincingly, to justify their sides' violence.
But this is a sterile debate and I do not propose to get into it.
The two sides have to be kept apart, but the normal constraints of morality, self-discipline and the rule of law have been drowned in a seething reservoir of hatred and revenge.
As things now stand, neither side will stand back for long enough to allow these intense emotions to abate.
They fear and distrust each other too much.
It is clear that an international force must be interposed between them, because there is literally no other way of keeping them apart.
This force must command the confidence of the two sides.
To achieve this it has to include United States and EU components.
The American presence will reassure the Israelis, who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally.
The Palestinians see the EU as an honest and trustworthy broker.
A realistic appeal can then be made to both sides for restraint while the force is being organised and deployed.
Simultaneously, the peace process can be reactivated on the basis of the so-called roadmap, which has been accepted by the two sides.
It can work, if it gets time.
It will get time if there is no violence, and I believe the international force could break the cycle of violence.
The EU can now vindicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy.
There is nothing else in sight.
It is exceedingly urgent.
The prize is much more than peace in the Middle East: it is world peace, because continued violence in the Middle East is a poisonous backcloth to a lot of the terrorism which continues to happen in all parts of the world.
Mr President, October 2000 to October 2003 represents 1 000 days of violence, 1 000 days of the innocent dying, 1 000 days of suffering by both communities, 1 000 days of the Intifada and 1 000 days of Europe's powerlessness.
One day the history of this missed opportunity, this wasted time will be written about, and those who thought that violence was a justifiable political weapon will be judged very harshly.
A few days ago, we experienced an exceptionally powerful moment in Parliament, a moment of genuine enlightenment, when we received the Palestinian, Mr Nusseibeh and the Israeli, Mr Yalon.
They represent hope, because hope emanates from the communities themselves.
Europe could be built because in 1946 a Franco-German commission decided to withdraw anti-German phrases from French schoolbooks and anti-French phrases from German schoolbooks.
From that time on, we have not called the Germans 'Boches'; we have given them different names and looked at them through different eyes.
This is the message that we must send to the region.
There are people in both communities who think in terms of dialogue, reconciliation, the future and development.
These are the people who warrant our support.
Those who truly deserve to win the Nobel prize are the Palestinian intellectuals who take the risk, as Camus once did, of condemning terrorism as an absolute evil and a crime against humanity.
I cannot allow it to be said, as it was a few minutes ago, that the actions of Hamas have anything in common with the French resistance movement.
The real heroes are also the ordinary Israelis, the bus drivers that no human shield has ever thought about accompanying.
Europe must think about the communities and about the future.
We must stop acting as prosecutors, since we are not really qualified to sit in judgment.
We must play the role of a realistic and courageous guide.
Mr President, at the Conference of Presidents Mr Antonione correctly stated that the downward spiral of violence must be stopped.
The way forward is for both sides to get together around a table.
What could they bring that might break the deadlock?
Perhaps Palestine could re-examine the status of her intifada.
It is an armed intifada.
She should ask herself whether an intifada has to be armed to qualify as a genuine intifada.
The answer to that is 'no'.
Most intifadas are popular and peaceful intifadas.
Perhaps she could withdraw from violence by making her intifada a peaceful one.
What about Israel?
Israel has a responsibility to bring Palestine to independent statehood.
Palestine cannot be an independent state if it is not financially viable.
Israel could think hard and re-examine her approach towards helping Palestine to trade freely, without adding on costs and without using the wall to further depress agricultural or factory production.
There is much to be done if both sides can get together.
Looking at just those two simple items, success could still be within their grasp.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have repeatedly given our very close attention to developments in the Middle East, and I think there is consensus that we all want to do our bit to ensure that the roadmap to peace can be adhered to.
I see this, though, as giving rise to three specific demands.
First of all, in the first phase of the roadmap, there is reference to the need to destroy the infrastructure of terror.
What contribution are we making to that?
What contribution can we make to it?
This is where there is a need for further initiatives, especially together with the United Nations, if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too.
Secondly, I am very grateful to the European Union for now having blacklisted the civilian wings of certain movements.
I would ask, though, that we now do what the Palestinian Authority has already done, and block their accounts, so that there is no possibility of terrorism being funded through European bank accounts.
In this, we should not merely make declarations, but take the appropriate action.
Thirdly, there is something that has been for many years a major concern for me as a member of the Committee on Budgets, namely the issue of the form of the Palestinian Authority.
It is a fact that we in the European Union have been spending a very great deal of money, and I would like to see it achieving something.
We cannot be expected to invest in a system that does not correspond to what our Budget regulations require.
Instead, we must ensure the creation of stable structures capable of giving a country like this peaceful civilian administration in the long term.
Mr President, as we listen to and take part in this debate, we seem to feel, after 50 years and seven wars in the Middle East, that we are taking a risk, that is to say that each of us seems to have turned into a minor master of democracy and budgeting capable of applying yardsticks and prejudices that are ours and ours alone.
We may not always have appreciated the role played by Yasser Arafat, just as we have hardly ever appreciated the role played by Sharon, but we should not forget that President Arafat was democratically elected as president of a people deprived of a homeland, of its own territory and a peaceful existence.
If we forget that we are guilty of conceit, evasiveness and superficiality.
If we condemn terrorism against Israel firmly and with absolute sincerity - and we condemn it with all our strength and with all due vehemence - then we should condemn with equal force and vehemence the character assassination by the media of the democratically elected president of a people.
We call on the Presidency not just to denounce his exile as unacceptable.
We should also be denouncing the indecent incitement to homicide by a minister in the Israeli Government and by an influential newspaper like the Jerusalem Post.
What can Europe do?
Just blacklist Hamas?
I do not think that is enough.
We need to be firm on three points: we should call for an end to the blockade on the Palestinian territories; we must call for an end to all settlement activities; and we must call for the demolition of the security wall, which amounts, in practice, to an annexation of territory and is a violation of international law.
Europe must invest here, and one possibility might be to send in a ground force that would make a decisive, practical contribution to monitoring respect for reciprocal obligations.
The only alternative to peace is peace, but to make this possible Europe must take practical action.
Mr President, during the summer, following one particularly deadly attack, we were able to hear, broadcast by most television stations across the world, a Palestinian leader, someone who works closely with the prime minister, make a declaration to the effect that the Palestinian Authority should indeed once and for all commit to combating terrorism.
This was too much, however!
It was too much for Arafat, who precipitated the crisis in his security services and who forced Abu Mazen to resign.
President Arafat's beatification by the international institutions does not alter the appalling fact that we are still waiting to hear a renunciation of terrorism.
Today, it is Arafat who is responsible for the Palestinian suffering, having sabotaged several attempts to secure peace.
He is the Saddam Hussein of the Palestinian people and I hope that they will be able to rid themselves of him!
Mr President, the tragedy of the Arab-Israeli conflict is never too far from our minds or TV screens, and the carefully constructed roadmap now seems to have virtually imploded.
Serious mistakes have been made.
Clearly the Palestinian Authority was unable or unwilling to rein in the excesses of Islamic and other terrorist groups, as we saw in the Hamas suicide bomb a month ago in Jerusalem.
In this context, I welcome the EU's belated banning of the political wing of Hamas from fund-raising in its territory.
I also believe that the undermining by Chairman Arafat of Prime Minister Abu Mazen has further muddied the waters, and lends credibility to those who argue that Arafat has no interest in going the last mile for peace and security if he is not at centre stage.
However, coded calls for his assassination recently by Israel's Deputy Prime Minister are not helpful, as he was recognised as the elected PA Chairman, and this lowers the moral tone of the debate.
Our challenge is to encourage reformists and moderate interlocutors amongst the Palestinians.
I met a Professor Nusseibeh two weeks ago in Brussels and he is clearly an example of the type of Palestinian who is acting in good faith and is prepared to make compromises, including over the vexed issue of the right of return and the final status of Jerusalem.
Both issues can be solved with imaginative thinking and money.
The international community needs to redouble its efforts to reconvene the roadmap to enable a two-state solution with a viable, contiguous state of Palestine, based approximately on the 1967 borders, and a secure Israel living in peaceful, neighbourly coexistence.
Otherwise, Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world will use this conflict to galvanise the Islamic world against the West, using it as a pretext to justify worldwide terrorist attacks.
Unlike my colleague, Mr Cushnahan, I am not yet convinced that an international military force is the solution needed to end the hostilities and kick-start the peace process, as I do not think that a totally neutral force could ever be assembled.
Incidentally, I have been involved in Parliament's working group looking at EU funding to the Palestinian Authority, which is proceeding on schedule.
It has been a worthwhile exercise in addressing so many of our taxpayers' concerns about serious allegations of misappropriation of funds, and now we have in place the appropriate mechanisms for scrutiny of the way these monies are being spent.
Mr President, violence in this conflict cannot offer a solution.
A solution should be sought not by military means, but by way of politics and -diplomacy, but one of the key problems is that the leaders on both sides - and I mean on both sides - are in a weak position.
Despite this, there still seems to be goodwill, as is evident, among other things, from the proposal to release a number prisoners from each side.
The European Union should play a pioneering role, much more so than it has done to date.
We are, after all, the region's key trading partner.
I would therefore argue in favour of working for peace from this House, this Parliament, even though it appears that Parliament is becoming increasingly divided into two camps.
It is not up to us in the European Parliament to fan the flames through all kinds of unilateral actions.
On the contrary, we must use our joint goodwill and energy much more to help establish reconciliation and lasting peace.
That is the Parliament's task.
Mr President, I believe there have been many statements here condemning the recent comments of the Israeli Government and recent events.
It is very easy to say to other people, to the Israelis and the Palestinians, what they must do, but perhaps we should consider what Europe is doing, what we are doing, because we can do something about that, because it is in our hands.
In this regard, I did not like the comments of the Council, which has taken the bait, which has become embroiled in the current media war.
Europe cannot depend on the media war, on statements and threats.
We must work on what Europe is doing.
In this regard, European policy has been rather ambiguous in recent months, because, if Europe played an important role in creating the figure of Abu Mazen, what has it done to support him?
I would like to put this question to the Council, and also, and above all, to the Commission.
What have we done to ensure that the Palestinians do their duties, such as to support Abu Mazen so that he may have a single police force or to demand that Arafat concede some of his powers to a minister who he himself had supported?
What have we done in order to build a country able to accept its responsibilities as an independent and democratic state?
What have we done to exchange our very nice NGO programmes, peace declarations, human rights groups, doves in schools, for a system and health services which are not managed by the Church or by a terrorist system like Hamas, which is paying doctors and teachers?
There are more than 1 200 000 children lacking a proper education system.
The question we should be asking is: what has Europe done to strengthen the system of security and justice?
We condemn the wall, because it runs counter to any democratic system and is a physical and moral aggression, but we must also build the country and support the victims of terrorism.
Europe must open a line of support for these victims.
It must take a position and combat the prevailing ambiguity.
Let us have a clear and effective policy in Europe, and not a policy of making statements.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
I view the increasingly aggressive stance of the Israeli Government towards the Palestinian people with the deepest concern.
The recent series of threats by the Israeli Government to expel Yasser Arafat, which culminated in the Deputy Prime Minister's suggestion that he be assassinated, is totally unacceptable and despicable.
The United Nations General Assembly has criticised the Israeli Government in this connection.
The United States veto of a UN Security Council resolution to this effect (a vote from which, moreover, Germany and the United Kingdom abstained) is deplorable.
The EU cannot simply, in the words of the statement by the Presidency of the European Union, express 'its deep preoccupation', ask 'the Israeli Government to refrain from any use of force and, in particular, from the expulsion of President Arafat', or consider the Israeli Government and the Palestinian people as equals.
To do so is to ape the stance of the United States.
It is essential to put significant pressure on the Israeli authorities with a view to ending the military occupation, the killings, the annexing of Palestinian territory, the building of the wall to control the movements of Palestinians, and, in general, the campaign of pure state terrorism being conducted against the Palestinian people.
There is an urgent need to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.
Peace will come only when the Palestinian people's inalienable and widely-acknowledged right to their own independent, sovereign state becomes reality.
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in CancÃºn from 10 to 14 September 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this House, the Union body which is fully representative of the citizens, I feel it is right to start with the document which you, yourselves, adopted on 3 July 2003 - this year, that is - in preparation for the CancÃºn Ministerial Conference, in which, inter alia, you rightly underline that the successful outcome of the Doha Development Round negotiations remains an important factor in bolstering economic growth worldwide and strengthening multilateralism and global governance.
For its part, the European Council took these considerations on board, reaffirming in the conclusions of the GAER Council of 21 July 2003 the European Union's fundamental commitment to a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda by the end of 2004, the DDA being a single undertaking aimed at achieving an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced package of agreements.
On these bases, the European Union went to CancÃºn, but - as you know - our desires, our hopes and our undertakings were shattered at the Summit in the hot, torrid climate which was caused by more than just the weather.
Yet we all thought that we had done everything possible over those months, that our preparations would ensure that the negotiations could genuinely take off and that the timeframes laid down at Doha would be respected.
It is therefore necessary, in this cooling-off phase, to ask ourselves a number of questions about the Summit and the preparations we made for it.
Where did we go wrong?
In particular, we need to ask ourselves this question because Europe, perhaps more than anyone else - and this is to our credit, not a criticism - believes in multilateralism, for that is the principle underpinning our Union of sovereign States.
The work of the European Parliament, your work, is the highest expression of that principle.
Before I raise some questions, I feel it is only right and proper to confirm before the European Union body which is fully representative of the citizens that Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler - who are to speak after me - have always fully adhered with wisdom and flexibility to the mandate given to them by the European Council, which is, moreover, mirrored to a large extent in the demands contained in your resolution.
Furthermore, as President-in-Office, I can assure the House that, at all times during the Summit, at every meeting held and in every measure - including bilateral measures - taken or supported by the individual Members of the Union, there was always full coherence and consistency.
Europe really did work as a team!
In CancÃºn phraseology, Europe was a genuine G-25, thanks, not least, to the substantial contribution of the accession countries.
At this point, we must attempt to respond, although it will not be easy, to the three questions which appear to be most urgent, and to discuss together with you three short- to medium-term scenarios. Firstly, why was the fifth Ministerial Conference a failure?
Secondly, who is to blame for that?
Thirdly, did Europe do everything it could?
Why did the fifth Ministerial Conference fail?
First of all, we have to realise that the ambiguities in the agenda for the negotiations and the issues which had not been resolved at Doha served to tighten the noose at CancÃºn, particularly where the two main subjects - agriculture and the Singapore issues - were concerned.
In both cases, the ambiguities were left over from Doha.
As regards the agriculture text, ambiguity was introduced in too many places during the fourth Ministerial Conference, during the very last minutes, the very last exchanges.
Moreover, a similar thing happened with the postponement of the decisions on the Singapore issues, which were the subject of a heated debate at Doha and were in danger of bringing the talks to a standstill then.
At the fourth world Conference, these ambiguities were resolved thanks to the decision of the Qatar presidency to extend the negotiations for a further 36 hours in order to discuss precisely these matters.
As you know, the solution adopted then allowed the matter to be inserted more or less effectively in the single undertaking but without any specific negotiating commitment.
This means, apertis verbis, that the success of Doha is probably due to the level of international need.
It was the exceptional nature of Doha, the fact that it took place so soon after the tragic events of 11 September, which caused the Fourth Ministerial Conference to be a success.
It may be, however, that, in actual fact, the WTO crisis which started in Seattle was only temporarily alleviated in Doha and that it re-emerged in CancÃºn, not by chance in relation to those same Doha issues.
These are two questions which are relatively similar.
On the one hand - with regard to agriculture - Europe and the countries of the northern hemisphere created a cultural exception, which was completely legitimate but which is, still today, in conflict with the hopes of the major developing countries, who are actually accusing us of protectionism and of distorting the market.
On the other, there are the Singapore issues, the other issues relating to the governance of globalisation, which are a priority for Europe and the major investor countries but which the developing countries feel are an invasion of their rights, which has led them - or some of them, at least - to create a kind of cultural exception too, at least for the time being.
The second question is: who is to blame?
The negotiating parties must certainly take some of the responsibility. They did not take recognition of the other as a basic premise.
Quite the opposite: they often sought, more than anything, to divide the opposing side. After the August agreement between the European Union and the United States on the agricultural dossier and NAMA, there was a strong reaction from about 20 countries, led by India, Brazil, China and South Africa and including developing countries from the Cairns Group, which continued consistently throughout the Summit.
However, precisely this initial impetus - a negative rather than a positive impetus, given the dissimilarity between the countries involved - resulted in a polarisation of positions which soured the negotiations.
For the same motives, some African countries sought - they may have had no other choice - to take up a new, offensive position, promoting initiatives on themes such as cotton, for example, and further widening the gap between the positions on the traditional chapters.
Basically, the WTO has a clear structural problem: the lack of a structure organising the negotiators, leading to the absurd situation where we have a presidency which first extends negotiations, at Doha - those who were present at Doha will remember - for over 36 hours and then, however, cuts the Summit short in CancÃºn; then the mini-ministerial meetings, a useful pre-negotiation exercise, which, however, failed to resolve the issues; lastly, the greatest flaw - a WTO which now has 148 members and, yet, is without efficient decision-making structures.
Immediately after the summit, Commissioner Lamy talked of mediaeval organisation.
European history teaches us that, in order to reach the Rinascimento, the era of the flowering of civilisation, a common effort of creativity and political vision is needed.
Therefore, we must ask ourselves now, in this House, whether Europe did everything possible.
For our part, I would say that we Europeans were well-prepared - or, at least, we thought we were - in particular with the reform of the common agricultural policy, while the United States was moving in the opposite direction with its Farm Bill, but it may be that we did not succeed in getting the message across properly.
I feel that we did a good job, not least as regards the most vulnerable, with the Development Agenda itself, with Everything but Arms, with technical assistance measures and capacity building, with the ground-breaking decision on lifesaving medicines, with regard to which we showed ourselves to be willing a long time before the United States.
However, maybe we failed to exploit the full potential of our position, which was, moreover, decisive on many issues.
Moreover, we tried to stop the gap widening between the European Union and the United States with the August agreement, but we must ask ourselves whether what we thought was a solution has not actually proved to be a mistake.
Was it possible, after a year and a half of trade wars which have widened the gap between the two shores of the Atlantic and divided the principal Doha negotiators, to remedy the situation with two framework-agreements, however important?
Could we have done more?
I am referring, in particular, to the cotton initiative, which, as an MEP pointed out at CancÃºn during the Council's meeting with the interparliamentary delegation present, gradually, over the course of the Summit, assumed ethical and political significance, a symbolic value equal to that acquired by lifesaving medicines at Doha.
If we had been quicker off the mark in involving the United States too, in showing greater willingness to resolve the issue, we might have achieved a more successful result.
We must go back to that point and start again.
This thread must be taken up again in accordance with WTO rules and without this constituting a precedent for other negotiating chapters.
At this juncture, these three questions open up three debates. Firstly, can we resume the Development Agenda at this point?
Of course, it is not yet wholly compromised, but its path has become more difficult, full of obstacles and, thus, of necessity, longer.
If we do not make up in the coming weeks in Geneva what we lost at CancÃºn, the process will go on way beyond the deadline of 1 January 2005.
On 15 December in Geneva, there is a kind of mid-term review, probably at senior-official level, which will tell us more.
Moreover, at the end of next year, the principal negotiators might change, not least because of both the US presidential elections and the end of the present European Commission's term of office.
There will be other negotiators, other issues, other timeframes.
Until then, we will need to hold a dialogue, aware of its value, with the new leaders which emerged at CancÃºn; to recognise these leaders in order to succeed in forging a close, effective negotiating relationship; to pursue the reform of the common agricultural policy and communicate it better; to persuade other industrialised countries to undertake initiatives along the lines of Everything but Arms; to verify that the agreement on lifesaving medicines is being properly enforced, that the agreement is having the desired effect, that it is meeting the needs of the weakest of the weak; to extend technical assistance and capacity building to prevent third negotiating parties starting to lose faith in the transparency and objectives of the European Union because of the inconsistent and fragmented nature of the message, maybe.
We wish not to impose but to persuade. We believe not in deceit but in clear agreements.
The second debate is the WTO reforms.
Can we reform the structure and the themes of the agenda at the same time?
How and where?
Is that, perhaps, linked to the crisis of the other international organisations, starting with the Bretton Woods organisations, which are not doing their job, and the organisations dealing with other themes - such as employment, the environment, agriculture itself - which are overloading the WTO agenda?
The WTO may be in a crisis similar to that of Aesop's frog, because it is in danger of swelling up, both because of the number of Members - 148, as I said - and because of its growing agenda, in the face, moreover, of the inertia of other international organisations on themes which are their particular interest and responsibility.
I wonder, and I put it to you, whether it might not be appropriate to resume the initiative pursued by the Commission in 2001, creating a special group to work on the reform and transparency of the World Trade Organisation, to explore the possible institutional solutions for the organisation in depth.
Lastly, the third debate is whether we need to adjust our trade policy in any way.
It is no coincidence that President Bush's personal representative, Robert Zoellick, announced within minutes of the failure of CancÃºn that the United States was going to forge ahead with the creation of the FTAA - the Free Trade Area of the Americas - and, in any case, with bilateral agreements.
These great continents are linked by very strong bilateral agreements.
Without undermining the principle of multilateralism, Europe must take the initiative and step up its action, starting precisely with the implementation of the EU-Mercosur agreement, on which a great deal of negotiation work has been done, for which I pay tribute to the Commissioners, and which now needs to be brought to a swift, successful conclusion.
The Barcelona agreement on Euromed also certainly needs to be fully implemented.
These are bilateral agreements which do not undermine multilateral agreements, which must remain our main priority, but strengthen and pave the way for them.
Brazil - although only with regard to the agricultural dossier, for the moment - has, together with others, capably taken on leadership of the countries of the southern hemisphere, with the creation of the G-21.
It is an authoritative, democratic leadership, European in nature.
We must place our trust in it and strengthen the historic, economic and commercial ties with Latin America as a whole; let us endeavour to include this objective in next year's agenda too.
I would like, if I may, after this discouraging analysis of negotiating issues, to end by sharing with you something which distinguishes us as Europeans.
Upon hearing the news of the failure of the Summit in CancÃºn, a journalist from a prestigious Italian newspaper asked me a spontaneous, maybe too frank question.
He asked me at the press conference whether we might have made a mistake in resolving the issue of lifesaving medicines before CancÃºn, suggesting that if they had remained on the negotiating table during the Summit we might have had more influence, more negotiating power.
I immediately replied, interpreting, I believe, the values of our Europe: 'If we are the European Union, the pioneers in the recognition of civil rights and the dignity of the human person, it is because we believe that the highest value, life, takes precedence over negotiating considerations.'
If CancÃºn served any purpose, indeed, it is precisely that it may have forced many countries to remove barriers to agreement in the run-up to the Ministerial Conference.
Of that, at least, we can be proud.
Trade negotiations are generally described as a win-win situation, in that success means the parties' gains outweigh the cost of the quid pro quo they offer.
In the event of failure, however, the reverse is true.
A successful outcome at CancÃºn would have meant all WTO members stood to win; the collapse of the Ministerial Conference means we all lose.
That, in a nutshell, is the verdict of the Commission as the EU's trade negotiator.
Since we are responsible as negotiators to you and to the Council, my colleague, Commissioner Fischler, and I intend to report to you this afternoon on the Commission's analysis of our stance at the talks, and the conclusions we feel able to draw of this event, at least at this stage.
So what was CancÃºn about?
Our aim, as I told you before we set out, was to achieve half of the negotiating programme adopted at Doha in November 2001.
We failed quite simply because the gap between the parties' negotiating positions remained too wide to be bridged.
This is really self-evident.
We were supposed to get half way; we barely covered a third of the ground.
How did this come about?
Not because of poor preparation, which is what happened in Seattle, but because the negotiations never really gained momentum either in the run-up to CancÃºn or at the Conference itself.
This momentum enables the differences to be narrowed while gradually creating the prospect of a positive outcome. This momentum causes an increasing number of delegations to realise that it is more in their interests for the talks to succeed than to fail.
All of us sitting around the table at the WTO are carrying out - and know that the others are carrying out - a delicate balancing act and the slightest thing can tilt that balance.
Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, at CancÃºn it was the balance of these scales that tipped success beyond our reach.
And whose fault was it? It is said that success has many fathers and failure is an orphan.
I do not intend to play that game, and my answer to this difficult question is that we were all responsible. To be precise, the fault lies with the way all the assembled negotiators saw fit to fulfil their mandates.
That is a somewhat abstract proposition.
To make it clearer, I shall briefly review the stances adopted by the four highest-profile players at CancÃºn: Europe, the United States, G-21 and the group formed by Africa and the least-developed countries.
The European Union was famously keen to see the Doha programme - and hence CancÃºn - succeed.
But that, of course, makes for an awkward tactical position when it comes to exchanging concessions or bringing in the rules we set store by.
And we duly paid quite a price: at Doha, by reluctantly agreeing not to negotiate a linkage between fundamental social clauses and trade rules and by scaling down our environmental ambitions; between Doha and CancÃºn, by relaxing our stance on investment, competition, trade facilitation and public procurement; after reform of the CAP, by agreeing to additional multilateral measures on agricultural support to help developing countries and further opening up our agriculture market, thereby getting the United States to embark on a similar course; last but not least on access to drugs, by managing to persuade our pharmaceutical industry of the need to waive patent rights - an achievement that happily still stands, since the negotiations on this issue were part of a separate process.
Concessions can, however, only go so far.
With the assent of the Council, of Member States and your delegates on the spot, we went to the limit and beyond on two issues in CancÃºn; investment and competition.
In the absence of any significant movement from the other players the Chair of the Conference concluded that proceedings had stalled even before negotiations on the long list of subjects still on the table had really got under way.
The United States too keeps a close eye on the tilt of the scales.
My feeling is that the fading prospect of any additional access to markets for farm produce or manufactured goods in keeping with their initial hugely ambitious aims upset a precarious balance.
What tipped the scales the wrong way was the prospect of separate negotiations on one politically neuralgic commodity; cotton.
I think they might have gone along with the demands from four African countries that believe themselves clearly injured by the US support system had the commitments on a reduction of support been part of the broader negotiations on agriculture, but unfortunately the negotiating process was scuppered before it got that far down the agenda.
The Group of 21, including Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Mexico and twelve Latin American countries, was born of two parents, a political father and an agricultural mother.
The political father comes from a desire to give the developing countries a voice in the WTO in dealing with the supposed US-EU duopoly.
An odd sort of duopoly, considering the long-standing differences in the American and European positions on access to drugs, the Singapore issues, geographical indications, the WTO implications of the biodiversity convention, the reform of the dispute settlement mechanism or access to agricultural markets, and there I shall end the long list.
I therefore believe that the gleam in the father's eye, in this case, went beyond the WTO; I see the coalition as an expression of the larger emerging countries' desire to make their mark in international debates.
They did not manage in the UN in the debate on Iraq but at CancÃºn, on trade, they were able to do so.
The agricultural mother was also there, however, since measured by the WTO yardstick, the USA and Europe are indeed the biggest purveyors of farm support.
Only up to a point, however, which was never discussed because the talks ran off the rails: there is farm support and farm support, and not all of it is disruptive of trade.
This is an essential dividing line for the future common agricultural policy.
Also present at the birth of G-21 was the corpulent industrial Uncle Tariff, a rather frustrating figure for our exporters of manufactured goods and apparently in no hurry to slim down.
In short, I believe that for G-21 the political achievement of making its presence felt, coupled with trade interests that were defensive, even if legitimate in the WTO context, finally outweighed the otherwise real attractions of a success on agriculture.
I complete my survey with our friends in Africa and the least-developed countries.
Our analysis is that they feared the erosion of their trade preferences on EU markets - a certainty if our remaining multilateral defences were lowered even further - as a loss outweighing the prospective gains within reach in other areas.
That led them to refuse the Chair's compromise proposal that all the Singapore issues be dropped except transparency in commercial transactions and in public procurement - a refusal, incidentally, condemned by South Korea, which insisted that investment and competition remain on the table, probably to offset certain concessions on agriculture that they (and Japan) would find particularly difficult.
I hope that this rapid overview of the different stances taken by the main players will have made it sufficiently clear to you that it is an exaggeration, indeed a mistake, to attribute the failure of CancÃºn to a sudden North/South split in the WTO.
In CancÃºn , there was no confrontation between the North and the South, rather the 'Norths' and the 'Souths' crossed paths without actually meeting.
Before I come to the conclusions we are drawing at this stage from this common defeat, I should like to stress once again that the EU negotiated in good faith in CancÃºn and added fresh concessions to those already on the table.
People can criticise this good faith, but this is a question of the EU's image and neither Mr Franz Fischler nor I are prepared to compromise on that.
I have also heard, and read, complaints that we moved too slowly.
Compared to what or to whom, might I ask?
Compared to the total stasis of the other big players, not one of whom budged an inch?
I would accept that criticism if the discussion process had gained any momentum, but I think there are enough witnesses around who can confirm that this was not the case.
This has been a major shock; there is no point in denying it.
And whenever there is a political upset, like CancÃºn, we have to go back to essentials. That means we have to ask ourselves some questions about the EU's international trade policy in order to see whether the fundamental assumptions on which we have built it for decades need re-examining.
The first question is: are we still looking to strike a dynamic balance between market opening and rule-making, rules without which market opening is neither effective nor in line with our values?
This is a question that has to be asked, since the appetite of those seated around the WTO table for market opening is becoming dangerously selective, while modernisation of the existing rules or the adoption of new ones in areas that are dear to us such as the environment is complicated by the multiplicity of political choices that comes with the ever-greater numbers of nations taking part in international trade.
Question number two: do we still, as the presidency has just asked, give preference to the multilateral approach, hitherto the hallmark of EU external policies?
Do our partners share that preference?
If not, are we strong enough to get them to change their minds?
Should bilateral or regional agreements still be seen as an adjunct to the expansion of multilateral measures? Could these replace multilateral measures, if a period of inactivity leaves the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to interpret an incomplete body of rules and ends up taking the place of the 148-member Ministerial Conference as international legislator?
The third question is: what about the future of our trade preference schemes, the systems generously set up to help the developing countries and carefully differentiated to ensure that the benefits are directed towards those that need them most?
My fourth and final question is: does the WTO, its ground rules and organisational principles still meet today's needs?
What about the principle that members have the same rights and obligations, flanked by rules on special and differentiated treatment in line with the asymmetry in the remaining protection between North and South?
What about its increasing difficulty, as an organisation, in building consensus among an ever wider membership on issues which may be technical but now affect the lives of billions of men and women and consequently have far-reaching political implications?
Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, these are the questions we need to think about before we move on, if necessary, to tactical or operational considerations; before seeking out new compromises, the compromises that are inevitable if we remain committed to harnessing globalisation in the interests of greater fairness and equity.
The European Commission is counting on you and on the Council of Ministers to help find the right answers to these questions.
We are counting on all of you - and primarily, of course, those of you who were delegates in CancÃºn and worked with us so closely there.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lamy and I agree entirely in judging CancÃºn, to our regret, to have been a disappointment, a failure that leaves us all damaged and is of course also a setback for the whole Doha development agenda.
It would be wrong to take the view that this failure is ultimately attributable to the industrialised countries' agricultural policies.
The negotiating parties did not even get round to addressing that topic in a concluding round of negotiations.
In the months leading up to it, the success of the negotiating round at CancÃºn was alleged to be largely the EU's responsibility.
At first we were told that we had to reform our common agricultural policy if the negotiations were to stand a chance of success.
That is what we did, and the world even applauded us for doing so.
We were then told that the conversations would collapse if we did not settle our differences with the Americans.
In August, therefore, we drew up, with the USA, a compromise document giving the negotiations a solid structure that promised them success.
The bottom line is that the failure of the discussions makes losers of us all, and, in the final analysis, it is probably the developing countries that are the overall losers in the agricultural negotiations.
This is particularly true of the G21 countries, which were most opposed to the approach proposed by Mr PÃ©rez del Castillo.
The package on offer at CancÃºn would have enabled the developing countries to better integrate their economies into the world trading system, and, accordingly, to benefit from its advantages.
Why do I say that?
Because the package on offer at CancÃºn would have resulted in a rational reform of the system of agricultural trade; it would, in particular, have led to drastic cuts in the subsidies that distort competition, especially in the industrialised countries - which was one of the developing countries' main objectives in the agricultural negotiations - and, among other things, the USA would have had to reform its agricultural policy.
What, exactly, was on offer?
In the area of domestic support the measures that most distort competition, the so-called 'Amber Box' and the 'de minimis' payments, have been drastically cut back.
The Blue Box would have had a lid put on it, while there was, at the same time, provision for special preferential treatment for developing countries, to which input subsidies would have continued to be permitted.
In the field of export competition, drastic cuts and disciplinary measures were proposed for export subsidies, state-funded export credits and the exploitation of surpluses disguised as food aid.
There was, for the very first time, the prospect of the complete abolition of all forms of export promotion for a whole list of products of particular interest to the developing countries.
That is not all by a long way.
Success in CancÃºn would have led to further substantial liberalisation of trade.
Quite apart from its proposals on market access, which were in the interests of all concerned, the European Union, with the development aspects of the Doha agenda in mind, had made a number of far-reaching and specific proposals relating to these states.
When the EU delegation arrived in CancÃºn, it demonstrated its support for the developing countries and its endorsement of the development agenda.
I would sum this up by saying that our concessions to the developing countries played a part in making the European Union, today, far and away the most important importer of agricultural produce from developing countries.
Last year, we imported from developing countries agricultural produce to the value of EUR 35 billion, which amounts to more than the imports of the most important industrialised states taken together.
We had adopted the 'Everything but Arms' agreement, which unilaterally opens the EU market to the forty-nine poorest countries in the world, without demanding political or economic concessions in return.
We proposed that this concession should be extended to our partners among the industrialised countries and the more advanced countries in the developing world.
We proposed that the industrialised countries should guarantee that at least 50% of the total agricultural imports from the developing countries should not be subject to import duties.
Other things on offer included discussion of the escalation in customs duties, and the developing countries would have gained a special protection clause and separate arrangements for their specialised products.
Finally, the document drawn up by the facilitators left other issues, such as concerns not relating to trade, open to further negotiations, and proposed that the 'peace clause' be extended.
As far as the future is concerned, I take the view that we have to continue on our ambitious path, but that we must also take great care in evaluating, analysing and planning every step that we take along it.
Over the coming months, we must continue to put our weight behind constructive dialogue; whilst we must play a central role, success, at the end of the day, is dependent on all members of the WTO and also our willingness to move towards a position in the centre.
This will, without doubt, demand from all of us - both the industrialised and the developing countries - not only political will but also the willingness to compromise.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is most disappointed with the outcome of CancÃºn.
We were sat there and followed the negotiations between a number of protagonists, including the United States, the European Union, the G-21 and the ACP countries. We followed the discussions on agriculture.
We made concessions and ended up receiving nothing in return.
I think this is quite a bad omen.
We are witnessing a hesitant global economic recovery. We are increasingly questioning the functioning of multilateral organisations and in the final analysis, it is the least developed countries that are the victim in this.
So there is no reason whatsoever to celebrate the outcome of CancÃºn.
This raises questions that have already been addressed by the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council: why has CancÃºn failed and where do we go from here?
Allow me first of all to thank the two Commissioners and the President-in-Office of the Council on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and - however strange this may sound - to congratulate them on their huge effort.
The failure was certainly not their fault, and my group therefore emphatically refuses to vote against, even in this House, as if the European Union and especially our Commissioners were responsible for the stalemate.
On the contrary, I would say that they are not to blame in any way.
I should like to extend warm thanks to the President-in-Office for his openness and his cooperation with Parliament.
We should, however, go over a number of points of assessment with each other.
First of all, there is the question whether the EU position and the EU negotiation results were sufficiently clear for the various delegations?
We have met plenty of people in the corridors, including MEPs and Ministers, of whom we had the feeling that they were insufficiently informed of the EU position on agriculture.
In addition, they often had insufficient knowledge of what the European Union precisely had to offer.
We therefore wonder whether the ambassadors of the EU countries and our own ambassadors could not have made more of an effort in the run up to the conference, and even if the Council and the Ministers present had pulled out all the stops in this respect.
Mr President-in-Office, you will certainly remember that we expressly asked you in a meeting with yourself to adopt a more pro-active role.
Then there is the G-21.
It is actually with good reason - many have noted this and it has transpired once again - that Brazil, in particular, has claimed a position in the Security Council in the United Nations during the general debate.
This illustrates, of course, that this was a geopolitical move more than anything else.
However, the interests of the least developed countries have badly suffered as a result of this.
I therefore think that the G-21 bears a very considerable responsibility all on its own.
Furthermore, my group has expressed some surprise at the behaviour of some NGOs - sadly also funded by the EU - in connection with what we see as their not very constructive role concerning the WTO.
Perhaps we need to talk to them again about this.
Finally, an assessment should naturally also include an evaluation of the functioning of the WTO itself.
Where do we go from here?
The rules of the game should be broadened.
We should, I think, also check whether our ambassadors in Geneva should be galvanised a bit more.
We will need to prepare the ministerial conference that is to take place early next year more effectively.
We will need to proceed more quickly with the GATS, but we will also be able to do more as a Parliament, and the resolution is, in that sense, also an invitation.
What I would like to say to the Commissioners is this: we will persist with a multilateral approach, for we have no choice.
Bilateral relations only lead to the suffering of the weakest.
Furthermore, I think we must think very carefully about whether, and when, we will be making concessions again, for if we receive nothing in return, then I think we are negotiating on a virtual plane, which does not benefit the interests of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy has asked us whether, after the failure of CancÃºn, we intend to go for a multilateral or bilateral approach.
If you go by what the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the European Parliament's resolution say, we will be operating primarily multilaterally, for in a global village, it is a choice between corrective global rules to make world trading fair, or regulations Ã  la carte, where the law of the jungle rules.
The law of the jungle leaves no room for social and environmentally-friendly agriculture.
It leaves no room for development of Africa, which only has 2% of world trade to its name.
It does not provide any protection against unfair competition via state aid in South Korea or against products made involving slavery or child labour which enter Europe via China, for example.
Although globalisation offers opportunities, it also makes our citizens anxious - and with good reason - about the future of their jobs.
This is why global rules for protection are necessary.
Not everything can, or should, be done through the WTO.
A great deal can be achieved through other multilateral organisations, such as the UNDP and the ILO, but also through human rights protection and the right of organisation for independent trade unions.
The WTO, however, should first be reorganised towards this end.
It has to function more intelligently, faster and more democratically.
On a practical level, it has to join forces more with the UNDP and the ILO.
Politically, we witnessed in CancÃºn the birth of a new world order in response to Iraq and George Bush's unilateral power politics.
Political debate and cooperation with the G-21 and the new Alliance is of major geopolitical importance to Europe.
This requires new initiatives from the Commission and the Council.
We cannot afford to wait and see, for the US is on a unilateral mission.
Europe must seek alliances with the developing countries based on its social values.
Together, we can take initiatives to reorganise the WTO and put them on the table.
At the same time, we must pursue our own agricultural reforms convincingly, and continue to put the US under pressure to do the same.
In short, I am arguing in favour of consciously investing, politically speaking, in short-term alliances with developing countries in the short term and avoiding situations where the US and Europe get caught up in the same trouser leg, for then we will stumble, as we did in CancÃºn.
Confidence-building measures are required if a new global coalition of fair traders is to be brought about.
Export subsidies in Europe for products that seriously affect the developing countries must be abolished.
This does not only apply to cotton and sugar, but also to cereal and meat.
This should, however, be directly linked to aid for multifunctional agriculture.
Furthermore, reinforced financial support for the transfer of knowledge and the development of production capacity in the developing countries is needed, as well as priorities in political contacts and the debate with the new alliance.
We must bring the debate with the developing countries on social dumping, child labour and slavery back on the negotiating table.
They are more open to this now that they are being increasingly threatened by China.
In short, we need new initiatives to get the development round back on track via new avenues.
As for the Singapore issues, Mr President I should like to ask you to find out whether, in addition to the intense technical preparation for CancÃºn, which was perfect, a new initiative should not be taken to take the pressure of the negotiations away from the topics, and thus to create a freer forum for a political debate with the developing countries about pros and cons.
After all, they also know that transparency and rules for them are necessary, because they will otherwise be faced with the arm-twisting of the large trading blocs, such as the US and China.
Despite all the disappointment surrounding the failure of CancÃºn and the appeal I am making here to invest politically in this new global coalition of fair traders, we should also emphatically mention, as a significant result of the Doha round, the agreement on cheap medicine for Aids, tuberculosis and malaria patients in Africa, Asia and Latin America, as well as Europe's commitment to it.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy, for your open and direct cooperation with us.
With your own responsibilities, over which we have clashed once or twice, for example concerning the Singapore issues, you have behaved as a true democrat, as has your fellow-Commissioner, Mr Fischler.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the general disappointment at the failure of the WTO negotiations in CancÃºn is evident, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party too is of the opinion that this negative outcome is a missed opportunity.
Nevertheless, on behalf of the Liberals, I share your view that despite this failure, we need to make a new start in the area of multilateral negotiations in order to bring about trade liberalisation.
Stubborn bilateralism is not the way forward.
In addition, I endorse your ideas about reorganisation of the WTO.
Clearly, the secretariat's organisation, structure and mandate in Geneva are not equipped for preparing and running negotiations effectively.
The question then arises as to why the negotiations in CancÃºn failed.
Several times in this House, the Singapore issues have been blamed for this.
Apparently, the EU was even inflexible in the negotiations and this is why everything went wrong.
This appears to me to be a serious misconception, and, on behalf of my group, I concur with what was said by Mr van Velzen, who also spoke highly of the work of our Commissioners.
As a member of the delegation, I took umbrage at the fact that the entire week was dominated by agriculture and that knowledge about our agricultural policy is very minimal in various countries outside of Europe.
Only at the eleventh hour did the negotiations about the Singapore issues and trade in services open, and the conference collapsed no less than half a day later.
It is, moreover, regrettable that the developing countries were not prepared to negotiate on this, for it is precisely they that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate, reduction in import levies and transparent legislation.
In this respect, they would gain from trade facilitation.
Indeed, 80% of all import levies are paid by the developing countries combined.
One ray of hope that I saw in CancÃºn was the success of the Parliamentary Conference, which is of crucial importance in lending the WTO democratic legitimacy.
We managed to make a final declaration calling for the installation of a parliamentary pillar in the WTO.
This seems important to me, for we cannot leave democracy to the NGOs.
They, at least some of them, once again demonstrated their dubious role in CancÃºn by cheering on the sidelines when the negotiations had failed.
And this while the developing countries lost out!
I would ask Commissioners Lamy and Fischler what their first step will be to breathe new life into the multilateral negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioners, our first task is to make a correct diagnosis of events.
The Union might have made mistakes, but I am not going to make it the scapegoat for the entire breakdown of negotiations, in the same way that I would not blame the donkey in la Fontaine's fable for eating two clumps of grass.
One can and indeed one must discuss tactics but our negotiators did, in essence, stick to their mandate; they made many concessions and backed down in the negotiations on investment and competition.
The Union was under no obligation to go further.
On the other hand, and I shall return to this point, the reality of the situation means that we must undertake a thorough review of our mandate.
At CancÃºn, there were other parties willing to stand in judgment and also others who made mistakes.
The United States hid behind our skirts, because they had no desire to become involved.
India and many other countries showed no interest in the Doha Agenda and although Brazil was interested, in particular with regard to agriculture, it attached greater importance to its own political development.
A wrong diagnosis can be extremely dangerous for the future when major issues are at stake.
Let us beware of pressure from within to abandon the common agricultural policy.
A good reform requires moving towards eliminating export subsidies, and certainly not long-term support.
We must be vigilant in ensuring that industrial problems are not ignored, because it is the international division of labour that is at stake in the WTO, involving an enormous number of jobs.
We must beware of a certain naÃ¯ve optimism as regards the North-South divide.
Like many other speakers, I note the pairing off of the advocates of free trade and the major exporters of agricultural produce from the South.
I also believe that it would be suicidal for employment in Europe not to see that China, to be followed in future by others, is emerging with huge comparative advantages.
My second question is: what should we do?
The discussion that has been proposed is welcome but for the moment should we not also be thinking about initiatives to help the vast number of poor countries who genuinely need results now?
Should we not, therefore, include on the Doha Agenda reopening negotiations as soon as possible on some key issues, such as export subsidies, cotton, textiles, special and differentiated treatment and probably transparency too.
In the medium and long term, we must hold fast to multilateralism and undertake more detailed work on reforming the WTO, calling on the citizens to become involved and to participate.
I believe, and this is where the developing world activists are right, that if the WTO is to be consolidated, a new look must be cast at its foundations, in any event, those that involve a sense of responsibility.
The WTO is built for free trade and the trading of comparative advantages, but issues of legitimate protection are increasingly being raised.
We in the North do so by talking about patents, public health, the environment and the social clause and in the South they raise the issue by talking about access to non-reciprocal markets.
This is why, in my opinion, our 'liberalisation plus rules' line will never fully convince the European public, because it knows that these are rules favouring free trade.
We therefore want to see a world fair trade organisation, with rules for a fruitful mutual opening up of markets that will also entail achieving a balance between liberalisation and genuine protection.
In this context, some differentiation is necessary, given the enormous disparities between countries throughout the world. This is a political issue that has failed to find a satisfactory solution at the WTO.
On all of these issues, let us enter into open dialogue with Brazil, with the G21, with the G90 and also with the US public.
Could we not also redefine our bilateral and regional policies, which rely too heavily on the mantra 'Aid for Trade', whereas most countries say that they have other priorities, such as pre-sale production capacity and also being able to make use of international public assets.
Mr President, instead of looking backwards I would like to look forwards.
Commissioner Lamy, in our meeting this morning, I asked you what the status of your Seattle mandate was.
You replied that, as yet, you were not sure.
I would like to make the case as strongly as possible that the mandate given to you in 1999, even before the Seattle Ministerial - let alone the Doha and CancÃºn Ministerials - must now be null and void.
We cannot pretend, now that two out of three ministerials have collapsed, that we are dealing with business as usual.
In particular it seems that the EU must now accept the verdict of developing countries that they do not want negotiations on the Singapore issues.
Therefore we must drop not just two, but all four of those issues.
At the same time we need to go further in eliminating export subsidies and much further in responding to ACP and LDC concerns in particular.
The statement by Botswana on behalf of those groups said very clearly that the revised texts fell far short of their expectations.
We can debate the causes of the collapse at CancÃºn.
I suspect my own analysis will be rather different from many we have heard so far this afternoon, but what is clear is that collapse offers us an opportunity to start a root-and-branch transformation of the WTO.
What we need now is a full review, not just of the working procedures of the WTO, which you have rightly called medieval, but of its trade rules themselves, which I would call imperialist.
In many ways the rules of the WTO are not neutral ones that can be used defensively to protect the interests of the weakest players.
The rules are too often institutionalising the current system of global inequality.
Take the overriding principle, for example, of national treatment that effectively denies poorer countries the right to promote their own national industries and economies, a right that was indispensable to most richer countries and which they used with impunity in their own development processes.
It is clear that we need fair, multilaterally agreed rules to oversee and regulate trade in the interests of poverty eradication.
But whether the current WTO can actually deliver those outcomes is frankly much harder to believe.
If we are to rebuild confidence in the multilateral system, we have to expend much more political capital in making its rules and procedures genuinely fair and sustainable.
Can you tell me if you are prepared to do that?
Mr President, I share the views of the majority of the speakers here this afternoon that the collapse of the talks was a major blow, both to the WTO itself and to the global economy.
Without increased trade activity, global growth will slow down and global poverty will rise.
Clearly the current EU and indeed US markets could do with an output boost, but it is the developing countries which would really have benefited from a successful CancÃºn.
I believe that the WTO in its current structure and working practices is dead.
We need to breathe new life into the round.
That is for sure, but first we must put in place a more workable organisation that can deal with 148 members, many of whom do not have the technical expertise and resources to operate at full potential.
In this I am convinced that the EU must take the initiative.
It is clear from statements of the US trade representative, Bob Zoellick, that America intends to forge ahead on a bilateral path.
I urge the Commission to put in place immediately a cross-services task force so as to come up with concrete proposals for reforming the WTO.
I know that colleagues in Parliament are more than willing to contribute to such an exercise.
Each of the European institutions must take on its responsibility to get the message across to our WTO partners regarding the EU offer which remains on the table.
We in the EU put a lot on the table in the interests of developing countries in the area of agriculture, market access and so on.
It is particularly important to carry out this diplomatic and information activity with the so-called Group of 90, comprising the ACP, the African Union and LDCs.
In conclusion, it is imperative that the Doha development round gets back on track if there is to be any hope of lifting millions in the developing world out of poverty.
This can only happen if we seriously adjust the structures and procedures of the WTO.
Madam President, the WTO negotiations have broken down but we are not making too much of an issue out of this because we believe that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.
'Why?' and 'who gains from the talks breaking down?' are the two questions that must be asked following CancÃºn.
I agree that it is difficult to get 160 countries with very divergent interests to agree, but did the Union not commit a strategic error?
Did it not negotiate naively before the negotiations?
Should the Union have spoken with a single voice by giving the Commission an exclusive mandate regardless of the skill of the negotiators?
Would it not have been preferable and more effective to conclude appropriate agreements like the G21, for example, rather than aligning ourselves in advance with the United States on the issue of farming?
How, indeed, can we imagine that, in the period running up to the elections, President Bush would sacrifice his farmers and his agri-food industry?
There was therefore no rapprochement possible between North and South as was bitterly observed on the issue of cotton, a highly symbolic dossier.
The fact that the World Bank is telling African countries to produce on a massive scale and also to change crops is truly unacceptable.
The European Union, which did not hesitate to sacrifice its electors by forcing through the CAP reform in order, supposedly, to reach a position of strength at the negotiating table, is in a delicate position.
The USA is still helping out its farmers and is starting to sign bilateral agreements.
Is the Union willing to do the same and to freeze its reform of the CAP?
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Urso, Commissioners, CancÃºn was essentially a game of trade agreements.
If the WTO survives, this must remain the main focus of negotiations.
Essentially, however, a political game has been played, with the creation of an absurd situation - mentioned a number of times by Commissioner Lamy in the meetings with the European Parliament delegation - in that, at the beginning, the debate focused almost solely on agriculture, which accounts for only 20% of international trade.
This is, indeed, an absurd situation, for which we bear a large share of the responsibility.
CancÃºn was the scene of a propaganda game, and there is certainly no need to explain to the heirs of the Princes Metternich and Talleyrand the significance of propaganda in international politics.
We Europeans have given our 'opponents', if ever they have deserved that name, a wonderful opportunity for dispute and propaganda on a silver plate, where international public opinion is concerned.
It has been said that there were red lines in the field of agriculture, the abolition of - quite despicable - export subsidies across the board and a maximum ceiling for Green Box subsidies, subsidies which, in theory, should not distort the market.
It has been said that, rather than cross the red line, it was better for the negotiations to fail, and that is what happened.
The fact that an industrial power like the European Union is imposing these limits, these 'red lines', is one of the reasons why we are now lamenting a failure which affects the European Union much more than it affects the United States, for instance.
There is no time to explain why, in my view this is the case.
The very fact that the Commissioner for agriculture - and I am not trying to sleight Mr Fischler in any way - is here today, on a par with Commissioner Lamy, explaining what happened at CancÃºn, is a sign that something is wrong, of the absurd situation of Europe as regards agricultural policy.
That is not, of course, to say that European agricultural protectionism is not ultimately so very different from that of the United States.
Quite the opposite: it may be that, with the reform of European agricultural policy, we have succeeded in overtaking the United States; the Japanese are causing more harm than we are with rice.
We, however, are thinking of the interests of Europe.
The Members know that all the parliamentary delegations we were able to meet insisted on focusing on the agricultural issue.
They had their own reasons for doing so - to cover up the tariffs of nearly 90% on Indian fabric.
It may well be true, but how do we explain to these people that we want new investment rules?
We ask developing countries to impose competition rules and public procurement rules, and then we continue to subsidise meat, rice and other exports.
Then we could discuss Everything but Arms at length, Madam President.
We have postponed the definitive abolition of tariffs on rice, banana and sugar imports until 2010.
Is this all we can manage to offer the developing countries?
What is more, causing loss of interests ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, the failure of the mid-term review of the Doha round at CancÃºn was a defeat with regard to accelerating world economic growth.
It was also an undeserved defeat for us in the EU; but above all it was a defeat for the developing countries.
The atmosphere when the meeting started was cautiously optimistic.
The European Union and the United States of America had reached consensus on a joint bid to lower agricultural trade barriers and subsidies, and an agreement on the introduction of generic drugs to improve medical care in the developing countries had been made.
What, then, went wrong?
If we ignore the chairman's in my opinion hasty decision at the moment when everyone had prepared for at least 35 hours more of intensive negotiations, there are surely many reasons why it went wrong.
New as far as the Doha meeting was concerned was the appearance of the Group of 21 nations.
This group, as has already been said here, probably did not have only trade goals, but also aims relating to power politics, as, for example, its opposition to real or imagined US unilateralism.
Whilst these countries talked as if they were representing all underdeveloped countries, they themselves were not prepared to abandon the high trade barriers they had in respect of poorer countries.
Part of the problem over cotton is connected with this.
It is time we understood, on a more universal scale than just Europe, that the development of the less developed countries is starting to differentiate very greatly.
Moreover, it is worth asking what a developing country actually is.
Is India, taken as a whole, still one, or even China or Brazil?
Other developed countries should also follow the EU's example and conclude 'Everything But Arms' agreements, as we have done with 49 of the poorest countries.
We should also remember that the EU, in addition to being by far the biggest donor of development aid, buys, for example, 80% of Africa's agricultural exports.
In terms of its form, the meeting failed in its debate on the four Singapore issues.
Why, when each individual country can opt to be absent with regard to these?
Why, when it had been agreed at Doha that they would also be on the agenda?
It was mainly a matter of the timetable.
To what extent opposition to the liberalisation of the cotton trade was responsible for the meeting's failure remains a mystery, but it certainly played a part.
A large number of NGOs, as has been mentioned here, were happy the meeting failed.
Let us hope that the underdeveloped countries will never again get caught by them as they were at CancÃºn.
We have to move forward.
The EU and the Commissioners negotiating on its behalf have nothing to hide or be ashamed of.
The Commission did a good deal beforehand to ensure the success of the meeting, and furthermore used the room for negotiation it had during the meeting.
The EU's task must be on the one hand to endorse the WTO and speed up negotiations and on the other, and as a result, to further clarify to the underdeveloped countries the EU's position regarding trade policy, as they still do not seem to know what it is.
Madam President, Mrs Lucas was right when she said that this is not the time to look to the past, but rather we must look to the future under all circumstances.
It is true that, following the failure of CancÃºn, this is the right time to consider the dangers facing us now.
The first, and I am saying nothing new, is to dedicate ourselves to saving multilateralism within commercial relations.
We must be careful when we say that we must reform the World Trade Organisation.
We must say how we want to reform it, because we must not think of reforming the World Trade Organisation in such a way that it begins to function like its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which, at the end of the day, made decisions in accordance with the wishes of certain commercial giants, without taking account of the importance of other countries.
Also, when we say that 'we are going to reform the World Trade Organisation', are we as Europeans going to accept a reform in which the European Union has no right to veto, or is the United States going to accept that type of reform?
The World Trade Organisation therefore functions with all the problems we know about, but, at the end of the day, it is the best instrument we have for international trade.
Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of the birth of the Group of 21, which we wrongly believed was going to be dissolved like a sugar lump in water.
I do not believe that we should attack that Group of 21, but rather sit down with them, accepting what they are, a giant like us, which represents more than half the world's population and their specific weight must clearly not be underestimated.
Finally, we must act in a balanced and coherent fashion.
Commissioner Lamy is right when he tells us that it is one thing to make declarations and quite another to take decisions which affect thousands of millions of citizens.
It is true that we must reconcile solidarity with some of our least-favoured sectors, such as the rural population or certain types of production, with solidarity with the least favoured countries.
We cannot say that we are going to adopt one line while forgetting the other, because, until we are capable of finding that balance, it will be difficult for us to continue making progress.
Madam President, Commissioner, I shall not criticise either the Commission or the European Parliament.
I shall just say that I personally have become aware that something important has happened with the ultimate collapse of the WTO Conference in CancÃºn.
This need not, and must not, be the end for the WTO, but it means that the EU and the United States must adjust to a new situation.
Until now, we have in actual fact completely dominated as actors in the WTO but, by setting the agenda ourselves, we have given the developing countries the feeling of being excluded and of having been ridden roughshod over.
When we prepare ourselves - and we prepare ourselves quite well - we naturally do so because we want to give a good account of ourselves, but we have not given enough thought to what is best for the world.
The time when we could conduct this type of policy is now past.
We must realise that the world's most populous countries, such as China and India, and large producer countries, such as Brazil, are in the process of acquiring clear contours on the map of world trade, and the poorest developing countries are beginning to be noticed.
It is important for us to acquire a new map of world trade.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, CancÃºn showed, firstly, that it is quite simply unrealistic to demand that markets be opened up without taking into account the existence of serious social differences.
The WTO member states start from such widely divergent positions that having the same conditions for all does not promote justice but reinforces injustice, and thus takes us away from the declared objective of fair trade rather than bringing us closer to it.
Secondly, there are of course especially great differences between the industrialised and developing countries, but these blocs are far from homogeneous, any more than the European Union is a homogeneous edifice.
Knowing as we do how difficult it is to get results out of the European Union, we ought to sympathise with the incomparably greater difficulties faced by a community of 148 states.
Thirdly, when negotiating, we must always put ourselves in the position of the party with whom we are negotiating; that is to say, we must be prepared to make concessions to our weaker opposite numbers without expecting anything in return.
If, though, we conduct negotiations as if in a bazaar - 'you give me one thing, and I give you another', we should not be surprised when they fail.
Fourthly, we have to grasp the fact that the EU is only one of many regions in the world, and, in future, our decisions must take into account, to a much more marked degree, the effects they will have globally.
To put it in other words, we need the impact of our policies to be assessed in a preventive way.
The fifth thing that we learn from CancÃºn is that negotiations have to be conducted with more candour and transparency, enabling civil society as a whole to be involved in the whole process at the right time.
Is it not paradoxical that the WTO puts up fences to keep its critics out, while its alleged mission is to tear down trade barriers for the good of the world's population?
I too was in CancÃºn, and I think it quite utterly unacceptable that the representatives of governments, instead of seeking dialogue with the demonstrators, barred them from the venue where the negotiations were being held.
My sixth point is that the WTO needs a different organisational and decision-making structure, and should be restructured in such a way that multilateral agreements can be hammered out in a fairer and more transparent manner.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the failure that was CancÃºn imposes a duty on us, a duty to think clearly.
I believe that, despite the differences of opinion that exist in this House on who was responsible, and I must confess that I do not agree with those who blame the NGOs or the southern countries, we must clearly state that the structure is no longer the same as it was at Marrakech.
The players involved are no longer the same.
At the time, there were two blocs, which to some extent imposed their own timetables, set their own game rules and in any event were the dominant players.
We now have several players and Commissioner Lamy is right to say that there is no longer a North and a South.
There were two southern blocs at CancÃºn.
On the one side there was the group of the 21 and the group of the ACP and least developed countries and on the other, the United States and Europe: that already makes four major players and perhaps next time there will be even more.
We have clearly, therefore, moved beyond the time when two players dominated the game.
We must be aware of this fact and bear it in mind.
The second observation I wish to make is that, as several speakers have already said, the WTO is an institution that does not live up to our expectations of a multilateral trade body.
We do need multilateralism and I do not believe that anyone here is calling this concept into question, but it must be organised equitably, which cannot be said of the WTO.
We need a new framework and I believe that a UN-style framework would be more appropriate.
We need new ground rules, which are more democratic, more transparent and, above all, fairer.
Genuinely equitable trade rules must be implemented, in which trade is put at the service of human rights, social rights and environmental protection and not the other way around.
World trade rules must stop hampering States' action to achieve sustainable development, which last year's Johannesburg Summit considered to be the absolute number one priority. Instead, the WTO's action should help States achieve this aim.
Madam President, Commissioner, I admit that your frankness has disarmed me somewhat.
You have admitted your defeat and you have even acknowledged, through the voice of Commissioner Fischler, that you were wrong to pay in advance by sacrificing the common agricultural policy while the United States, with which you have forged an alliance which is, as it happens, somewhat unnatural, have not made any such sacrifice.
This defeat is that of the European institutions themselves.
You have committed errors not intuitu personae - others would doubtless have committed worse - but ex officio.
During your speech, you raised the right questions, with the exception of one: the relevance of granting an exclusive negotiating mandate to the Commission on behalf of the 25 countries.
The Group of 21 has 21 negotiators.
The Cairns Group, which used to have 17 countries, had 17 negotiators.
That is the question which needs to be asked and I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will also ask it seriously.
Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, obviously one might well regret an error of analysis in the power relationships at CancÃºn.
You spoke of two elephants; perhaps the third one escaped you.
Fifty years after Bandung, we have CancÃºn and the return of the non-aligned, even if they have multiplied.
More to the point, a mistake was made on 13 August 2003, with the EU-US agreement, which blurred the pro-development image which you wanted to create, especially with the 'Everything but arms' programme, and you gave the impression, to use your words, of a 'duopoly'.
It is certain that this preliminary agreement with the United States, which came in the wake of the 1992 Blair House agreement, put you and us in the same boat as the Texas cotton planters and their USD 3.5 billion subsidies, which are creating financial hardship for the 10 million small African planters.
Europe is certainly not responsible for this failure, however, if stopping the drift of ultraliberalism can indeed be called a failure.
During the election campaign, the American administration did not want an agreement any more than, in Seattle, the African countries could not accept the contempt of paragraph 27 of the final declaration, telling them to grow something other than cotton. You, on the other hand, you have made every sacrifice, you have sacrificed our farmers in advance, you have sacrificed two out of the four Singapore issues, you were even prepared to give them the shirt off our back, provided that the textile agreement was brought to a close, but they did not want our shirt in CancÃºn.
What is to be done, then?
Obviously we wait for the investiture of the new American president in January 2005.
What is to be done about the common agricultural policy (CAP)?
Good sense, justice, would want us to withdraw the rules on the CAP since it was the price to be paid for the CancÃºn goods which were not delivered.
What is to be done about cotton?
Do we sacrifice our 3% share of the world market or make the Africans a gift of what they wanted: a trust fund of USD 250 million per year organised by an international institution?
What is to be done at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)?
You say we have to change medieval procedures.
You could say that of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), you could say that of the UN, you could say that, moreover, of the European Commission itself.
Which means that the institutional question is much broader.
How in future can we legally reconcile, on the one hand, inescapable globalisation at economic, media and technological levels with, on the other hand, the equally inescapable and eternal perpetuity of the political nations which, for their part, have the decision-making powers?
Obviously, no one has the answer as to how to modify the WTO.
At all events, however, it needs to be sought in teleology, not theology, because there can be no doubt that the theology of the 'free-tradist' sect, the madrasas of Washington or Geneva which train the market fanatics, the Taliban of ultraliberalism, constitute between them an ideological error of global proportions. This is because the right aims, which will bring about the right solutions, are not ultraliberalism, privatisation or the market, but social justice, political justice and national justice.
This being so, Commissioner, we wish you good luck in your new office after June 2004, and I admit that I await with a little thrill of greedy curiosity to see where your golden parachute lands.
Madam President, Commissioners, honourable Members, I had prepared a speech, but everything has been said.
I shall start, Commissioners, Mr Lamy, by saying that, when there is a failure, someone is to blame.
I think that we are all to blame.
When we say we have to divide up the shirt and we do so badly, it is perhaps because we were ill-prepared.
But we also have to confine ourselves to our responsibilities.
I agree with what Mr van Velzen and Mr Suominen said.
First, I should like, nonetheless, to tell you that I am very happy with the agreement concluded before CancÃºn on generic medicines, even if it is a minor agreement for the developing countries.
I have a particular thought for this issue.
Secondly, having been present in Seattle and Doha, I shall say that it is true that negotiations can no longer continue to take place under such conditions.
Mr Lamy, you are right to say and, if it is true that you should leave as certain people have said, it is now time to say how negotiations should be conducted.
It is also true that we cannot, on the one hand, have demonstrations and, on the other hand, have people who want to negotiate and try to find solutions, especially for the poorest countries, within the framework of multilateral negotiations.
This multilateralism is important, but it is absolutely necessary to introduce more democracy into the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
This is an important point: in CancÃºn, I noted a lack of democracy at the level of the negotiating table and at the level of the general climate.
I even think that this is what worried me most at the end of my third participation in the negotiations.
We are being asked for transparency and clarification.
All those participating in the negotiations must be transparent about why they are there and whom they are representing.
The 25 Member States of the Community were represented by two people.
The Group of 21 was defended by certain NGOs which we had met in our offices in Brussels, and which had used a very different language then from the language they used in CancÃºn.
All that is true.
The boil perhaps needed to burst, but, above all, we must not leave.
Who is to blame, then, and who is not?
Above all, we must ask ourselves two additional questions, Mr Lamy. What are we going to do next, how are we going to work, how are we going to apply the 'peace clause' at the level of our work in the immediate future?
That is the question European farmers are asking themselves.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a similar position to Mr Daul, in that I too do not wish to repeat everything that has already been discussed, but I would like to say something about one comment made by the Italian Presidency.
I think you were right to raise the issue of whether we are not really still in the 'post-Seattle process'.
You put it so neatly: from Seattle, via Doha, to CancÃºn.
I think there is a lot in that.
We had a situation in Seattle in which civil society tried, as part of anti-globalisation campaigns, to ask questions that we as a political institution have perhaps not always taken seriously enough or adequately addressed.
That process has continued, and it has led to a general feeling of insecurity, insecurity not just limited to civil society but that has also reached far into the political institutions and also into many societies and states.
We felt the same thing once again in CancÃºn in relation to the African states involved, and that feeling has even to some extent reached the G21 countries, who of course also attempted to mount a kind of revolt and to break this monopoly of power between Europe and the United States and perhaps also other nations.
In view of that it may perhaps make very good sense for us to analyse further what actually happened and whether we are creating a reasonable basis for our new strategy.
I do not share the self-pity that I rather sense here in this Chamber, that feeling that we are to blame for so much.
I would like to congratulate the Commissioners.
I think that their strategy was the right one and that we should not be heaping all the blame onto our own shoulders because it failed.
I also believe that we should keep our options open.
I certainly do not think that we should limit ourselves to the multilateral agenda, and those Members who know me will be aware of that.
Sometimes it is a good thing to have several options, because you then have some scope for juggling your options.
Sometimes one option is right and at other times a different one is.
I am therefore in favour of keeping both options open.
Furthermore, I hope that my fellow Member from Austria, Mr Paul RÃŒbig, will address the House later.
Unfortunately I have no more time left.
Madam President, the failure in CancÃºn is a snub inflicted by the countries of the South on the imperial powers of the United States and the European Union.
The latter have tried, once again, to impose their rather cynical logic, which consists of maintaining protectionism for their own agriculture and obtaining free access for their industries the world over.
The suicide of the leader of the Korean peasants symbolises in a tragic manner the despair of millions of men and women dishonoured by this fool's bargain.
Under very difficult conditions, the demonstrators in CancÃºn affirmed their refusal of the rules of the WTO which impoverish them more and more each day.
This failure on the part of the WTO will not suffice to change the systems in order, at long last, to satisfy fundamental needs.
Nonetheless, it constitutes real encouragement for the rejected of the planet - and they are numerous - to develop their philosophy and fight towards an ambitious objective: to create, at long last, a fair, mutually supportive world.
Specifically, today, Mr Lamy, it is necessary to stop demanding, in our name moreover, the liberalisation of 102 of their services.
On the contrary, it is time today to cancel the debt of the countries of the South.
That could, at long last, open up the possibility of real development for the developing countries.
Madam President, Commissioners, Mr President, honourable Members, CancÃºn was a failure just like Seattle.
Undoubtedly, this round of negotiations was doomed to failure.
Who was to blame?
The right - the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party - are convinced and say that it was the others, the NGOs, the Group of 21.
We say it was probably the WTO itself and us as well, who had already negotiated with the United States.
Without doubt, we have to admit that the fall is harder for us, the European Union, since you, Commissioners, and you, our leaders, were convinced that we had planned everything for this round to succeed.
Everything had been planned, certainly, except the explosion of the Cairns Group, which we had rather sought to neutralise.
Everything, except the more coherent emergence, whatever you might say, of the Group of 21, which set itself up as the defender of the developing countries, even if the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) and the least advanced countries (LACs) are not quite the same thing.
We, the North, need to convince the South, for example on the agricultural question, that we really are more equitable.
The CAP has been broadly revised, perhaps a little too much, in order to make it more 'sexy' in the eyes of the WTO.
But the countries of the South, for their part, continue to have a negative perception of all agricultural subsidies, even those which appear to us to be the most virtuous.
How can we make countries like the countries of Africa understand our point of view, when their food crops have been ruined for years by the dumping effects of European Union export subsidies (the subsidies which made battery hens from Brittany cheaper to buy than local chickens in Dakar market)?
The CAP, by subsidising the export prices of cereals, meat or sugar, has inundated the countries of the South for a long time.
How, then, are we to convince them today of the merits of our re-orientations, without abolishing export subsidies?
How are we to convince them when, on the crucial question of cotton for Africa, we have appeared to be the unconditional supporters of American derision, via paragraph 27, which postpones any reform in this sector indefinitely?
Until we find a way of making the countries of the South understand what the second pillar of agriculture and the social, environmental and food security rules represent, until we allow them to adopt the same rules to protect their rural populations, we shall not rediscover a situation which allows them to understand us.
It is this democratic reform that we need to maintain and debate with them.
It is by redefining the WTO in rules of this type that we are engaging not only in fair trade but also in democracy.
Madam President, the failure of the ministerial conference in CancÃºn on 14 September has made many people fear that the first victim will be the multilateral approach to international trade negotiations.
That would be a pity.
We are in fact convinced that world trade and international life in general must be based on simple multilateral rules respected by everyone, applied by transparent international organisations.
Which rules, though?
That is the whole problem, because since 1995 and the Marrakech agreements, the WTO has been living by a major underlying principle: the systematic opening of the markets and the doctrine of global free trade which are supposed to give everyone, in all circumstances, maximum profit.
It is this rule, contested by more and more countries, which has just exploded in CancÃºn and we must be aware of this if we want to reconstruct something.
In order to reconstruct, we would need to keep the rule of free trade, of course, but complement it with another rule: that of the sovereignty of each national democracy or each preferential trade zone, which must be free to modulate trade to its needs, especially when it comes to agriculture.
Now we need to learn the lessons from the failure of CancÃºn and admit the specificity of these questions, which should doubtless even be taken away from the WTO and dealt with by a specific international organisation.
At all events, the fundamental rules should be the right of each country or each region to maintain its agricultural model, its food independence and the health of its population.
This implies two twin demands.
First, we have to accept the total abolition in the long term of agricultural export subsidies.
Let us not hide our face, let us recognise it frankly, it is a moral necessity.
Then, we have to accept equally frankly the legitimacy of the Community preference in the form of an import levy or internal aid when it is needed to achieve the social objectives that we have democratically set ourselves.
These two simultaneous frank acceptances are necessary if we want to start again now on the right foot, but they also imply the need for an in-depth review of the internal reform of European agricultural policy, which was prepared too quickly in the run up to CancÃºn.
This reform should now be the subject of new reflection and should be reoriented in line with the lessons we have learned from this failure.
Madam President, I declare an interest as a farmer receiving agricultural subsidies.
But today I specifically want to speak in defence of the weaker developing countries, particularly those in the ACP.
To me, CancÃºn should have been the culmination of months of serious work in committee, thrashing out answers to the doubts and fears of the developing world.
To expect to sit down with 148 countries and reach any conclusion is beyond any possibility, but I believe that CancÃºn was a watershed.
The days of powerful blocs such as the European Union and the USA sitting in smoke-filled rooms, carving up the spoils and throwing a few crumbs to the rest of the world, have long since gone.
Developing countries have realised that there is strength in numbers and power in using that strength.
But this is not just a matter of the developing and the developed world.
There are different strata in both groupings.
Economically, Asia, the Far East and Latin America are light-years away from the ACP countries.
Countries' trade potential will develop at different speeds.
Successes for the future depend on flexibility of timing.
Opt-outs were offered as essential ingredients at CancÃºn and must be part of any future plan.
Capacity to enact what has been agreed is a key factor.
The ACP is, at this moment, negotiating a Cotonou partnership agreement on trade to be agreed by 2008.
Economic partnership agreements and regional economic partnership agreements are the eventual aim of those negotiations.
Most of those countries are not ready for reciprocal trade agreements or rules on competition; but regional integration would give them strength in a global world and increase south/south trade.
The ACP countries could not cope with Cotonou and CancÃºn at the same time.
For them CancÃºn was a step too far, too soon.
Now we must have a complete reassessment of procedures.
Madam President, I should like to say at the outset that I agree with those who have said that we have to look to the future.
However, what others have said here today, that we must take stock of what happened, is equally important.
My first point is that we should not waver in our continuing commitment to multilateral trade rules.
We arrived in CancÃºn with an extremely overloaded agenda: ministers had enormous difficulty grappling with too many complex, unresolved issues.
The process, therefore, is clearly unsustainable.
The whole process of those few days was virtually wasted until Saturday when the revised text appeared, to the consternation of developing countries.
There was a real sense when we arrived in CancÃºn - as confirmed by this revised text - that the vision, promise and ambition of Doha was being seriously threatened, because matters of substance on agriculture, cotton and the new issues, which are important to developing countries, simply were not being addressed.
We have to acknowledge very clearly what the perception of developing countries is.
It is not good enough to come here and say that the developing countries were asking for too much.
They should be insulted by the implication that NGOs were able to manipulate and manage their opinions in the way that some have said.
In view of the proximity of the December date for the meeting in Geneva, I would like to ask, Commissioner, what kind of bridge-building and confidence-building you are engaged in at this time - having just had a moment to catch your breath after CancÃºn - to try to ensure that we have some success there?
Finally, on the Singapore issues: are you aware, Commissioner, that on Thursday the DTI Minister in the UK said that she would be seeking a meeting with you on the Singapore issues to ensure that you stick to the position that was taken in CancÃºn and that we will no longer press for negotiations at the WTO on investment and competition?
Are you aware that the British Minister said this in the House of Commons and do you expect your mandates to change on the basis of this kind of statement?
Madam President, the WTO is the main imperialist mechanism which imposes the terms of the multinationals and the full liberalisation and opening of the markets on international trade. The result is the widening of the gap between rich and poor, despite the growth in international trade.
The failure of CancÃºn demonstrates that the WTO cannot play this role unimpeded, which is, without doubt, a good thing.
Resistance is growing both on the streets and in the negotiating chambers.
New players are appearing and claiming a place in the game.
Intra-capitalist oppositions are becoming more acute.
The solution does not lie in reforms in one direction or another, it needs to get to the very foundations of the WTO.
The European Union went to CancÃºn having sacrificed the interests of small and medium-sized farmers.
It is clear from the interview with Mr Lamy that he intends to sacrifice even more and I am waiting for an answer to the question of how far he will go.
With cotton, for example, where the European Union imports 70% of its requirements, will we reach the point at which we import 100% and wipe out the cotton industry in Greece, Spain and Portugal?
Madam President, unlike in the past, agriculture was not the reason why these negotiations failed.
In my view, their failure was due to the maximalist stance of the Group of 21, which came to the negotiating table with questions which went beyond the Doha Agenda.
The most striking of these was the demand for the phasing-out of the domestic aid believed to cause the most distortion, namely the blue and amber boxes.
For the first time, the European Union adopted an assertive stance, with which it seemed rather comfortable. This was due to the CAP reform it has carried out, and the agreement it has concluded with the United States of America.
Sadly, though, the Group of 21 did not recognise the European Union's efforts to adapt its agricultural policy. This group still insists on talking as if the CAP had not changed in the last ten years.
The CAP has changed radically in that time, but they still talk as if the European Union were a protectionist wall, ignoring the fact that the EU is the largest importer of agricultural produce in the world today.
Perhaps the group of African countries which, perhaps legitimately, dug in their heels to defend cotton, had forgotten that the European Union as a bloc has tried harder than anyone to support developing countries. Today's EU market, moreover, takes in 85% of those countries' agricultural exports.
Furthermore, the voices of the world's poorest countries, which enjoy completely free access to our markets as a result of the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, were not even heard. This was because they were completely drowned out by countries which also claim to be underdeveloped but whose interests are fundamentally different from, or even opposed to, the interests of these poorest countries.
We must not, I feel, be masochistic.
The European Union took a very reasonable stance in these negotiations and behaved generously towards less-developed countries.
It could go further, of course.
I can say in all conscience, however, that if everyone had adopted the same flexible, responsible stance as the European Union there, an agreement would have been reached.
This debate is dragging on.
I therefore want to ask Mr Imbeni and the speakers following him on the list of speakers to excuse me, because I must now give the floor to Commissioner Lamy.
At the end of the debate, Commissioner Fischler will also be given the floor.
Madam President, my colleague Mr Franz Fischler will join us and reply to those of you whom I shall not have the opportunity to hear.
I have two general comments to make, before moving on to a number of more specific points in response to your observations.
My first general comment is this: I would wish, insofar as it is possible, that we could remove a misunderstanding that I sense between us here and there when we talk of the World Trade Organisation.
The World Trade Organisation is still an organisation in which concessions representing additional access to certain markets are negotiated, as well as rules intended to ensure that trade is developed for the benefit of the general interest.
The harsh reality is that it is a body in which we conduct negotiations.
We negotiate interests there, even if we ascribe greater value to them than others, given our highly European idealism.
Having said which, we must not forget this realism if the discussion is to progress between us.
No naÃ¯ve optimism, I heard Mr Philippe Herzog say.
I do not take that as a lesson, but as a reminder of reality.
If it is true for the others, it is therefore true for us.
My second general comment is as follows: many of you insisted on the geopolitical dimension which came to take precedence, in CancÃºn, over the strictly commercial dimension of the negotiations.
I agree with you. Perhaps this dimension did partly escape us at some moment or other during preparations for CancÃºn.
Any suggestions in this connection on your part will be welcome next time.
My third and final general comment: there is, in these commercial affairs, a South-South dimension which is essential and which we should not forget, even if, on this subject too, given our well-known tropisms, what interests us most is the North-South dimension.
It is essential for developing countries to open up their markets and accept a number of rules.
Everyone knows that this is a sine qua non and that the opening of the markets and the acceptance of rules by the North is not enough, not by a long chalk.
I wish that this reality were highlighted from time to time by those of you who, rightly, have a particular interest in the position of developing countries.
I would like to make a few more specific comments before allowing the debate to continue.
First of all, concerning the reform of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), you are right. We need to rethink a certain number of rules and mechanisms; we need to try and strengthen cooperation between the WTO and the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other organisations in the UN family.
I agree on this issue, and we are going to think about it.
In addition, we need to realise that, on this road, which is without doubt the one that we Europeans intuitively wish to take, we risk finding ourselves very much alone at times, because I cannot see many developing countries taking the same route.
As for the United States' interest in better coherence in terms of what we refer to between ourselves as international governance, we know that that is not necessarily their natural inclination.
Therefore, we agree to think about it, but bearing in mind that other partners will have to join us on this road and, for that, we need to recruit.
What are the next stages, you asked several times?
I think it is too early to say.
First, because we need to take time for an in-depth analysis of what happened.
I think that the debate today will have contributed to this and I thank you for that on behalf of the Commission.
Then, because we also need to take time for contacts between one side and another, contacts which cannot always be forged publicly in this type of negotiation, especially with our friends from the developing countries.
We are therefore going to do all this without haste.
Several options will need to be considered.
We in the Commission shall do so as a College, and we shall then see whether or not the Commission suggests a change to its mandate, should these negotiations be relaunched.
I heard a great many expressions of support, for which I thank you because, for both Mr Franz Fischler and myself, this support is even more precious in bad times than in good.
I also heard a number of criticisms to which I shall try to respond very quickly.
Mrs Lucas reproached me both for not having moved enough on the Singapore issues and for not having moved on export subsidies.
On export subsidies, Mrs Lucas, I am embarrassed to tell you that this is completely untrue.
When Mr Franz Fischler and I table a proposal which says that we are ready to go down as far as zero for export subsidies for products which interest developing countries, do not tell me that the European Union did not move.
As for the Singapore issues, you maintained that investment and competition were overloading the boat and this is also your opinion on the issues linked to the transparency of commercial transactions, which comes as a surprise to me, because I thought that transparency was one of the principles to which your group was very attached.
Concerning, therefore, your argument which consists of saying that we have to get rid of these two issues linked to transparency because the developing countries want nothing of it, I should like you to tell me if that also applies to the environment and to the social clauses which are issues of which the developing countries also want to hear nothing.
Mrs Auroi, I cannot let you say, without reacting, that the European Union supported the American position on cotton.
If this is the information at your disposal, I prefer to correct it immediately.
I said at a public session, in plenary, at CancÃºn, what we think of this famous paragraph 27 and I would be obliged if you would please correct your information.
As for the sentiment expressed by several of you to the effect that the Union's positions are not sufficiently known in certain parts of our great planet, I have taken careful note of this observation.
I also agree with it.
Please just be aware that our resources for improving this situation are not unlimited and that we will doubtless be able to talk about this again when the annual budgetary debate takes shape.
To close, I shall reply to a fairly accurate observation by Mr Martinez.
I thank him for his words on parachutes.
I recognise that, when it comes to parachuting, he knows what he is talking about.
On a more serious note, he reproaches me for having paid in advance on agriculture and for not having been paid in return.
Mr Franz Fischler will, if necessary, explain to you that the opposite is true, Mr Martinez: you are on the wrong side of the counter.
It is true that we are carrying out our reforms of the common agricultural policy for our own reasons and that, for the same price, in return for good negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, we can obtain commitments from the Americans in sectors equivalent to ours.
That is one of the reasons why, for European farmers, the failure of CancÃºn is not good news either.
I shall finish there in order to allow the debate to continue.
As the President mentioned, my colleague, Mr Fischler, will reply to you at the end of the debate.
Madam President, I get the impression that the individual trees that make up the many aspects of the failure of CancÃºn prevent us from focusing more closely on the wood.
The wood is the same as that which caused Seattle to break down almost four years ago, and it has a name and a surname: it is called a huge inequality between rich and poor countries, and the absence of an agreed strategy to reduce that inequality, a strategy made up of timeframes, policies, programmes, figures and amounts.
Clearly, this strategy forms part of neither Bush's unilateralism - it is true that there is a close link between Iraq and CancÃºn - nor any of the bilateral agreements.
Genuine multilateralism is the only correct method, but that is where our limitations lay in the preparations for CancÃºn.
That was one of the weaker areas of the Presidency and the Council's work.
Although he is not listening to me, I would like to say to Mr Urso that I appreciated his frank reasoning and also much of his analysis.
What, however, did we do to prepare for CancÃºn?
While President Bush was on the phone to President Lula and the Indian Prime Minister, what were we doing?
This was a weaker area of the Commission and Parliament's work too.
According to Commissioner Lamy's forecasts - backed by most of the Members of the European Parliament - the famous G-17 alliance, which then became G-21 and G-24, was to be primarily tactical, but, for mainly political reasons, that was not the case, and it will not be the case in future either.
Madam President, I would have preferred to wait a little before voting on the documents in this Chamber.
Indeed, tomorrow, we are going to vote on a rather disappointing document which will not answer the question 'Why did CancÃºn fail?' and will not provide guidelines on the direction we should take in future.
I would like to end by saying to Commissioner Lamy that, although the WTO is the negotiating forum, it is not on the Moon or on Mars. It is here, and the backdrop to the negotiations is precisely this huge inequality which exists and which characterises life on this Earth in our time.
Madam President, I would like to remind you of three main lessons we should learn from events in CancÃºn.
Firstly, the positions of the European Union and the United States contributed to this conference's failure to find solutions which might have given developing countries a fair deal.
The EU and US positions ignore the need for debt relief for the least-developed countries, and ignore the problems faced by workers and by micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises within Europe itself, in sectors such as textiles, clothing, footwear and agriculture.
Secondly, the workings of international institutions must become more democratic. New, fair and democratic rules must be laid down, giving hope to the poor and enabling effective sustainable development.
Thirdly, however, I would also like to remind you of the major popular demonstrations in CancÃºn and, to a degree, all over the world, protesting against the injustice of globalisation and demanding new, fairer, and more democratic rules.
Madam President, Commissioner, we have indeed all lost out as a result of the failure at CancÃºn. Paradoxically, the least-developed countries are set to suffer most, when they should have been the main beneficiaries of the Development Round.
Economic growth at global level has also been negatively affected. This is not only because a reduction of duties and the elimination of other barriers to trade benefits economic growth by making trade exchanges easier.
It is also because success at CancÃºn would have sent out a very positive signal, one that would have helped revitalise the global economy. There is also likely to be a negative impact on the multilateral trading system.
I am convinced there is no need to deviate from the course followed to date.
Nonetheless, it is imperative to overcome the stalemate the Development Round finds itself in following CancÃºn. Work on the basis of the agreements previously reached must resume at the earliest opportunity.
As has already been stated, it is essential to undertake an in-depth study of the working procedures of the WTO and its organisational structure. The reasons for the failure at CancÃºn must be investigated too.
Commissioner, I venture to suggest a further area for consideration by you, namely the need to reformulate the development of the potential of the least-developed countries.
By this I mean more than the need to increase the budget allocation for the purpose, though that is certainly required also. What I have in mind is the need to establish how best to help weaker countries to improve their negotiating capacity, and how best to empower them to take decisions for themselves, and to do so in full awareness of the facts.
This would also ensure they were not taken advantage of.
Regrettably, this does seem to have been the case in the past.
Madam President, I believe the outcome of this consideration and the ensuing decisions will determine whether Doha will indeed prove a turning point, even though the next stage of the journey will be longer than anticipated.
It will also determine the future of the multilateral trading system.
Madam President, the negotiations in CancÃºn should have been an opportunity to take a first step towards fairer trade.
However, they were scuppered.
The developing countries reversed the traditional power relations within the WTO.
This is an essential point to consider politically.
But who will really benefit from this failure?
I note, for my part, that the developing countries have not gained anything specific in the application of the demands which they put on the Doha agenda.
I imagine, like many here, that the United States is going to try and reinforce bilateralism for its own good, and I wonder how we Europeans are going to face the intensification of the trade war which threatens to ensue.
On balance, this failure appears harmful, at least in the short term.
In the public's eyes, however, it has had the effect of raising more than ever the question of adjusting the balance between the North and the South.
This is the overall problem to which we must now try and find an answer.
We need to see how to respond to it and with whom.
This question is truly important because, for example, the interests of all the developing countries are not identical and their options with respect to the WTO do not yet appear to be very homogenous.
In this context, which partner, which group can we count on in order to elaborate and engage in a strategy to relaunch the negotiations and reform the WTO?
Elsewhere, and on another level, we have, of course, understood the Group of 21's intention to combat external and internal public subsidies in the agricultural sector.
Should we not fear that some countries, Commissioner, will seize the opportunity of the end of the peace clause to launch a legal attack on our CAP, in order to achieve their objectives without needing to honour any politically negotiated guarantees in return?
However things stand after CancÃºn, the answers appear to be less obvious than the questions.
Madam President, I would first like to thank the Commission's very professional negotiating team, Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Lamy, because they really did everything in their power to make the conference a success.
Perhaps in future we ought to bring in a rule that says anyone who walks out of the negotiations has given their approval.
We were expecting tough, rigorous negotiation, but we lost our partners along the way.
In other words, the poor will remain poor and the rich will remain rich.
That is not something for us to be happy about.
Mrs Lucas said earlier that poorer countries should have the right to promote their own national industries.
Does she mean by that monopolistic companies owned by a handful of ministers who are worried that competition rules and investment protection agreements will put their own assets at risk?
It might be helpful here to involve national members of parliament, opposition members, somewhat more closely, so that there can be a genuine debate in the least developed countries as well about who is to be wealthy and who is to live in total poverty.
A few wealthy individuals compared with millions living in hunger.
We should therefore make every effort to encourage small- and medium-sized enterprises, family companies, in these countries, to stimulate competition, and to promote well-being - and I do not mean just for a handful of people who benefit from the existence of monopolies.
That is why I believe that the Parliamentary Conference is so important, and we as Europeans should be in the vanguard here, to ensure that there is an objective and transparent debate not only here in Europe, but also and above all in the world's poorest countries.
They urgently need a debate of that kind.
There is one more issue I would like to focus on: what will happen when the ''peace clause'' expires?
Will we be faced with another war, a world trade war in which the poor will become even poorer?
Madam President, Commissioner, I think that the Union should learn the lessons of this failure in CancÃºn, in order to avoid making the same mistakes in the future, and should rethink its strategy in order to prepare the indispensable initiatives for relaunching multilateralism.
First, with regard to the emergence of these new groups of developing countries, I think that President Prodi was right, in Bologna last week, to stress that the nature of G21 and the will to make a political affirmation which it expressed were underestimated and misunderstood.
I think that to seek to divide it or to set other developing countries against this group was wrong.
It was useless and it diverted us from the indispensable political dialogue and trust which we needed to try and re-forge with it.
Of course, the emergence of these groups, such as the subsequent G90, will make discussions and negotiations more difficult for us within the WTO.
This is a challenge for the European Union, but it is also the pledge of a fairer trade system which responds better to the concerns of all the continents, especially of those who have not so far been the winners from the establishment of the WTO.
Secondly, on the Singapore issues.
I think that the negotiations were already fairly complicated on agriculture and the other questions which come under the jurisdiction of the WTO.
There was also the outstanding balance of the commitments which were made in Doha and not respected, especially the deadlines which were not respected, not to mention the issues which we knew the majority of developing countries did not want.
This was too classic a bargaining approach between defensive and offensive issues which did not match the situation and demonstrated, here too, a poor understanding of the deep-seated refusal to deal with these Singapore issues.
I think that, if we want to save multilateralism today, it is only conceivable if we propose an in-depth reform, not only of the working of the WTO - this Parliament has made proposals for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur - but also of its rules, of its priorities and of its doctrines, as previous speakers said.
I think that we have to reinsert the commercial rules, in order for them to be better accepted by everyone as a whole, into a concept of world governance.
Without doubt we need to replace the WTO in the system of the United Nations, because what Commissioner Prodi said earlier about relations with the other agencies comes down to that, perhaps under the control of an 'economic and social security council', as proposed by the former president of the Commission, Jacques Delors.
Madam President, Commissioner, the Dakota Indians have a wise saying: 'when you discover that you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount'.
Things have not yet got quite that bad with the WTO, but what happened in CancÃºn is certainly a cause for concern.
I too regard abandoning the negotiations more as a pyrrhic victory for the developing countries than as a success.
Another interesting point here is the suggestion that the negotiations foundered on the rock of agricultural issues.
How could that have been the case, though, when there were never to be any negotiations in the form of an official agriculture round?
I too regard the EU proposal on agriculture as totally acceptable, even if many developing countries were looking for something more.
It was still an excellent proposal.
So what role did the United States play?
It suited President Bush very well that there were no negotiations at all on agriculture, because reality would then have dawned on many countries.
They would have then realised just who was putting the brakes on and that would have no doubt somewhat irritated the 'coalition of the willing' and those dependent on it.
Mexico accordingly had to break off negotiations before they had even started, and the United States is also more interested in bilateral treaties than multilateral ones.
I have one more thing to say, however, about those who believe that they now need to mount a campaign against the NGOs.
Firstly, they greatly overestimate the NGOs' power, and, secondly, they demonstrate what they ultimately think about participation by some areas of civil society.
My advice to them is to close this particular can of worms before it leads to their own downfall.
. (IT) Madam President, I will just say a few words, first and foremost to thank the European Parliament for the contribution it has made today.
Thirty-one speeches underline the importance this institution - the greatest representative institution of the European Union - attaches to the principle of multilateralism which must govern our work.
You have stated, reiterated and stressed the need to save and reinvigorate multilateralism, and, at the same time, many of you have stressed how important it is to launch a WTO reform process, in which the need for recognition of the new players must on no account be disregarded, to this end.
Of course, we cannot go back to the old GATT mechanisms; we need to move forwards, recognising, as I said, that the world is now, I am glad to say, multipolar, and this is true of both northern and southern hemispheres, as can be seen, not least, from the creation of the G-21 - with which we must cooperate - made up chiefly of developing countries which are already reaping the benefits of globalisation and which have, therefore, become strong competitors and are claiming their rightful place - China and Brazil, for example - while there is a world in the south - the ACP and African States - which, as yet, are not benefiting from globalisation but, if anything, merely suffering the consequences.

Thus, this threefold need to save multilateralism, reform the WTO and recognise new players should presumably prompt us to call for a process to be launched which can then lead to the creation of some intermediary bodies in between the Secretariat and the Assembly, in which this new representation can, at last, establish common ground between players who represent geographical, political, cultural, social and economic areas which are similar but different, so that they can create a high-level forum where issues can be resolved before they reach that assembly which really did seem in CancÃºn to be a veritable cacophony of languages and positions.
Another important aspect which has been stressed concerns the issue of communication - a wholly European problem.
Somebody pointed out that the non-governmental organisations played a dual, perhaps ambiguous role, changing between the language spoken in Brussels or Strasbourg and the, at times, loud shouting at CancÃºn, and that, at the same time, the European Union and the Commission had difficulty in putting across how much Europe has done over these 22 months and how much it does every day for the weakest of the weak.
In this connection, by way of example, I believe the Commission took two press attachÃ©s to CancÃºn, whereas a single non-governmental organisation had at least 14.
There is therefore a communication problem, and there may also be some linguistic confusion, which we must clear up if we are to do justice to the remarkable strength of European civil society, which has to express itself first and foremost - although not solely - through its representative organs.
Lastly, you ask whether it is necessary to change the mandate or make it more flexible.
I believe it is our duty to take your comments to the European Council, particularly in preparation for and in the wake of our appointment on 15 December, in which we may succeed in gaining a better insight into the impact of this failure on the other players too, including those who, perhaps unwittingly, have rejoiced rather too soon at this failure.
I believe that we should discuss this in the coming months in order to discover whether more flexibility is needed on the Singapore issues - as requested by some - more flexibility on social and environmental issues and more flexibility on agricultural policy too.
Lastly, I believe, with due regard for the time limits, that your contribution on this matter will be important, not to say decisive.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you all for your contributions to this debate, which has been a very important one.
In my response I would like to concentrate on a few points that I think need to be explored further and also clarified somewhat.
Firstly, one of the issues being debated was whether a multilateral approach or bilateral agreements should have priority.
I do not think there is any alternative.
There is no better approach than the multilateral one, and we need to adhere to that.
Bilateral agreements can of course sometimes be helpful, but they should not be a substitute for a multilateral approach.
Furthermore, no one should deceive themselves into thinking that only multilateral negotiations are difficult.
Many bilateral agreements can also be hard to achieve, for example agreements with the Mercosur countries or many others besides.
I also believe that it would be a mistake if by precipitately switching to bilateral negotiations we fell into the trap of thinking that those opened up the way to a kind of win-win situation.
By that I mean imagining that you can take home what you have won in bilateral negotiations and then be well placed to make further massive demands when it comes to multilateral negotiations.
I think some caution is called for here from a European point of view.
Nevertheless, we should have direct discussions and direct negotiations on a bilateral basis with many individual states that are WTO members so that they understand our stance towards them in multilateral negotiations.
My second point is this: I very much believe that it was the right thing to reform the common agricultural policy.
We made those reforms ourselves - and I am pleased to remind you about that here, because we had that very debate here in this Chamber.
We said that European society was demanding reforms, and that was why we needed them.
We cannot come along now and say that we were only pursuing our project to make Europe's agriculture and European agricultural policy more sustainable, for example, because we needed an argument to succeed in international negotiations.
That really would be putting the cart before the horse.
This did of course give us a certainly flexibility in international negotiations, but it goes without saying that we should always carry out our internal reforms first, and then base our mandate for negotiations on that.
Or do you really believe that this House would be willing to give the Commission a negotiating mandate that goes beyond our own existing common policies?
That is inconceivable, it would never work, and we should not therefore have any such illusions.
What we cannot tolerate, however, is an attempt to simply 'write off' the contribution we are making by virtue of our own reforms, so that for example commitments to make reductions are not based on the amount we agreed last time, during the Uruguay Round, which was taken as the starting point at that time, but that instead any competition-distorting support measures we are currently implementing are treated as the baseline.
That would be unfair to us and that is something we also need to make clear.
My third point is that the NGOs have played a major part in this debate.
We should not make the mistake of acting now as if the NGOs have not behaved properly and cut off their financial support or whatever.
I think that would be nonsensical.
What we must do, however, is to seek a dialogue with the NGOs.
We need to deal with them and with the arguments they put forward.
This is pretty important, when I think, for example, how much the position of the same NGO may vary depending on whether you are talking to the department responsible for development policy or the department for environmental policy.
You cannot just do what many NGOs have done and say that Europe's agricultural sector must become environmentally friendly and we must have a budget for agri-environmental measures.
Because if we do that you cannot come along afterwards and say that any form whatsoever of agricultural aid is undesirable!
That is inconsistent, and we need to have a more meaningful debate here.
This would also enable us to reduce mistrust towards the developing countries, which sometimes get the feeling that the complexity of the negotiations and the difficulties involved have been designed to make access more difficult for those who have not already been taking part in these negotiations for years.
We need to dismantle the barriers here.
First and foremost, we should try to get back to the facts.
We should involve independent organisations such as the OECD more closely so as to achieve a more objective debate.
As they say in the world of agriculture, you can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.
There also needs to be a willingness to go into the arguments and to enter into a real dialogue.
That is the only way for us to make progress.
As far as the peace clause is concerned, let me remind you that it expires at the end of the year in any case.
Although this does not mean that the whole WTO agricultural edifice will come tumbling down, there is a possibility that the way we in Europe have implemented our Uruguay Round commitments will come under fire.
I would also like to sound a warning note: some states see this as an opportunity to set up a variety of panels.
That would be another means of undermining the actual WTO process.
We therefore need to consider all this very carefully.
Lastly, one thing that we must achieve is to get over more effectively our basic philosophy about the purpose of the WTO negotiations.
The point of negotiating is that there has to be some middle ground that the various parties can move towards.
It does not mean moving towards an extreme position.
If you do not take that principle into account properly when preparing for negotiations, the risk of failure in the future will remain fairly high.
For that reason my advice - if we are not to shelve things but draw the necessary conclusions now - is that we should carry out a careful analysis and debate matters, and then reach a decision in as consensual way as possible about what the next steps should be.
That should enable us to get everything back on track again, as it were.
Following this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The developing countries are organising and asserting themselves.
The main lesson of CancÃºn is linked to the rising power of the Southern 'bloc'.
The poor countries have had enough of putting up with the arrogance of the world trade giants, the United States and the European Union.
Even though Mr Pascal Lamy is doing his best to make believe that the failure of the conference is, first and foremost, detrimental to the poor countries, the fact remains that - for lack of the WTO fortress - a protectorate has fallen.
We have to get away from the cynicism of the 'tit for tat' logic which consists of imposing on the South the profligacy of all-out liberalisation of their most vital sectors, while its people are struggling to survive.
The Union and the Member States should construct new relations with the South, not despoil it.
Europe should refuse to toe the United States' line, by leaning, for example, on the authority acquired by the anti-globalisation movement.
Today, isolated, discredited in its will to invest sincerely in a real cooperation and development policy, the Union needs to pull itself together.
The so-called 'poor' countries are not poor in terms of demands and proposals.
It is by considering them as real counterparts that Europe will win a place in the world, in order to help make it more humane.
The next item is a statement by the Council on the review of the trans-European networks and sustainable development.
Madam President, I have to start by informing you that I am afraid my colleague, Mr Lunardi, the minister responsible for this matter, has been detained in Rome by important government commitments and will not, therefore, be able to take part in this debate.
I am therefore going to deliver a brief statement on some of the considerations relating to this major subject instead.
Firstly, the Council confirms its commitment to the sustainable development strategy established by the 2001 Gothenburg European Council.
In this regard, our goal is to ensure the sustainability of transport, deal with growing traffic volumes and levels of congestion, noise and pollution and promote the use of environmentally friendly means of transport.
We are also aiming at the full internationalisation of social and environmental costs.
As stressed by the European Council, one essential way of achieving this objective is to develop trans-European transport networks, giving priority, where appropriate, to investment in infrastructure for public transport and railways, internal waterways, short sea shipping, intermodal operations and effective interconnection, in other words to encourage the development of means of transport which are less harmful to the environment.
The existing guidelines on the development of trans-European transport networks already identify, as one of the objectives of the network, guaranteeing the sustainable mobility of persons and goods while, at the same time, contributing to the achievement of Community objectives, particularly in the field of the environment and competition.
In this regard, the incorporation of environmental concerns at the planning and development stage of projects has been fixed as a priority objective for the development of the network.
More generally, Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 places the Member States under obligation to give due consideration to environmental protection during the development and implementation of projects, carrying out environmental impact assessments.
In addition, an environmental assessment has to be carried out on the plans and programmes drawn up in preparation for these projects, particularly those funded by the Community, under Directive 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.
Genuine free movement of goods and passengers depends on a perfectly integrated transport network, which links the islands and outer or remote regions with central regions.
By ensuring a more effective use of transport, a modern, interconnected and interoperable network brings an increase in trade and in the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole.
Until the necessary infrastructure has been built and until there is a proper legislative framework for the effective management of the network, the concepts of internal market and territorial cohesion of the Union will be incomplete.
The inclusion of a section dedicated to the trans-European networks policy in the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Community the powers and instruments it needed to develop them.
Under Article 154 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community is to contribute to the creation and development of trans-European networks in the field of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure.
This will contribute to both the creation of an internal market and economic and social cohesion, although, to this end, we need, first and foremost, to develop the interconnection and interoperability of national networks.
Over the past decade, we have witnessed not only a disturbing increase in traffic congestion in urban areas but also a new phenomenon of congestion on the major arteries of the trans-European network.
According to the Commission, the external costs of congestion caused by road traffic account, alone, for 0.5% of the European Union's GDP.
This figure is even more alarming if we consider that the demand for transport is going to continue to increase considerably in the future.
If we do not adopt measures between now and 2010 to rationalise the use and maximise the benefits of each means of transport, the volume of heavy road traffic alone in the 15-Member State Union could increase by 50% on the 1998 level.
This trend is damaging to both the Member States and the countries applying to join the Community, in that we witnessed both the gradual fall in the market share of the railways and, at the same time, a rise of almost 20% in road transport between 1990 and 1998.
In the new context of sustainable development, the June 2001 Gothenburg Council called for emphasis, in future, on the development of rail, sea and river transport.
In May 2004, 10 countries are to join the European Union, while Romania and Bulgaria are to join in 2007.
In the light of this, there is a need for new infrastructure in the corridors serving other countries to link them effectively to the trans-European network of the present 15 Member States.
The need also arises to improve links between the countries themselves.
A new network of infrastructure therefore needs to be built linking east to west and north to south.
It should also be remembered that the Council conclusions on the second review of the Council strategy on the integration of environmental requirements and sustainable development into transport policy, adopted by the Ministers for Transport in December 2002, stressed the importance of analysing new political proposals from the point of view of their environmental impact and of the Community's ability to reduce harm to the environment caused by the transport sector.
To back this up, I would point out that, during the same meeting of December last year, the Council approved the Marco Polo programme, which is intended to fund improvements to the environmental aspects of the goods transport system.
The programme provides for the funding of initiatives to transfer goods transport from road to other means of transport such as rail, internal waterways or short sea shipping.
The goal of promoting sustainable development through endeavours to restore a balance between means of transport which favours those which respect the environment will, therefore, be an essential point of reference for the Council when, in the coming months, it examines the Commission's proposal on the revision of the TEN guidelines and the priority projects it contains.
From this point of view, the Council believes that the conclusions of the High-Level Group chaired by former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, follow the strategic approach of sustainable, well-balanced development with due regard for environmental protection and, at the same time, endeavours to strengthen the unity of Europe through the free movement of persons and goods, and with due regard for the need to reduce natural barriers and to maintain a balance between east-west and north-south routes.
It considers that investment in infrastructure together with appropriate public and private partnership initiatives could be a highly effective instrument supporting economic growth.
From this point of view, the situation of certain countries which continue to be affected by the problem of passes and whose production systems continue to suffer considerable economic harm as a result, is typical.
That is why we must continue to urge the Commission to resolve these issues.
The Council therefore calls upon the Commission to present its proposal for revising the TENs without delay, so that a broad political debate can be held and a common position adopted.
Madam President, when we debate this issue, anyone can see that, as long as we remain at a theoretical level, we do not have very many disagreements.
We all agree that efficient trans-European networks linking eastern and western Europe and northern and southern Europe need to be created, we all agree that the issue of traffic congestion needs to be addressed, we all agree that emphasis needs to be given to the environment and to more friendly means of transport and we all agree that greater emphasis needs to be given to the railways.
The problem is when we start to address specific issues.
That is where we see that there is a difficulty reaching decisions.
For example, Minister, we have been talking about railways for a great many years, but the Council is not distinguished, at least not as a whole I think, by its intention to liberalise rail transport.
Because, without liberalisation and without interoperability in the network, it is obvious that the railways, which are the most environmentally-friendly, will never be able to acquire the required momentum.
