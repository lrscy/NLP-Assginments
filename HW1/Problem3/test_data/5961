However, I oppose the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax as I believe the principle of subsidiarity should apply and decisions in relation to taxation should be retained at national level.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on his important and timely report on a European Information Society for growth and employment, to which I lend my full support.
I particularly welcome the call for the early adoption of the 7th Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (2007-2013), both aimed at providing the appropriate financial resources to support the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a driving force for competitiveness, growth and employment.
These two programmes will help to develop entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of entrepreneurship in the EU, which are vital to regional development, as they will put an end to 'digital isolationâ and support SMEs in developing innovative projects.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, which was launched in June 2005 to foster growth and jobs in the information society and media industries.
The report has three main priority objectives. Firstly, to promote an information space without borders, secondly to stimulate innovation through investment and research, and thirdly to make ICTs accessible everywhere and to everyone in the EU.
Despite concerns over further regulation, I am encouraged by the fact that i2010 should benefit all citizens in helping to bridge the digital divide and narrow social and regional imbalances.
Â Â  . There are two key ideas in this report that led me to vote in favour, although I take exception to other points raised in the report.
On the one hand, I feel it is extremely important to realise that in terms of new technologies, almost everything that is said reflects a backward-looking approach.
We do not know what the future will be; we only know that it will be fast-moving and new.
Accordingly, the purpose of this regulation should be, on the one hand, to open up the markets to competition, and on the other to boost investment in innovation.
Europe's economy will only be competitive if it is an innovation-driven economy and if it becomes an economy of the near future and not one of the present.
That being said, I share the concern over issues of privacy and information security.
The society being created is at risk of becoming a vigilante society under constant surveillance, and this will be a major modern tragedy in terms of public freedoms.
Lastly, we recognise that innovation, in particular new technology, has been responsible for a democratic revolution in modern societies, and this is something that should be welcomed, preserved and encouraged.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, to the Commission, on the state of the European footwear sector one year after liberalisation (O-0005/2006 B6-0007/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the footwear industry is an important economic sector in the European Community, known throughout the world for the excellence of its products.
This sector is largely made up of small and medium-sized businesses, located in many cases in regions where they are the main source of employment.
In 2005 there were more than 11Â 000 companies, employing more than 500Â 000 workers directly or indirectly and producing around 700 million shoes, representing 10% of world production.
I should also point out that, in response to the opening-up process, the footwear industry has been extensively restructured and now concentrates its production on the higher price range in particular.
I would say that Europeâs most obvious speciality is the leather industry.
Just as in the case of textiles, the impact of the liberalisation process has been important in terms of putting an end to the quota system.
The monitoring system introduced by the Commission clearly demonstrates that imports, from China in particular â but not just from China â have seen a spectacular increase.
Last year, the average increase in imports in terms of value and quantity exceeded 450% and, in some cases, it was as high as 900%.
The average price of imported footwear has fallen significantly, but the retail price of products has not.
This does not support the thesis â a thesis that we all believe should be defended â that the true beneficiaries of the process of trade liberalisation should be the consumers.
A year ago, the European Confederation of the Footwear Industry presented a complaint about dumping practices in the leather footwear sector.
This is one of the biggest cases to have arisen in the European Union, and it affects many industries to the tune of more than EUR 800 million.
On 23 February, Commissioner Mandelson announced to the media that the Commission was going to recommend an increase in tariffs of 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam.
Childrenâs and other footwear, which represent a very significant proportion, were not subject to this kind of measure.
The fact is that the Commission adopted an unprecedented decision, introducing provisional tariffs for a period of five months by way of an antidumping measure.
It should be pointed out that, given the unit value of the products, this measure cannot be seen as extreme.
It is a relatively small percentage.
I am not going to say anything more about dumping.
In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, however, I would like to make a few comments on the basis of an initial premise, and that is the need to respect the rules that we have laid down within the framework of the WTO, both inside and outside the Community.
I am aware that this is rather more than a simple case of dumping.
In some cases, we are talking about the survival of the sector in Europe and also about the possibility of relocation as an appropriate response to developments.
As you know, everybody has their arguments in these cases; however, it is inconceivable that the entire European industry should move out.
At the same time, it should be pointed out that China is trying to achieve market economy status within the WTO.
Certain aspects of the Communityâs investigations indicate that, in this case, China has clearly not complied with WTO obligations, either in the field of subsidies, whether hidden or not, or in the field of counterfeits.
This is therefore an opportunity, Commissioner, to demonstrate to the citizens that the Commission is going to do everything in its power to ensure that the trade rules are respected, including, if necessary, having recourse to the WTOâs dispute settlement body.
These distortions of the market are not restricted to the footwear sector.
There are well-founded suspicions that certain forms of illegal support for Chinese exporting companies are offered regularly.
Commissioner, in view of the expectations of the industry in question and the sensitivity of European public opinion, I would like to know what actions the Commission will take to ensure that that country respects WTO rules.
Political considerations must not take precedence over technical conclusions where antidumping is concerned.
The measures that you have proposed are controversial.
The European industry and certain Member States are not satisfied with your proposal.
Public objections have been expressed to the 'creativity' demonstrated by the Commission in its application of the well-established rules and practices in the field of antidumping.
I do not know whether these allegations are true.
What I do know is that antidumping investigations are based on laws that must be applied fully without any kind of parallel consideration.
In conclusion, I can tell you, Commissioner, that the European Parliamentâs Committee on International Trade is going to follow the whole of this process very closely, because we believe that the step taken by the Commission is a first step and that it must be accompanied by an attitude in favour of China and other countries, such as Vietnam, having greater opportunities within international trade while jointly respecting the rules we have laid down.
Â Â  . Mr President, in response to the very welcome questions, let me stress that I am strongly committed to developing the two-way trade and investment relationship between Europe and China and with other Asian markets, including Vietnam.
There is no greater prize, in my view, for European trade policy in the coming years than the prize of getting those relationships right.
I believe that Europe must respect and adjust to the natural advantages those economies have, shifting our own focus to sectors and to products where our own skills and technologies give us the edge.
That is how trade grows and that is how Europeâs economies have grown over centuries.
The European footwear industry is in the front line of global competition.
For all their ingenuity, creativity and excellence, Europeâs leather-shoe makers are faced with an extraordinary challenge from Asiaâs producers.
However, the case of dumping requires me to distinguish between this tough new competition, on the one hand, and genuinely unfair trade on the other.
Europeâs trade defence measures target unfair trade.
They cannot protect us from tough competition.
They cannot shield us from Asiaâs natural and legitimate low-cost advantages.
However, when those comparative advantages are topped up by unfair and uncompetitive practice, we have a right and an obligation to act.
That is why, having been presented with a preliminary analysis and assessment by my services, I have recommended to the Commission and to Member States provisional duties in this case.
There is clear evidence of serious state intervention in the leather footwear sector in China and Vietnam: cheap finance, tax breaks, non-market land rents and improper asset valuation leading to dumping. That dumping is causing serious injury to EU producers.
The dumping duties that I am recommending will ensure that retailers with goods in transit are not suddenly faced with unexpected costs at the border.
I am suggesting that they be phased in over a period of five months, beginning at about 4% in April.
It means that importers can plan ahead over the next six months with a maximum of transparency and predictability.
It nevertheless means that after six months the full duty will be in place and the damaging effects of dumping will be counteracted.
As I am required by law to do, I have pondered the question of consumer and retailer interest in this case very seriously.
I have proposed to exclude high-tech sports shoes which are no longer produced in significant numbers in Europe.
I also propose to exclude childrenâs shoes so as to be sure that even small price rises are not passed on to poorer families.
I know that some are worried about the possible impact on consumer prices.
I believe, on the basis of the facts, that there is a margin within the supply chain to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain.
As I have said, these are proposals for provisional measures. They will be discussed with Member States and must be confirmed by the College of Commissioners.
I believe that I am proposing a balanced solution that deserves the backing of Member States and this House.
It corrects the injury but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers.
There will be no quotas, no limit at all on imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam.
I have told the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments that I want to work with them to see how they can address the concerns raised by the EU investigation.
Imposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism.
It is not a question of asking consumers to subsidise uncompetitive European producers, because the easy comparison is too often made.
It is also worth being clear that shoes are not the next textiles.
The textile issue concerned fairly-traded textile imports.
Our proposed anti-dumping measures on leather shoes tackle, in contrast, unfair competition.
The Commission has a legal obligation to investigate such a claim and a legal right to protect European producers against such practice.
Some of your questions address the overall situation in the European footwear sector.
Let me address this briefly.
The contraction of the footwear sector is a long-term process that began long before trade in footwear with China was liberalised in 2005.
Nonetheless, it is clear that there have been winners and losers from this change.
Some producers have increased their exports and others, including Turkey and some of the ACP countries, have seen their exports to the EU and elsewhere hold steady or fall.
Clearly, it is China, equipped with a staggering production and export capacity, that has benefited most.
Here in Europe, more than 40Â 000 footwear jobs have been lost and more than 1Â 000 footwear companies have closed down since 2001.
European production of leather shoes has fallen by 30% and profit margins have been heavily squeezed to just over 1%.
However, we should not pretend that this intense competitive pressure on European footwear producers is related solely to dumped goods.
In large part, these are the consequences of changing production and consumption patterns in the global economy.
I believe we should accept this, while helping those affected to adjust to these changes.
We should also acknowledge that European producers have significantly contributed to the change by relocating their production to Asia in quite a number of cases.
As a result, we need to take into account a range of European producer interests in assessing our interests in this matter.
Rising to the Asian challenge places great demands on our businesses and workers.
The Commissionâs growth and job strategy is built on the idea that Europe must commit itself to equipping todayâs Europeans to respond to this challenge and to create tomorrowâs jobs.
We cannot block globalisation and economic change.
I do not believe it is in Europeâs interests to try.
Those who think that the Trade Commissioner can reverse global economic change are asking King Canute to hold back the tide.
However, we can shape globalisation, even harness its dynamic potential for renewal and, indeed, for innovation in Europe.
I believe that the broader footwear issue confronts us with that imperative.
We must invest in change, invest in those affected by change, but face up to the changing world in doing so.
We must also be robust in our defence of the rules and of fair competition.
We need to recognise that if we want to win the wider political argument for free trade, we must be ready to defend and stand up for fair trade.
However, we cannot deny Asia its comparative advantages or the competitive industry that is lifting hundreds of millions in the developing world out of poverty.
The only sustainable balance to that competition is the creativity, innovation and commitment of European companies themselves, reinforced with the appropriate help from political authorities.
I am happy to return to any of these points in detail and to answer points that any Member may subsequently raise.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am a little bit worried that we, and the Commission in particular, have not learned anything from the problem of the âbra warsâ, as they became known, when we had to readjust our position.
I fully understand the situation on anti-dumping measures and agree entirely with the Commissionâs outlook on it.
However, Commissioner, you said one or two things in your speech which concern me.
You said that, when you looked at Vietnam and China, there were circumstances where they had financing, special financial agreements and tax breaks etc. Does that never apply in some cases in the European Union?
Are there not cases where this quite often happens in the European Union?
In particular, have European funding, structural funds, etc. never been used?
Would there be a risk of us perhaps being taken to the WTO on the extent of anti-dumping measures or support?
Could you also answer one or two other questions?
I understand the situation with China very clearly and I would accept your position, but one of the things that we are trying to do in the Western world at the moment is make poverty history.
This is something that we have been talking about quite a lot.
However, Vietnam, 30 years ago and even 10 years ago, was a very poor country, probably poorer than many sub-Saharan African countries.
Why have they had the need?
Surely they have been able to compete without actually putting in a support mechanism?
Could you answer that?
This is a country which has dragged itself from being one of the poorest and now at least has some sort of infrastructure.
I am concerned that we are going to be protective of the European shoe industry.
You say not. However, I still feel concerned.
I should like you to answer one final question.
I think we as MEPs and you as the Commission have missed an opportunity to get the message across about dumping.
People see us as being protectionist.
Your staff told me that a pair of designer boots from China cost about EURÂ 180 in Europe and yet only EURÂ 10 coming from China.
If the effect of the 19% is passed directly on to the consumer, will the 19% be calculated on the EURÂ 180 or on the EURÂ 10 that it costs to bring them in?
Â Â  . Mr President, I have a few questions and I will not be able to speak on behalf of my group in this case because, as with the anti-dumping cases, I think we are pretty much divided and have our own views on this issue.
Nevertheless, I want to thank the Commissioner for presenting his point of view and for intervening.
My starting point is that the anti-dumping measures and instruments need to be taken quite seriously.
On that point, I support my colleague Mr Sturdy, who is right.
If we do not use the instrument in a transparent and fair way it could become quite complicated for us.
My first question to the Commissioner is: will the EU produce an overall assessment of the conditions of competition and state intervention in the Peopleâs Republic of China?
The European Parliament would also like to receive a report on Chinaâs compliance with WTO rules and accession commitment five years after its accession to the WTO.
Would the EC take WTO action if China and Vietnam do not stop their unfair actions within a reasonable period of time and what would these measures be?
Commissioner, do you agree that the EC agreement and the results of the AD investigations are confidential and that leaks of information may lead to market distortions?
Could you explain in detail the rationale behind the exclusion of childrenâs footwear, especially in view of the fact that in some countries childrenâs footwear is worn by adults?
Could you explain why the publication of the results of the anti-surveillance system were so delayed?
If I am not completely mistaken, it was one year.
One small point: how do you see this investigation relating to another evaluation which is currently being undertaken as regards giving China market economy status?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, recent figures from your offices, of which you seem to have been aware for a long time, have taught us that since the liberalisation of European imports last year, the monthly shoe imports from China have risen by 400%, and in some cases, by no less than 900%.
You have not announced any dumping levies until now.
Some may say that this is too little too late.
They believe that you could have prevented things from getting worse by being more alert and responding more rapidly.
The European shoe industry is a relatively small sector, restricted to some four European countries, and already delocalised to a great extent as it is.
The question that arises is whether this is a good enough reason to let the whole sector go down the drain, certainly if it has to come up against â and you termed this very aptly yourself â unfair trade practices, such as dumping, or direct and indirect state aid.
Today, the free market is a socially adjusted one in which rules that apply at global level must be observed by all the players.
This is clearly not the case here.
China is keen to enjoy the benefits of WTO membership but overlooks the obligations that this entails.
It is obvious that the whole of the world market is at risk of being thrown out of joint.
Textiles yesterday, shoes today, what will it be tomorrow?
I would like to ask the Commissioner why the Commission did not react any sooner.
Can it really be that it is scared of rubbing the big yellow giant up the wrong way?
Most of all, can the Commissioner explain to us how we can convince the workers in the European shoe industry, who are at risk of losing their jobs as a result of unfair competition, of the benefits to be derived from globalisation of this kind?
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is a certain sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu in this debate.
Although anti-dumping is indeed different from the example of the multi-fibre arrangement, I believe it is no coincidence that this crisis follows the end of quotas.
It is clear that in a world of completely deregulated and unfettered free trade the so-called âChina priceâ will drag costs and standards down right across the globe, with the harshest impact on the poorest.
I believe we will see more cases of this kind until we recognise that the way forward is through a system of quotas that enables everyone to benefit from trade, rather than just a few.
Mr Mandelson talks about Europe being able to adapt by moving up the value-added chain, but we have had this discussion many times.
He knows my view that essentially China is going to do exactly the same, and why wouldnât it?
That is not going to provide a solution for Europe and it is not going to provide a solution for the rest of the world either.
What is interesting about this case is the extraordinary lengths that the Commission appears to have gone to in order to give the impression that this is a much less serious case than it is.
It almost feels as if the neo-liberal dogma and ideology are getting the better of the facts on the ground.
There are, therefore, some key questions to be answered, including the level of duties, based on injury, that the Commissioner has found: 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam.
Those are apparently based on adjustments never used in the European Community before.
There is real concern in the industry that they will not be enough.
The exemption of childrenâs and sports shoes has the effect of excluding around 42% of footwear imported at dumping prices, yet for which dumping duties will not be paid.
I do not believe that is fair to European producers; but it is not fair to Chinese workers either, who are working for pitiful wages â around USDÂ 12 per week, as mentioned in reports of â while at the same time social rights are reduced to an absolute minimum.
Unless we suppose that the consumer is benefiting, I believe it is worth noting that the anti-dumping duties are not likely to lead to increased consumer prices, but to decrease the profit margins of the importers.
I believe that we need to be genuinely concerned about the impact of competition from companies based in China â not just on Europe, but on poorer countries such as the EuroMed countries â and recognise that until we have a system of managed trade, the winners will always be concentrated in a handful of ever fewer countries and the losers will prove to be the majority.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, for ten years the European Union and the United States have been leading negotiations on Chinaâs entry into the WTO.
Now Beijing has learned the lesson and is not hesitating to apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation with a merciless resolution worthy of its masters.
It appears that the anti-dumping measures in no way comply with Community legislation or case-law and may have an extremely negative impact on the whole system of EU trade policy and consumers: we should therefore conduct a wholesale rethink of the WTOâs laissez-faire doctrines.
We believe that it is important for the European Union to retain an economic model that places at its centre respect for social clauses and the rights of workers in all parts of the world.
Europe ought to be more active in the various international bodies to promote work with dignity.
Europe ought to bring in regulations designed to promote labels for ascertaining geographical provenance and compliance with social and environmental rules.
If we do not call into question the WTOâs laissez-faire policies, then after textiles and shoes will come a long list of other products.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to express my sympathy to Commissioner Mandelson.
Commissioner, you have got an impossible job.
How can 25 countries have one single trade policy?
One size does not fit all, whether it is trade policy or shoe sizes.
You have also got the problem that you yourself are a free trader, a globalist, a moderniser.
You recognise what is going on in the world, but you are battling against the revived economic nationalism that exists within this European Union.
You simply cannot do your job and you are overseeing a regime that is laced with protectionism and sheer hypocrisy as we, of course, subsidise our own agriculture and will keep export subsidies in place until 2013.
But, in line with what John Blundell, the Director-General of the IEA, said just the other day: do you recognise that the overwhelming majority of British businesses now want British withdrawal from the common commercial policy and for us to get back to running our own trade policy?
Do you recognise that?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the footwear market since 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005 has led to an increase in imports from China equal to 500 per cent in one year, giving rise to a further contraction in the EU footwear sector, more bankruptcies and higher unemployment.
Import prices are artificially low; there cannot be any fair competition when the starting points are so wide apart and there is no equity when dumping is the rule.
The consequences of this situation have also affected suppliers of footwear and of parts from non-EU countries, including applicant countries and developing countries that have been driven out of the Community market.
Following complaints by the European industry against China and Vietnam the Commission has opened an anti-dumping enquiry, which is the largest of its kind ever launched by the EU.
Good intentions are not, however, enough for Parliament; we call for information on specific points.
What impact has the disappearance of the quota system had on the EU industry and on developing countries?
How does the Commission intend to tackle the need to restructure the European footwear sector?
What assessments can the Commission provide on the results of the EU monitoring system in the sector?
How are the anti-dumping enquiries proceeding and what are the prospects for the protection of EU interests?
Does the Commission intend to launch further initiatives internationally, as was the case for textiles, or is it expected to be too late?
Has the Commission considered the need to launch an enquiry regarding China within the framework of the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism?
The level of protection laid down in the proposal is too low, and is inadequate, especially if it is spread over six months, during the course of which the Chinese will not wait for the duty to reach 20% to export huge quantities of shoes.
This, MrÂ President and MrÂ Mandelson, is not what the free market is.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is abundantly obvious that Europe needs to protect itself.
The scale of the threat before us can be readily understood if we consider that the import of footwear from China has risen by several hundred per cent.
The situation is far worse with regard to Vietnam as the latter is an even more dynamic country.
Clearly, we need to resort to certain instruments that are only apparently contrary to the spirit of the free market.
I say only apparently, because in continents such as Asia production in the sector we are discussing has nothing in common with the free market, as the local labour force is cheap in the extreme.
It stands to reason that the European Union is entitled to defend itself and to resort to standard economic procedures and instruments.
I would, however, appeal for consistency.
A study of the broader situation reveals that unemployment in this sector has affected a couple of states in the European Union in particular.
It also reveals that those same states are refusing to recognise the free market within the European Union.
In my view, this demonstrates a certain lack of consistency and I appeal to the governments of the Member States in question to remedy the situation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, you have supplied us with the figures: today, footwear production in Europe has decreased by around 30%, import prices have fallen by more than 20% and, above all, the sector has lost nearly 40Â 000 jobs.
Six months have passed since the textile industry affair and, just as we had predicted at the time, the Community market once again finds itself faced with unfair commercial practices.
In fact, we have â as you pointed out â evidence of state intervention and of the granting of backdoor subsidies to manufacturers from China and Vietnam.
Faced with the evidence of such a violation of commercial practices, the European Union has a duty to react and to repair the damage caused to the Community industry, and this in accordance with WTO rules.
That is why it is necessary â as you have demonstrated, Commissioner â to implement antidumping measures in relation to these imports.
To establish a law for products that are subject to dumping does not amount to asking the consumer to subsidise uncompetitive European businesses.
Rather, it is a question, in fact, of guaranteeing the conditions for balanced trade, which protects the interests of both consumers and manufacturers.
Thus, to intervene with the aim of limiting the harmful effects of dumping should not be regarded as protectionism.
The European Union aspires to harmonious and open relations with its Asian partners in order also to free these populations from poverty. However, it also aspires to enforce fair and equitable trade rules for all.
Â Â  A year after the latest restrictions on footwear imports from China were lifted, we are in a good position to make an objective assessment of the impact of trade liberalisation in this sector.
There has been a sharp rise in imports, with the consequences that that entails for European manufacturing sector.
This new situation makes it all the more necessary to monitor the ongoing restructuring process in the footwear sector, whereby the business world must be encouraged to adapt, and the economic structure of the regions most directly affected by the social impact of the ongoing changes must be rearranged.
At the same time, however, the Commission must commit itself to detecting and combating glaring examples of unfair competition, which is exacerbating an already problematic situation.
Unfair competition is the biggest ally of protectionist impulses.
The EU must take a particularly strong lead in this area.
In this context, we should welcome the Commissionâs decision to adopt anti-dumping measures, after it emerged that China and Vietnam had resorted to unfair practices, such as the artificially low pricing of its exports in this sector.
Such practices are especially unacceptable in view of the fact that these countries already enjoy extraordinary advantages over their competitors.
There is therefore no justification for any kind of manipulative approach.
Although the adopted measures are broadly welcome, we do have one or two concerns.
The gradual implementation of anti-dumping rights, from a low starting point, may lead to an immediate increase in advance imports from China and Vietnam, which would make the current situation much worse.
This is a serious concern.
On the other hand, the idea of excluding certain categories of product from the scope of measures also deserves thorough analysis, given the threat of aggressive behaviour, which can only be combated if â as we are hoping â these imports are strictly monitored.
Â Â  Mr President, in September I stood here and called on the Commissioner to demonstrate greater foresight in the first post-quota era.
Little did I know then that since June, the Commission had statistics showing almost a 700% increase in imports of footwear from China, which indicated the serious state intervention in the sector that the Commission revealed five months later.
The cynic in me suggests that these statistics were swept under the carpet in order to end the âbra warsâ, another sticking plaster when the EU needs long-term solutions.
To add insult to injury, the Commission then went to the press with its plans for anti-dumping duties on leather shoes before even the Member States received the proposals, let alone this Parliament.
Commissioner, EU manufacturers and retailers who fear the future in a market swamped with cheap Asian exports need answers, which you hide from them.
They need confidence and hope, which you take away from them; and above all they require innovation, ideas and management from you, which you seem unable to provide.
Commissioner, first it was textiles, now it is shoes, next it will be furniture.
Unless you demonstrate greater foresight and communicate fully with your EU partners we will not be able to work together and help European industry to face the challenge of these emerging markets.
Â Â  â Mr President, not even a year after the problems in the textile sector, Europe is about to engage in a fresh trade conflict with China.
Time and time again, the rapid economic development of Asian countries takes Europe by surprise, and Europe is once again divided.
The EU should not be paralysed, though, by the opposing views adopted in the northern and southern Member States.
Once again, the Commissionâs policy constitutes a weak compromise between free trade and protectionism.
For that reason, the Commission should, as a matter of priority, develop a solid and unambiguous trade policy with the Asian region, so as to break the chain of sectoral conflicts.
While I can understand the frustration felt by the importers and the Member States that do not have an industry of their own, I do take the view that it is vital to remind China of the WTOâs rules.
As these words must be backed up by action, I would call on you, Commissioner, to include the documented state intervention in the shoe industry in the negotiations on market economy status for the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Â Â  â MrÂ Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, it is the same old story: having abolished all restrictions on the import of footwear products from the Far East and having caused such damage to the European and Italian industries in the sector, with the obvious consequences for employment, we are laying the foundations for definite risks in the future to small and medium-sized enterprises.
They will finally be crushed by the unfair competition of goods at the very lowest prices, produced without any proper monitoring of the conditions in the production and distribution chain, either with regard to environmental impact or the social security benefits and employment benefits enjoyed by the labour force.
These are the factors of production on which the business costs advantage operates, unfairly distorting every competitive capacity and transforming it into, instead of the free operation of the market, open dumping that runs counter to the interests not only of one sector, but of the entire Community.
I ask for the Commission to take action to defend the footwear sector against unfair competition from products imported from countries outside the EU, partly in the light of the fact that the monitoring measures so far taken by the EU have proved, in practice, to be useless.
We are calling not just for vigilance, but also for active defence of the special expertise and quality of the European footwear sector, through strict limits on imports, the imposition of duties and the certification of the social and environmental ethical qualities of products, as I have already requested on other occasions.
Â Â  â Mr President, I belong to those who support a multilateral, balanced, free world trade system with institutional and political consistency.
I mean a system based on even stricter rules, on stronger institutions, on more transparent and democratic procedures.
The increase in imports of leather shoes of up to 500% in 2005, a percentage which Mr Baron Crespo raised to 900%, is not just the product of liberalisation and that must be understood.
It is the product of unfair practices in violation of the rules of international trade on the part of China and Vietnam, on the part of two emerging economies.
As other Members said, we lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of productive units disappeared in the European textile industry yesterday and today it will be the shoe industry.
The European Union needs to send a clear message, as you intimated Commissioner, and we are all with you in this message.
We are behind you.
Yes to competition, no to its evident or concealed distortion.
The anti-dumping duties â and this should be understood â are not a protective measure; they are a measure of legal commercial defence and, if this measure is to be effective, the duties must be proportionate to the degree of dumping.
To all those who use the better price argument against the imposition of duties, I would counter with the following question: have consumers benefited from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation?
My personal opinion is that the few suppliers of products from China and Vietnam have benefited.
The Commission should organise its institutional attack, an attack of systematic convergence and effective protection of intellectual and industrial property, an attack against ecological and social dumping, against opaque and unfair practices and state interventions.
Otherwise, the accumulation of experiences of violation of the rules of international trade, with the Union reacting after the event, may jeopardise the confidence of European citizens in the fundamental principle of the liberalisation of the world trade system.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ever since the quota system was abolished last year, imports from China have, as has been mentioned, spectacularly increased by around 500%.
That has serious consequences for the competitiveness of the European footwear sector which, faced with this flood of very low-priced imports, is seeing a number of tragic bankruptcies, to say nothing of the job losses that go with them.
Furthermore, our traditional suppliers in the form of candidate countries and countries in the Euromed area have been ousted from the Community market.
The Commission remains silent on this matter and does not seem keen to assess the impact of the damage done by this liberalisation.
Following the complaint lodged by the operators in this sector, you opened an antidumping inquiry.
The alarming results of that inquiry bring to light unquestionable evidence of state intervention and of social dumping practices, which cause material loss to our industries.
In order to combat this distortion of the fundamental rules of international trade, you are proposing some measures to us today.
I am worried, however, about the gradual entry into force of these antidumping laws over a five-month period, a precedent that I feel is inappropriate and legally questionable and will not be without pernicious effects.
These laws should make it possible to eliminate either dumping or the losses it causes.
In fact, the proposed progressive rates do not fulfil either of those two alternative conditions.
What is more, the exclusion of childrenâs shoes seems to me to be unjustified and incomprehensible.
Your proposals could very quickly prove to be insufficient faced with the extent of the losses suffered by our businesses.
Other initiatives could be taken to counter these unfair commercial practices. For example, it would be possible to open an inquiry in the framework of the provisional safeguard measures applicable to Chinese imports, measures that have the advantage of being simple and effective.
If the Member States asked you to take such initiatives, would the Commission envisage doing so?
Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law?
Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened.
After textiles last year and footwear now, which other sectors will have to be subjected to these unfair practices in the future?
Â Â  MrÂ Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian situation in the footwear sector prompts me to call for a significant change to the measures proposed by you and in part accepted by the Italian Government.
Italy is already paying very high prices in terms of employment.
Mine is a request not in the name of protectionism, but in the name of a calculation of the social impact.
It is not a case of affirming or refusing globalisation or the market, and its analysis is measured, in theoretical terms, and also realistic.
It is a question of emphases: the path between heaven and hell is a narrow one.
Just as there is a fine distinction, as you have said once again here, between tough competition and unfair competition.
I base myself on your words: China and Vietnam have broken the rules.
You propose to react, but the dimensions of the dumping seem rather greater than the duties that you propose.
I think, quite frankly, that your measures should be revised, with changes to both the figures and the deadlines.
In other words, duties should be applied immediately, not in a few monthsâ time, and they should be increased, by also excluding high-tech sports shoes from the exemption on duties Otherwise, neither European producersâ nor European consumersâ interests will be protected, nor will the market be well served.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the town of Romans, in the department of DrÃŽme, the unemployment rate stands at 18% â twice the French average â because the footwear sector there is devastated and traditional skills disappearing.
This collapse is due to the anachronistic application of the Ricardian model underpinning your policy.
The new international division of labour has encouraged low-wage countries to specialise in labour-intensive industries, while high-saving countries concentrate on very capital-intensive industries.
Today, growth-starved capital is also leaving those countries.
Thus, the countries of the European Union, which used to have a high level of productivity and high wages, are being surpassed by countries that are just as productive but that pay low wages.
In order to prevent a fatal outcome, we must re-read the work of the liberal Maurice Allais, we must rediscover the virtues of the common external tariff of blessed memory and we must protect ourselves outside the Union in order to be free inside it.
If we do not do so, then all of our labour-intensive industries will follow in the footsteps of the footwear industry.
Â Â  Commissioner, EU history where anti-dumping is concerned is scary.
Well-organised special interests are allowed again and again to impose customs duties in their pursuit of small profits, which turn into large costs for consumers.
When the Commission introduced customs duties on TV sets, consumers had to pay SEKÂ 2.00 for every krona earned by the industry.
In the case of the duties on bed linen from Pakistan, every krona that went to the manufacturers cost consumers SEKÂ 3.00.
In the case of Norwegian salmon, matters were even worse: every krona earned by the salmon producers cost consumers as much as SEKÂ 70.00.
The Commission is therefore failing to take sufficient account of consumers and, thus, of Community interests.
Now, the process has begun of making the same mistake once more â in connection with shoes from China and Vietnam â but this time we know the cost of the policy in advance.
The Danish Government conducted a study showing that the costs to consumers in the EU was eight times greater than manufacturersâ profits and that, in total, the EU was losing more than SEKÂ 2.5 billion.
For Sweden, the figure is even more appalling.
Each krona earned by Swedish manufacturers costs Swedish consumers SEKÂ 44.00.
In total, Swedish consumers can count on paying almost SEKÂ 60 million more for their shoes.
The only EU country in which the business is estimated to be profitable is Slovakia, where SEKÂ 300Â 000 is estimated to be earned.
It would be cheaper if we in the European Parliament were to pool our money, in that way preventing people from having to pay duties.
To be honest, I do not believe that that would be a mistake.
In spite of everything, the Commission has consciously chosen to make comparisons with expensive shoes from Brazil and measured the increase in imports before the quota was abolished against that after the quota was abolished.
Not a single factory has been given market economy status, in spite of its being acknowledged that factories buy leather and labour in a way that is adjusted to conditions in the market.
I am seriously concerned about the increasing protectionism I encounter in the EU, and I hope that this is the last time the Commission gives way to the demands of protectionists at the expense of citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, the European footwear sector is experiencing difficulties for two reasons: on the one hand, it is suffering as a result of unfair practices, and, on the other, Commissioner, it is still facing tariff difficulties and other practical obstacles when it comes to accessing third-country markets.
I believe that all of this makes it necessary to take effective action to tackle dumping, enabling us to react fairly, but swiftly, in order to prevent speculative movements and ultimately a greater increase in imports while we are waiting for measures to be taken, as happened in the case of textiles.
The Commissionâs proposal on the antidumping procedure relating to footwear from China and Vietnam is reasonable and balanced, but it contains surprising elements that many people cannot understand, such as not applying the measures that you have proposed either to childrenâs shoes â which, as you know, are worn not only by children â or to special technology athletic footwear (STAF).
Where dumping exists, duties will have to be imposed that are effective in guaranteeing fair competition conditions and, in this regard, the level of duties and their practical application should be based on their effectiveness, that is to say on how effective they are in eliminating dumping.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, what is lacking in the European Union is a strategy for facing up to globalisation.
The globalisation fund now provides us with a means of dealing with the past, but what solutions do we have for the future?
My initial reaction to this was that this is the same sort of protectionism that we find with regard to textiles, and that would be a bad thing, for we need free and fair access to markets throughout the world.
That is important to our producers within the European Union, and it is important that we in the European Union should keep to the rules, just as we demand that our trading partners should do.
After I had got my hands on more information, it became clear to me that this is not protectionism, but dumping, and it became clear to me that the measures you are putting in place are, technically speaking, better planned than those you took to deal with textiles back then, but I can also see that our actions, now as then, are inconsistent, and inconsistency will be seen by the Chinese as a sign of weakness.
I can still see why we have taken sports shoes out of the procedure, but why have we done so with childrenâs shoes?
Either this is dumping that we are dealing with or it is not.
I do not think it makes any sense whatever to argue on the basis of the effect on consumers, for in no way have they benefited from the reduced import prices over the past few years, and, when one considers that a shoe imported for EURÂ 6.50 can retail for EURÂ 120, it becomes clear that there is no justification whatever for the importers' warnings of price increases, which, it is claimed, will be of the order of 20%.
Let us take a look at the issue of China.
What lies behind this dumping?
One aspect I find deeply disturbing; businesses are unable to keep proper accounts or ensure proper management.
That is part of the reason.
On the other hand, though, I am also seriously worried about the ever-increasing role played by the state in dumping, about the unjustified prices for land, about the tax reliefs for export businesses, about the banksâ unrecoverable loans, about the subsidised costs of raw materials, and about much else besides.
It simply makes no sense, then, to do as some in the Commission seem to want to do, and recognise China as a market economy.
Here too, we must be consistent.
In all these respects, I would like to see us, in future, demonstrating more consistency and making a better job of keeping to the rules.
Â Â  I wish to begin by expressing my support for the proposal to adopt anti-dumping measures in the footwear sector.
This was the least we could ask for given that dumping destroys the very essence of freedom of trade.
Europeâs industry must not die of apathy and of complicity with such practices.
Given the lack of time I shall limit myself to two remarks.
Given that we know dumping takes place, it makes no sense to allow it to be tolerated.
This is what will happen with the proposed gradual approach to implementing anti-dumping measures.
There is no justification for this gradual approach.
My second remark is that excluding childrenâs footwear is totally unacceptable.
There is no justification, no legal basis and no technical foundation for such a move.
To pursue this and other unjustified exclusions totally undermines the credibility of these measures.
I therefore call for a complete rethink of these aspects.
Lastly, it is crucial that the Commission abandon its constantly reactive position and begin to achieve results in its political priority of opening up third-country markets for European footwear exports, and in particular the Japanese market, mechanisms of access to the Russian market and indeed the Chinese market.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for learning from its past experience.
I am glad the decision has been taken not to impose quotas on import issues since this would have been disastrous for the whole supply chain and for consumers, and I think we all agree on that.
However, we need to ask in whose interests these anti-dumping duties are being imposed.
I cannot see how consumers will benefit.
Whether we like it or not, European citizens are voting with their wallets and buying imported footwear.
Imposing duties could punish consumers by increasing the price they pay for their footwear.
I agree that some of the predicted price rises may be alarmist, but there will be price rises.
We are told that a 20% duty on the import price of shoes should not lead to a large increase in the retail price.
Retailers and others in the supply chain are expected to absorb the duties.
However, in this day and age I am astounded that the Commission believes that it knows best how retailers and shoe companies should run their businesses and how much they should be charging their customers.
What has happened to the laws of supply and demand between sellers and European citizens and consumers?
If the Commission truly feels that retailers are making too high a margin on shoes, then it should launch an investigation into the competitiveness of the shoe industry, not punish retailers and the supply chain by using the blunt instrument of anti-dumping duties.
Is pushing up the prices of shoes from China and Vietnam really going to help European producers, or will it simply force retailers to source their shoes from other non-EU markets, such as India?
Finally, can we really take the high ground and complain about the Chinese Government subsidising the footwear industry when we spend so much of our EU budget on subsidising inefficient farmers?
Let us in the EU throw away the post-war protectionist model and take a lead in embracing globalisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that I have the impression that this measure is now devoid of substance.
Sports shoes have been excluded, but how do we define sports shoes?
Childrenâs shoes have been excluded; I and many, many other women still wear these shoes despite not having been children for some time.
The application of anti-dumping measures has taken place with a sluggishness that has not been seen before, and above all anti-dumping duties are being proposed that are not sufficient to tackle a situation of unfair competition that the Commission itself defines as serious.
So I ask you: do you not believe that lurking behind the defence of consumers, in particular poorer families, as you wrote in Sundayâs , there is also, or perhaps chiefly â I do not know â an attempt to protect the interests of multinationals?
Do you not believe that the Commissionâs policy, which I consider to be at times ambiguous, might endanger the important, if not unique, instrument of European commercial policy?
Finally, I would like you to comment on what is happening in the bed linen sector since, in this case too, the action taken by the Commission is not easy to understand.
Â Â  . Mr President, if you do not mind I shall not go along the course of answering the point about bed linen at this precise moment.
In the time I have available I think it would be better to stick to shoes, but I can assure you that the question of any anti-dumping duty on bed linen will be properly assessed and properly applied as, in my opinion, it is at the moment.
I think that the value of debates such as this and the important role of this Parliament are demonstrated by the very important and insightful observations that have been made during the last 45 minutes.
My role on behalf of the Commission is to listen to what honourable Members have to say and to reflect very carefully on the points and arguments that have been raised.
I can assure you I will reflect on them and on the observations made by Member States so that when I come back to the Commission with final recommendations I will be able to do so having heard the variety, diversity and range of different points and arguments that have been made.
However, having heard so many people this afternoon complain that my intervention is protectionist, unnecessary and unjustified, alongside a slightly greater number of Members of this House who have complained that I am not going far enough, my actions are inadequate and that I should go further, I am tempted to make the easy observation that perhaps I have got the measures just about right between those two rival points of view!
However, tempting as it is to make that rather cheap observation, I am going to avoid doing so.
I should like to say, though, that I agree particularly with Mr Papastamkos and Mrs SaÃ¯fi, both of whom see the need to intervene against anti-competitive and trade-distorting behaviour by our partners, but at the same time to do so with a degree of perspective and balance that I think it behoves me to uphold.
I think Mr Assis is right in that, in the provisional measures that are introduced, it is important that we maintain careful monitoring and surveillance of the effect of what we are doing so as to ensure that, if there is circumvention of our duties, we are able to review the situation and perhaps take revised action when we come to the definitive stage of our measures later this year.
Let me very quickly respond to some of the other points that have been made.
Some have drawn a parallel between the proposed action on shoes and the action that we took on textiles.
They are very different cases.
In the case of textiles, we were dealing with fairly-traded goods, albeit subject to a dramatic and sudden increase in volume following the lifting of quotas on Chinese textiles at the beginning of 2005.
We therefore took a safeguard measure by the introduction of quotas, as we are entitled to do.
We were not, as in this case, dealing with anti-competitive measures â dumping actions â that attract an anti-dumping measure in the form of a tariff duty â not a quota and not a physical limit.
Therefore I do not anticipate our running into the temporary teething problems that we had in the case of textiles.
This should be remembered by those who describe the textile period as involving us in some sort of war or battle with China.
Far from it.
We were able to agree with China the measures that we took, in a very unwarlike way.
Two other points were raised by a number of Members.
One concerns the impact on consumer prices. Let us put this case into perspective.
It concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every 100 pairs bought by European consumers; in other words, a fraction of the product range.
A duty would be just over EUR 1.50 on average wholesale prices of EURÂ 8.50 on shoes which then sell for between EUR 40 and EUR 120, as opposed to a duty which would simply amount to EUR 1.50.
Please do not tell me that EUR 1.50 cannot be absorbed across the supply chain by importers and retailers, especially importers and retailers who have benefited from low import prices from China and Vietnam but who have not passed on the effects of those cheaper import prices to consumers â a question that consumers may put to their retailers if they are able to encounter them at some stage in the future.
A number of Members have asked me why I am proposing to exclude sports technology shoes and childrenâs shoes.
In the case of the sports shoes, these are excluded from the investigation because they are not produced in Europe in sufficient quantity to qualify as being potentially harmed by dumping.
There is therefore no injury to European producers because they barely exist in the case of these sports shoes.
In the case of childrenâs shoes, the exclusion I am proposing is on the grounds of Community interest.
Young children need three to four pairs of new shoes per year.
The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes.
In my view, parents should not see any potential hurdles put in the way of buying good-quality shoes for their children.
Those who want me to reclassify the customs segmentation for these shoes should bear in mind that the customs classification for children is up to size 37Âœ with heels less than 3cm.
Whilst I am prepared to discuss that with my colleagues in TAXUD, it is a classification that I am given, not one that I propose.
Let me make just briefly one or two other quick observations.
There was a suggestion that the investigation had taken too long.
This sampling takes time.
I am obliged by the regulations that exist within the European Community to observe very strict procedures and use very strict reference countries and companies when I am investigating those of another country that does not enjoy market economy status.
Therefore, just as I cannot anticipate dumping complaints â some Members were complaining that I do not show enough foresight, as if I have a crystal ball before me that is going to reveal where the next dumping complaint is going to come from â I cannot pre-empt proper procedures and investigations that are laid out in our regulations and which I am obliged to follow in detail.
Let me reply to the suggestion that somehow there was a breach of confidentiality.
I do not understand this.
Member States received the Commissionâs working document before my press conference on 23Â February.
The moment these working documents go out to Member States I can assure you that they are as good as published to the media.
I therefore have to clarify them immediately and explain and justify what I am doing.
This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commissionâs services.
I shall leave the matter there, except to say in conclusion that it is very important that we see what is happening in China, Vietnam, India and other Asian countries in some perspective.
Of course there is tough competition and there is a difficult challenge for European producers and manufacturers to rise to, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help European producers rise to this challenge and to help those employed in companies adjust to the challenges and the new circumstances of international trade which we are experiencing.
I do not believe that a proper and legitimate way of helping people to adjust to these new forces in the global economy is to encourage people to shelter from them or to pretend that, if we close our eyes or cover our heads with a blanket, these changes, challenges and new sources of competition will somehow go away and leave us alone so that we do not have to respond to them.
Any politician giving that sort of message to the public would be guilty of false leadership, and poor leadership to the public, who need to understand what is going on and help to respond to it.
We cannot maintain the pretence that we in Europe, by retreating from the competitive challenge we are facing in the global economy, will somehow be able to hide from it and, at the same time, maintain our living standards and our prosperity in the future.
We cannot and will not do that.
We have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness, innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future.
If we do not rise to that challenge and do not set that out to our public, we cannot blame them subsequently for reacting with fear and mystification to what is taking place in the global economy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could make a short comment on a question raised by many of our colleagues on granting market economy status to China.
Â Â  . Mr President, China is not yet qualified to receive recognition of market economy status by Europe.
There are technical criteria that China needs to fulfil, and it is making progress towards doing so.
Indeed we can, should and are giving every assistance to China to enable it more easily and rapidly to make the technical changes that will enable it to fulfil those criteria.
It is important to do that.
Let me add this related comment.
The environment in which Member States and Members of this House come to judge the market economy status of China will be helped and encouraged by China doing more than it is at the moment to open its markets to our exports and to othersâ trade, to make sure that it is in full compliance with its WTO accession commitments, and to make sure that where it is taking longer than is reasonable to move towards full compliance with those commitments and WTO rules it makes the necessary changes sooner rather than later.
If China were to do that, and to respond to the anxieties felt in Europe and around the world about the growth of its export capacity in a way that rebalanced the terms of trade â so that as well as people seeing goods coming in ever-growing numbers from China, they were also to see those containers being refilled and returned to China with European and other goods â it would do more than anything else to still public anxiety about what we are seeing in China.
Understandably, people in Europe see the growth of Chinaâs market as a threat, but we must understand it as a huge opportunity for us in Europe to sell our own goods and services to that market in future.
However, China has a responsibility to make sure that no artificial or unreasonable barriers remain in place to European goods and services being sold to the Chinese market in ever-growing numbers.
When we get that equation right, then perhaps people will be able to look more sympathetically, as well as technically, at the issue of Chinaâs market economy status.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  I welcome the Commissionâs diligence in listening to the demands of small and medium-sized European enterprises worried by the increase in imports from non-EU countries, and the latest proposal for compensatory anti-dumping duties on leather shoes, against China and Vietnam.
I believe, however, that the measures put forward are still totally inadequate given the severity of the issue.
The duties proposed are inadequate because they are too low and therefore ineffective.
The phasing-in period (six months) is inadequate, since it is a procedure that is too feeble for such a serious case of dumping.
The exclusion of non-professional sports shoes and childrenâs shoes (which can also include womenâs shoes) is also unacceptable.
I would also point out that another fundamental request, which is the compulsory introduction of a label of origin for products entering the EU, has been dragging on for two years without the Member States being able to come to agreement.
It is also necessary to tackle the worrying increase in swap practices â in other words, anomalous movements of products with the aim of bypassing more stringent customs controls (imports from Belgium have increased by an amount of 17.8%, which is absolutely inexplicable).
The calls by the Commission to make innovative changes are reasonable and interesting, but they make sense only in a genuinely equitable and fair competitive environment, and the Commission has a duty to ensure that the international market is just that.
Â Â  I want to raise with the Commissioner the plight of a factory in my constituency â 'Dickies' in Midsomer Norton, near Radstock in Somerset â whose future and workforce are threatened by any adverse outcome from your services' current investigation of an anti-dumping complaint regarding protective footwear imported from China.
I have met with representatives of both management and the workforce, including trade union representatives from GMB, and they are united in stating that jobs and livelihoods are at stake should the Commission impose anti-dumping duties on this particular sector.
The imported footwear from China underpins the distribution and manufacturing sections in the Midsomer Norton plant.
Those who introduced the complaint do not manufacture generally in Europe, but source form other third countries rather than China.
I believe the investigation will find that no damage has been done to European industry by these imports from China and in fact the plants concerned, most of which have applied for market economy status, have not engaged in dumping.
Stop this threatened tax on protection, relieve people's understandable concerns and close the file as soon as possible.
Â Â  â The situation in the footwear sector is alarming, not least in Portugal.
Just by way of an example, dozens of businesses â among them Ecco and Rhode â in Aveiro District, closed down or laid off workers in 2005.
Unemployment and the risk of poverty have increased, a case in point being C [amp] J Clarks in Castelo de Paiva, where workers were promised work, training and subsidies, only for them to be laid off just two years later.
Once again, we must report that:
- With the steep rise in footwear imports from third countries, it was not the so-called consumer whose wallet became fatter, but the large retailers and distributors who accumulated fabulous profits;
- It is not third countries that are responsible for the closure of businesses and the loss of jobs; it is the EU, which is at the head of the queue to promote competition and liberalisation of international trade and which maintains the euro at a level that harms manufacturing and exporting, as in the case of footwear.
The real losers in this policy are the workers, small, medium-sized and micro-enterprises, and countries such as Portugal, as borne out by studies and, more importantly, reality.
Â Â  It is clear that the EU is facing new competitive challenges on the world market, challenges which cause anxiety and uncertainty for our industry, our workers and our consumers.
Yet as we adjust to the new global environment we must avoid the populist appeal of protectionist measures which are at best a short-term panacea for long-term ills.
In this instance, however, it appears that there has been a well-documented case of dumping and injury to the European industry.
Whilst I fear that some EU companies with good employment standards and interests in the Far East (for example Clarks shoes) will be hit by these measures, I am pleased to see certain exemptions to the punitive tariff proposed by the Commission have been obtained, namely in the sensitive childrenâs footwear sector.
On balance I think that the Commission has hit the right note here.
I am inclined to agree with the Commissioner when he states that consumers should be more concerned about the mark-up enjoyed until now by retailers on goods produced cheaply in poor employment and environmental conditions and then sold below the cost of production.
Our partners must now address these social and employment issues, issues which we ourselves have faced and dedicated much time and effort to overcoming jointly through the European project.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0049/2006) by Adeline Hazan, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on evaluation of the European arrest warrant (2005/2175(INI))
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Gastinger, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity given to us today to debate the European judicial area on the basis of my report on the still very recent, and therefore inevitably fragmented, assessment of one yearâs implementation of the European Arrest Warrant.
We have already had the opportunity to debate this matter.
Before turning specifically to the European Arrest Warrant, I should like to make one small point, because, underpinning this concept of a judicial area, which was formulated very gradually after the Geneva Appeal in 1996, was the ambition to give Europeans a common sense of justice in an environment in which the authorities do everything possible to prevent Europeansâ freedom â from being circumvented or their rights from being flouted.
In OctoberÂ 1999, the Tampere Summit marked an important stage, with the introduction of the mutual recognition principle.
This change has been radical.
It involves mutual confidence, the exercising of shared sovereignty and the recognition of the European area as a common territory.
Since then â as we have seen â problems persist and people need to be aware of these.
It must be said that the inspiration and ambition that motivated the Heads of State or Government at Tampere have not injected the same degree of enthusiasm into the debates on the texts presented since then.
Mutual recognition has inspired many projects, but it is the creation of the European Arrest Warrant that is undoubtedly the symbolic measure.
The warrant does, in fact, represent a definite step forward, despite encountering persistent problems.
What, then, was the aim of this measure, which officially entered into force on 1Â January 2004?
The European Arrest Warrant applies to a broader range of offences than those covered by the extradition procedure.
Thanks to this warrant, the surrender procedure has become an entirely judicial, and no longer political, process â which is a bonus.
The bottom line is that EU law can now be interpreted correctly by practitioners, whereas existing extradition law relies on an abundance of bilateral and national agreements.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out on several occasions â including in Article 1 of the framework decision â that, when issuing and implementing the arrest warrant, the Member States and the judicial authorities must ensure that they strictly comply with the principles laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Once the principles of this instrument are laid down, how are they implemented?
We now have at our disposal an assessment carried out, as I said, over only a short space of time by the European Commission, and we must therefore remain cautious when faced with the results of this assessment, which is not yet complete.
Some of the planned objectives have been fully achieved.
For example, the Arrest Warrant came in very useful recently in the prosecution of an Ethiopian suspected by the British authorities of having been involved in the London bombings.
His extradition by the Italian authorities was obtained in record time.
Another success was the arrest of a corrupt judge, wanted by her country, Greece.
The European Arrest Warrant is an undeniable success story, with 3Â 000 warrants issued in 2004, 1Â 000 people arrested and 650 people handed over.
The 2005 figures will undoubtedly show an increase, but they will not be officially available until June or July.
The extradition procedure has been made much shorter.
By replacing the old extradition procedure with the European Arrest Warrant, the average duration of the procedures has gone from nine months to 43 days, which is an appreciable gain for both the judges and those standing trial.
Lastly â and most importantly â the procedure is no longer in any way politicised because it no longer involves governments, but only the justice system.
It must be said, however, that the application of the European Arrest Warrant has hit several stumbling blocks.
Last autumn, for example, and in response to Berlinâs refusal to extradite the German-Syrian citizen Mamoun Darkazanli, an alleged Al-Qaeda figure, Spanish law declared the European Arrest Warrant issued by Germany to be null and void.
Several Member States are also attempting to reinstate elements of the traditional system, such as the verification of double criminality.
To the optional grounds for non-execution provided for by the framework decision, some Member States have added other grounds for refusing extradition.
Even more importantly, the issue of fundamental rights has given rise to considerable transposition problems in Poland and Germany.
This difficulty must be interpreted as a failure to understand the principle of mutual recognition, and yet this principle is precisely the foundation on which the European judicial area is entirely constructed.
In conclusion, I would say that the European Arrest Warrant marks an important step forward in the fight against crime â above all in terms of serving Europeans - and in the creation of a European judicial area.
The fact remains that there is still a host of problems and that these problems must not be underestimated.
The first problem stems from the fact that our judicial systems are too different from one another.
The second problem is that most of the Member States are still too keen to control international legal assistance.
Even though the judicial system is a product of history, the issues that arise are going to have to be dealt with.
To conclude: is more or less harmonisation needed?
I believe that more is needed.
Should more progress be made in terms of the mutual recognition of systems?
I believe that, here too, the answer is yes.
Â Â  . Mr President, Vice-President Frattini, Mrs Hazan, honourable Members of the European Parliament, firstly, let me thank you warmly on behalf of the presidency for this report on the evaluation of the European Arrest Warrant, which I have read with great interest.
The Presidency shares your view â as indeed do I â that the European Arrest Warrant has, in essence, been a success.
It has certainly been a milestone in improving cooperation between the European Unionâs Member States, particularly as regards our common desire to combat organised crime and terrorism.
I believe we can also agree that it is of a quite new and exemplary character and has made an essential contribution to the further development of the mutual recognition principle, to which Mrs Hazan refers at several points and on which we agreed at the Tampere Council.
We in the Council, at any rate, regard the European Arrest Warrant as the foundation for all the further work we will do in this area.
I am particularly glad that your House shares our view.
Perhaps we might look back and recall how extradition procedures were formerly very long, unwieldy and, in many respects, dependent on political decisions.
All of us who are active in this field found this state of affairs intolerable.
All 25 Member States have now transposed into their own legal systems the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant.
If we look at how things stand today, we see that the procedure for handing over suspects is now speedy, efficient and, as a matter of principle, reserved to independent courts.
That is of quite considerable benefit, and it is this framework decision that has made it possible.
It is also important that it has been possible â as the honourable lady who spoke before me stated â to quite considerably reduce the time that the extradition process takes.
Until now, it generally took on average nine months, but the average time has now been reduced to between 40 and 45 days.
That represents quite substantial progress, particularly in terms of fundamental rights, for you will all be aware that Article 5(3) of the Convention on Human Rights requires us to contribute to the speeding up of the processes by which people are taken into custody.
This framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant has enabled us to largely comply with this requirement.
Despite the fears that you voice in your report about the critical views expressed in the rulings of national constitutional courts concerning transposition in some Member States, the presidency is not aware of any fundamental rejection of the European Arrest Warrant at national level.
I myself am not aware of any, and I am sure that this is not happening.
On this point, though, we must also bear in mind the fact that public confidence is to a large degree dependent on our conceding the possibility â for which there are certainly good legal reasons â of the implementation at national level for which we are making provision under the Framework Decision being subject to scrutiny by national supreme courts.
That is a quite essential consideration.
If such scrutiny reveals the need for some change in transposition at the national level, then that change will be carried out, but what really matters is that the public should have confidence in what we are doing at the European level.
Something else that is important and could make for repeated difficulties in interpretation â although I do not take as critical a view of this as you do in your report â is the exemplary character of the fundamental rights clause, which is not, formally speaking, a ground for rejection.
That, too, is a quite essential consideration.
It is important, though, that we should allow our national courts to perform their essential function within the Member States, that being to examine whether their countryâs legal system guarantees protection for fundamental rights.
I do not believe that there should be any contradiction in this.
I do, however, perceive a contradiction in this report, in so far as it highlights, on the one hand, the risk of the discriminatory use of the fundamental rights clause, while at the same time â and this is something else I can fully endorse â stressing the need for the European Arrest Warrant, in its application, to specifically protect human rights and personal freedoms.
Care must be taken that these do not conflict with each other.
As I have already said, the role of the national courts must be to ensure, on the basis of the fundamental rights clause, that the fundamental rights of our citizens are not infringed.
That, too, must be part of the procedure under the European Arrest Warrant.
While I am on this subject, I would like to mention a case brought by Belgium before the European Court of Justice, in which the Court is asked to scrutinise the aspects of the arrest warrant relating to fundamental rights.
Our expectation is that the Court will deliver an unambiguous ruling not only on the issue of the legal basis but also on that of the list of crimes in respect of which the double criminality test no longer applies.
This list of 32 crimes has been the subject of recurrent debate, and we look forward to a clear statement concerning it.
Once such a clear ruling has been delivered, there will, without doubt, be further deliberations as to whether this list needs to be revised, and perhaps we can leave the matter there.
Further conclusions will then be drawn as to whether that would be proper or worthwhile.
Let me take this opportunity to point out that the Presidency of the Council sees it as most important that we should treat the uniform application of the framework decision in the individual Member States of the European Union as a core priority.
That is necessary if we are to make the mutual recognition principle a living reality.
It is also not a matter of dispute that, when the European Arrest Warrant is executed, the state executing it must safeguard human rights and, in particular, adhere to procedural safeguards.
That, too, must be our common concern.
The presidency, like your House, takes it as read in this regard that the application and functioning of the European Arrest Warrant will need to be evaluated by means of thorough and unbiased examination.
That is a quite essential consideration, and it is for that reason that the Council has already decided on a fourth round of mutual evaluation.
The work entailed by this is running to timetable.
From it we expect further results derived from practice, from which detailed knowledge applicable to practical implementation may emerge.
As for the practical use to which the European Arrest Warrant is put, I would like to state, very briefly in view of the time available, that long-term support for its implementation is available in the shape of information, readily accessible on the Internet, and provided not only by the Council Secretariat, but also by the European Judicial Network, and that the judicial atlas is also rendering outstanding service in this, so that the direct contact between the judicial authorities, which is so urgently necessary to the best possible application of the European Arrest Warrant has thereby been made considerably easier.
I would also like to highlight another aspect of not inconsiderable importance as regards practical application, which is that the European Arrest Warrant has made it possible for such formalities as certifications and so on to be kept to a minimum in proceedings between one state and another, for we now know that we do not need them if we trust each other and the mutual recognition principle is a lived reality.
I believe that the European Arrest Warrant has had a quite vitally important part to play in this.
I therefore look forward to the rest of the debate, following which I will have a few other things to say in my concluding statement.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, MrsÂ Gastinger, MrsÂ Hazan, I believe that the European Arrest Warrant can be said to constitute a symbolic measure of European judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It implements â for the first time â the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and will, as I sincerely hope, soon be enhanced by other instruments, such as the proposed European Evidence Warrant.
In addition to the European institutions, it is very important that we involve national parliaments in the debate, as was the case last October during the fruitful parliamentary sittings organised by this European Parliament.
I believe that MrsÂ Hazanâs report has enriched and, on several points, updated the conclusions drawn by the Commission with regard to the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant.
We will take account of this when drafting our second evaluation report on the implementation of the Arrest Warrant.
This second report will be sent to Parliament in June.
As early as January of this year, the Commission presented a version of its first report updated to include Italy.
A delay in transposition had in fact prevented us from including this Member State in the first report.
I agree with the bulk of the proposal for a recommendation addressed to the Council.
As regards acting on the proposal for a recommendation by considering the possibility of extending the list of 32 categories of offence for which the verification of double criminality is abolished, I feel able to say to you that, as far as I am concerned, any possible progress along these lines is, in principle, desirable.
Nevertheless, the Commission will see to it that coherence between the various instruments of mutual recognition is preserved.
The Commission therefore reserves the right to present proposals aimed at amending the framework decision once more experience has been gained.
MrÂ President, I shall now make way for the continuation of the debate, at the end of which I shall no doubt intervene to make other remarks.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs President-in-Office of the Council, the report by Mrs Hazan is exceptional.
I agree with all the recommendations and comments which she makes.
Congratulations Mrs Hazan.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European arrest warrant tests the willingness to cooperate of and the spirit of mutual respect and mutual trust between the Member States of the European Union.
It constitutes a huge step in the direction of the creation of a single area of justice and security, as well as a strong measure for combating crime.
It puts an end to fugitives from justice, an end to the complications of the political process to extradite criminal suspects.
The presumptuous invocation by certain Member States of national sovereignty, of human rights and of the alleged supremacy of their national law in order to circumvent the institution of the European arrest warrant is dangerous.
It goes without saying that each Member State individually and all the Member States in general have a fundamental obligation to comply faithfully with and apply human rights in their judicial proceedings and there is no room for needless doubt.
The institution must be strengthened and three steps need to be taken in order to do so: firstly, the institution of the European arrest warrant needs to be moved from the third pillar to the first pillar.
Secondly, the Council needs to adopt, as quickly as possible, the proposal to harmonise minimum criteria in criminal proceedings.
Thirdly, every constitutional obstacle to the application of the European arrest warrant needs to be removed.
Already in my country, in Cyprus, the Constitution is being amended within the next few days so that Cyprus can come into line with this institution.
Combating crime is not just a national issue. It is pan-European.
That is why we all need to help to strengthen the European arrest warrant.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for her very thorough work.
In fact, this report not only enables us to assess the European Arrest Warrant - the first practical instrument of the European judicial area - but also gives us the opportunity to redefine our priorities as far as the implementation of a genuine European judicial area is concerned.
As we have said, the European Arrest Warrant has been an overwhelming success: 2Â 600 warrants have been issued throughout the European Union since its creation, with the result that judicial procedures have been considerably speeded up.
Borders are therefore no longer an obstacle to justice.
This success shows that the Member States are willing to work together.
We are thus strengthening the principle of mutual confidence, which is the cornerstone of the European judicial area.
The European Arrest Warrant has nonetheless encountered obstacles put in the way of its application by certain governments, and I regret Italyâs delay in transposing the legislation.
This delay meant that the Commission was late in assessing that country.
Furthermore, the Member States interpret the warrant differently in their national laws.
This also illustrates the Member Statesâ lack of political will and the limits imposed by the method of decision making in this area.
Nevertheless, the success of the European Arrest Warrant demonstrates that it is impossible to limit ourselves to civil law.
We must be more ambitious and extend judicial cooperation to criminal law.
That is why we consider it crucial to have recourse to Article 42 and the âpasserelleâ in order to permit a minimum harmonisation of European criminal legislation.
We will thus be able to put an end to the unanimity rule, which slows down the implementation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.
Furthermore, we must bridge the democratic gap, and only the full involvement of the European Parliament in the creation of the European judicial area will enable fundamental rights to be protected.
Moreover, how can we succeed in making progress if we limit ourselves to security matters?
Let us make progress in police matters, certainly, but we must also set high standards with regard to fundamental rights.
Thus, the proposal on procedural guarantees must be addressed at the same time.
To conclude, I have a specific question to ask the Commission and the Council: when will we finally be able to make progress with other practical instruments, such as the exchange of evidence and information between criminal records bureaux?
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Hazan, Parliamentâs rapporteur.
My group broadly shares her assessment and her concerns.
I was the rapporteur who took this issue through the House.
I had the honour to do so in 2001.
However, I would not be speaking here for my group today were it not for the fact that our colleague, Mr Duquesne, who was Interior Minister in Belgium at the time and very supportive of this measure, is sadly seriously ill in hospital.
At the time we took the measure through we believed that the European Arrest Warrant offered practical solutions to the issues of greatest concern to Europeâs citizens: their safety and security.
Experience has shown that the warrant is Europeâs chief asset in the fight against cross-border crime, allowing our judicial authorities to reduce the extradition process to an average of 13 days in over half of all cases.
That is 13 days compared to the months of waiting that went before.
It has been well used by Member States and has generally worked well.
Nobody would deny that there have been some teething problems.
In addition to delays in implementation, controversial court decisions in Poland and Germany have raised eyebrows â and accusations that this measure violates fundamental rights.
Nonetheless, all Member States are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and by European Court of Human Rights case-law, as stated specifically in this measure.
I have two questions today.
The first is to the Council.
Will the Council name and shame the Member States that are blocking the framework decision on procedural rights, which would set to rest any concerns about violations of fundamental rights in this measure?
What does the Council believe is the likely timetable for agreement of the framework decision?
The second question is to the Commission.
Could the Commissioner tell us if the warrant has now been correctly implemented in the country he knows best and whether any other Member States are dragging their heels, and will he start proceedings against any Member State that has misapplied the law or limited its effects?
Â Â  .
Mr President, it is beyond dispute that the European arrest warrant is already paying off in many ways, but while it makes the extradition system more efficient, considerably quicker and also less arbitrary, it still has flaws.
At the time, my group was opposed to its introduction, because it was not accompanied by agreements on minimum standards in criminal proceedings.
What has now been done relates only to the tracing of suspects, without putting the necessary guarantees in place for their rights.
This may have the appearance of decisive action and being tough on crime, but it is at the same time an obstacle to cooperation in the area of extradition.
Three years after the arrest warrant was adopted, the situation remains unchanged.
The framework decision for procedural rights of suspects has not yet been adopted by the Council.
I would join Mr Watson in his appeal to the Council to clarify which Member States are opposed to an improvement in the rights of suspects and for what reason.
Indeed, what being said, also by MrÂ Demetriou, is that whilst all Member States must adhere to the rights of suspects and the human rights convention, there are also a huge number of legal cases running in Strasbourg.
Equally, there are very many differences between the Member States, particularly in relation to those procedures.
If we were all agreed on the rights of suspects, then the signing of this agreement on procedural rights would, of course, be a mere formality, but that is not the case, because there are many major differences which result in national courts now trying to figure out the conditions under which people are allowed to be extradited.
This means that in a number of legal cases, people have not been extradited to other EU Member States.
One example of this was a legal case in Bolzano where the local court refused to hand over an Italian to Austria.
Once we have common agreements on the rights of suspects, suspects will also be surrendered much more easily.
I would therefore ask the Council not to consider this to be a bonus for the rights of suspects, but as a necessary component, namely that repression and tracing go hand in hand, while at the same time guaranteeing the rule of law, even at European level.
After all, the lack of mutual trust between the Member States will also adversely affect the tracing aspect.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to assess the European arrest warrant a comprehensive analysis should be made of the effects that the framework decision has on legal cooperation, the mutual recognition of offences, respect for individual procedural guarantees and civil liberties.
Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing considerable problems, with some Member States having had difficulties in applying the warrant because they are actually hindered by their national constitutions.
It would, however, be a mistake to think about distorting national constitutions in order to make the arrest warrant work.
Todayâs evaluation, unfortunately, has had to do without data from one country: Italy, which, in order to protect private interests, due to a decidedly Eurosceptic and anti-European ministry, has not transposed the EU legislation by the required time.
Finally, it is not possible to think of creating a European arrest warrant without first establishing common minimum standards for criminal procedure and without putting in place shared procedural guarantees.
Parliament has already expressed an opinion on minimum procedures, and we are waiting for the Council to go forward on this point.
It has been like building a block of flats starting with the roof instead of the foundations.
In fact, the European arrest warrant can certainly be a useful tool in removing the extradition of criminals from the political arena, and there have already been some positive examples on this point, but the procedure is vitiated by a fatal flaw, an original sin that has sprung from the haste of having to react to terrorist attacks by enacting emergency legislation.
I wholeheartedly agree with the evaluation put forward by MrsÂ Hazan in her report.
The text has been improved in committee, and we have also avoided extending the list of 32 offences, but our judgment cannot help but spring from the erroneous starting-point brought about by the obsession with security.
There is an old Italian proverb that says âmore haste, less speedâ.
This applies perfectly to the evaluation of the first year of application of the European arrest warrant.
Â Â  . Mr President, I endorse this measure to fight terrorism more effectively.
In the 2002 debate, I argued that only offences for which a European, or international, definition existed should be put on the list.
The current list of offences is too broad, and that may result in legal uncertainty and discrimination.
Member States are therefore seizing every opportunity to apply the criterion of double criminality.
Mrs Hazan is right in urging the Council to ensure that this double criminality be abolished.
Initially, she even asked for the list of offences to be extended â a request that the Commission rejected.
Given the present indicators, this was not at all timely.
It is preferable to follow the developments in the next two years from a close range.
I expect that, if anything, an assessment will need to lead to the present list being cut back.
The list can only be extended whilst guaranteeing legal certainty if all specified offences are defined at European level.
It would, however, be undesirable, for criminal law to be harmonised surreptitiously on the back of this decision.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue.
Unfortunately, however, like all of us here in Parliament, the rapporteur seems to be working at somewhat of a disadvantage, because we do not have access yet to the Council and the Commissionâs evaluation mechanism concerning the operation of the European Arrest Warrant.
We can learn some things from the experience we have already gained.
On the positive side, compared with the old extradition process, the time delay has reduced dramatically.
Members speak of between 90 days and 42 days, but some extradition proceedings that would have gone on for years between Member States of the European Union in the past have now been reduced to 42 days.
However, we have to be careful to tread very softly with regard to constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms.
Some courts have put a question mark about the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, whether as regards its transposition into international law by the mechanism used or as regards the way that certain courts have interpreted elements of the arrest warrant process.
Irrespective of harmonisation, this idea of mutual respect, trust and understanding between the judicial authorities is the first step towards creating a wider and more inclusive area of judicial operation.
One of the difficulties we face is that we have different legal systems within the EU Member States, which have built up bodies of law and precedent.
To some extent that affects how we can best utilise this area.
That is why limiting the categories of offences to 32 was a good idea in the initial stage.
Now, however, after the experience we have gained, we can look at this more closely.
My last point is that we should not rush towards achieving all these goals in the short term.
Let us not forget that some countries have only transposed the framework decision in the last number of months.
We need more time to look at the evaluation and to ensure that the proper operation takes place.
Finally, fundamental respect for human rights and freedoms must be at the core of all our work in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, when our state security managed to let Fehriye Erdal, a dangerous terrorist from the Turkish terrorist movement DHKP-C, escape, the day before she was due to be sentenced to four yearâs imprisonment, and without even one minister being called to account over it, Belgium was once again held up to ridicule by the entire European Union.
In other Member States, the DHKP-C has been listed as a dangerous terror group for a long time, but not so in Belgium, where Erdal enjoyed shelter and asylum undisturbed.
I was, in spite of myself, reminded of this when we started assessing the development of the European arrest warrant.
If we want to carry out an effective assessment into the uniform rules and procedures to fight cross-border crime, including terrorism, using the European arrest warrant among others, then the only conclusion I can come to when blunders of this kind occur is that the European Union still has a very long way to go.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Hazan, on a report that is undoubtedly accurate and rigorous.
I would like to say that the approval of the European Arrest Warrant â and we must never forget this â was not simply the approval of just one more legal instrument, and nor did it merely replace an obsolete extradition system; the reality is that it was a symbol, it was a response and it reflected a new attitude.
It was a symbol of the urgent need to create a European judicial and policing space.
It was the European response to the terrible September 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York and, at the same time, it reflected the political attitude that terrorism had to be combated actively and that security had to be tackled by means of an internal European Union policy, one of the great objectives that we should be making a point of pursuing.
I must point out that I had the opportunity to present this Warrant during the era when I was in the Council of Ministers and, unfortunately, it was not approved until the 11 September attack happened.
It is therefore essential that we do not reintroduce verification of double criminality, that we resolve the various forms of incompatibility with different Constitutions and that the national judges do not introduce supplementary instruments before another attack obliges us urgently and hurriedly to introduce modifications to this extremely important Warrant.
There must not therefore be any obstacles or timidity in relation to this issue.
Unequivocal will is undoubtedly required, and we must also remember the extremely important work of a Home Affairs Minister of that era, Antoine Duquesne, who is not here today but who played a decisive and crucial role in making it possible for the European Arrest Warrant to be the subject of our debate here this afternoon.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on her report.
The European arrest warrant on its own is not an adequate tool for the creation of a European area of security, freedom and justice, nor will we achieve its proper application unless we substantially strengthen mutual trust between judges, unless we apply minimum common rules to criminal proceedings which safeguard suspects' fundamental rights and unless we achieve a rudimentary approximation of national laws.
That is why we are also calling, as a first step, for the approval of the framework decision, with the European Parliament's amendments, on certain procedural rights within the framework of criminal proceedings in the European Union.
We also hope that the future human rights service will take on a substantial role in the protection of and respect for human rights and personal freedoms and in the field of the European arrest warrant.
Â Â  Mr President, the utility of the European arrest warrant was illustrated, especially for my constituents in London, when Hussein Osman, a suspect in the 21Â July attempted bombings, was returned to Britain to face justice in weeks rather than years.
However, two thirds of Member States have introduced explicit grounds for refusal: violation of fundamental rights.
To the extent that this is valid, it justifies the welcome change of heart by the Austrian Presidency towards a conviction that there must be agreement on minimum standards for fair legal proceedings.
However, we need to do more to invest in the criminal justice system, as the European Parliament called for a year ago.
Sadly, many leading politicians give in to the temptation to criticise judges for judgments they do not like.
Last year the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, boasted of how he had battered the criminal justice system.
Instead of questioning basic rights, such as the presumption of innocence and habeas corpus, and possibly colluding in torture flights and extraordinary rendition, we need to raise standards, not lower them.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mrs Gastinger, Commissioner, in July last year, the German Federal Constitutional Court declared null and void Germanyâs law implementing the European Arrest Warrant.
It quite rightly demanded that the German legislators should fully discharge their responsibility for protecting and maintaining the fundamental civil rights guaranteed by the German Basic Law, and this ruling was without doubt a resounding clip round the ear for them.
It is with that in mind, Mrs Gastinger, that I find it quite simply incomprehensible that the Council should allow the framework decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings to drag in this way without, to date, doing anything about it.
That is quite simply unacceptable, and the accused must be given far more rights to take account of the European Arrest Warrant.
I endorse what has already been said by many Members of this House.
These rights include, of course, the requirement that the accused be informed of their rights in a language with which they are familiar.
They must have the right to avail themselves of the services of an interpreter, and it must of course be guaranteed that the documents relevant to criminal proceedings be translated.
Mrs Gastinger, the Council must at last do something about this; it is quite essential that it should, for the citizens of the European Union must have the certainty that their rights are protected and respected in the same way throughout Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, those countries used to Roman and Napoleonic law have to accept that the state governs their lives, but in Britain any such idea is an abomination.
Where I come from, the state does not exist in its own right and the government of the day answers to us: those who elected it.
Our safeguards against any attempt by the state to interfere in freedoms and rights go back hundreds of years and are protected by common and statute law.
No European has the right to detain and remove a British subject from the UK without due process, and that means protection from imprisonment after three days unless a court hears the evidence and decides otherwise.
It also means no offence can exist that is not an offence in the UK: xenophobia, for example, can stand as a charge in the UK.
We still enjoy the presumption of innocence, protection of trial by jury and freedom from double jeopardy, despite the disgraceful efforts of the Blair Government to fall into line with what the EU chooses to call law.
The people of your countries would be far better off enjoying the rights and freedoms of the British.
Learn that lesson and you might start winning hearts and minds.
Someone should tell MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m ...
Â Â  â Mrs Gastinger, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hazan on her excellent report.
As Mr Mayor Oreja said, we welcome the creation of the European Arrest Warrant as an innovative and highly effective step in developing judicial cooperation and stepping up cooperation and mutual trust.
The warrant will guarantee equal legal protection for EU citizens and will become one of the main instruments in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
Unfortunately, this first assessment has revealed a number of problems preventing it from being implemented in full and undermining mutual trust.
There have been difficulties in its transposition, for example, recourse to constitutional jurisdiction in various Member States, and practical obstacles in using the warrant, such as the translation, transmission and use of different forms.
There has also been resistance among several Member States wishing to retain certain elements of the traditional extradition system, such as control over double jeopardy and the intervention of political authorities in the judicial procedure.
I should like to highlight three points: Firstly, I wish to reiterate the benefits that adopting the draft Constitutional Treaty would bring to this area of judicial and police cooperation, in particular the removal of the pillars.
As Mr Demetriou said, we need to make use of the resources at our disposal, including the referred to in Article 42 of the Treaty enabling the Member States to incorporate the European arrest warrant in the first pillar so as to ensure greater transparency and democratic control by Parliament and legal control by the Court of Justice.
Secondly, I wish to point out that we should draw on the Nordic arrest warrant as a source of inspiration for strengthening the effectiveness of the European arrest warrant.
The Nordic arrest warrant boasts some innovative aspects, including a more effective system of delivery and shorter procedural deadlines.
Thirdly and lastly, it is crucial that, as Mr Frattini said, both Parliament and the national parliaments take part in the forthcoming assessment on the progress made in implementing the European arrest warrant.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur.
In 2002 the European Union proposed a new mechanism as part of its efforts to combat crime.
I refer to the European Arrest Warrant.
Now, almost four years later, we are to evaluate the efficiency of its implementation and provide an answer to the question as to what should be done to ensure that criminals no longer feel safe in Europe.
I would like to make just two comments, if I may.
Firstly, it is to be regretted that pursuant to the current legal system the European Arrest Warrant is a third pillar instrument and does not come within the competence of either the European Parliament or the European Court of Justice.
Clearly, a change is required.
It should be borne in mind, however, that pursuant to the European Constitution pillars will be removed and instruments for the administration of justice developed.
In addition, more procedures will become part of Community competence.
As a result, the Union should become more effective and its decisions more transparent and democratic in nature.
In this connection, it is worth highlighting that the part of the Constitutional Treaty outlining these methods was never the subject of any protest.
It was not contested in any way in the course of the recent ratification campaigns, which bodes well for this institution.
My second comment is that despite the success achieved in implementing the European Arrest Warrant, it has come up against a number of significant legal obstacles in certain countries.
The House has heard about the situation in Germany and in Cyprus.
We are aware of the position in Belgium and Italy too.
There are also difficulties implementing the European Arrest Warrant in my own country, Poland.
It has become part of the Criminal Code and is being implemented, but in April 2005 the Constitutional Court ruled that the Warrant was unconstitutional.
We were granted 18Â months to remedy the situation and now only seven months remain.
I would like to hope that Poland will resolve this contradictory situation in time.
Â Â  â Mr President, the two basic poles in European cooperation on criminal matters are the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States.
These two principles complement each other; however, their implementation is difficult to achieve and will take a great deal of time.
Nonetheless, every possible effort must be made to bring about a common criminal policy in the European Union.
The European Arrest Warrant constitutes a first, important step in the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal judgments and helps to consolidate a common legal culture.
Naturally, despite the fact that progress has been made with the procedure to adapt the European Arrest Warrant, there are still certain difficulties which continue, among other things, with the uniform or non-uniform transposition of the framework decision into the national laws of the Member States and the categories of offences whose criminality is not checked.
Particular attention must be paid to these difficulties.
Similarly, and I address myself to the President-in-Office of the Council and Austrian Minister, MrsÂ Gastinger, I wonder why there should be this list of 32 crimes and why we do not simplify the entire process by saying that all offences punished by over three years in prison are subject to this arrangement.
This would do a great deal to accommodate both national legislation and national judges.
I am certain that, with the capability which distinguishes you, Minister, you will address this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, in my concluding statement, I would like to reiterate in quite general terms that we, despite the thoroughly justified criticisms that you have made of various points today, can take it as read that the European Arrest Warrant is certainly something of which we can all be proud.
The fact is that it was a first and vital step towards our jointly combating crime and terrorism on the basis of the mutual recognition principle.
That is something very important, and it is something of which we must never lose sight.
Several Members have asked me to say something about the minimum procedural safeguards in criminal trials, and I think this is a very important point.
Mr Watson, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Catania, Mr Lambrinidis, MrsÂ Ludford and Mrs Kaufmann have raised the issue.
I am sure that you are aware that we spent a lot of time discussing this whole area during the informal Council meeting in Vienna on 13 and 14 January.
I am also sure that you are aware that this framework decision â and I do not hesitate to say what I am about to say â is, at the moment, in a sort of dead-end, and this is something that all of us in the Council very much regret.
I can assure you that we in the Council most certainly do have the political will to put these minimum procedural guarantees for the accused in criminal cases in the form of a regulation of one kind or other.
We want thereby to send out a very important political message.
There are also problems with the framework decision itself, for some Member States have doubts about the legal basis for the adoption of a legal instrument at European level, and that, as I am sure you can imagine, is an issue that it is rather difficult to evade.
A look at the details reveals that these doubts have to do, in particular, with the scope and similar points, which we are discussing, but I can assure you, on behalf of the Austrian Presidency, that we regard this as a high-priority matter and that we do want to achieve real progress on it during our presidency.
We must also, however, bear in mind the fact that the minimum procedural guarantees are one point on which we have to add value to the Human Rights Convention, more specifically to its Article 6, for that Article 6 is our common foundation in Europe, and something to which we all feel committed.
In the course of our presidency, then, we will attempt to reach a solution to this in order to take the next step, which really is essential.
What is most important to us is that we should be able to move on out of the cul-de-sac in which we currently find ourselves.
Mrs Roure raised another important issue, that of what progress we have achieved with the other instruments, essentially the European evidence procedure and the exchange of information between judicial authorities.
What I can tell you about evidence procedures is that quite considerable progress has been made on this at Council level.
It goes without saying that the list of 32 offences â to which this debate has returned again and again â is back on our agenda.
I will discuss the question later on.
That too is an item for debate, but I am full of hope that on this too we will make a great deal of progress during our presidency.
We may well manage to bring this matter to a conclusion, but, even if that proves impossible, we will be able to hand over to the Finnish Presidency a dossier which is very close to completion.
If I may turn to the framework decision on the implementation and content of the exchange of information from criminal records between the Member States and the framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the course of police and judicial cooperation, I can tell you that we are discussing this in working parties, and, here too, we believe that we will be able to move forward.
Mr Varvitsiotis asked why we do not take as a basis a three-year prison sentence rather than the 32 offences on the list, and I am able to say, in response to that, that â as I am sure you are aware â these 32 offences were the subject of long and in-depth discussion in the Council before we were able to agree on them.
That was a very difficult process, and we are now glad that we have the list.
What must not be forgotten when considering these 32 offences is that what is laid down by means of this list is that these are the areas in which, in practice, double criminality is not subject to extra scrutiny.
That is the background to the list of 32 offences.
Extradition and the application of the European Arrest Warrant continue, nevertheless, to be options in other areas in which only double criminality is checked in order for the European Arrest Warrant to come into play.
As I have already said, these 32 offences are again a subject for discussion in relation to the European evidence warrant, for we do of course know that some of these offences are very broadly defined, while others relate to very specific acts.
When seen in todayâs light, this is not really coherent, and we are well aware of this.
Even so, we are glad that it is in place, and, on the basis of the experience gained with the European arrest warrant, we will of course continue to work on this list.
I would ask you to give us time; we need time if we are eventually going to have a good basis for even better cooperation in this area.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few observations following that interesting debate.
First of all, I would like to point out that monitoring of the transposing of the law on the European arrest warrant will continue and that Parliament has at its disposal our evaluations on all the Member States, which since January includes Italy, with an additional report; in June there will be another report.
I would like to say to MrÂ Watson that, unfortunately, the Commission is not able to launch proceedings for breach in accordance with Community law since this is a third pillar instrument.
I am particularly happy to hear what some Members said regarding the possibility, with which I would obviously agree, of transferring to the first pillar an instrument that is of such great importance in the fight against terrorism and crime; that would clearly give rise to the positive result of even more effective and forceful monitoring than is currently possible for us.
We will continue to highlight the strong points as well as the weak points of each transposing law.
We will do this while remaining in continuous contact, MrÂ Coelho, with the national parliaments, since obviously we must make them aware of any problems that exist.
Sometimes these are linked to constitutional issues and at others to parliamentary issues, and they have made it difficult in some states for the procedure to be fully implemented.
In my view, this amounts to respect for the principle of proper cooperation between the institutions.
I would like to conclude by saying that it will be necessary to integrate this European action programme with the European evidence warrant.
I have already said this, but I say it again now: I find it strange that we have been able to reach agreement on transferring people from one country to another, while we have not succeeded in transferring the evidence, which is a considerably less significant element in terms of invasion of fundamental rights, and of mutual trust.
There is sufficient trust to hand over a person who has been arrested, and still we cannot succeed in agreeing on collecting a piece of evidence from one country and transferring it to another.
I agree with MrsÂ Gastingerâs assessment of the need to make real progress and I hope that with the Austrian Presidency agreement will be reached on the few remaining points of disagreement.
The same applies to procedural rights: I must thank the Austrian Presidency, which is expending great efforts in the attempt to reach an agreement, and in my opinion it does not seem that the legal basis is a reason for difficulty.
There are legal arguments, but all legal arguments lend themselves to debate.
I am convinced that there is a foundation for reaching agreement on a European initiative relating to procedural rights; in political terms this would be an extremely important signal.
I know that there is a commitment on the part of the Presidency; equally important is the commitment on the exchange of criminal record information.
At the same time, the repressive approach must constantly be balanced by boosting rights and freedoms, and this will give us one more political card with which to combat crime.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0013/2006).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
There are presently 131 senior opposition figures, including 10 elected members of the Ethiopian Parliament and including professors, judges and journalists, who are being detained in Ethiopia.
Can the Council state what measures it has taken to highlight these grave injustices with the Ethiopian Government in light of the fact that these detentions are in breach of international law, and taking into account that the European Union is the largest donor in the world of international aid to Ethiopia ?
Â Â  . Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Council, I would like to reply in the following terms to Mr Ryanâs question about opposition figures in Ethiopia.
The Council is observing the situation as regards the detained opposition leaders, representatives of civil society organisations, newspaper publishers and journalists with close attention.
Following their arrest, the European Union, on 6Â November last year, made a statement expressing its concern and calling for the release of all political prisoners.
The EU also demanded the immediate release of all detainees against whom no charges had been laid in a proper manner complying with certain minimum standards.
It also urged that all the detainees should be given the right to receive visits from their family members and from the International Red Cross and/or other appropriate representatives of the international community.
A similar demand was made in a joint statement by the ambassadors of the European Union and the United States of America in Addis Ababa on 6 November 2005.
Since the arrests at the beginning of November 2005, representatives of the European Union have regularly raised the case of these detainees in meetings with the Ethiopian Government and also brought it directly to the attention of the Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, in the course of the political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The diplomatic representatives of the European Union in Addis Ababa have agreed to raise the subject of respect for human rights and the rule of law as central elements in the political dialogue with Ethiopia, together with the demand that all those persons detained after the political demonstrations in June and November be set at liberty and that their relatives, their lawyers and humanitarian organisations be guaranteed access to them.
Let me take this opportunity to mention that I have myself discussed these issues with Lord Triesman and with Mr Hilary Benn, since we know â as I have indeed mentioned â that the various steps taken under the British Presidency were of great significance in this respect and I do of course regard continuity in this area as important.
The diplomatic representatives also agreed that they would insist on the relatives of the detainees being informed as to their whereabouts, and on the detainees being given access to legal counsel and being treated in a humane manner.
We are also giving particular attention to guaranteeing the presence of local and international observers at the trials of opposition leaders and of other persons.
The intention is that an observer should monitor the trial of the opposition leader Hailu Shawel and other persons and report back to the EU representatives in Addis Ababa.
The European Union will continue to raise these issues with the Ethiopian Government and to monitor the situation of the detainees with close attention.
Â Â  I am slightly disappointed in the answer to the question.
Our policy on development aid focuses on good governance and respect for human rights and it certainly does not seem to be the case here.
If you look at the fact that we gave approximately EURÂ 900 million to Ethiopia between 2002 and 2005, we do not seem to be getting any respect for human rights in that country.
A lot of talking is going on, but there is very little action.
I would like to raise the specific case of Berhanu Nega, the elected Mayor of Addis Ababa.
What is happening to him and has that case been raised by the Council?
Â Â  . On the supplementary question, as the honourable Member knows and as we all know, Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world.
Parts of the country, in particular in the south, suffer under great strain; there is a shortage of food and we have an obligation to help the population.
We believe that development aid and development cooperation for the poor of the country should not be used as a means of pressure against the government and should not lead to punishment of the population.
That is why the European Union does not withhold development cooperation funds but now channels them differently.
That is the point we should bear in mind.
So we are reflecting on how we should proceed.
We are reducing the part of our aid that goes to the government directly and trying to find ways and means of channelling those funds directly to the population, where it is needed.
On 13 and 14 March, there will be a conference in Paris in which the future of development aid for Ethiopia will be discussed and new ways will be found to help the poor people of Ethiopia directly, without channelling those funds directly to the government.
As to the case that Mr Ryan mentioned, I have no specific information; I will certainly look into it and will let you know the result of our inquiries.
Â Â  Why is Ethiopia one of the poorest countries in the world, as you said?
It is because of the nature of the political regime, which distrusts civil society even to channel food aid, as I witnessed when I was the chief election observer in Ethiopia.
It is also because it is a country where 85% of the population are peasants: they do not own land and therefore have no incentive to produce.
Did yesterdayâs and todayâs donors meetings take into consideration the conclusions of the European Union election observation mission, that the elections failed to respect the principles for genuine democratic elections, and which highlighted the reasons for such failure?
Why has the Council ignored this Parliamentâs calls in three resolutions to enter into dialogue ...
Â Â  . I am sorry, but I did not understand the last part of your question.
As I said, we are very much aware of the political and social circumstances in the country.
I can assure you that we take them very much into account.
I can also assure you that the conference that is now taking place has all the information relating to the political, social, economic and financial situation in Ethiopia.
Â Â  I agree with the Council that you cannot allow the poor people of Ethiopia to suffer for the inadequacies of their government.
How will the Council support civil society in delivering aid within Ethiopia?
It is clear we should not be channelling any funds through the Ethiopian Government but we should continue to encourage NGOs to be involved in Ethiopia.
However, they need logistical support to be successful there.
How will the Council assist NGOs in Ethiopia?
Â Â  . There are a number of ways and means in which the Council can and does act.
We are very interested in â and want to support â the democratisation process in Ethiopia.
I should like to mention briefly some of the instruments that we are using, one of which is the question of parliamentary procedures.
We looked into them and took them into consideration.
We have conducted a number of studies and want to help the parliament to improve its parliamentary procedures in order to enhance the possibilities of the opposition parties and to raise those procedures to international standards.
In that connection, we are also trying to design programmes and projects to educate parliamentarians.
We are helping with logistical support for the expansion and construction of a parliamentary infrastructure.
The parliament, as far as I know, has no facilities for the opposition parties.
They have no technical means of communication, so we are trying, together with the UNDP, to design projects which would be helpful in that respect.
We are also helping the parliamentarians â in particular those from opposition parties â to travel to other parliaments to gain experience: to the parliaments of, for example, India, the United Kingdom and the United States.
As you will know, the party landscape in Ethiopia is still very young, very underdeveloped, and we are trying to introduce those inexperienced parliamentarians to more traditional parliaments so that they can learn from them.
We are helping to reform the National Election Board, a very interesting initiative in my view.
Our ambassadors in Ethiopia are working on that to ensure that the National Election Board corresponds to international standards.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, as the Council Conclusions of 7Â NovemberÂ 2005 also indicate, the Council is agreed on the importance of supporting political reform in Iran and of promoting human rights and democracy.
The EU obviously wishes to see Iran develop into a society in which human, civil and political rights are fully respected, in which democratic values and freedom of expression are able to blossom, and in which equal treatment and equal opportunities prevail over discrimination.
At the same time, however, we are aware that the implementation of this objective will require sustained, long-term efforts and patience.
The Council has endeavoured in the past and will endeavour in future to promote political reform, namely by supporting various authorities and organisations in Iran, including Iranian civil society.
It is with this objective in mind that the EU has resumed its comprehensive political dialogue, and it is also making intensive endeavours towards restoring a meaningful, constructive human rights dialogue.
The EU is currently seeking the best way to support political reform and democracy in Iran, and its deliberations include strengthening the role of the media and democratic forces.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, thank you very much for that answer.
Unfortunately, no human rights dialogue is taking place in Iran.
Nothing has happened.
The current human rights abuses in Iran are on a vast scale.
Iran has a regime that breaches most human rights.
This is a state of affairs that rather recedes into the background when we debate the nuclear weapons programme, which is of course incredibly important.
I believe that a well thought-out strategy is required for dealing with the human rights situation in Iran, and I wonder if we might perhaps draw on our experience from the period when we supported the Belorussian opposition by broadcasting to it from Europe in Belorussian.
I wonder if that experience is something we can draw on.
Â Â  â MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m, we are aware that we cannot do everything at once, however much we should like to.
Nevertheless, we believe that dialogue is the only alternative open to us, as breaking off dialogue and âpunishing civil societyâ, as it were, is certainly not a viable option.
It is of course disappointing that the human rights dialogue has not been held since June 2004.
Indeed, that was why the General Affairs Council, back in November of last year, called on Iran to take steps to resume substantive discussions within the framework of the dialogue.
I can tell you, MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m, that, in recent weeks, Iran has indeed shown interest in resuming this dialogue, although the EU has laid down certain framework conditions for this, as there is no point in dialogue for dialogueâs sake.
If we succeed in imposing the framework conditions that permit a meaningful dialogue, and which also support civil society, we shall be glad to resume this dialogue.
We hope to be able to resume the dialogue â which we also hope will be meaningful and beneficial â even before the end of the Austrian Presidency.
Â Â  â The question is specifically about strengthening democratic forces in Iran.
One of the larger democratic forces in Iran is called in English the Peopleâs Mujahedin.
It is currently on the EU terrorist list, presumably because the Government of Iran put it there.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office to consider raising in the Council the issue of whether this anomaly can be removed at an early stage.
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member that not only will I consider bringing it to the attention of the Council, I bring it to the attention of the Council.
Â Â  I was pleased to hear the Councilâs response, because megaphone diplomacy is not going to work in the case of Iran.
When George Bush made his famous speech, naming Iran as part of the âaxis of evilâ, Iran was part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
It is now no longer part of that treaty, partly because it feels exiled from the rest of the world.
If you treat people as evil, they will act as if they are evil.
Will the Council assure us that it will continue dialogue with Iran but not get involved in the internal politics, not â as some of my colleagues have suggested â backing individual political parties, but opening up Iran to wider discussion?
EU backing for a single political party would be death to that party inside Iran.
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for the encouragement.
We are trying to carry on a dialogue that is meaningful and not respond in a way that would shut the door on the possibility for dialogue.
I can assure you that we will continue in this way.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to give the following reply to MrÂ Beglitisâs question.
The EUâs unambiguous position on all the activities contravening international law that are carried out by Israel in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, remains, and is expressed repeatedly, regularly, emphatically and clearly at all levels in the sustained political contact between the EU and Israel.
The tools used by the EU in following this political line are the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel, which envisages such contact, and the EUâIsrael Action Plan, which was agreed in early 2005 within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
This position has not changed; a fact that was revealed once more on the last two occasions on which we were able to discuss the Middle East peace process and the situation in the Middle East, namely at the last General Affairs Council and at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or âGymnich meetingâ, in Salzburg last weekend.
The EU and all its Foreign Ministers continue to follow this line of fairness and of speaking clearly â including to Israel â when it comes to drawing attention to activities that we consider contrary to international law.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank the representative of the Austrian Presidency but, at the same time, I want to express my regret about the bureaucratic way in which he replied, as representative of the Presidency, to my question on an issue which truly constitutes violation of the principles of international law and the Founding Charter of the UN.
To be honest, I do not understand, Minister, the double language which the European Union uses to the Palestinians and to Israel.
I see no statement, no measures being taken about the continuing settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.
I see no reaction by the European Union to the statement by the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Olmert, that he will unilaterally shape the borders of Israel by 2010.
Â Â  â I am sorry if the honourable Member felt that my answer was bureaucratic â that was not my intention.
I believe that I made myself very clear when I said that, wherever the Council considers conduct to be contrary to international law, it is taking every opportunity to say so openly at all levels.
To cite just a few examples, we have stated very clearly that we consider the wall, the separation barrier erected on Palestinian territory, to be contrary to international law.
We have unambiguously criticised Israelâs settlement policy on repeated occasions and shall continue to do so.
I hope that the honourable Member does not feel this to be bureaucratic; indeed, we are not doing it bureaucratically, but in an entirely political manner.
Â Â  Since the EU relishes and promotes cross-border infrastructural projects within its own territory, would it not be incongruous and wrong for it to object to such a project in Israel, since improved communication links can only bring cohesion and social and economic betterment to those disparate territories?
Â Â  . Yes, I would agree that we should encourage and support all people-to-people contact and all infrastructural measures that promote such contacts.
However, they have to be in line with recognised rules of international law.
That is exactly the policy of the European Union.
We encourage those contacts and projects that are in line with international law, and we criticise when they are not in line with international law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as pointed out in the question, EU companies are contributing to infrastructural projects in occupied territory.
These are projects clearly contrary to international law and international humanitarian legislation.
They include, for example, the tramline link with settlements and the new railway to Jerusalem crossing the occupied West Bank.
The French company Connex is involved in such construction projects.
What does the Council of Ministers think about the fact that EU companies are participating in these activities that are contrary to international law?
Â Â  â I can answer this question as to whether the EU should participate in undertakings, as it is not, in itself, incompatible with the remit of the Council.
I can only repeat what I have already said, and I apologise for this repetition.
Naturally, the EU supports only projects that are in accordance with international law and that conform to the rules.
Differences of opinion are possible as to precisely what is and what is not in accordance with international law but, at all events, the Councilâs view is that we naturally support only projects that are in accordance with international law.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, this question concerns the protection of fundamental rights and the principle of mutual recognition that has already been discussed.
I should like to say in reply that the Council has always emphasised that it gives absolute priority to respect for human rights, and that the Council is also actively promoting the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, with particular regard to ArticleÂ 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the relevant EU guidelines.
In addition, in the Presidency Conclusions of the Tampere European Council â which has already been mentioned here today â the Council emphasised that the principle of mutual recognition should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation, and that mutual recognition and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate the judicial protection of individual rights.
In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 26Â JulyÂ 2000, entitled âMutual Recognition of Final Decisions in Criminal Mattersâ, the Commission stated in this regard that it must be ensured that the treatment of suspects and the rights of the defence would not only not suffer from the implementation of this principle â namely the principle of mutual recognition â but that the safeguards would even be improved.
This was also confirmed in the Programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters that was adopted by the Council and the Commission.
On 28Â AprilÂ 2004, the Commission adopted a Proposal for a Council framework decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union, which it presented to the Council on 3Â MayÂ 2005.
We have already discussed this more or less intensively under the previous item on the agenda.
This proposal, which is currently being examined by the competent bodies of the Council, and with which we shall try to make considerable progress under our presidency, is aimed at improving the rights of all suspects and of defendants by guaranteeing them a uniform level of protection throughout the European Union.
In addition, the Council points out that the EU Member States have to meet their obligations under international law and, in particular, under the European Convention on Human Rights â to which, after all, we are all parties.
This is confirmed in ArticleÂ 6 of the EUÂ Treaty.
The fact that the principle of mutual recognition is being realised within the framework of a purely judicial procedure also means that legal protection is guaranteed by independent judicial authorities, which is a great advantage.
It should also be borne in mind in this connection that, as a rule, the legal instruments based on the principle of mutual recognition contain a general human rights clause confirming that the obligation to respect fundamental rights and general legal principles pursuant to ArticleÂ 6 of the Treaty on European Union is not affected.
Finally, the Proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which was presented by the Commission in JulyÂ 2005 and is currently being examined by the competent bodies of the Council, represents a further step on the way to an effective EU human rights policy.
Â Â  â I am much obliged to the President-in-Office for her comprehensive answer.
I should like to put a supplementary question relating to the European Constitution.
PartÂ II of the Constitution provides that the product of the work of the then Fundamental Rights Convention is intended, as it were, to supplement and also, to a certain extent, to reinforce the provisions of ArticleÂ 6 of the present Treaty.
Can we envisage its implementation, as already addressed by the Commission and Parliament, by the Council, too, and could that improve the situation as a whole?
Â Â  â Absolutely.
Indeed, that is one of the reasons why we regret that the European Constitutional Treaty is not yet in force, because one of the major benefits I can see in this Constitutional Treaty is that it would incorporate that very Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It would no longer be necessary to discuss precisely those minimum standards for procedural safeguards that we were debating in great depth earlier if our Treaties had a single legal basis.
I see this as a very great benefit, and for that reason it is also important to continue the discussion in one way or another.
Indeed, I am hopeful that we shall reach a solution to this in due course.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the state of emergency declared by the President of the Philippines on 24Â February of this year was lifted â as you know â one week later, on Friday, 3Â March.
Both the EU Presidency, which had come to an agreement beforehand with the local Heads of Mission in Manila, and the EU Troika, which was in Manila from 28Â February to 4Â March for the ASEAN Regional Forum Intersessional Support Group meeting on Confidence Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy, verbally expressed the EUâs concern about the recent development at meetings in the Philippines Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1Â March.
In addition, they called for the rule of law, the right to due process and human rights to be fully respected, and for the prompt lifting of the state of emergency; which, as I have said, was then indeed lifted, on 3Â March.
Â Â  â Mr President, Minister, thank you for your information.
However, I must say to you that we may have lifted the state of emergency, but five opposition members of parliament have been arrested and are now in gaol.
I should therefore like to ask you what you will do to bring about the immediate release of the members of parliament detained and of the trade unionists who are still in gaol.
Â Â  . â I can assure the honourable Member that, in these cases, as in all cases of flagrant human rights violations, especially those concerning representatives of the people, the EU is continually, regularly, and wherever possible working to ensure compliance with the relevant human rights provisions and standards.
As has already been correctly pointed out, this does not always take place in public, because that does not always produce the desired effect â sometimes silent diplomacy is better â but it does take place, and regularly.
It is very often carried out by the local representatives of the EU â including, in particular, the Troika.
It is carried out in the course of discussions with high-ranking officials from the countries concerned.
In addition, I can assure the honourable Member once again that we shall of course also continue to work on, and attend to, the cases you mentioned.
Â Â  . â In response to MrsÂ Schierhuberâs question on improved access to justice for consumers in Europe, I should like to say that, in the field of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, the Council is currently pursuing the projects envisaged by the Hague Programme of 2004 and the Action Plan 2005 implementing this. These include creating new procedures to enable EU citizens to obtain a judicial decision more quickly and more easily in the case of cross-border disputes.
In specific terms, we are concerned here with two regulations in particular: firstly, the Regulation creating a European order for payment procedure and, secondly, the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure.
These being regulations, Parliament is very closely involved in both procedures under the codecision procedure.
Both regulations create new procedural opportunities, which will also, in particular, strengthen consumer protection throughout the EU.
If consumers are faced with a legal dispute in connection with their cross-border financial transactions, they should now have recourse to the institutions organising judicial cooperation between the judicial authorities of the individual Member States.
The two new procedures will therefore supplement the instruments that have been adopted up to now in the field of judicial cooperation â the simplified procedure for taking evidence and the minimum standards for legal aid, to name but a few â and thus further augment the legal remedies within the EU.
The Regulation creating a European order for payment procedure will make it possible in future for EU citizens to obtain a European order for payment upon application to a court, in respect of payment notifications that are possibly uncontested by the debtor.
If, subsequently, no objection is forthcoming from the debtor, this order for payment becomes final and also enforceable.
This will make it easier for the creditor to subsequently assert this order in the Member States.
Further to Parliamentâs positive opinion in December 2005, it proved possible to reach political agreement on this regulation as early as 21Â FebruaryÂ 2006, at the most recent Justice and Home Affairs Council.
Once the regulation has been revised by the lawyer-linguists, it should be adopted by the Council at first reading as an âAâ item in AprilÂ 2006.
Even so, we envisage that the regulation will enter into force in two yearsâ time.
The establishment of a European small claims procedure â the second crucial point here â should simplify and accelerate the enforcement of cross-border small claims.
The small claims procedure, which is in principle designed to be conducted in writing, is one in which judicial decisions are taken in respect of claims up to a total of EURÂ 2Â 000.
The desired acceleration is to be achieved by imposing a time frame for even the individual stages of the procedure, which not only the courts, but also the parties to the proceedings will have to observe.
In addition, the court is free to determine the means of proof and the extent to which evidence is taken, according to the individual case.
Evidence may also be taken by means of modern communication technology, such as videoconferencing or similar â provided, of course, that this is also admissible in the procedures of the Member State concerned.
We intend to actively continue work on the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure during our Presidency, and indeed hope to be able to bring it a long way towards completion.
Â Â  â I am much obliged to the President-in-Office for her answer.
She mentioned the European small claims procedure and also cross-border protection for both parties.
My supplementary question is as follows: how are European consumers to be informed in future about their judicial remedies?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, generally speaking, there is a great deal of information on offer to EU citizens.
The Commissionâs Judicial Atlas, in particular, which is available to every man and woman on the Internet, plays a very valuable role in this connection, because this enables jurisdiction and similar matters to be accessed very simply throughout Europe.
That is one very important aspect.
We are of course concerned that our citizens receive as much information as possible â particularly with regard to access to justice â and so it is important that information also be passed on promptly.
To this end, it is particularly essential, from our point of view, that cooperation with the vital institutions concerned is very constructive, very swift and very efficient.
That is a crucial aspect.
I consider it vital that we carry out a great deal of work in the Member States on obtaining information from the courts, so that the required information can be transferred from the courts to the public.
That is another crucial aspect.
A sound legal system in Europe can only function if the public knows where to turn to.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, consumers are increasingly making use of the new opportunities offered by the Internet, including, in particular, -commerce.
Have there been any deliberations on this with regard to the improvement or protection of legal remedies?
How soon can we expect results that improve the current situation?
Â Â  â Generally speaking, of course, the honourable Member is right: the field of -commerce will play a quite decisive role in the Europe of the future.
There are, of course, regulatory instruments whose provisions are already starting to include consumer protection, particularly in the field of -commerce, since we are aware that frequent abuses are possible in this field.
I am also aware that individual -commerce providers are already using seals of quality and such like, which is their own form of access.
I envisage our dealing with these instruments, too, in future, although this will not be done primarily by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, but rather will fall within the domain of the Competitiveness Council.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, I, too, believe that the internal market needs a functional legal system and, particularly, a functional system of law enforcement.
What are the planned arrangements with regard to cost, however?
After all, law enforcement is always a matter of cost.
Is there to be a uniform European arrangement for this, or are we keeping to the system of individual national arrangements, as it were?
Â Â  . â The honourable Member has raised a very delicate issue, which, of course, particularly in the case of the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure, is one of the main issues under discussion.
Strictly speaking, there are no plans for compulsory representation by a lawyer under the European small claims procedure, which, of course, raises a central question regarding the matter of cost, and particularly regarding the reimbursement of court costs, for which different arrangements exist in the various Member States.
Generally speaking, we have already been making efforts to establish legal instruments within the framework of legal aid, in particular, and these are already being implemented.
