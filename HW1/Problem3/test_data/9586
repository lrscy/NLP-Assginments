(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, on what legal basis are we constructing this agency?
The Fundamental Rights Agency would have been given authority by the European Constitution.
It would be given authority by the Lisbon Treaty.
But the only legal base it has at the moment is a flimsy cat's cradle of communiquÃ©s, of press releases, of resolutions in Council.
The European Union does not have a problem with the systematic violation of human rights.
It does have a problem with the systematic violation of democratic rights.
The problem we have is that a human rights charter written down on paper is meaningless unless there are also mechanisms to hold leaders to account.
If you look at the constitutions of the former East Germany and of the Soviet Union, they were full of these wonderful promises of liberty.
But, as the peoples of those unhappy countries found, it meant nothing without democracy.
That is why, if you want to impose this human rights charter, you should consult the people first in a referendum.
Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Mr President, I too voted against this ludicrous proposal of an agency in respect of human rights in the EU.
We in the United Kingdom, like many other countries, are long-term signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Such rights as require external supervision are found there, and any court which is required is found in this city under that aegis, not under any aegis required by the EU.
So this is totally unnecessary, an utter waste of public money.
Its primary intent is to provide another layer of apparatus of statehood to the EU so that it can parade itself as some sort of a superstate within a Europe that gives rights to its citizens, rights they already have.
If it wants to give rights, then let it recognise the fundamental right to vote on matters such as this: to say 'yes' or 'no' to a constitution.
(SK) Mr Chairman, since criminal activity is increasing continuously and the threat of terrorism is growing, Europol needs to become more flexible.
The three Protocols from 2000 to 2003 that amend and supplement the Europol Convention have still not taken effect.
Surely an organisation that is promoting law cannot be effective if changes to its basic legislative instrument come into force only several years after a decision has been made to accept them.
The proposal for a Council decision deals with this situation, which is why I voted for it.
One important change in relation to the present situation is the plan to finance Europol from the Community budget and give the staff the status of EU official.
This will increase the European Parliament's involvement in the management of Europol and simplify budget and personnel management.
In addition, the European Parliament's position will be strengthened as democratic control of Europol improves.
Moreover, the Community's financial expenditure will be comparable to the current expenditure of the Member States.
(CS) Mr Chairman, please allow me to explain why I did not take part in the vote on this report.
Firstly, I think that Europol is functioning well on the basis of bilateral agreements and bilateral cooperation.
Secondly, the Czech Republic has, together with other countries, joined the Schengen area.
It is necessary first and foremost to get accustomed to this cooperation, analyse it and subsequently improve it.
In addition, any further integration aimed at transforming Europol into a European police force will require ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
Only then we can talk about possible changes to Europol's legal basis.
Mr President, I was interested to note that you cut off the microphone of my colleague, Mr Kamall, on the instant of 60 seconds, whereas you are much more generous when people are saying things you find more palatable.
One of the errors we make in the European Union is to confuse 'cooperation' with 'supranationalism'.
I am all in favour of police cooperation - any sensible person would be in this day and age.
However, I am absolutely opposed to the creation of supranational authorities - such as EUROPOL is intended to be - which, as one of my colleagues said of the Fundamental Rights Agency, is one of the attributes of statehood that the European Union is claiming.
The trouble is that these organisations lack democratic legitimacy, and that is very dangerous.
Both EUROPOL and the European Union will lack democratic legitimacy until you put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum.
Mr President, I could not disagree more with this report. I voted against.
Cooperation between police forces, yes; forced cooperation and obligation, no; especially when this police force will have within its ranks armed police that can be sent anywhere in the European Union.
We do not have armed police as a rule in the United Kingdom.
We will not suffer armed police coming in at the behest of EUROPOL.
We do not believe in it.
We run our country in a different way!
I am particularly disappointed to see that Amendments 56 and 57 were voted down, because, if passed, they would have removed immunity from that police force.
In the United Kingdom, we are used to a police force which, if it causes damage to property or violates the individual or arrests without good reason, can be charged with offences afterwards.
But then, I would not be surprised, because, after all, you are prepared to ram through a constitution without asking anybody either.
Mr President, for the second time I rise to declare my vote opposing this motion.
In Britain, there is a simple philosophy: no man is above the law; not even the Queen, the monarch of England, is above the law.
It will take due process. We have in this legislation created a situation where there are people outside the law, incapable of being pursued legitimately.
I have said in this House before: if the European Union is the answer, it must have been a bloody stupid question, and never was this so true as now.
I give you Kennedy's comments: 'Those who make peaceful protest impossible, make violent protest inevitable'.
Mr President, it is vital to cooperate across transnational boundaries on international crime, terrorism, drugs and so on.
EUROPOL is doing that job right now with other police forces.
However, creating a European police office which increases central powers will not solve the problems that have arisen in local communities around Britain.
My country, my party, has voted against this resolution today as loyal Conservatives.
My party has also requested that we have a referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty.
I have no place other than this House to protest at what Mr Brown is doing in reneging on a pledge he gave to hold such a referendum.
I would therefore ask that we request Mr Brown to give the British people that referendum.
Mr President, I understand that this proposal for a Council decision, as outlined in the report, provides for the conversion of EUROPOL into an EU agency.
We must recognise that this will have two consequences.
First of all, funding will have to be provided from the Community budget, and EUROPOL staff will acquire the status of Community officials.
The report also contains provisions for coordination, which we all welcome, and organisation and implementation of investigations and operational activities carried out in conjunction with the Member States' relevant authorities or by joint investigation teams.
The Conservatives favour open cooperation between police forces across the EU and beyond in the fight against crime.
But we really do not accept that the EU has any role in centralising such cooperation.
Thus, EUROPOL is an agency which is not necessary since other organisations already exist to fulfil this function at a global level.
It is for this reason that I would like to add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate.
Mr President, I am glad to have this opportunity to make an explanation of vote.
I put in for speaking time in the debate on this issue, but one of the consequences of my party's unhappy mÃ©salliance with the European People's Party is that British Conservatives are systematically denied speaking time in important debates.
What I wanted to say was that this report is based on a conceptual misunderstanding.
People say that, because we have cross-border crimes, and because crime is international, we need cross-border policing.
We already have it.
The police forces of the nation states have for decades been collaborating to great effect.
We have Interpol, we have the Hague Convention, we have extradition treaties, we recognise the time spent in another country's prison as constituting part of a sentence, and so on.
The difference is that these things are based on democratic decisions between independent states, whereas what is being proposed with EUROPOL is the federalisation of what ought to be a sensitive national issue - namely the policing of criminal law.
If we want to do that, we should first ask people in a referendum, which is why we need a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Mr President, some of the reasons propagated for this proposal on EUROPOL are quite bogus.
It is suggested that we need to change the legal base; that we need to provide it with EU funding; that we need those it employs to be EU officials; that we need to expand its remit; and that we need an agency so that we can fight organised crime and terrorism.
What utter nonsense!
We have been fighting organised crime and terrorism quite effectively, through proper long-standing cooperation between police forces.
This is all about creating another aspect of the apparatus of EU statehood, so that it has an effective EU police force.
That is what those officials will be, meddling in the internal affairs of Member States and - as has been pointed out - with immunity for their actions, beyond the reach even of judicial review in nation states.
It is a preposterous proposal and utterly unnecessary.
Mr President, regarding the Polfer report, the Conservatives did vote with the rapporteur on the issue of the South Caucasus.
But it is again rather curious, is it not, that, while we are so anxious to protect the democratic freedoms and the rights of the people of the South Caucasus, and to ensure that they have a legitimacy and that they can express their self-determination, when it comes to the serious issue of the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union, Mr Brown of the Labour Party, who promised to give us a referendum, has now reneged on a referendum.
My party, the Conservative Party, is incensed that a promise has been reneged on and that is why I am standing here asking the Labour Government to give us a referendum on this important constitutional issue, just as we are concerned about what is happening in the South Caucasus.
Mr President, I understand that this report welcomes the inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia into the European neighbourhood policy and the endorsement of bilateral European Neighbourhood Policy action plans.
I also understand that the rapporteur calls on the EU to develop a regional policy for the South Caucasus to be implemented jointly with the countries of the region.
Of course, one of the watchwords that will appear in many of these reports is the word 'democracy'.
I represent London - you may not be aware of this.
I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world, and we happen to have a very diverse community in London, including many people from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
One of the things that they welcome about living in London is democracy and the right to have their say on vital issues.
They ask me all the time, 'Why is it that you are preaching to us about democracy, yet you deny that very right to your citizens in Britain when it comes to a referendum on the Constitution?'.
So the Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate.
Mr President, may I thank you for the patience and good humour you are exhibiting in this session.
May I also, as yesterday, extend my thanks to the services and the interpreters for humouring us.
The big issue in the South Caucasus region at the moment is the dispute over election results.
The West more or less connived at the Saddam-like election victory of the current Georgian Government the first time around with its vote of well over 90%, and now, when it claims re-election, we are arguing about whether that vote was free and fair.
What kind of example do we in the European Union hold up to these struggling democracies when we show such contempt for our own democratic process here in the European Union?
It seems periodically necessary to remind this House that 55% of French voters and 62% of Dutch voters voted 'no' to the European Constitution, and yet we have the document coming back - this time without any referendums - as the Lisbon Treaty.
I say it again: it is necessary to give the people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
Mr Hannan, my good humour is matched only by yours.
I always wonder how you manage to fit in a reference to a referendum.
You succeed in doing so every time, no matter what topic we are discussing.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this measure not because it was my considered wish to do so, but because, as a loyal Conservative, I was following the whip.
Left to myself I would probably have abstained or perhaps voted against.
I have to say that issues concerning the Black Sea are not the top priority for my electors in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, and I suspect not the second or third priority either.
Therefore, you could in a sense say that this was not a matter of the very greatest importance.
However, I do not believe that the European Union should have a common foreign and security policy.
I believe that nation states should have their own foreign policies, and am perfectly happy for them to work together in cooperation when that is in their interests - be this with states in the European Union or with states outside it.
In any case, the common foreign and security policy can have no democratic legitimacy if there is to be no referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Mr President, without doubt this new policy is aimed at facilitating, amongst other things, the supply of oil and gas through that region to Western Europe.
That would be Russian gas and Russian oil, and you are now allowing yourselves to be possibly taken hostage.
We all know that Russia cut off the supply of gas to Ukraine two Christmases ago; once they get an even bigger share of Western Europe gas supplies, perhaps they might do it to all of us at some time.
At least here in France they have got the right idea, generating at least 70% of their electricity by nuclear power, and it is about time the EU formulated a policy to promote that right across the Union.
But instead, of course, you go dabbling in the south Caucasus, around the Black Sea, with regimes that are not terribly stable; with regimes that may not want us there.
But of course, you would rather do that than promote a referendum on the new constitution amongst your own people.
Mr President, I am pleased to say that I am still here, even if you and others may not share my pleasure at being here.
I would like to thank you all for your patience.
I understand that this own-initiative report actually welcomes the Commission's communication 'Black Sea Synergy - a New Regional Cooperation Initiative', which aims to enhance cooperation with and within the Black Sea region by supplementing existing bilateral policies with a new regional approach.
It considers that, in order to adopt such an approach, the communication has to be followed by further consistent steps on the part of the EU to encourage a genuine regional dimension tailored to this era.
What region are we talking about?
Let me just clarify - the Black Sea region comprises the EU Member States Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, as well as Turkey and ENP partners Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, as well as the Russian Federation.
The great philosopher Brook Benton - followed and copied by the great philosopher Randy Crawford - once said, 'It's a rainy night in Georgia'.
Indeed, when the people of Europe are denied their vote and the people of Britain are denied their vote in a referendum on the Constitution, it is a rainy night in the EU for democracy.
Mr President, I appreciate your courtesy.
I am glad to be able to speak on this report because it seems to me that the European Union, in its treatment of Turkey, is making a generational, a possibly epical mistake.
It now seems very clear that we are never going to admit Turkey to full membership.
It is clear from the majorities in this House; it is clear from the promises of referendums in Austria and France, where there are majorities of 70% and 80% respectively against membership.
Had we said initially to Ankara that this was the case and we were going to work out some kind of alternative, we might have been able to go ahead in amity and partnership.
Instead we are stringing the Turks along, imposing tens of thousands of pages of the acquis communautaire on them, making them grovel about Armenia, about Cyprus, about the treatment of their minorities and then, possibly 10 or even 15 years from now, after all of this, we will flick two fingers at them.
In so doing, we risk creating the very thing we purport to fear: an Islamist state.
Turkey is more of a democracy than the European Union.
It changed its government peaceably.
I wish we would have the courage to consult our own people.
Pactio Olisipio censenda est!
(SK) The Black Sea region, an area of production and transit, has a strategic significance for the diversification and security of energy supplies to the European Union.
I am convinced that regional cooperation should, in addition to Turkey and Russia, include the EU Member States as equal partners too.
That is why I have voted in favour of the report.
I am concerned about the continuing conflicts in this region, which are a threat to the stability and development of the area.
I would therefore call on the European Union to play a more active role in the efforts to resolve the conflicts in this strategic area, in particular to get involved in the peace operations and to cooperate more closely with the Russian and Ukrainian Governments.
There are obvious problems as regards the uneven development of the private sector in many countries around the Black Sea.
It is necessary to improve the investment environment in the region, for local and international companies, through measures to improve the fight against corruption and fraud and promote market economy reforms.
In accordance with the decision of this House, the explanations of vote will continue after this afternoon's votes.
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my full support for this report, the fruit of a lengthy and excellent job by our colleague Michael Cashman.
The European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia was transformed into an Agency tasked with safeguarding and promoting human rights, the Agency being officially established on 1 March 2007.
Ever since then, we must acknowledge, it has been wholly non-operational owing to the lack of a director and a multiannual framework.
In response to this sluggishness and bureaucratic inefficiency, the rapporteur proposes amending the multiannual framework in a minimum number of areas.
He urges the Commission and Council to speed up the process of selecting candidates for the post of director so as to facilitate a rapid agreement among the EU institutions, thereby reactivating this vital tool to safeguard citizens' human rights.
I would call upon my fellow Members to support this report, since it represents an initial step towards making the Agency operational.
Support for EU human rights policies and their development cannot and must not be subject to considerations and delays of a political and economic nature.
in writing. - (PT) I obviously supported the creation in February 2007 of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights as I believe that this Agency could significantly help to increase the coherence and cohesion of EU policy on fundamental rights.
The Agency was officially established on 1 March 2007 but is still waiting for the basic elements so that it can become fully operational, in other words the appointment of its director and the approval of a multiannual framework.
This initiative aims to adopt this multiannual framework, which must guide the Agency's work over the next five years by defining the thematic areas in which it must act.
I therefore welcome the enormous effort made by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, to facilitate the negotiations, and I hope, like him, that this encourages the Commission and the Council to conclude both the discussions on this multiannual framework and the process of selecting candidates for the position of director as soon as possible.
The people of Europe will not understand the reason for further delays preventing this Agency for Fundamental Rights from becoming fully operational.
in writing. - (PL) I am opposed to the creation of a European Fundamental Rights Agency, and therefore I did not support the Multi-Annual Framework for 2007-2012.
I believe that the proposed creation of this agency and its functions are not only a waste of money but also a dangerous political initiative, whose long-term effects will be damaging to the Member States of the Union, The basic tasks assigned to this agency amount to a clear intrusion into the sovereignty of Member States.
The agency's existence cannot be justified. There are already institutions charged with safeguarding democracy and protecting human rights in every European country.
In my view, this agency's activities will inevitably extend beyond the thematic areas for which it was established.
For example, in the course of today's vote on Amendment 6 to the recitals, the question of defining a human being and establishing the point at which it acquires human rights arose.
I consider this type of action to be an outrageous attempt to covertly impose dangerous ideological notions in the framework of the European Union.
in writing. - I support this report, despite my opposition and disappointment that the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, set up following the recommendations of the Council of Ministers' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia, where I represented the European Parliament, has now been dissolved into a wider European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
The Monitoring Centre in Vienna did extremely valuable work on promoting best practice in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and preventing their rise, as well as reporting on the current state of play across the Union and in applicant countries.
The danger is that this will be lost, or at least diluted, in this new Agency.
I will watch developments with care.
in writing. - (FR) The PPE-DE Group's French delegation welcomes the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012.
Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency's activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully.
The French delegation, following the group line, rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma. It did so not in order to express their opposition to this legitimate and justifiable goal, but because these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency's thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities.
We welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens.
in writing. - (PT) Leaving aside the aspects criticised, which we have already had the opportunity to highlight, once the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights becomes operational in due course, its actual purpose will be clarified.
In the debate on the definition of the objectives and priorities for its Multiannual Framework for 2007-2012, its thematic areas were clearly restricted to the following was clear: racism, xenophobia and related intolerance; discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or sexual orientation or of persons belonging to minorities; compensation of victims, prevention of crime and related aspects relevant to the security of citizens; protection of children, including the rights of the child; immigration and integration of migrants; asylum; visa and border control; participation in the Union's democratic functioning; human rights issues relating to the information society; and access to efficient and independent justice.
The European Parliament has added extreme poverty and social exclusion.
However, social rights, including the rights of workers, have not been regarded as a priority, even at a time when fundamental social rights are being called into question by the policies promoted by the EU.
in writing. - (FR) Like the French delegation in the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012.
Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency's activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully.
Like the French delegation and the PPE-DE Group, I rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma.
In fact, these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency's thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities.
I welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the amended proposal because it contains improvements in data protection.
However, I do not agree with the increasing move of justice and home affairs issues from the Member States to the EU.
For this reason, I voted against the legislative resolution.
in writing. - (FR) I strongly support the report by our excellent colleague Mr DÃ­az de Mera.
The transformation of Europol into a Community agency is a request I have always supported.
It means in fact that from now on Europol will be financed by the Community budget, and that the status of Community official will apply to Europol personnel.
In both cases, the powers of our Parliament have been considerably enhanced.
Moreover, the Council decision substantially broadens Europol's scope and capacity for action, which I also support.
In short, making Europol more operational and subjecting it to genuine democratic control is a decision I support unreservedly.
in writing. - The Council's wangling has been entirely successfully: transforming the European Police Office, Europol, from its status as an intergovernmental agency financed by the budgets of the Member States into a European Union agency financed by the EU budget, and applying the status of Community official, all on the grounds of technical, not political, requirements.
Since Europol's missions have in fact been extended significantly to encompass areas other than organised crime, the Council feels that the new objectives will be better dealt with at EU level than at Member State level.
Thus, in the name of the extremely questionable principle of subsidiarity, the Europeanist logic of systematic elimination of competences of the Member State and deepening of the supranational model is applied.
This is exactly the philosophy and the approach of the reforms in the Lisbon Treaty, which European and national leaders as a body wish to impose on the peoples and nations against their will.
Europe is no longer listening to its peoples.
Worse still, it is disregarding them and lying to them.
Now that 26 European countries have already announced they will not ratify this Treaty by referendum, let us hope that the nations and peoples of Europe will be saved by a rejection of this ridiculous text by the Irish, the only people who are allowed to decide for themselves.
in writing. - (PL) The Member States of the European Union created Europol as an institutional response through which to combat organised crime.
We are today debating broadening Europol's competences and streamlining its operations, 12 years after it was established.
The rapporteur has made an accurate assessment of Europol's current legal and factual situation.
He rightly criticises the overly complicated and lengthy procedure envisaged to change Europol's status and include it in the Union's organisational structure.
The corrective measures proposed in the report are also worthy of consideration and support.
Earlier attempts to change Europol's competences show how difficult it is for countries to reach agreement when they are bound by the principle of unanimity.
I therefore believe that only when the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and comes into force in all 27 Member States will we be able to introduce procedural changes and improve this situation, as the Treaty will also reform the decision-making process within the EU.
In addition, bestowing the status of an EU agency on Europol, with all the consequences that involves, including financial, will enable the European Union as a whole to combat organised crime more effectively.
in writing. - (PT) As neither the Treaty proposal nor this proposal to adopt by qualified majority decisions on regulations relating to the structure, operations, field of action and tasks of Europol have been ratified, the EU institutions are already tiring of trying to convert the European Police Office into a European agency.
In addition to our fundamental criticism of this process, we are concerned that we are facing:
the possibility that 'special categories of data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, party or trade union membership, sexual orientation or health' will not be excluded from processing;
the failure to adopt safeguards for the protection of personal data processed in the field of police and judicial cooperation at EU level and in relations with third countries, particularly with the US (e.g. air passenger data);
the failure to guarantee access by an individual to his data or even to be aware that his personal data is being processed by Europol;
the failure to clarify the control by national parliaments.
This would be a flagrant breach of citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees.
in writing. - (ES) I voted for the text agreed by consensus with the contributions of the groups.
It is an issue that affects essential cooperation against crime.
I must point out, however, as did my colleagues Mr Fava and Mr Moreno, that the lofty goals of the resolution are at odds with the recalcitrant attitude of the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera, who was Director-General of the Spanish Police on 11 March 2004 and who refused to cooperate with the court that presided over the trial on Europe's largest ever terrorist bombing.
Moreover, the rapporteur is one of the major propagators or collaborators of the disgraceful theory that it was not Islamist cells, but ETA terrorists, that were responsible for this massacre.
Mr DÃ­az de Mera and others who described themselves as 'peones negros' (black pawns) attempted to mislead international public opinion and, even though their standpoint was in the end not treated as a crime (it was subjected only to a sanction and serious admonishment from the Court), this Parliament should be acquainted with all the facts.
Their personal attacks reveal their lack of arguments.
Finally, I wish to express my regret that Mr DÃ­az de Mera did not even have the dignity of his colleague Jaime Mayor, who at least removed his name from the terrorism text.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to vote in favour of the DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra report on the establishment of the European Police Office (Europol).
Changing circumstances within the European Union, new forms of criminal activity and new terrorist threats mean that the existing body is in need of reorganisation.
I nevertheless feel that certain points should be clarified.
The transformation of Europol into an EU agency must not place an additional financial burden on Member States; above all, it must not consume any of the already insufficient state resources earmarked for national police forces.
On the contrary, the investigative authorities and those responsible for law and order must be better looked after and reinforced.
Indeed, Europol's activities must consist of supporting and coordinating the fundamental, irreplaceable work of the various Member States' police forces.
I am therefore pleased that the proposal contains provisions for the coordination, organisation and conduct of investigations and operational activities in conjunction with the Member States' competent authorities or by joint investigative teams.
in writing. - (PT) This own-initiative report reveals the true ambitions of the 'European Neighbourhood Policy', specifically for the South Caucasus.
These are to set out the geostrategic agenda in its political, economic and military aspects, in other words the EU's plan for intervention in this neuralgic area, with increased pressure being put on China and Russia.
This will result in more interference in, and manipulation of, the conflicts arising from the dismantling of the USSR, with the aim of ensuring that the EU's major powers and financial/economic groups gain control over this region, with the inter-capitalist rivalries also being clearly evident.
You only have to look at the 'recommendations', such as the incentive to conclude free trade agreements and the pursuit of further liberalisation or the clear appeal for interference through 'support' for the action of 'civil society', ensuring that 'the [Community!] funds are distributed ... without ... state interference'.
The approach to the energy issue is particularly significant as it highlights the importance of energy brokers who can bypass Russia and the control over energy infrastructures and sources.
Finally, we note the incoherence between 'its unconditional support for the territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognised borders of Georgia' and the appeal to the principles of the United Nations Charter, when this is not being done for Serbia.
in writing. - (PT) This is another own-initiative report which assumes the same logic as the report on the Southern Caucasus and the 'European Neighbourhood Policy': in other words, interference and pressure to guarantee access to (and control over) markets (particularly energy markets) and further liberalisation.
The report argues for the promotion of 'market economy reforms', encouraging 'harmonisation and further liberalisation measures' and supporting 'the creation of a free trade area in accordance with WTO principles'.
This is a process in which the EU allegedly has 'a leading role to play' in 'encouraging the region to take the necessary steps'.
At the same time the report 'stresses the crucial importance of establishing and developing good neighbourly relations among the countries of the Black Sea region and with their neighbours, based on mutual respect, territorial integrity, non-interference in each others' internal affairs and the prohibition of the use of force or threats to use force, as fundamental principles for fostering regional cooperation' and yet it argues for the promotion of 'European values', 'irrespective of the degree of willingness shown by partner governments'.
This is a clear contradiction/incoherence between what is recommended (for others) and what is done.
The EU is demanding that others respect what it itself does not respect.
What cynicism.
in writing. - (DE) Until a short while ago Kenya was a holiday paradise for many people.
Visitors were well shielded from the massive corruption and terrible poverty in which a large majority of the population have to live.
Since the events of late December and the fraudulent presidential elections, Kenya and its political problems have suddenly been on everyone's lips.
While the parliamentary elections were generally regarded as successful by the official observers, doubts were raised as to the accuracy of the results of the presidential election.
In tabling today's motion for a resolution on Kenya, we are once again condemning the widespread irregularities and the conduct of the incumbent President Kibaki, who in rejecting the offer made by President John Kufuor to help resolve the crisis has seriously undermined the mediation efforts.
We call on Kenya's political leaders to do everything in their power to prevent further violence in the country and to ensure respect for human rights.
During the debate on this subject we again discussed and examined the question of the effectiveness of direct budgetary aid.
This topic, like that of Kenya, is one that will continue to occupy us in the months ahead.
in writing. - (PT) This explanation of vote is intended to point out that, by recognising the mediation efforts begun by neighbouring countries, by the Southern African Development Community and by the African Union, we believe that the Kenyan people will be able to find and define their own path.
It is up to the Kenyan people themselves to find the solutions to overcome the current situation in their country.
As a result, we regard as negative any attempt by the EU to interfere, as indicated and proposed in the resolution, particularly bearing in mind the objectives proclaimed by the EU in its 'Strategy for Africa' and the framework of inter-imperialist cooperation/rivalry concerning this continent that is also clearly evident and that is so deeply felt in this region.
Finally, I must highlight the omission from the resolution of a reference to the severe and deteriorating socio-economic situation in this country - which is at the root of the expression of popular discontent manifested in the elections - and the deep responsibility for this situation of the neo-liberal policies promoted, in particular, by the international financial institutions, major capitalist powers and their transnational companies.
in writing. - (CS) I fully support our resolution on the situation in Kenya, which is based on an up-to-date investigation by the EU observer mission in Kenya at the start of the year.
We must ensure that the authorities in Kenya investigate, without delay, the circumstances surrounding the elections and prevent further violence.
We must insist on the return of live broadcasting and on the adherence to basic human rights and the rights laid down by the African Charter.
However, this resolution detract from the responsibility of the European Commission to resolve the issue of the transfer of â¬ 400 million to the Congolese Government.
I think that we shall be returning to this issue soon.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of paragraph 20 of the report on the role of women in industry because it is essential that the Commission carries out a study into the negative consequences of long working hours on private, family and social life, such as children spending a lot of time alone, left to their own devices, which often leads to failure at school and crime.
The Member States must improve monitoring of undertakings that force their employees to remain at work beyond the statutory working hours and they must impose harsh penalties on these undertakings.
in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament today adopted my report on the role of women in industry.
This is very positive, although I do regret certain minor amendments.
However, the report recognises the important role of women in industry and it calls on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures, including effective monitoring, to combat stereotyping and discrimination, particularly wage discrimination.
This situation is even more serious when you consider that women's wages are around 30% lower than men's wages in industry, whereas the average for other sectors is 15%, despite the Equal Pay Directive having been around for more than 30 years.
It stresses the importance of collective bargaining in the fight to abolish discrimination against women, in particular with regard to access to employment, wages, working conditions, careers and professional training.
It stresses the importance of Community programmes that encourage the creation of trademarks, the protection of products' designation of origin and the external promotion of Community products from industrial sectors where women predominate.
Finally, it is very important to ensure recognition of the right of female and male workers to take part in restructuring processes affecting industrial undertakings, by guaranteeing their structures, in particular the European Works Councils, full access to information and the possibility of decisive intervention, including the right of veto.
in writing. - (SV) This report deals with a number of aspects which, in themselves, are important but in respect of which the Member States retain the power to act and the responsibility to develop and improve their legislation.
The gender ratio on company boards, the development of equality plans in large companies and the proportion of female members of company boards are not questions which are best and most effectively regulated at EU level.
We have thus voted against the report in question.
in writing. - (PL) Clearly, European industry is undergoing far-reaching change.
It is therefore hard not to recognise its strategic importance for the development of all Member States of the European Union and their citizens, regardless of gender.
The role of women employed in European industry and the opportunities available to them depend not only on a country's level of economic development, but also on traditions regarding acceptance of equal opportunities and respect for human rights regulations.
There is large-scale participation of women in industry and they make a substantial contribution in almost all sectors.
Nonetheless, one has to agree with the rapporteur that the role of women in industries involving cutting-edge technologies, such as the aeronautical industry or the chemical industry, is very inadequate.
It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the report highlights this aspect and focuses quite rightly on gender issues.
The report also emphasises that women's involvement in industry cannot be limited to work in sectors that do not require qualifications, where women are the first to suffer when restructuring takes place.
The rapporteur calls for support, especially for SMEs, to enable the relatively high level of female employment to be retained, particularly in the case of women who find themselves in an unfortunate professional situation.
This suggestion is worthy of support, as is the entire report, if only for this reason.
in writing. - I support paragraph 33 because such proactive measures need to be taken - at least on an interim basis to ensure participation of women in the decision-making process at all levels.
In addition to this I strongly support paragraph 20 as there is a real need for a full investigation into the impact that long working hours have on health, both physical and mental, as well as on family life.
If we are to promote a work life balance and family friendly policies then we need such a study.
in writing - (PL) Human rights are the foundation of democracy.
These rights include the very important principle of equality between women and men, allowing of course for the circumstances arising out of the biological differences between them.
One aspect of this issue concerns the employment and role of women in industry.
It is simply impossible to apply an arithmetical division into equal halves.
Above all, what we are concerned with is equality of opportunity, which is conditional on access to education and professional training in technical and economic subjects.
Another very important issue is providing assistance to mothers bringing up children and ensuring they are not discriminated against in the workplace.
It is essential to introduce flexible provisions regarding pensions for women bringing up children.
The period of so-called parental leave must be credited in full and added to the period considered as time in employment under pension rules.
In many of our countries women are still being paid significantly less than men for work of equal quality and quantity.
There can be no justification for creating obstacles impeding women from undertaking managerial and supervisory roles on company boards of directors or boards of trustees.
Action is needed to do away with stereotypes in this regard.
The report tabled represents a step in that direction, which is why I voted in favour of it.
in writing. - (FR) In many recitals and paragraphs of this extremely long resolution, we are stating the obvious.
We are calling for measures that were, fortunately, taken some time ago.
It is true that certain directives on equal treatment and opportunities between women and men have been poorly applied, but if discrimination still remains in the areas covered by this set of measures, who is at fault?
All these directives contain appeal mechanisms.
Women who have experienced discrimination need only go to court, where they will win their case, as demonstrated in many cases in my country, thankfully.
Unfortunately, this report contains a number of incongruous claims that bear no relation to the role of women in industry.
Asking for a 40% quota of female representation on company boards is interference contrary to the principle of subsidiarity in issues reserved for Member States.
It is not for us to call for the 'monitoring' of company delocalisation.
It is utopian to demand 'more choice in the workplace'.
If my company is based in the city of Luxembourg and has no other branches, I cannot put in a request to work in Schifflange where I live.
I voted for this report in accordance with these observations.
in writing. - (CS) I agree with many of the ideas in the report on women in industry.
However, I am not happy that specific attention was not given to the regional unemployment among women who lost their jobs in European textile factories at the time when this was happening.
I also think that no amount of quotas for the employment of women will solve the situation.
My second comment concerns the balanced division of time between work and family. This affects women as well as men.
I do not think that the solution lies in resolutions. It lies in the implementation of the European concept of flexicurity.
Holland is one example where an excellent legislative framework has been developed for part-time work.
The result has been reduced unemployment, as well as giving men and women more time for family life.
An effective use of shorter working hours also shows that it does not have to lead to a reduction in income.
in writing. - (SV) As a liberal and a member of the Liberal Party of Sweden, Folkpartiet, I always find reports from Parliament on equality somewhat tricky.
The Swedish Liberal Party has over the years taken the view that the best way to proceed in these matters is on a voluntary basis but we also realise that this is not always enough.
Sweden's positive engagement in this field has made us known as one of the world's most equal countries.
So do we not want to disseminate our successes across the EU?
Of course we do!
The question is merely by what methods.
In the report in question I felt obliged to vote against a number of paragraphs whose spirit I support but whose scope and approach seem dubious.
I think that both equality plans and measurable targets may be important tools for enterprises.
On the other hand, I do not believe it is something that the EU should concern itself with as a primary issue.
The same applies to the establishment of an EU-sponsored 'methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail' that will 'guarantee' equal pay.
The Global Adjustment Fund, about which I had severe misgivings from the beginning, also should not take special account of gender - that would be to perpetrate a double injustice.
One cannot expect every report to be written as though one had drafted it oneself, but there is much to find fault with here.
Yet the subject is so important that, in the end, I voted in favour of it as a whole.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Figueiredo on the role of women in industry.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and thorough report.
The issue of equal rights for men and women is a very important one and we must continue to give it as much attention as possible, since the European Union is based on the principle of non-discrimination.
We should give priority to tackling all indications of failure to comply with this principle.
This is particularly necessary because the nature of industry is changing as we strive to create a knowledge-based society.
The sectors in which women were traditionally employed are linked to the processing industry, whereas the newest sectors of industry are based on the development of the latest technologies, such as information and communication technologies.
We should make every effort to ensure that the principle of equal opportunity is complied with in these new sectors.
in writing. - (IT) The resolution on which we are about to vote cannot fail to receive the support and vote of the UEN Group.
We hope that there will soon be better regulation of the Internet aimed at protecting children and taking more effective measures against providers that host child pornography websites.
Immediate action must be taken by all EU Member States to close down illegal sites, by means of better coordination among the police forces responsible.
In addition, we hope that it will be possible to tackle the sensitive issue of information exchanged by terrorist organisations thanks to the Internet, and that this matter might be the subject of future forums.
There can be no freedom without rules and, most importantly, the Internet cannot and must not be an area of freedom for those who commit criminal acts and preach hatred and intolerance.
An emergency must be tackled by means of decisive, urgent measures and not improvised ones.
The fight against terrorism and hatred between peoples must be a rule and a goal of the European Union and all free, democratic countries.

Arrest of Chinese dissident Hu Jia (debate)
- The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the arrest of the Chinese dissident Hu Jia.
author. - (DE) Madam President, our Group has nominated Hu Jia and his wife, Zeng Jinyan, for the Sakharov Prize.
Because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in China.
The renewed arrest of Hu Jia has only served to demonstrate something that he himself warned of.
Does China by its action wish to show its contempt for the opinion of the European Parliament?
Human rights must be firmly enshrined as an issue that cuts across all the relations that exist between the EU and China.
We too must act in a coherent and consistent way and should not simply sacrifice our values on the altar of good economic relations.
We are therefore calling on the Council and the Commission not just to take up a position for Hu Jia but also to use the next EU-China summit to call for a commitment to human rights.
China has to put a stop to the systematic intimidation of human rights activists.
If China does not change its conduct we will again need to raise the issue of our participation in the Olympic Games.
Moreover, Russia is set to host the next Winter Olympics and that country also has a poor record when it comes to human rights.
(Applause)
Madam President, the problem of human rights in China keeps coming up in these urgent debates, always with good reason.
China's economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties, abuse of power by the authorities, room for opposition and independence of the judiciary.
Harsh penalties are still being imposed, including frequent use of the death penalty.
China is not the only country that sentences people to death and executes them, but it is the champion in this.
The only progress that we have seen is that more care is now taken to be certain of the perpetrator's guilt before the death penalty is carried out, so fewer people are being put to death who later turn out to be innocent.
Meanwhile, the international focus on the three great dramas in China has to a large extent disappeared.
The bloodbath in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the persecution of the supporters of the Falun Gong movement and the changing of the composition of the populations of Tibet and East Turkestan are being given less and less attention.
All the attention is now going to economic growth, export opportunities to China, opportunities for cheap imports from China, the growing role of China in Africa and the coming Olympic Games in China.
Under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling.
The Olympic Games have become an argument for pulling down residential areas and driving the residents away.
Chinese ambassadors say that their national honour is violated when this is criticised from abroad.
The coming Olympic Games could have been an occasion for improvement.
As things look at the moment, they will be good for tourism and good for the completion of major public works, but not good for improving human rights.
In the Netherlands, meanwhile, a debate has started about the possibility of boycotting these Olympic Games.
A resolution about a single arrested human rights activist, Hu Jia, is necessary but it is not enough.
The most important factor in the relations between Europe and China should not be economic self-interest but our concern about human rights in China.
author. - (PL) I agree with Mr Meyer who said just now that we should boycott the Olympic Games because of the persecution to which the Chinese people are subject in China.
Indeed, it is not only the Chinese who are constantly being persecuted in that country.
The persecution of the Tibetan people and other national minorities has often been raised in this House.
We are today referring to the illegal detention and persecution of an activist in the cause of freedom, a person who is fighting for freedom in China, namely the politician Hu Jia.
His wife and family have shared his fate.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can remember when the Olympic Games hosted by the Soviet Union were boycotted several decades ago.
That action contributed to the fall of the Communist regime.
We cannot now allow ourselves to be dazzled by China's economic success.
Congratulations are due to China on the latter, but we must not turn a blind eye to the persecution of so many people and the violation of their fundamental rights.
As I mentioned earlier, it is not only the Chinese who are affected, but also other residents of what is known as China.
After all, Tibet, whose cause has repeatedly been raised in this House, is not China.
I appeal for a boycott of the Olympic Games.
author. - (DE) Madam President, seven months before the start of the Olympic Games, China is demonstrating how little account it takes of human rights.
The hope that the IOC decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion.
In October and November 2007 the State Security Services abducted and maltreated the attorneys Gao Zhisheng and Li Heping.
At the end of December they imprisoned the human rights activist and cyber dissident Hu Jia on the charge that he had used the Internet to incite subversion of State power.
On 10 October Hu Jia took part in a press conference on human rights, which was held at the European Parliament in Brussels.
He was linked to us live from China by telephone.
We must thank him for this courageous act.
Last year he and his wife Zeng Jinyan were nominated by the European Parliament for the Sakharov Prize.
In his Internet blog he reports on political prisoners and on the victims of land confiscations for the forthcoming Olympics.
In a letter he thanked Chancellor Angela Merkel for having received the Dalai Lama.
This clearly was too much for official China.
In an open letter some 57 Chinese intellectuals called for the release of Hu Jia. Our President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, endorsed this.
It is a slap in the face when human rights activists are arrested, especially because of their contact with the European Parliament.
We have to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to ensure that he is released from prison immediately.
China is promising the world the best Olympic Games ever seen.
The price for this should not be censorship or contempt for the rule of law.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, back in 2001 when it was decided that Beijing would host the Olympic Games, many of us believed that despite the controversy surrounding it, this decision would help to bring about political change in Communist China.
We felt that the host country would be moved to put an end to widespread violations of human rights and increase the scope of fundamental freedoms on its territory.
I agree with Mr Mann that with 7 months to go before the Games open, all those hopes have proved in vain.
The opposite is actually the case: the rule of terror in China has intensified.
Human rights defenders like Hu Jia and his wife are imprisoned and held illegally without trial in unknown locations, harassed, terrorised and denied the right of defence.
The Chinese authorities are sending out a different signal to the world, indicating that there is no democracy or openness in their country.
At the same time, the Chinese Olympic Committee has determined that the Games' main slogan will be 'One world, one dream'.
They maintain that this dream consists of a common aspiration to flourish and live in peace.
One is left wondering what kind of peace the Chinese have in mind and whether they really understand what the Olympic Games are all about.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the Chinese activist Mr Hu Jia was arrested two days after Christmas during the afternoon at his home.
It is very sad news, particularly because China, a great country, a great global player in the contemporary world, is the organiser of the Olympic Games this year.
The European Parliament and all the European Union must stress that China must challenge six issues relating to human rights: China's failure to fully implement new regulations allowing greater press freedom; China's superficial commitments to upholding the rule of law; limited Chinese support for international efforts to promote civilian protection in Darfur, Sudan; limited Chinese support for international efforts to promote human rights in Burma; the absence of transparency in Chinese aid to abusive governments; and, in particular, the release from prison of all political prisoners in China.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Hu Jia and Zeng Jinyan have come to symbolise for us the fight for freedom of expression and human rights in China.
Both husband and wife have been nominated by this House for the Sakharov Prize in recognition of their activities, whilst they are repressed in their own country because of those same activities.
Hu Jia was arrested on 2 January.
In the 1980s, during the period of martial law in Poland, transparency served to protect against the most drastic forms of repression.
The press and radio stations on the other side of the Iron Curtain named those imprisoned, which allowed us to hope we would be safe.
I myself experienced what it meant to be helped in this way by people abroad who were not indifferent to our plight.
That is why it is now so very important for me to ensure that our voice, the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of hundreds of Members from different European countries should be heard in China.
The Chinese authorities must hear our appeal and stop repressing Hu Jia and the many other victims of persecution.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Olympic Games ought to be perceived by both the Chinese authorities and the rest of the world as a chance for China to change its international image, which has been particularly affected by continuous breaches of human rights, affecting very different groups, for very different reasons.
The arrest of Hu Jia, and many others, show that China is not taking up this opportunity as it should.
It also serves once again as a reminder to those who saw China as a country that was prepared and sufficiently open-minded to organise an international event supposedly focusing on solidarity such as the Olympic Games.
China still has time to change that image, but to do this it must take issues such as freedom of expression and freedom of association more seriously, and put an end to its obsession with arresting, punishing and convicting Chinese men and women accused of an offence as difficult to justify as incitement to subvert state power.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President, every Olympics draws our attention to the preservation of human dignity as stated in the Olympic Charter.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics will specifically draw our attention to that preservation - or otherwise - in China.
Hopefully, this will bring pressure on the Chinese Government to rethink actions like the arrest of Hu Jia.
It is an opportunity for the country to improve its poor record in this area.
Instead, the Chinese Government seems determined to sweep human rights abuses under the rug, by arresting activists and protestors.
Of concern is the purchase of Western high-tech security equipment by the Chinese authorities, obviously intended to step up security during the games.
My concern is twofold.
I fear that such security equipment will be used against the Chinese people this summer, and that it will remain in misuse after the summer.
We must either use the Olympics to promote human rights in China, or boycott them, and one thing we cannot do is have a big celebration of China if human rights continue to be so flagrantly disregarded.
(BG) Colleagues, during the 20th century millions of people all over the world fell victims to communism.
Regrettably, this extremely pernicious, misanthropic and mostly anti-Christian ideology continues to take its victims to this day and to have its representatives.
Even here in this Chamber.
I will give you an example to illustrate and make things somewhat clearer.
Currently Hu Jia is under house arrest in China because there are a sufficient number of people there who believe that he is a proponent of their ideas.
This is what makes his dangerous for the Chinese regime.
Here, at the European Parliament, thank God, there is a sufficient number of Members elected by millions of citizens to represent their views, yet the powers that be in this European Union, which many compare to a 'pyramid', have their own priorities and a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty is not among those priorities.
This makes us, those Members, just as dangerous as Hu Jia is for the Chinese regime.
We are not placed under house arrest but Mr. PÃ¶ttering, if he is honest and open enough, would admit that he might go that far.
However, I assure him that an honourable representation of our voters counts more than that prospect.
Thank you.
Madam President, the case of Mr Hu Jia and his wife, unfortunately, is not an isolated one.
In order to have the privilege to host this year's Olympic Games in Beijing, the Chinese Government undertook additional commitments to meet internationally recognised human rights standards.
Contrary to these expectations, Beijing sees the Olympic Games as a justification for increasing repression against human rights activists.
So, by systematically violating its own commitments, the Chinese Government has demonstrated that it does not intend to respect the core values of the Olympic tradition.
In fact, it is about to lose its credibility.
Therefore, the democratic states cannot limit their reaction to mere complaints.
If the Chinese authorities do not make credible changes to the situation, then the democratic participants in the Games risk their own credibility with regard to the values they advocate.
(PL) Madam President, in 2001 the Vice-President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, Liu Jingmin, stated that awarding the Olympic Games to Beijing would help to promote the development of human rights.
In recent months, however, the Chinese authorities have been allowing themselves to violate freedom of expression more frequently than usual.
They have also repressed journalists and activists.
The arrest of Hu Jia, a leading human rights activist who was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 sent shock waves through society.
Hu Jia was arrested on the pretext that he had been inciting others to overthrow the national government.
He is still being denied the right to a lawyer and to medical care.
China must be forced to comply with international standards in human rights and to respect those rights.
It must also put an end to exploitation of the Games as an excuse for the illegal detention of journalists and dissidents.
We should remind the Chinese authorities of the idea inspiring the Olympic movement, namely linking sport with a vision of a peaceful society and the preservation of human dignity.
At the same time we should call for the immediate release of Hu Jia and of all the other activists detained without trial, so that they can return to their families and access essential medical care.
(PL) Madam President, I simply wished to establish whether the 'catch-the-eye' strategy also works here.
If so, I wished to state briefly that when in China one cannot detect any obvious signs of how the control system operates, but it does.
The citizens feel strongly bound up in the oppressive regime imposed by the system.
We believe we are called to make the rest of the world aware of the situation, as other Members have already stated.
That is the only weapon at our disposal.
We can respect the economic development achieved in China, but hardly anywhere else in the world have people become so permeated by fear and self-censorship.
I am therefore full of admiration for those courageous individuals in China who are brave enough to risk their careers, their freedom and their very lives to draw attention to the situation.
It is our moral duty to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.
There is no other solution, no other way forward.
(PL) Madam President, further to the comments of my fellow Member from Poland, I should like to pose the following question to Commissioner Kuneva, taking advantage of her presence in the House. Against the background of the last few years, can we really say that genuine respect for human rights is on the increase in the People's Republic of China?
Have the Games due to take place this July in Beijing really meant that Chinese dissidents can now feel more secure, and that relations with Taiwan are on a more civilised footing?
Has free access to the Internet increased over the last two or three years?
I would be grateful for the Commissioner's reply.
After all, the Bible tells us: 'Ask and ye shall receive'.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, only a month ago my colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, expressed in this Chamber the Commission's deep concern at the continuous and systematic repression of human rights' defenders in China.
The Commission was, therefore, all the more concerned to learn about Mr Hu Jia's arbitrary detention and recalls that he has been subjected to repeated acts of harassment in the past due to human rights activities.
We also express our concern for Mr Hu Jia's health. He suffers from hepatitis B and must take daily medication.
It is not clear whether daily access to the medical treatment he needs is guaranteed and whether he can count on doctors' assistance during his detention in the Beijing Municipal Detention Centre in Dougezhuang.
In the Commission's view, the detention of Mr Hu Jia places an obligation on the EU to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007.
As such, it has echoes of the case of Cao Dong, a Falun Gong petitioner, who was arrested and is still in prison after meeting the Vice-President of the European Parliament in Beijing in May 2006.
The detention of Mr Hu Jia also calls for a reaction from the EU as an international actor for the protection of human rights defenders.
Yesterday the EU troika carried out a firm dÃ©marche to the Chinese authorities asking for his immediate release.
We sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will understand that the issue of human rights defenders has an important impact on China's standing with the European public and will act accordingly.
I would like to reassure this Chamber that the EU will monitor very closely the evolution of Mr Hu Jia's case.
The Commission would like to use this opportunity to urge again the Chinese Government to permit expressions of all forms of opinion.
This is an important factor in how the international public views China, especially this year, when the eyes of the world will be on China in the build-up to the Olympic Games.
We are convinced that a far more stable society can be achieved by allowing freedom of expression.
Let me close by saying that the Commission will intensify its efforts to seek an improvement of the overall human rights situation in China.
In this respect, we will continue to play an instrumental role within the troika in preparing the EU-China human rights dialogue and seminar so that discussions continue to become more target-focussed.
Despite the slow progress in the human rights situation in China, we firmly believe that the EU-China human rights dialogue remains one of the most effective ways of engaging China in frank and detailed discussions with a view to achieving human rights reforms on the ground.
- The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime (debate)
- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime.
author. - (ES) Madam President, sexual violence and rape in particular as a weapon of war is not, regrettably, a new issue.
It is no minor issue that Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provide that rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation or any other form of sexual violence are to be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes, and will equal, in terms of treatment and persecution, torture or serious war crimes, whether or not they are committed during an armed conflict.
The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows to what extent this issue merits much more attention than has been paid to date.
There have been tens of thousands of reports of rape or sexual assault annually in the region.
Many of these incidents, moreover, take place at camps for displaced persons or refugees, and are frequently perpetrated by government troops, rebel groups or other forces.
I thus consider it extremely important that this Parliament not only condemn these practices, but that it urge the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put an immediate stop to these practices, investigate, bring them to trial and secure convictions, and guarantee protection for the victims, witnesses and family members.
We must also remind our own institutions that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 emphasises the responsibility of Member States to put an end to impunity, and pursue those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including crimes relating to sexual violence or other kinds of specific violence against women.
Madam President, European states brought tribes together in colonies in Africa that did not have good relations with each other, and divided other tribes by drawing boundaries right through the middle of their lands.
The Democratic Republic of Congo, an enormous territory with a multitude of racial groups, was not given the opportunity to grow into independence by gradually building up self-rule during the Belgian colonisation before 1960.
There was no preparation for decolonisation: it suddenly became inevitable after England and France had granted independence to their smaller neighbouring colonies at the end of the 1950s, partly as a consequence of the wars of liberation in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Kenya.
Since then the Congo has been a permanent war zone.
The early years were dominated by the conflict between Kasavubu from the west, Lumumba from the north-east and Tshombe in the south-east.
They each represented different ideologies and interests but, more importantly, they were popular with limited sections of the Congolese population.
The harsh military dictatorship of the profiteer Mobutu kept the country united for years in apparent peace, but the differences were never bridged.
The most recent elections also failed to produce unity or good cooperation.
The country remains a conflict zone with flexible borders, where, just as in the 1960s, it is about the demarcation of ethnic territories and control of mining areas.
Foreign companies have benefited from this.
The conflict now seems to be about which group among this multitude of tribal groups will dominate the others.
As things are now, the future of the Congo seems to be without prospects.
The atrocities to which the resolution refers, including the general lawlessness and frequent rape of women are all connected with this chaos.
The 2006 law against sexual violence will not solve that problem, as long as the conflict continues and there are so many people without a permanent place to live.
The resolution rightly makes reference to the role of government representatives, peace forces, aid organisations; their people should do everything they can to prevent such atrocities without becoming drawn into them themselves.
Recognition of rape, forced pregnancy, sexual exploitation and other forms of sexual violence as war crimes by the European Union and the United Nations is a prerequisite, but removing the breeding ground for this violence will have to happen on the ground.
author. - (PL) Madam President, I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo only three weeks ago, so my knowledge of the situation has not been gained exclusively from documents although the latter are very important.
This truly is an unfortunate country, which has experienced frequent name changes.
It used to be called Congo, then it became Zaire and now it is known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It has experienced mass movements of its population far more frequently than name changes, however.
The documents before us state that last year alone 400 000 of its inhabitants were forced to leave their homes.
The total number of people forced to do in recent years is four times greater, amounting to 1.5 million.
I should also refer to the use of rape as a weapon used deliberately for political purposes both by the partisans on the rebel side and by the police and the army on the government side.
This is something unprecedented and the African Union is totally powerless to deal with it.
Madam President, it is my strong impression that the words 'Democratic Republic' that form part of the official name of Congo ring rather hollow nowadays, because it is precisely in that country that one the worst humanitarian crises of recent years is unfolding before our very eyes.
Over 650 000 people are constantly moving around the country.
In just one province, Kivu, 80% of families have been displaced during the last five years, about 1 000 women a month are the victims of rape, and tens of thousands of children have become soldiers.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo the passage of the armies is accompanied by all possible kinds of crime against the civilian population, such as rape, murder and pillage.
Sexual violence is used to terrorise and punish the inhabitants of the Democratic Republic of Congo who supported the wrong side in the conflict.
It is so widespread that, according to MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres, 75% of all rapes in the world take place in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Rape is accompanied by barbaric torture such as beating with clubs and mutilation with knives.
Many young women have been forced into sexual slavery.
We should recall that the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world, consisting of over 17 000 soldiers, is currently deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
What is the main method of preventing sexual violence?
It is slogans on walls stating that rape is inhuman.
The most alarming fact is that the UN soldiers themselves have become involved in this scandal.
On more than one occasion, UN investigators have discovered that UN soldiers themselves have forced Congolese girls into prostitution.
It has proved simply impossible to punish the soldiers concerned, however, because their unit leaders did all they could to impede the prosecution.
The soldiers have perpetrated violence instead of protecting against it on more than one occasion, and these occasions are becoming more numerous.
This can only be defined as a scandal.
I would like to appeal to the international community to support immediate determined action aimed at identifying and punishing those responsible for crimes of a sexual nature.
I should also like to emphasise that the countries sending military units into the field under the auspices of the UN are responsible for carrying out a proper investigation of any allegations of criminal behaviour by personnel involved in peacekeeping missions.
I realise that the European Union's options regarding the resolution of conflicts of this type are limited.
Nonetheless, I call for funds to be made available for the organisation of a peace conference in Kivu.
European Union aid should also be channelled towards the provision of medical, legal and social assistance to all victims of sexual crimes.
I trust the European Union and the UN will formally recognise that all types of crime of a sexual nature are crimes against humanity.
author. - (ES) Madam President, the description of sexual violence in Kivu, Congo, produces an unavoidable feeling of revulsion.
Our fellow Members have described what is going on there, and I do not intend to repeat it.
We must not merely agree to condemn it, since this could make us a voice crying in the wilderness: we have to do something to stop it, and what we can do is put pressure on the Congolese Government, because it is not just the rebels, but also its armed forces, who are carrying out these kinds of atrocities, aimed at humiliating women and undermining the moral foundations of the society in which they live.
We must make the United Nations and the European Union declare sexual violence a crime against humanity.
We must ask the Commission to allocate development assistance funds to the Congo, fundamentally and as a priority as assistance for the victims: legal assistance, social assistance and medical assistance.
We must make United Nations personnel on the ground consider defence of the victims and the search for those responsible priority tasks, and to do so we must extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to constitute a more direct link to the prevention of such occurrences.
Finally, we must call on those attending the Kivu Conference to produce a set of specific results demanding justice and acceptance of responsibility, because if, after all that has happened, rapists finally enjoy impunity wearing the uniforms of the official army of the Republic of the Congo, the victims will be humiliated twice - first during the rape itself, and again when they see it was carried out with impunity.
That is what we can and must do.
I trust the Commission will take due note of this, and rechannel development assistance funds for the Congo, as I have requested, to assist victims and prevent the continuation of this savage butchery of the dignity of women.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, the text of the resolution before us contains alarming data.
We should keep in mind, however, that behind these statistics lie the tragedies of individual women.
I would like to tell the House the story of Lumo. She was the victim of a mass rape in 1994.
The attack was so brutal that this young woman sustained permanent internal injures.
After years of treatment and four operations she has still not regained her health and will probably never fully recover.
She has been rejected by her fiancÃ©, by most of her family and by society.
Her mother and the African charitable organisation HEAL Africa have been her only support.
HEAL Africa runs a hospital in Goma, which is the rape capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The hospital specialises in treating the victims of brutal cases of sexual violence.
The surgeons have been very successful, and so-called mothers provide psychological support for the victims.
The House should commend these people on their work, but commendation alone is not enough.
We need to consider how we can provide them with practical assistance.
We owe it to Lumo and to the thousands of her Congolese sisters to help.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, with today's motion on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and on rape and violation as a war crime, we are calling on the European Union and United Nations formally to recognise rape, forced impregnation, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence as a crime against humanity and as a form of torture.
We are also calling for pressure to be put on the Congolese Government to bring an end to the situation in which these crimes are being committed with impunity.
These measures are needed to improve the appalling situation in which hundreds of thousands of women find themselves.
The violence being suffered by women in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unimaginable.
In the province of Kivu more than one third of all women have been subjected to rape, and many have been violated repeatedly over long periods.
This has been going on for many years.
Most of the perpetrators are soldiers from both sides, members of the Congolese security forces and the police.
The UN special rapporteur on violence against women submitted her report last September.
The atrocities being committed by armed troops are of unimaginable brutality and are designed to ensure the complete physical and psychological destruction of women.
The trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and ostracism by their families and communities.
This is one of the reasons why only a fraction of the rapes actually committed are being reported.
Echoing what my colleague Mr Fontelles has just said, we therefore want to see the UN mandate extended to include the protection of civilians against sexual violence.
Reports of sexual misconduct by members of the UN peacekeeping mission must be looked into in greater depth and those responsible must be brought before a court.
The Goma Conference on peace, security and development opened a few days ago.
We urgently call on all the participants to tackle the problem of sexual violence against women and girls, to undertake to bring those responsible before a court and to end the current situation in which these acts can be committed with impunity.
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Madam President, we are today discussing rape as a war crime in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It is ironic that this country should be named the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Nowadays it seems that the more democracy is referred to in names and in speeches, the less human rights are enjoyed by ordinary people.
I shall say once again that the only way to rein in African warlords who have been elevated to presidential office is on the one hand through economic sanctions, and on the other through armed intervention.
Until the European Union creates a police force that would not, of course, intervene in every civil war but could at least supervise the camps, the so-called refugee camps where the very worst crimes are being committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, all we will be able to do is continue debating the matter.
People will continue to suffer and die whilst we debate endlessly.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the appalling mass rapes taking place in the Congo are being systematically organised and this means they are also being used as a military strategy, and that is not just war but sexual terror against women.
The brutal rapes are now being used by each of the warring factions in eastern Congo, whether they are local tribal militia or national army soldiers, as a symbol or power and as a means of intimidation.
It is precisely the weakest in society, namely women, children and even babies, who are being barbarously abused, deliberately injured, mutilated, infected with HIV and other infectious diseases and even killed.
We know, and have heard, that the level of brutality exceeds the powers of human imagination and we now urgently need to see rape being condemned at long last as a crime against humanity, as a war crime and as a form of torture.
Moreover, when the rape victims return traumatised and alone to their villages after painful operations - with many of the women losing all their genital organs - they find little or no shelter there.
I can therefore only support the remarks made by Mr Borrell and Mrs Scheele: we must also use European money to set up women's dormitories that can serve as a kind of refuge for those returning from their stay in hospital, and where they can then try to build a new life.
Indeed, in addition to the physical violence endured, the psychological violence that the victims have suffered is terrible beyond measure.
We know that most of these attacks have been carried out by rebels, but almost one fifth of the recorded incidents can be attributed to government troops and police, and it is indeed shameful that not a single culprit has yet been arrested or even charged.
The time for empty talk is therefore past.
We need political action from the UN and the European Union, for if we ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, when I took the floor recently in a debate on sexual slavery in Japan during the Second World War, I also expressed my opposition to the brutal violence against women currently being perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
According to MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres, 75% of all rapes committed in the world take place in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This is all the more alarming because the violence is accompanied by particular cruelty. Even three-year-old girls are affected.
Armed groups use rape as a tactical method to break down resistance and punish ethnic groups. This is true not only of armed rebels but also of the Congolese army.
Along with food shortages and disease, sexual violence and aggression on an unprecedented scale have contributed to turning that area into a hell on earth.
We should remember that the inter-tribal rivalry stems from colonial times, when one tribe was favoured over the other.
(PL) Madam President, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the largest country in Africa.
It is rich in natural resources, such as water, tropical forests and agricultural land, but civilisation has long been in a state of collapse there.
Over four million people have lost their lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a result of two civil wars, tribal conflicts, and the activities of armed groups and partisans.
To compound the tragic situation of the people, there have also been mass deportations of citizens from their previous areas of residence, corrupt and inefficient governments, the AIDS epidemic and most recently the onslaught of the Ebola virus.
How can these people be helped?
In addition to humanitarian aid and technical support, it is essential to deal with the leaders and organisers responsible for these horrific acts. They have been, and remain, unpunished and should now be excluded from Congolese society.
Criminals responsible for genocide should be pursued by international special forces, so they can be tried before a court of law.
(PL) Madam President, I do not wish to repeat what has already been said so I will simply state that as far as we are concerned there can be no question that aid must be provided.
Hopefully the aid will be as substantial and widespread as possible.
I would also like to say that when I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the elections, I was shocked to discover that boys as young as 13 and sometimes even younger are taught two things: how to fight and how to rape girls even younger than themselves.
Such is the image of the so-called soldiers of the group supporting the opposition presidential candidate, Mr Bemba.
That is no exception, however. The situation is similar in all factions.
I therefore support Mr Borrell's statement that the funds and resources we have available should be directed to re-educating these young people, amongst other purposes.
If these youngsters become set in their present ways, the only future they can look forward to is a life in gangs, committing rape and murder.
Something has to be done with them.
It seems we are being challenged to find a way to help these people change their attitude to life and to the opposite sex.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission remains extremely worried about the deteriorating human rights situation - especially about the widespread sexual violence - in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and strongly condemns all acts of violence against women.
In the prevailing climate of violence and insecurity all the armed groups present in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including elements of the national armed forces, are to some extent involved in the dramatic rise of these types of acts.
In this context, it is important to promote the fight against impunity, but also to address the root causes of the problem.
It ought to be noted that sexual violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is embedded within the context of persistent conflict and violence in the region.
Peace is needed for sustained security and stability, the two key elements linked to the prevalence of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This is why the Commission, together with the EU Member States, has been continuously promoting a political solution for the crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The ongoing conference on peace, security and development in the Kivus, coupled with the recent agreement reached between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in Nairobi in November 2007, could indeed represent a significant step forward in the process, while acknowledging that there are still many challenges ahead before a sustainable peace in the Kivus can be reached.
However, these efforts are not enough and have to be complemented with active support to strengthen the capacity of the state in providing protection to its people.
In this regard, the Commission works together with the Member States in strengthening the rule of law and the fight against impunity by supporting the security sector reform comprising the army, the police and the justice sector.
I would like to reflect on some of the questions from Members and try to answer them.
The Commission addresses, in particular, the problem of sexual violence and criminality through a multi-donor justice and rehabilitation project in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing inter alia on building the capacity of judicial actors and reinforcing the provision of legal assistance to the victims of sexual violence.
In addition, the Commission provides significant humanitarian assistance - roughly EUR 40 million per year - to the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially to Uturi and the Kivus.
Our humanitarian and health programmes take into consideration the gender violence they mentioned, both from a creative and awareness-raising perspective.
- The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Egypt (debate)
- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Egypt.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to begin by saying that this Parliament would be making a most serious mistake if it succumbed to pressure from those who prefer us not to discuss issues that could cause discomfort in certain countries, particularly when they denounce breaches of human rights.
We have privileged relations with certain countries, such as those covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, with whom we must have a particularly clear dialogue and remind them that business cannot and must not ever be disassociated from respect for human rights, either here or there.
The situation in Egypt merited some reflection, and the relations between Egypt and the European Union also obliged such reflection.
Thus it is more than legitimate to denounce, as we are doing in this resolution, the persecution of a number of non-governmental organisations, particularly human rights organisations, that is currently taking place in Egypt, and to lend support to the campaign for freedom of association led by a number of social movements in the country.
author. - (PT) Madam President, I too must point out that there are of course no borders or sacred places where human rights are not a fundamental concern.
However, we must take into account the fact that we had the opportunity to observe the willingness of Egypt's Foreign Minister who came on purpose to the European Parliament, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and who was ready to answer all the questions on human rights' infringements that were put to him.
I was there and I put these questions to him and obtained some answers from the Minister.
In addition to certain negative factors, this motion for a resolution also highlights certain positive factors that I feel are important to stress, such as the undertaking to lift the state of emergency this year, in fact within the next few months, and the cooperation in the fight to end the arms smuggling in Gaza.
However, in my opinion, the fundamental point is that we should take advantage of the willingness of the Egyptian authorities and encourage them to rectify certain serious infringements.
I must highlight in this respect the continued imprisonment of the former candidate for the Presidency of the Republic of Egypt.
I would repeat the call for this situation to be brought to an end as this would be coherent with the basic principles of a country that defends human rights, as Egypt has repeatedly advocated and to which it is committed.
Madam President, Egypt has no tradition of democracy.
The young military men Nasser and Naguib, who overthrew the poorly performing regime of King Farouk over 50 years ago, brought hope for change and progress.
Nasser gave his people pride and inspiration for the future; he was to put an end to their status as a backward and humiliated country.
His successor, Sadat, gave them hope of permanent peace with their neighbour Israel, after a series of terrible wars.
The current president, Mr Mubarak, does not offer any hope at all.
He has become the symbol of the stagnation.
His only service has been to organise stability with a hard hand, so that he can be seen in the outside world as an ally against terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism.
However, he has no progress and no democratisation to offer.
Oppositions are permitted selectively, but they do not have the normal latitude that is customary in a parliamentary democracy.
Consequently, he is cultivating a breeding ground for internal conflict from both fundamentalists and democrats.
Intolerance of religious minorities, including the large Coptic Christian minority who have been present in Egypt for centuries, is also on the increase.
Long-term stability cannot be built on these foundations, where problems are not solved but covered up with violence.
There is every reason for this critical resolution therefore.
Sabotage of non-governmental organisations, intimidation of opponents, discrimination against minorities, arrests and torture and all the other failings on record lead us to fear the worst for what will follow the Mubarak regime.
Egypt seems in many respects to have stepped back into the backwardness of the reign of King Farouk, 60 years ago.
European relations with Egypt ought to contribute to bringing this situation to an end as far as possible.
author. - (PL) Madam President, the progressive deterioration of the situation regarding respect for human rights in Egypt is causing increasing concern.
Changes to the constitution have facilitated violations of human rights.
On the pretext of the need to provide protection against terrorist attacks and in connection with the alleged problem involving the smuggling of weapons into the Gaza Strip, additional powers have been vested in the Secret Service.
It is now easier for the latter to evade responsibility for the use of torture.
Repression on the grounds of religious belief, arrests and prolonged detention without proper trial are being resorted to ever more frequently.
Organisations like Amnesty International, which monitor respect for human rights, have drawn attention to the international community's indifference towards the situation.
I call on the European Commission to consider effective methods of bringing pressure to bear on the Egyptian authorities in order to halt this process.
author. - (CS) Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt is without doubt the most notable of the Arab countries.
It is the cradle of ancient civilisation and it is the most important Arab state.
Nobody in the European Union or in this Parliament doubts that Egypt is not only a key partner of the European Union, but also a dynamic partner, prepared and strong.
These are the reasons why we consider a dialogue with this country very important and significant.
New negotiations are starting next week on an action plan between the European Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt.
It is good that our Parliament is unanimously and clearly expressing its support of these negotiations and that it is thus a player in international politics.
We are stating clearly that a country that allows severe interference in the independence of an old democratic institution, i.e. the courts, that permits torture in prison and the killing of immigrants, that violates freedom of speech, blocks the Internet and sends members of parliament, such as the nephew of President Sadat, to a court martial, cannot be a partner of the European Union.
Egypt is a key ally in the fight against terrorism, and it must remain a key ally notably in our struggle against the causes of terrorism and Islamic radicalisation.
For that very reason, Egypt cannot act the way it did when it prohibited the registration of non-governmental organisations, it must not destroy freedom of speech and it must in particular defend the long-standing rule of law that has always existed in Egypt.
We believe that Egypt can succeed in doing this and we believe, in particular, that our resolution will help the European Commission to establish a high-quality action plan with Egypt.
Thank you for your support.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am one of the few people here in this Chamber who was present when President Sadat gave his famous speech in the European Parliament.
This speech could be taken as a policy document for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue that has just begun. It was one of the greatest speeches ever made here in this House.
Down through the years President Mubarak too has been an important and reliable partner for the European Union, and this is of course in spite of the many failings and mistakes that we have seen in Egypt.
I therefore simply cannot understand the speech that the President of the Egyptian Parliament made in reaction to this motion.
We are simply saying in a reasonable and restrained way that we consider Egypt to be one of the most important partners in the Mediterranean area, but we are criticising by way of a number of specific points and using categorical facts that some things still have to change as Egypt moves forward towards democracy and the rule of law.
This is our commitment towards our own citizens and towards the people of Egypt.
I certainly believe that breaking off relations, which is now being threatened, would be completely the wrong move.
We need to keep talking to one another and for this reason I support this motion for a resolution, which has been drafted in reasonable language, and call on the Egyptians not to see this as a breakdown in the dialogue but as a clear signal for a more intensive dialogue to start: that is what we are trying to achieve with Egypt by way of this motion.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to refer to two issues in the course of today's debate on Egypt, and I am sure one of them will have been raised already in the House.
Whilst I believe that our relations with Egypt should be maintained and developed, and that Egypt should indeed become our main partner in that part of the world, I would like to begin by pointing out that Coptic Christians are second-class citizens in that country.
This is true both of those who follow the Orthodox rite and those who follow the Catholic one, and should be borne in mind when making contact with Egypt.
In addition, as I have already said on repeated occasions, we should study the situation of the religious minorities in that part of the world and prepare a report on the subject.
Secondly, there can be no talk of lasting peace, democracy and respect for human rights in the area in question until a solution is found to the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East.
Therein lies the source of all that force, violence, terrorism and fanaticism that is also threatening Europe.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to express a degree of satisfaction, in that as we debate the case of Egypt today, we do not have to refer to regular crimes.
In general, during the debates on human rights on Thursday afternoons, when I usually take the floor, we find ourselves discussing extremely serious and dangerous cases indeed. They tend to be cases of violation of human rights, murder and rape.
Today, however, we can feel a certain satisfaction because in comparison to so many other cases, we are intervening in Egypt at a stage when crimes have not yet taken place, although fundamental freedoms are being infringed.
There is a chance that this timely intervention will therefore be more effective and will pre-empt more serious consequences.
The usual pattern is for the first stage to be restrictions on the media - in this case we are referring to the arrest of journalists - and restrictions on the right of association.
We also have in mind the trade unions and persecution of religious minorities.
The next stage is the criminal one.
Fortunately that stage has not yet been reached in this instance.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is paying close attention to the democratic and human rights situation in Egypt, which is one of our partners in the European neighbourhood policy.
It is following developments very closely through our delegation in Cairo, and in partnership with the Member States.
It is also in regular contact with local and international NGOs dealing with human rights and democracy.
The Commission shares your concern at the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Egypt, and at the number of reported cases of human rights violations, particularly in relation to freedom of expression, torture and ill treatment, as well as respect for religious minorities.
It has called for greater political reform, and respect for human rights is an intrinsic part of the EU partnership with Egypt.
The Commission is, therefore, using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Egyptian authorities to progress in this area.
As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Egypt has committed itself to upholding 'the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights'.
The EU consistently raises the importance of respecting human rights - notably on the basis of Article 2 of the Association Agreement - in its bilateral contacts with Egypt, including those at the highest level.
With the adoption of the joint EU-Egypt action plan, under the European neighbourhood policy, in March 2007, we now have another political tool to foster respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Egypt, based on what we understand to be shared values.
The action plan provides for the establishment of a formal and regular dialogue on human rights and democracy in the context of the Subcommittee on Political Matters: Human Rights and Democracy, International and Regional Issues.
That subcommittee aims to facilitate dialogue within a context of mutual understanding, and respect for the positions of both parties, on all aspects of human rights and democracy, international and regional issues, in a comprehensive and non-exclusive way.
It will convene for the first time next week - 23 and 24 January 2007 - in Cairo, and will be a constructive way for Egypt to demonstrate commitment to shared values.
The Commission firmly believes that the dialogue with Egypt within the framework of the political arrangements set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP action plan is the most effective way to impress upon the Egyptian Government the EU's concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law.
The Commission remains committed to contributing to Egypt's reform process through financial and technical assistance, and support for political reform, human rights and democracy remains a priority in the national indicative programme 2007-2010, and under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
I am sure the European Parliament will be a strong ally in support of these efforts.
- The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank you especially for having read out the names of those who this morning alleged that there was no democracy in this House because they have not had a chance to speak.
If you look across to the benches of those who have been loudly demonstrating and complaining that there is no democracy you will see that they have not even taken the time to stay until the end of the sitting.
They themselves are hardly a role model for Europe.
I would ask that this be specifically recorded in the Minutes.

Welcome
We welcome the ACP members of the Presidency of the ÎCP-ÎU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and their delegations.
At this extraordinary sitting we are to debate an issue of global importance, since climate change and the energy issues associated with it are common challenges for the European Union as well as for all the peoples of the world.

Proposals on energy and climate change (debate)
The next item is the statement by JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, on the proposals on energy and climate change.
President of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I apologise for the slight delay.
As you know, we have just concluded our Commission meeting, and the first thing we did immediately after it was to come here to present what we believe is an historic package for the European Union.
That is the reason why I, together with the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Dimas, and the Commissioner for Energy, Mr Piebalgs, have only just arrived.
The final drafting of the document is being completed.
We will have it immediately, but this is a very important occasion to present to you first-hand the conclusions of our meeting today.
I should like to start by saying that we are very happy with the result. The result was obtained by consensus in the College, with strong backing from all the Members of the Commission for a very ambitious proposal, because we have agreed what is now the most comprehensive package in terms of climate action and renewable energy that exists in any part of the world.
We believe we have reason to be proud of it.
This package on climate action and renewable energy meets the challenges of the future.
We believe it is good for our planet; it is good for the European economy; it is good for our citizens.
The work of the European Union is sometimes seen as rather technical: interesting to specialists, but not relevant to people's daily lives.
The action we are discussing today proves this theory wrong: the struggle against climate change and the quest for secure, sustainable and competitive energy touches every European every day.
We are all affected by this, and this is one of the most - if not the most - important challenge of the 21st century.
Europeans ask for a vision and a plan of action.
That is what we are doing now.
This vision was set out last year with leadership from the European political community.
It was agreed in the European Council, following a Commission proposal, to bring about the '20/20/20 by 2020' goals: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases, or 30% if other developed economies agree, 20% of energy use through renewables and a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020.
This was agreed by the European Council.
We can be proud that Europe is leading that effort. We then brought it to the Heiligendamm Summit, to the High-Level Event at the United Nations in New York and finally to the Bali Conference.
Without strong European leadership, we could not have achieved the promising results of the Bali Conference, setting a road map for the global agreement we are seeking and that we expect to reach in Copenhagen in 2009.
The clear commitment of this Parliament to this cause has been essential, and I want to thank you, once again, for all your support.
Your work over the past year has been critical in building the political momentum in favour of action.
I believe that today's proposals match the goals that you have set out, as well as meeting the mandate given by the European Council last March.
Today's package adds up to a detailed road map to bring about the political vision agreed last year.
We have agreed on the vision and now we have to deliver on the concrete plans, the concrete instruments to achieve that vision.
We believe that the main priority is to bring about a 20% cut in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and be ready, if necessary, to step up to 30% with an international agreement.
Let us never forget that.
This is about global warming; it is about global climate change and not just about climate change in Europe.
We have to put our proposals in such a way that we bring others along with us.
It is also important to lead by example and that is why, for instance, we are now proposing how to achieve the 20% of energy use through renewables by 2020.
The package we have just approved in the Commission includes the following: an updated Emissions Trading System (ETS) to create a borderless ETS to drive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from big industrial emitters; specific, binding national targets, so that Member States know exactly what they have to do outside the ETS, in sectors like transport, buildings, agriculture and waste; a new approach to actively promote renewable targets, again including binding national targets; new rules to stimulate carbon capture and storage, tomorrow's technology to cut emissions; and new state aid rules that take into consideration the specificity of the action needed in this environmental field.
Part of our mandate was the 10% target for biofuels so that transport plays a part in emissions cuts.
As you know, this 10% target was unanimously agreed by the European Council.
I want to be clear that, in putting forward proposals on biofuels, we have also fully respected the other side of the mandate: the need for environmental sustainability.
The proposal creates the most comprehensive and sustainable system anywhere in the world for the certification of biofuels and for domestic and imported biofuels alike.
We will also continue to promote the rapid development of second-generation biofuels.
It is important to understand that what we are promoting is sustainable biofuels and we are making a contribution to a global regime, because what we have today is a situation where, in many cases, biofuels are not sustainable and do not respond to our criteria - criteria we want to be implemented not only in Europe but throughout the world.
The package of measures proposed today contains the most far-reaching legislative proposals to be made by the European Commission for many years.
How did we set about shaping this complex package?
We spent a lot of time exploring options in great detail, but we always held firm to five key principles.
First, respecting the targets.
Without this, we will not look serious to investors, to our negotiating partners and, most importantly, to our own citizens.
Second, fairness: recognising Member States' different capacities to invest and their different starting points.
Third, competitiveness: designing a system able to minimise the costs to the European economy and, in some areas, improving the competitive possibilities of Europe by giving European industry and the European economy a first-mover advantage.
Fourth, the proposals had to be designed to promote a comprehensive international agreement to cut greenhouse emissions, including stepping up our own effort to 30% emission cuts should other developed countries do the same.
Last but not least, we must also start work now to halve global emissions by 2050.
This means working today to bring tomorrow's technology rapidly on stream.
This package should also be seen in articulation with some of our earlier proposals, namely the internal market for energy and the Energy Technology Plan.
This is part of a very comprehensive set of proposals that is creating, for the first time, a real European energy policy, but we want this energy to be secure and also sustainable.
Of course, there will be those who say that change comes at too high a cost and that we have no choice but to bury our heads in the sand and hope for the best.
I think they have got this wrong.
There is a cost, but the cost is manageable.
We have worked very hard on coming up with the right design to meet Europe's ambitions in the right way.
So the additional effort needed to realise the proposals would be less than 0.5% of GDP by 2020. This amounts, on average, to about EUR 3 a week for each European citizen.
This is much less than the up to EUR 60 per week that is the cost of inaction.
Going on even the most optimistic assumptions of the Stern Report, the cost of inaction is more than 10 times what we are now proposing.
It is true there are some costs, but we have to compare the cost of this package with the cost of inaction and, since the cost of inaction is much higher, we can say that there is a relative gain in having this package.
In fact, every day the price of oil and gas goes up, the real cost of the package falls.
Instead of costs, we really should be talking about gains for the European Union.
(Applause)
The package is hard-wired to reach our goals in an efficient way, using the market to drive change where it is most cost-effective and ensuring a level playing field while leaving as much as possible to Member States
We have paid particular attention to fairness.
We have, therefore, designed the proposals to ensure that the demands on the poorer Member States are realistic: all will contribute, but in line with their capacity to invest.
At the level of business, we all know that there are sectors where the cost of cutting emissions could have a real impact on competitiveness with companies in countries that do nothing - or do very little - in the fight against climate change.
There is no point in Europe being tough if it just means production shifting to countries allowing a free-for-all on emissions.
An international agreement is the best way to tackle this, but we also need to give legal certainty to companies that we will take the action needed.
Energy-intensive industries will have ETS allowances free of charge if there is no global or sectoral agreement.
If our expectations for an international agreement are not met, we will look at other options, such as requiring importers to obtain allowances alongside European competitors, as long as such a system is compatible with WTO requirements.
I am making this point specifically, because it is very important that this package and the measures that the European Union will adopt are not in favour of the environment and against the economy.
No, they are not only for the environment and our planet but also for our economy and for the competitiveness of the European economy.
We want industry to remain in Europe.
We do not want to export our jobs to other parts of the world.
(Applause)
Fairness is also important at the level of the citizen.
We are encouraging Member States to act in a sensitive way, such as using a share of the billions of euros to be gained in auctioning revenues to help the less well off to invest in energy-efficient homes.
But we must not forget the huge economic opportunity represented by Europe's transition to a low-emissions economy.
Europe's leadership also means showing that the technology is there, that we will need an effective and competitive industrial sector up to the challenge.
There are real opportunities there.
The renewables sector alone will bring one million jobs by 2020 at least, according to our estimates.
I am sure that, once again, European industry will show its ability to innovate and adapt.
Europe can be the first economy for the low-carbon age.
We must seize this chance.
This package represents an opportunity for Europe to show itself at its best: tackling an issue of fundamental long-term importance; using the European Union's continental scale to best effect; turning political consensus into practical action.
If some people in Europe have doubts about the need for a European Union, then these are exactly the kinds of policy that show why we need a strong European Union more than ever.
(Applause)
This is precisely where we can demonstrate to the most sceptical that, alone, our Member States - even the biggest Member States - do not have the scale or the leverage to push the agenda forward.
But Europe, if it is determined to lead, can do it.
So, apart from the environmental aspects, apart from the economic aspects and apart from the very important geopolitical and security aspects - because let us not forget that we are speaking about security of supply, and we do not want to be dependent on regimes that are not our friends - it is also a great argument for European unity.
It is also a great argument to show not only that we need a strong European Union, but also that the world needs a strong European Union to lead the global efforts to face the global challenges of the 21st century.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic day.
It is a day that will influence our way of living and thinking, what we do and what we do not do.
Without wishing to denigrate its other merits, this Commission will undoubtedly be remembered in the future as the Commission that enhanced European integration with a new dimension, as the Commission that established the package on climate and energy.
It is a plan whose foundations were laid during the German Presidency under the impetus of Chancellor Merkel and that we in the PPE-DE Group have always supported.
Europe is making it clear today that we are not afraid to take responsibility in the area of energy and climate and that we can act as a global pioneer.
It now falls to us to reconcile ambition and feasibility.
Let us not deceive ourselves, ladies and gentlemen: accomplishment of the 20/20/20 goals will in the short and medium term demand difficult decisions of us all, and will require great efforts from everyone concerned and to have even agreed on them is a significant step forward.
Mr President of the Commission, the action plan you have just outlined is a well-considered one.
The PPE-DE Group supports your five key principles, but as the responsible Group we naturally need the flexibility to examine whether each proposal put forward by the Commission is fair and feasible for every Member State and for the sectors that will be most affected.
In order to succeed, a comprehensive approach is indeed required, allowing our ambitious energy and climate targets to be reconciled with our objectives in the areas of economic growth and employment.
At the same time Europe must secure our energy supply and become self-sufficient.
The PPE-DE Group supports the differentiated approach.
We know that we will now be bombarded with questions suggesting that it be toned down.
It is also our responsibility to listen carefully to the comments from the national and regional authorities and from a cross-section of society.
Nevertheless, our starting principle is that it is not the one who shouts the loudest who goes the farthest.
We must strive for a differentiated approach based on transparency, objectivity and fair criteria, and do so on the understanding that it costs more not to act than it does to act wisely.
In addition to our mutual solidarity, the geographical and economical capacity of the Member States must be the primary consideration when dividing up the cost.
The measures already taken and industrial capacity for future innovation must also be taken into account.
Under no circumstances can renounce these principles.
The PPE-DE Group's final assessment must deliver a win-win situation.
On the one hand, we must fulfil our climate objectives, and on the other hand, we must maintain a successful economy in order to create jobs.
If the balance sways to one side we risk losing both, for instance if the economic sector were to move to areas where there are not even CO2 limits.
Finally, the PPE-DE Group understands that it is vital for Europe, but also for the rest of the world, to succeed in breaking their energy addiction.
The time has come to learn how to consume on a large scale in a low-carbon manner.
All of us - employers and citizens - must turn things around.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I express my warm thanks to the President of the Commission and to the Commission for the work they have done.
Reference has already been made to the fact that the right environmental and economic objectives have been set and are being pursued.
In implementing the package, as the previous speaker said, we must take a careful look at specific points.
You know, Mr Barroso, that we are very sceptical about biofuels as far as the current state of the art is concerned.
We need to invest far more in research and development - and this applies to the next few budgets too - if the second generation is to become a reality in the shortest possible time and tip the balance decisively in favour of a cleaner environment.
It is absolutely crucial that the use of biofuels should demonstrably constitute a net gain for the environment.
As far as emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are concerned, many will say - and I agree with them - that a 20% reduction is not enough to guarantee the achievement of the goals to which we aspire in the struggle against climate change.
On the other hand, I wholeheartedly subscribe to your argument that there is no point in Europe going it alone and taking all the risks while others stay on the sidelines, unwilling to join in, for we have no wish to export dirty technology and jobs.
We want to develop clean technology in Europe and to export it too, so that we can maintain a clean global environment together.
That must be our aim.
(Applause)
That, Mr Barroso, is why we need transparent and coherent international agreements and why we need them as quickly as possible.
Should that goal prove unattainable, we are in favour of giving some thought of our own to the matter.
This, I believe, is an area in which the Commission has been too hesitant.
I certainly agree that the decisions need not be made until later, but I do believe that now is the time to think about what we do if international agreements do not materialise.
Will there then be import levies?
These, of course, would have to be WTO-compliant.
Would we perhaps think about introducing a CO2 tax after all?
That idea has already received some consideration in the Council and the Commission.
Whatever else we do, we must exert heavy pressure to ensure that both the environmental and economic dimensions are taken into account.
While I do not take every chorus of protest from industry at face value, consideration must be given to the legitimate interests of industry and labour.
You said that will happen.
We shall have to keep an eye on that in the legislative process.
What we really must achieve, Mr President and ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, is what we managed in the case of REACH, namely an alliance not only of environmentalists but also of industry and labour that is designed to reconcile their respective interests.
REACH offers a good example of such an alliance.
Mr Sacconi and many others played their part in ensuring that this Parliament and this Commission brought the REACH framework to fruition.
The environmental goals must guide us, but at the same time we must give due consideration to economic issues with a view to safeguarding clean industry and a clean economy in Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Liberals and Democrats welcome this package.
We believe it to be the most important act of Mr Barroso's Commission thus far.
Climate change is the greatest challenge facing life on our planet, the biggest problem facing our governments, and a gnawing worry for our citizens.
I am grateful to Mr Davies and Ms Ek for the work they have done within my group to make sure we have a firm and early response.
It is important for the Commission to take action.
National democracies are too often run by crisis management.
Problems are not tackled until they have to be tackled, and sometimes action comes too late.
California's scientists warned us 30 years ago about climate change.
We can no longer prevent it, but we can hope and strive to control it.
Your proposals, President Barroso, recognise the overwhelming urgency of action.
They will be hotly contested.
Some will argue that they will hit profits; others will argue that they will hit jobs, and we have heard hints of both.
No doubt you have had heated discussions in the Commission.
My group argues they can add to profits and to jobs and give our economy a new competitive edge.
They are, in any case, essential to responsible stewardship of our planet and we will work with you to secure agreement on them as early as possible.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, we have been waiting for some time to see the benefits of this legislative package.
Maybe the dream is coming true now.
Maybe targets will be laid down for a reduction in CO2 and an increase in renewable energy.
Member States will undoubtedly face a challenge.
But that, in fact, is what they are already facing.
This legislation will stabilise the market, especially the business and science market, provide certainty for investors, and promote wind energy, solar energy, hydroelectric power, and biofuels.
Overall it will help to protect the environment from climate change.
As regards biofuels, Parliament maintains that they will not worsen the problem of CO2.
The target is perhaps 10% too high.
We shall have to ensure that the legislation enables food supplies and shortages to be kept under review.
Member States will need to take a flexible attitude to the disparities existing from one country to the next.
The legislation must, however, be viable.
I welcome the Commission proposals on second-generation bio-energy, but we should start to focus on the third generation now.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Dimas, do you still remember Bali?
I am sure Mr Dimas does.
That is where the European Union virtually epitomised the international approach to combating climate change, where it stood for international solidarity and sustainability.
It was a wonderful feeling.
I was often proud of you, Mr Dimas.
I was even proud of the German Environment Minister.
It reminded me that the European Union is capable of regaining the support of its citizens by leading a truly efficient campaign against global climate change.
Public approval, however, is very easily squandered, Mr Barroso, especially when there is an ostensible gulf between words and deeds.
I have been reading a lot about the debates in the Commission.
Unless you persevere with a hard line in your proposals on emissions trading, I believe you will destroy a very important instrument.
If clean coal remains dominant and a covert campaign is waged for nuclear power, if the main focus is on biofuels rather than a different transport policy, if energy efficiency - the priority of priorities, Mr Piebalgs - is increasingly neglected, we shall remain helpless in the face of climate change.
(Applause)
The onslaughts mounted by European industry against the proposals are intolerable.
After all, it is the free market that has caused this climate problem.
It was not China and India that managed their resources wastefully and emitted far too much CO2 - it was us.
The free market will not solve the problem.
The free market must be regulated for the sake of protecting the climate.
It goes without saying, given the associated burdens, that we shall have to talk about external protection.
We are prepared to do that.
We believe it would take ambitious proposals at the European level for us to make any headway in international negotiations on any issue, including external protection.
We cannot go to PoznaÅ with weak instruments.
In PoznaÅ and Copenhagen we shall have to take the lead again.
I look forward to cooperating closely with you, Mr Dimas.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's decision to come and present its proposals to this House is significant.
It is a positive sign that Europe takes the issue seriously and aims for the kind of fair response that we have helped to flesh out.
However, for this very reason I wish to say, with all sincerity, that I have my doubts about some aspects of these proposals and cannot endorse them.
I refer to the excessive share of biofuels, despite growing misgivings in many quarters.
I refer to the risk that some people will be able to equate nuclear with a clean and renewable source of energy, which it is not.
I refer to the over-reliance on carbon capture technology rather than other, better practices.
Finally, I refer to the waivers on emission limits for polluting countries or sectors such as iron and steel.
In this way we risk sapping Europe's credibility, rather than reinforcing it in a crucial phase like the one initiated by the Bali Conference.
The ground rules were laid down in Bali for signing a post-Kyoto agreement.
In order to achieve this - and we must - there will be a need for considerable political will and the capacity to construct a complex scheme, but also consistency.
Political will means regarding climate issues as an acid test for Europe and for a different type of globalisation.
Consistency means moving towards the 20/20/20: reduction of emissions, energy efficiency and use of renewable energy.
We therefore need to identify a package of priority measures to be approved over the coming year, before Parliament is dissolved and new elections are held.
Over and above the 20/20/20, the package must include measures on vehicles and aircraft that make the general reduction pledges credible, partly by means of vertical policies.
To this extent, waivers in sectors such as iron and steel would be a big mistake.
We also need to build in the complexity needed for a strong agreement, one calling for a new globalisation scenario based no longer on competition but on cooperation and technology transfer.
In addition, it is crucial to explore novel ideas, such as Mrs Merkel's proposal on calculating per capita emissions, and to think about adjustments affecting in particular continents like Africa, which pollute less and are much harder hit by climate change.
It is by this yardstick, the plight of Africa, that Europe's contribution and dedication will be judged.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, this is an important day for environmental and energy policy.
I would like to thank the European Commission for this energy package that has been presented.
This legislative package that we now have has built on the decisions taken last year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
A characteristic of the proposals presented is that the various interests have not been registered, not even within the European Commission.
In recent days we have all heard criticisms of the suggestions, particularly from energy-intensive industry.
The amendments to the Emissions Trading Directive will certainly hurt various sectors.
Nevertheless, I think that we must take steps now, even though it may be difficult.
I also note with interest the proposed directive on carbon capture and storage.
It would be wonderful if more renewable energy sources were found: up to 20% of energy by 2020, as we have been told.
We must view take a critical look at the 10% target for biofuels.
The sustainability criteria must have a clearly defined place in this directive.
The Committee on the Environment will be the committee responsible for most of these proposals.
This means that it has to be effective, but we are optimistic about the final outcome.
In the coming months we will be hearing some strong criticism from the lobbies, but there will also be widespread support.
We must stand firm and ensure that the legislative frameworks ensure responsibility and justice in everything and for everyone, but particularly with regard to the environment.
(SK) Thank you, Madam President, Mr Barroso, and Commissioners Dimas and Piebalgs for the proposal you have presented.
I see it as being of paramount importance for all of us and for the future of Europe.
