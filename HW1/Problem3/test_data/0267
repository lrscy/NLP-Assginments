Setting aside the excesses, we should also be aware that, in the world of association football for example, only one per cent of all players registered with the International Federation of Football Associations are professionals.
So what we must try to defend is the whole of sporting activity, not just one aspect of it.
I believe that this is extremely important.
With regard to doping, I entirely agree with the idea that its underlying causes have to be tackled.
We have heard talk of sporting calendars. Let me also mention the dependence of some sportspeople on results and on sponsorship.
Similarly, there is a need to speak about the pressures from the media giants, which invariably try to raise the stakes in any competition.
So, the underlying causes have to be tackled, and without delay; I believe the accent must be placed on controls, on sporting sanctions and on action against the supply chains.
Not enough action is being taken at the level of the European Union to dismantle the chains through which these stimulants are made available within sporting circles.
Concerning the specific question that was asked, I believe it is absolutely essential that each Member State and the European Union as a whole should work on a sort of convention which would be signed between the States and WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, to facilitate the work of WADA in all countries, whatever their current legislation.
On the question of transfers, allow me to give my position and the position of the French Presidency.
I am not in favour of maintaining the status quo, because we are familiar with the huge excesses which it has created and which have no economic, social or sporting justification.
Nor do I wish the transfer system to disappear completely, because that would bring about an even more anarchic free-for-all than the one we are experiencing today, and the essential focus of inter-club rivalry would be the ability to offer the fattest pay packets.
In the past 48 hours, FIFA has made some extremely constructive and interesting proposals, which, if adopted, would serve to protect the youth-development system and individual rights, as well as satisfying the clubs' need to build and train teams.
This should be an interesting basis for discussion with the Commission, as Mrs Reding was explaining a short while ago.
So there is the possibility of innovative proposals in this domain.
It is vital, however, that some of the major clubs which seek complete deregulation, so that they can organise private competitions, do not try to sabotage the discussion process on which FIFA and the Commission are about to embark.
Someone spoke of the 'social role of sport' and asked whether it meant that sport was the opium of the people.
No, I believe that the social role of sport simply consists of enabling individuals to find themselves through an activity, to blossom, to meet other individuals and to engage together in something of benefit to them in their lives.
Finally, you may rest assured that the French Presidency, having listened to you, will proceed with great determination towards the establishment of a solid basis for the recognition of the specific status of sport and in the fight against doping.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking all the political groups for the support they have expressed for the action of the Commission on the issue of the transfer rules.
We shall enter into dialogue now with a view to finding, along with the European football chiefs, a negotiated solution in the form of a new transfer system which is in the interests of football and is consistent with the European Treaties.
Mr President, it is perhaps symbolic that we should be starting this debate on future policy just before the Sydney Olympics with two rapporteurs who are former Olympic champions.
What finer symbol could there be to demonstrate the union, the collaboration, we have seen between the political and sporting worlds in this arena today?
Allow me to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea, for their important contributions.
Allow me also to thank the chairman and members of the competent parliamentary committee for their constant, unstinting collaboration and to thank Parliament, which is a veritable mouthpiece of the European sporting family and which has always demonstrated the utmost solidarity with initiatives taken by both the Commission and the sports ministers to strengthen sport in Europe.
I am also gratified, Mr President, to note that the two communications issued in December 1999 have generated very lively interest and very broad support.
The views of the Commission and Parliament coincide, and they coincide with those of the public too.
I also listened with great interest to the words of Mrs Buffet, who shed valuable light on our deliberations.
If I had not already known, her words would have convinced me that we are moving in the same direction, that we are working together in the interest of sport.
The concerns expressed by the President of the Council are also those of Parliament and are the same concerns which the Commission has expressed in its two communications.
I shall mention four of them and shall return to them in due course. They are the protection of young sportspeople, commitment to the social role of sport, preservation of the sporting ethic and adherence to the principle of solidarity.
These are common lines of action; each of us in our respective spheres and all of us together must pursue our efforts to ensure that concrete action is taken in each of those areas.
I hope that the declaration planned by the French Presidency for the meeting of the European Council in Nice can help to define more clearly the specific character of sport.
Beyond the observations which the rapporteurs have made, and to which I fully subscribe, the two draft resolutions prompt me to make one or two additional comments.
I shall start with a few words on the Community support plan to combat doping in sport.
Doping in sport is not simply an ethical problem.
It has become a question of public health, and all the relevant players need to be mobilised to deal with it. For that reason, in response to the request made by the Vienna Council and by Parliament, the ministers responsible for sport and the Commission set to work on this problem.
The support plan you have been examining is more or less the outcome of this work - a provisional outcome, admittedly, because it is only one stage in a longer process.
It does seek, however, to define a global strategy to combat this evil. Moreover, in its communication the Commission opted for a three-pronged approach, which is also reflected in this strategy: first of all, assembling expert opinion on the ethical, legal and scientific implications of doping; secondly, contributing to the World Anti-Doping Conference and working with the Olympic movement on the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency and, thirdly, mobilising the resources at the disposal of the Community with a view to supplementing the initiatives that are already being pursued in the Member States and lending them a Community dimension.
I have already begun to implement this plan, and I should like to present briefly to you today the first initiatives taken by the Commission to combat doping.
Firstly, with regard to the initial objective, the Commission requested the opinion of the European Group on Ethics, which was delivered on 11 November 1999; the group proposed a number of measures, and the Commission will take these into consideration in its future actions.
Let us move on to the World Anti-Doping Agency.
As you know, and as Mrs Buffet mentioned, the voluntarist approach of the European Union enabled this Agency to see the light of day.
Now that it has been successfully brought to life, we must ensure that the Community presence in the Agency is strong and coordinated.
At the beginning of April, I also presented a communication to my fellow Commissioners on possible Community membership of the Agency.
The question was examined by the Commission, which adopted a very firm and clear position: Community participation could only be envisaged if it had the unanimous backing of all Member States.
I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the efforts currently being undertaken by the French Presidency will lead to the creation of this unanimity and that the Community will be able to participate in the work of the Agency, not only in a financial sense but also, and especially, in the formulation of ideas and political inputs.
We are expected to play a leading role, and we are prepared to do so.
Let me mention in passing that, pending the inclusion in the Commission budget of our contribution towards the Agency' s operating expenditure, the Commission has released EUR 1.5 million to fund specific initiatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Lastly, the Commission has to mobilise the resources at its disposal for the fight against doping.
It is essential, for instance, to ensure maximum coordination of policies and regulatory measures.
My fellow Commissioners, David Byrne, Commissioner for Health, and Philippe Busquin, who has the Research portfolio, are working at the moment on important initiatives in collaboration with my departments.
The adoption of a recommendation on sport and doping is also planned for this autumn.
Moreover, the Commission is funding a research project which ought to lead to the standardisation of procedures in the European laboratories that specialise in the fight against doping.
Contacts have also been established with the new Commission departments devoted to justice and home affairs, since, as your report rightly indicates, new opportunities are arising to deal with the doping issue in the framework of legislation for the suppression of drug trafficking.
Finally, you will easily understand that, in the departments under my responsibility, namely education, vocational training and youth, the programmes that have been prepared will play a significant part in informing young people, raising their awareness of the issues and enlisting their aid in the fight against doping.
Coordination, Mr President, is a means of extending the scope of the action we are able to take here.
In accordance with the spirit of the Helsinki report, I have entered into dialogue with governments as well as with the European sports federations on the question of the anti-doping campaign.
When I visit Sydney for the Olympic Games, I shall endeavour, together with Mrs Buffet, to meet with sports ministers from the other continents with a view to widening the range of our action and establishing bonds of solidarity among political leaders at a global level.
I should like to take this occasion to thank Parliament for having given us the green light to launch pilot projects.
The sum of EUR 5 million has been allocated.
One and a half million of this amount has been assigned to the Anti-Doping Agency; the remainder is to be used to finance fifteen European projects.
Information campaigns and a number of studies will be conducted, mainly to analyse the underlying causes of doping, in the closest of collaboration with universities, researchers and the sporting community.
You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen of the House, that our response to the report has already been initiated and that the results of your work here are very encouraging in my eyes.
I believe that all of this is only one stage in a process, that more is expected of us, and I am convinced that the Zabell report will serve the Commission as a signpost and a landmark, both in its present activities and in its future initiatives.
Mr President, allow me now to highlight the Helsinki report and the social dimension of sport.
This report has furnished the Commission with its first defined 'doctrine' in the realm of sport.
In that respect, the report is fundamental, and I thank Parliament for having played a crucial role in its development.
In 1997, in fact, Parliament called on the Commission to prepare a Community initiative in the domain of sport, and in that same year a declaration on sport was annexed to the Treaty, calling on the European institutions to consult with the sports associations before proceeding to deal with any major sports issue.
The Commission then launched the broad consultation process from which the Helsinki report drew its inspiration.
I, myself, have been privileged to receive solid support from three presidencies, namely the Finnish, the Portuguese and now the French.
It is my wish that this favourable combination of circumstances should serve to foster progress, so that sport can be given its due place within the activity of the Community.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, sport is in good health, maybe even in very good health.
If we consider the revenue from television rights or from the sale of sportswear and sports equipment, we have to conclude that sport has never been on a sounder economic footing.
It is clear, however, that this economic performance must not be tarnished by the threats that we have all identified together: the phenomenon of doping, the lack of protection afforded to young sportsmen and women, over-commercialisation and the violence that occurs inside and outside sports stadiums.
A common approach must be adopted to address these problems. In its Helsinki report, the Commission clearly signalled that it cannot solve all these problems by its own efforts alone.
There will be three levels of action: the world of sport, national decision-makers and the Community.
The world of sport comes first.
Since 1989, the Commission has been regularly proclaiming its belief in respect for the autonomy of the sports organisations.
But autonomy implies responsibility; it presupposes the will and ability to assimilate the new economic situation and adapt existing structures to the new realities of the sporting world.
The federations, in fact, must make an extra effort to achieve internal democratisation and to adapt their structures to the needs of amateur sport on the one hand, and those of professional sport on the other.
They must try to be more transparent in the way they manage sponsorship and television rights.
And as long as the principles of solidarity and the social function, on which the European Parliament has laid emphasis, are clearly respected, we can provide for derogation in specific instances from the rules of competition, for example in connection with the collective sale of television rights.
It must be perfectly clear, however, that a blanket exemption from these rules can never be warranted.
Moreover, we are banking on transparency and dialogue.
To that end, on 17 April I hosted a meeting in Brussels with all the European sports federations, and I shall do so again, together with Mrs Buffet, on 26 and 27 October.
We will organise a large European forum on sport in Lille, where we will once again arrange a dialogue between political circles and the European federations.
The second level is that of the national authorities.
Even if the federal organisation of sport is identical throughout Europe, the way it is dealt with administratively varies radically depending on each state or even each region' s cultural and political traditions.
Some questions have to be resolved at national level, in line with each state' s national laws and political approach to sport.
Here I would also stress the importance of local authorities and councils, who are key players and need to be given a more important role to play.
I would also add, in the same vein, that we must accord due respect for the small clubs and their countless voluntary workers who give sport a real civic dimension.
The third level is the Community level, which has to be involved solely in resolving questions that arise in relation to Community legislation and to underpin national measures, such as combating doping.
The Feira European Council asked the Commission to take account of the specific characteristics of sport and of its social dimension.
There are nearly 600 000 sports clubs in Europe and 60% of young people who are members of an association belong to a sports club.
These are the voters, Mr President, and I would be happy to see those who represent these voters listen to what I have to say, because it concerns them all.
(Applause)
Neither the European Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the Council can ignore the fact that the sports movement represents a real force in society.
Can we pursue effective common policies without taking account of the role of the grass-roots sports organisations?
I do not think so.
And among the aspects I think are of major interest, I believe that the role and quality of physical education in schools come top of the list.
We must not disregard the importance of protecting the education and the vocational reintegration of young sportsmen and women and sport is becoming a genuinely important part of the Youth programme.
I agree with you that sport and physical activity form an excellent counterbalance to other activities.
And I am convinced that we must make a special effort to protect young athletes more effectively.
I know that Mrs Buffet fully shares the Commission' s views and I am also aware of Parliament' s views in this regard.
To that end, the Commission has sent the Member States a questionnaire, asking them about methods to protect the health and education of young athletes, and I intend to submit a draft recommendation to the Member States on improving the protection of the education and health of young sportsmen and women.
Lastly, apart from the Youth programmes, other Community programmes, such as those on combating discrimination and gender equality, the disabled and minorities, must also take account of sport, as must the development programmes.
This brings me to a final comment, Mr President, one that is important for the future.
Do we need an article in a new treaty, or a protocol, in order to make progress in this area?
As I have often told you, I am involved in performing high-wire acrobatics right now, without a safety net, and an article could provide the safety net I dream of.
At the same time, though, we must keep our feet on the ground.
Neither an article nor a protocol could, in themselves, resolve all the problems of sport.
There is no miracle cure.
First we must consider how useful these references could be and what we want to do.
I will tell you my personal views.
I am not in favour of a protocol that would exempt the federations from the major Community principles.
That kind of protocol would, moreover, make it quite impossible to take account of the social dimension of sport.
I would also be against introducing an article in the Treaty seeking to harmonise sport in Europe.
That is not our aim.
But as your rapporteurs and many speakers have pointed out, the kind of article you are envisaging, similar to the one on education and culture that fully respected the subsidiarity principle, is, in my view, worth serious consideration.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Pack' s 1977 report proposed organising a European Year of Sport.
I have listened carefully to your messages today.
You keep coming back to that idea, emphasising it, and I quite agree with you.
I intend to submit a communication to the Commission on proclaiming the year 2004 the European Year of Sport.
(Applause)
Why 2004?
Because, for the first time in this millennium, the Olympic Games will be held in Europe; even more importantly, they will be returning to their birthplace.
So, we could not imagine a better opportunity to encourage the practice of sport, to promote its true values, to highlight its ethical principles, to revive the spirit of the Olympic truce.
A European Year of Sport would underpin the work done by the Greek authorities, would emphasise the importance Europe attaches to sport and would remind the whole world that sport must bring people together.
It would also show that Europe is a real force in terms of fair play, sport for all, and sport for the citizen.
It is with that in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that, like your rapporteurs, Olympic champions that they are, I hope that those men and women who will be making superhuman efforts in Sydney in a few days' time will all be winners, because true sport, fair play in sport, is not a question of coming first but of surpassing one' s own limitations.
Let us, too, surpass ourselves in our endeavours to boost European sport.
(Applause)
Thank you Commissioner.
With regard to what has just happened, I am sorry, but, as you could see, it is very hard to make a speech when the Members are in the Chamber to vote.
I am sorry, but many Members did, however, listen attentively to you.
Some of them even gestured to me to resort to an Olympic sport - gavel-throwing - in order to silence certain other Members who were making too much noise.
Unfortunately though, I only have one gavel: I would have needed 80 or 100 to throw at all the Members who were not listening to your speech.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr President, in West Timor, or rather the Indonesian part of the island of Timor, at least three United Nations officials from the UNHCR were violently beaten and killed yesterday.
The European Parliament must denounce this barbarous and despicable act, which according to some eyewitness reports took place with the complicity or connivance of the Indonesian military authorities.
Secondly, this act occurred on the same day that the majority of Heads of State and Government were meeting in New York at the Millennium Summit organised by the United Nations itself, which demonstrates the weakness of this organisation and of the instruments at its disposal to protect men and women far from their own countries who were simply endeavouring to defend human rights and the rights of refugees.
Mr President, I would like you to convey a message of solidarity to the United Nations. I would also like you to inform the Indonesian authorities of the outrage felt by the Members of the European Parliament and to stress our wish that people whose sole objective is to defend peace, human rights and the dignity of the Timorese people, be they in Indonesia or in Timor Lorosae, should be respected.
I am sure the President would be prepared to convey her views to the appropriate authorities in the manner which you indicated.
The Heads of State and Government, meeting in the UN, observed a minute of silence in honour of the peacekeepers who died and I think it would be appropriate if this House did the same.
(The house rose and observed a minute's silence)
Mr President, I wish to support the sentiments expressed by Mr Seguro and to draw the Commission's attention to this issue.
On various occasions throughout this year I have emphasised the potentially premature nature of the new policy being adopted by the European Union towards Indonesia, given that it is particularly clear that there is a degree of uncertainty.
This has unfortunately become clear in recent weeks.
I have addressed various questions to the Commission on this subject, and the seriousness of yesterday's events, together with other facts such as the infiltration of militias into East Timor, clearly demonstrate that the situation is not yet safe.
The European Union must, once more, make its views known to the Indonesian Government as forcefully as possible, in particular through the channel of the European Commission.
We understand the difficulty of the situation in Indonesia, but it is essential to demand that the Indonesian Government should exercise its authority on its own territory.
We will only be able to change our attitude towards that country once democracy is effectively ensured in Indonesia and self-determination and peace are guaranteed on Timor.
Mr President, I very rarely rise on a point of order and particularly now when we have extremely important votes to conduct, I only do so on what I consider to be an extremely important point.
Your predecessor in the chair has just apologised to Commissioner Reding and I think that the whole House would wish to endorse that verbal apology.
This week we have demonstrated here in Parliament that when we want to call the Commission to order, we can do so and the Commission responds in the appropriate manner.
But when a Commissioner is making an extremely important speech which demonstrates the amount of work and effort that she has put into a subject, which perhaps generates as much interest in the people we represent as anything else, there is complete chaos and a shambles in the Chamber.
I do not accept what your predecessor said, that it was difficult to call the house to order; that can always be done and it should be done.
My request is that an apology to Commissioner Reding be now made in writing on behalf of Parliament and I hope this is not an experience we see repeated.
I know that Viviane Reding is a very robust parliamentarian, as well as now a Commissioner and I am sure she managed to cope with it, but I take the point.
It is perfectly appropriate to make her an apology in writing.
Vote
This report has some positive aspects, in particular the restatement of the binding nature of the proposed measures to protect water quality.
But by granting deadlines, in particular a 20-year time-limit for banning discharges of hazardous substances, the report makes a nonsense of its own resolution.
That time-limit is equivalent to authorising undertakings to discharge their toxic substances for another 20 years.
Moreover, it is not made sufficiently clear that it is up to polluting undertakings to pay for any damage they have caused.
As for charging for water, the only decision that would be in the interests of the public would be a ban on all private profit-making from the supply and distribution of water, but that is not even mentioned in this report, which, in pillorying Ireland for its practice of publicly financing water provision, is instead at pains to stress the commercial nature of this vital substance.
That is why we abstained.
Although I support the report, I wish to make known certain reservations pertaining to same.
Ireland's derogation for domestic water charges is not as strong as I would want it to be.
The key provisions - Art. 9, paragraph 4 - state that a Member State "shall not be in breach of this Directive" if a decision not to introduce domestic water charges based on "established practice does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive".
It follows from this paragraph that a decision not to impose water charges would be in breach of the Directive if it can be linked to the Irish Government's failure to meet the new standards.
I have no confidence, given the Irish Government's failure to date, that they will reach the standards set.
. I support the Conciliation Agreement which has been agreed by the European Parliament and the European Council on the Framework Directive on Water.
This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water.
The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water, coastal water, internal waste and ground water now and into the future.
The European Council, which represents the fifteen Governments of the EU, originally did not include any provisions relating to the elimination of hazardous substances in this new Water Directive.
I am supporting this Conciliation Agreement, which guarantees that the elimination of hazardous substances will now feature in this Directive and addresses this imbalance.
From an Irish perspective, we make the working assumption that the elimination of hazardous substances includes the prohibition on discharging radioactive substances as well.
Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive.
This Directive now calls on Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter-pays principle.
Member States must ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies will provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently.
Member States will be allowed on an exceptional basis to opt out of the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on established national practices.
Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue.
Under existing EU Treaties such tax changes require the unanimous support of all EU Governments.
It is only right and proper that this matter of taxation is left in the domain of Member States, which must have the final say as to what taxation policies, at local or national level, it wishes to pursue.
As a result of the implementation of this Directive, the safety of water quality standards in Europe will substantially improve.
. (DE) With its communication "Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources", the European Commission is seeking to harmonise and give practical form to the economic provisions of the EC framework directive on water resources.
The Commission's proposal to monitor observance of the break-even principle by means of price surveillance is aimed at those EU Member States that still heavily subsidise their water industries.
In contrast, in Germany the break-even principle is already being implemented, as is monitoring of unfair practices by the cartel office and by local authorities.
Against this background, the framework directive on water resources and the Commission proposal on water pricing should not be used to create further layers of bureaucratic supervision in Germany.
Furthermore, the provisions on the charging of environmental and resource costs associated with water use are aimed at those Member States that still make excessive use of and pollute their water resources, and therefore not at Germany, where exceptional efforts are already being made in this respect.
The provisions of the framework directive on this point do not, therefore, provide any grounds for introducing a universal water or sewage tax in Germany, for example.
In view of the non-binding nature of the economic provisions of the framework directive on water resources and the Commission communication, there is a danger that there will be a considerable delay in implementing these provisions in the countries actually being targeted, if they are, in fact, implemented there at all.
If, as has already been the case with the transposition of other directives, Germany, the 'model pupil' , goes its own way, this would heighten the distortions in competition between the national water industries in the EU still further, thus running counter to the aim of the directive, which is to create a uniform framework for Europe's water industry.
Germany has to learn to implement EU provisions in accordance with the objectives of the directive, not as individual LÃ€nder would like.
With the EU framework directive on water resources we will once again see individual countries going their own way.
The framework directive on water has finally been adopted - very welcome news.
Ever since 1997 the European Parliament has been calling for the piecemeal nature of water legislation in Europe to be brought to an end.
After nearly four years, these rationalisation attempts have finally borne fruit.
The conciliation between Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the final stage in the legislative procedure, has enabled what I consider a balanced and satisfactory compromise to be reached.
The discussions were difficult, but I am happy that the Council finally agreed to make the main objectives of these new rules binding.
Our Parliament could not have endorsed a text which was nothing more than a statement of intent.
The PPE/DE Group has always taken an ambitious and realistic stance.
In my view, it was essential for this new framework directive to guarantee, in the future and for the sake of future generations, improvements in European water quality.
Henceforth, water management in Europe will be based on the principle of a hydrographical district, a body that goes beyond the administrative boundaries of Member States and takes account of the real water situation in Europe.
The objective is gradually to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances, within 20 years of their identification.
That is a realistic compromise between, on the one hand, Mrs Lienemann' s initial position in favour of a zero level of discharges into water and, on the other, the position of the Council, which was opposed to any binding objective.
A list of what are called 'priority' substances will be submitted to the European Parliament in the near future.
That will be a vital step and I hope our Parliament will be able to follow the same line as today.
Under the polluter-pays principle, the Member States will have to incorporate environmental costs in water pricing.
That is real progress.
Water is a vulnerable and invaluable natural resource.
Public health and long-term supplies are at stake just as much as biological diversity and landscape conservation.
For all these reasons, I voted for this text.
Nevertheless, I am sorry that we could not keep the article allowing Member States to transfer water in the form in which we had adopted it at second reading.
That kind of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always upheld.
In that sense, it deserves strong EU support, in the context of promoting trans-European networks and regional policy.
All proposals aimed at improving the environment in Europe are to be welcomed.
Trying to incorporate piecemeal water policies in one framework directive represents a considerable challenge.
The binding commitment the European Union has made to its Member States to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances into water within 20 years is certainly a step forward, even if 3 years are enough for certain chemical products.
Although we welcome the introduction of water management plans based on hydrographic basins, we must remain vigilant when applying these policies; here I am thinking particularly of the project to divert water from the Rhone basin towards Spain.
In that specific case, priority should be given to water management and the water savings that can be made, before massive projects to transfer water from one hydrographic basin to another are proposed.
The European Union now also needs to consider water pricing.
It is unacceptable for multinationals alone to fix water prices, on the pretext that they are providing a technical water management service.
This directive represents a step in the right direction, but there will have to be more precise rules to reduce water pollution upstream.
Florenz report (A5-0212/2000)
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Conciliation Committee' s definitive decision on the directive on end-of-life vehicles.
I voted in favour, not just because pensioners and elderly people who have reached a certain age feel that their fate is similar to that of cars, but, above all, because it is right and proper that, at last, thanks to Europe' s initiative, a solution has been found to the problem of where to put cars when they do not work any more.
I would, however, suggest improving on our decision, by providing for the payment of a deposit when a new car is purchased, to be returned when the old car is brought back.
I welcome the agreement which has been secured between the European Parliament and the European Council which represents the fifteen Governments of the European Union on this specific directive.
We know that each year within the EU there are up to nine million vehicles that are scrapped on an annual basis.
This directive, which will now be enacted uniformly across the European Union, will ensure that cars will be disposed of in the future in a more environmentally friendly manner.
All vehicles within the European Union must now be fully recyclable by the year 2015.
This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation.
Up to 75% of all metallic components in new vehicles can be recycled as metal scrap.
This process should and must continue in an effort to promote higher environmental standards.
This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components.
This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union.
The common position established the right for the last owner to return a vehicle to a treatment facility free of charge.
There is an obligation on manufacturers to bear the whole or a large part of the cost of implementing these measures and for them to take back end-of-life vehicles at no charge to the last owner.
It was agreed at conciliation between the European Parliament and the fifteen Governments of the EU that this provision should now apply from 1 January 2007.
However, any Member State within the EU is free to implement this specific provision of this directive earlier than this date.
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances.
We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage.
The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead.
Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years.
In conclusion, I have had much representation in Ireland on the need to take cognisance of the special vintage car industry in Europe.
At the request of the European Parliament, collector's vehicles will now be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive.
This is very important in light of the key social and economic role the vintage car sector plays in promoting tourism across the length and breadth of Europe.
We conservatives seldom vote against conciliations.
We cannot, however, support the compromise reached in the conciliation group concerning the way in which end-of-life vehicles are to be dealt with.
The compromise contains retroactive measures, and we cannot back a legislative text which alters the rules retrospectively.
Retroactive legislation affects competition and is unacceptable from a legal point of view.
. (FR) I have spoken several times previously on this complex subject involving quite considerable economic interests, but also, and above all, the protection of the environment.
The proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles, submitted in 1997, is aimed at preventing the creation of scrap from vehicles and promoting the re-use, recycling and recovery of vehicles and their components, so as to reduce the amount of scrap produced by end-of-life vehicles that are dumped or incinerated without any energy recovery.
The European Commission' s strategy is based on measures such as increasing the percentage of re-usable components, ensuring an adequate number of collection points for end-of-life vehicles, achieving a number of objectives regarding the re-use and recovery of end-of-life vehicles, checks on the use of certain heavy metals in vehicle manufacture and ensuring that the cost of disposing of end-of-life vehicles is not borne by the last owner.
The negotiations came up against stumbling blocks on several points.
The difficulties focused on producer liability and the treatment of heavy metals.
After several hours of conciliation, the negotiators managed to reach agreement.
On the question of producer liability, the directive stipulated that the last owner would be able to return an end-of-life vehicle free of charge and required producers to bear a substantial part of the cost of treating end-of-life vehicles.
The compromise provides that for new vehicles, i.e. for those put on the market after 1 July 2002, producers should be liable from that date.
For existing vehicles, i.e. vehicles put on the market before 1 July 2002, producer liability would begin in 2007 rather than 2006.
The directive would also allow Member States to introduce these provisions before the dates specified.
On the question of heavy metals, the Council and Parliament have agreed that vehicles put on the market after 1 July 2003 should no longer contain heavy metals such as cadmium, lead or hexavalent chromium.
The two delegations reached agreement on the exceptions set out in Annex 2 of the directive.
Apart from that, I am glad that Parliament' s call for vintage cars to be excluded from the scope of the directive was favourably received.
. (FR) The compromise that came out of the conciliation procedure, the final legislative stage, is the result of hard negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
Far from being satisfactory, I see it merely as a first step, although it does, in some respects, go in the right direction.
While I welcome the figured objectives that have been set (by 2006, 85% of the weight of vehicles produced after 1980 is to be recycled, re-used or recovered, and 95% by 2015) I regret the hypocrisy of some of the provisions advocated by the PSE and supported by the Socialist and Social-democratic Governments.
The Council of Ministers has, in fact, remained inflexible about allowing the owner to return his end-of-life vehicle free of charge.
That is a demagogic provision.
It may well be based on goodwill towards the consumer, but it is totally unrealistic.
In fact, the directive stipulates that the cost of treatment will be borne entirely by the producers.
The latter are bound to pass on at least part of these costs to the purchase price of new vehicles.
So, far from encouraging the purchase of a new generation of less polluting vehicles, this measure is a hidden bonus for those who own the most polluting old vehicles.
The Council of Ministers finally responded to the wishes of the MEPs, who had been calling since the first reading, for vintage vehicles to be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive.
The amendment I tabled and supported has, in fact, been fully incorporated into the final text.
In wider terms, this directive is not ambitious enough.
For example, it says nothing at all about the problem of the dumped cars that disfigure the landscape.
Despite the polluter-pays principle, it is the taxpayers who bear the cost of removing them.
It is a pity that neither this directive nor the directive on the disposal of waste has concerned itself with this problem, which, after all, has disastrous environmental effects in much of Europe.
De Roo report (A5-0218/2000)
Mr President, following this directive, tyres will be quieter: cars, lorries and road trains will make less noise as they drive along roads and motorways.
That is good news, because pensioners like peace and quiet.
Nevertheless, four weeks ago, Mr President, I was crossing the road near the Gare du Nord in Brussels, and a shiver went down my spine because it was night, you could have heard a pin drop, and I saw a tram pass behind me in complete silence.
Thankfully, God wanted me to be here so I could give my explanations of votes and I was not hurt.
But are we really sure that less noisy tyres are really in everyone' s best interests?
We can only congratulate our colleague, Mr de Roo, and support him in his efforts to include noise pollution in the context of protecting the environment.
Unfortunately, the impact of the increase in road traffic density is not limited to pollution from end-of-life vehicles and their recycling, something that has not yet been resolved in spite of its worldwide nature, or to the damage and harm this does to the air we breathe, or even to the serious resultant global warming.
Road traffic also produces considerable, incessant noise pollution, which millions of people living beside roads and motorways as well as the humble pedestrian have to suffer on a daily basis.
So, the purpose of Mr de Roo' s proposals is to highlight a form of pollution that is generally overshadowed by others, and here we support him fully.
But let us not forget that we must also set out more general requirements in relation to pollution from cars, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in developed societies and in our towns, and let us put pressure on the Commission to introduce policies to shift traffic off the roads and onto the railways and public transport.
The Strasbourg tram is a clear illustration of this.
.
(NL) For a long time now, the use of cars for transporting people and goods has been such a matter of course that we have given little thought to the effect this has had on many people and the environment.
We only saw the economic gain and how convenient it was for the car driver, not the drawbacks.
Exhaust fumes and the lack of traffic safety were accepted as part of the deal, as well as the noise cars generate.
Fortunately, over the past few years, this attitude has started to change.
Many cities give bicycles and trains more space and restrict the freedom of cars.
This does not end the problems caused by cars and lorries.
The number of cars is still on the increase, as is the proportion of freight transport by road, and with it, noise pollution.
Looking at it through the eyes of the car industry, it is evident that manufacturers will pass the buck.
They will look to the road owner - in general the Government - to increase safety and to reduce environmental pollution.
As long as the car industry succeeds in doing this, they, themselves, do not have to look into reducing pollution caused by cars, or incur any additional costs as a result.
In their opinion, noise pollution should be countered by using 'very open asphalt concrete' , a road surface which, however, can turn unexpectedly slippery overnight when frosty.
What matters now is that a choice should be made between the interests of the car and the car-tyre industries on the one hand, and the interests of the public and the environment on the other.
Far too often, we see that the short-term interests of powerful industrial groups are given priority, whilst the majority of our electorate increasingly sets different requirements for political decision-making.
Protecting the quality of our life, rather than making a fast buck, is gaining in importance all the time.
This contrast was highlighted once again during the debate on car tyres.
Mr De Roo was right in demonstrating that the regulation proposed by the Commission will not sufficiently improve matters, and that it is technically possible to reduce pollution by a few decibels.
This simply requires the political will to put sufficient regulations in place, to monitor compliance with the regulations and not to allow too much leeway.
The Group of the European United Left has constantly backed Mr De Roo in this.
We regret that his reasonable and self-evident proposals cannot count on the general approval they deserve.
Mankind moves, and moves other objects.
Movement creates noise.
Our amazing age of movement, to which we also owe our sense of freedom, is a noisy one.
It is our freedom that creates noise.
The states, and also industry, are working to combat this noise pollution, which can cause illness.
The industry endorses the legislator' s resolve to make transport, the movement of people and goods, which is a cornerstone of free movement, safer and less polluting.
We are aware of the progress made in road holding, in resistance to wear and tear, in reducing fuel consumption, but for known technical reasons the investments in research and technology do not yet allow all the rapporteur' s demands to be reconciled.
Global performance is estimated according to a range of often conflicting criteria that are well-known to tyre-manufacturers.
Yet we chose not to support the rapporteur because the amendments he has proposed will adversely affect safety, our safety, the life span of tyres and their road-holding properties.
We condemn these amendments, which would lead to what I would also call a nonsense in industrial terms.
Yet again, the Union is putting the devil in the detail.
And I will never cease to be surprised at the areas the Commission pokes around in and finds reason to legislate on.
Noise in all its forms may well be a scourge in our town centres, around our airports, on our roads, yet surely we should put road safety first.
Anyway, what do we find most annoying on a day-to-day basis?
Is it the muffled sound of tyres in contact with the road, or the sudden acceleration of vehicles and the roar of powerful motorcycles?
It would be better to do some in-depth research on road surface noise and dangers.
Let us not lose our sense of priorities and, what I would term, legislative efficiency.
Bakopoulos report (A5-0168/2000)
Mr President, I also voted for the Bakopoulos report because it is certainly right to exercise a certain amount of caution when placing products on the market which could be harmful to us all.
But I would suggest that we are going too far with these directives, and that we are taking up too much of Parliament' s time discussing such technical subjects, such technically important subjects.
Would it not be preferable to authorise the Commission to decide in a single directive which new harmful elements should be marketed, thereby avoiding spending so much time on each occasion that this comes up, going through the procedures to ban the placing on the market of new products yet again?
AIDS:
We voted for the joint resolution on AIDS, because if it produced any effects, and there is no guarantee of this, it would mean progress.
Yet we do not always agree with the wording, in particular of the recital that implicates only the African Governments or cultural and religious traditions that obstruct the effective implementation of anti-AIDS measures. That may be true, but at the same time it is a way of concealing the responsibility of an entire health system dominated by pharmaceutical trusts and the race for profit.
The reason people die in Africa, as in many poor countries, of malaria, bilharzia, tuberculosis or even just measles is not because of religious obstacles but because the people who are ill can afford neither medicines or care.
Telecommunications:
We voted against the joint resolution on mergers in the telecommunications sector.
This resolution, in fact, does away with any idea of public service in considering that this sector, like others, should be based on 'an open market economy with competition' .
Moreover, the vague reference to the 'guarantee of growth and employment' will certainly not protect workers against the likelihood of redundancies as a result of future mergers.
No binding rules are being envisaged to prevent companies from laying off workers on the pretext of restructuring, whereas the truth is that they are seeking to boost their profits.
Furthermore, obviously we do not propose to join in the ode to 'effective competition' contained in this resolution.
Once again communication is being regarded purely as a commodity from which to derive the highest possible profit.
We reject that approach, which disregards people' s social needs.
The ever-increasing influx of private capital into public operators that have become multinationals is now encouraging these operators to wage a ruthless economic war.
This means a way of sharing out the world markets that gives priority to the more profitable areas and leads to unfair pricing, quite apart from job losses and job insecurity for hundreds of thousands of workers.
The national and European political authorities must therefore impose public service constraints on all these operators, whatever their origin, for example:
for fixed telecommunications: lower charges for local calls, which in France make up 83% of the average bill of private individuals;
for mobile communications: in addition to lower charges, total coverage of the territory, even if it means using satellite links in inaccessible places;
for rapid Internet access: in addition to a radical reduction in charges, a timetable for the complete coverage of the territory.
At a time of indecent, record profits, that is how to include communication among the fundamental rights respected by a quality public service.
Human cloning:
Mr President, the majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has voted in favour of this resolution.
In the debate in the Chamber yesterday on cloning, I heard a number of people more or less clearly defending cloning for the purposes of medical treatment, on the grounds that this would be quite different from cloning for reproductive purposes.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency now to engage in a new semantic debate or strategy of this kind which would lead to a watering down of the moral implications of cloning human beings.
Those who do not wish to permit any form of cloning would be viewed as immoral in the sense that we would be allowing people to suffer from diseases such as Parkinson' s which would be curable if only the ban on gene technology were lifted.
This is a completely absurd assertion which I think ought to be withdrawn.
Researchers throughout the world have said that Parkinson' s disease and other serious illnesses can perfectly well be cured by other methods.
We also heard Emma Bonino say that politicians must take risks, but we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that it is our absolute duty as elected representatives to identify the risks and to be careful.
In this connection, I should also like to ask the Group of the Party of European Socialists why they have not called on Tony Blair to withdraw the whole proposal, but are content to request that a committee on biotechnology be set up.
We must observe the precautionary principle, in this case more so than ever.
We must ask ourselves the most important question of all. For what purpose should we clone human beings?
I believe we must realise that there is a race going on in the field of genetic technology, which means that there is a great risk of overstepping the limits in a quite horrifying way. The technology is developing incredibly fast now.
We cannot just content ourselves with this debate.
Rather, we must push the debate further and speed it up, whilst also observing the precautionary principle.
I was one of the 237 MEPs who voted for the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats on human cloning.
Science has always had two sides to it: it has always been the case that discoveries can be used for our benefit or against us: the wheel can be used to move us around more quickly or to kill people; revolvers can be used to defend or murder people; atomic energy can improve our lives or make atomic bombs.
In the case of cloning research, I wonder whether, in actual fact, a decision has already been made to do something to harm humanity rather than waiting for unbiased research to generate scientific results and only then deciding how to use them.
It would have been better if Europe were able to decide and not just one Head of State.
Mr President, given the conflicting viewpoints on the therapeutic cloning of humans, we can imagine that a great deal of restraint will be needed when applying this new technique.
Commercial and industrial cloning, or cloning in order to create people with certain characteristics is unacceptable in everyone' s book, and rightly so.
Nevertheless, we are today dealing with two conflicting points of view.
Within the GUE/NGL Group, it has been left up to the conscience of the individual members as to how they wish to vote.
In my opinion, the difference between the views of the Christian Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Social Democrats and Liberals on the other hand is that the former emphasise the penal implications for the medical profession, whilst the latter focus on the need for further research into the effects.
I myself endorse the latter.
A solution needs to be found for people who need a new heart, a new kidney or liver, as well as for people suffering from Parkinson' s disease.
This too is a question of ethics.
My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, exercises utmost reserve with regard to cloning and genetic manipulation.
From this perspective, I have been able to support the alternative put forward by the Social Democrats and Liberals rather than that put forward by the Christian Democrats and Greens which goes for all-out rejection.
Moreover, it appears as though it will be possible, within the next couple of years, to use the recipients own brain stem cells to grow organs which are not rejected by their bodies.
I very much prefer this technique over and above the circuitous route developed in Great Britain, which is based on the reproductive technique.
Mr President, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities and the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I voted in favour of all parts of the resolution from the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats.
I am extremely pleased about the decision taken.
At the same time, I am concerned about the narrow majority by which the resolution was adopted: 237 votes in favour, 230 votes against and 43 abstentions.
I presented a text concerning the unique, equal and inviolable dignity of human life when the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was adopted almost unanimously by this Parliament, was referred to us for consideration.
It is important that we be guided by the view of human life which has characterised this Europe of ours for more than a thousand years.
Civilisation and humanity show their character most clearly in the way in which they treat life when it is defenceless.
We must say no to the cloning of human beings.
Human beings are subjects, not objects.
Mr President, I think it is a great achievement in human rights terms that we have succeeded in giving a signal with this resolution - a signal that it is not acceptable for embryos to be deliberately created for research purposes.
And I think that this resolution makes it clear that human life must not become a kind of consumer item.
But I, too, am unhappy about the small majority in favour of this motion for a resolution. I hope that this is just because of tactical games on the part of the Socialist Group.
I have to say that I think their behaviour here has been shameful.
There have been calls for a temporary committee without it being made clear that Tony Blair is delaying his decision until this committee comes to a conclusion.
This smacks of contradiction.
It is shameful, to say the least, to ditch all your principles out of loyalty to Blair.
I would like to stress once again that we have always said that this is about 'therapeutic cloning' .
We have the alternative of using human stem cells to achieve the same result.
But I also hope that the Commission will now have the courage to act on the demands we have made in this resolution, by refusing to grant research funding to establishments which use these means directly or indirectly.
Mr President, this morning our group discussed our attitude to paragraph 5 of the motion for a resolution on cloning, which states that there can be no difference made between cloning for reproductive purposes and any other sort.
The matter is a controversial one and depends very much on one' s chosen perspective.
There are two points of view, with no real great difference between them.
In the first place, technically speaking it is a question of the same sort of procedure.
Secondly, philosophically speaking, if the action is examined from the point of view of the foetus, there is no difference at all.
In either case it is being used as a tool, as something to use, and not as a living being with intrinsic value.
Everyone is touchingly unanimous in their opinion that cloning for purposes of reproduction is unethical.
My own profound concern relates to what grounds we have for preventing it, and I am someone who has studied philosophy.
Are our arguments later to be abandoned on the basis of the fact that we actually already clone anyway, technically speaking?
Does our purpose matter in the end, if the deed is the same?
I voted against Amendment No 5 today only because, in my opinion, it would have required justification.
However, I do not think that there are any grounds for making a distinction from the point of view of technical methods or the foetus.
For that reason, discrimination such as this cannot be approved without the proper kind of thorough discussion.
. (EL) My group, the European United Left, did not support either of the two motions.
We disagree with the proposal by the European People' s Party because, behind its total opposition to human cloning, it is merely taking up its familiar stand against abortion.
On the other hand, we are not covered by the Socialists' position because it does not take a stand against the decision by the British Government, which has paved the way for cloning for medical purposes, thus giving the American administration the green light to take similar action, as demanded by the biotechnological industry.
We believe that, without wasting any time, what we can do today on such a complicated and difficult issue is to set up a temporary parliamentary committee on bioethics to give us the basis for a substantiated, in-depth discussion of the problem of medical embryonic research resulting from human cloning.
Therapeutic cloning entails creating an embryo by cloning only to destroy it afterwards, in order to remove cells for medical research purposes and, later perhaps, with a view to curing currently fatal diseases.
So the intention cannot be said to be a bad one.
The method, however, is highly questionable, for at least two reasons. First, a life is created (either by using a surplus embryo originally destined to create a new human being, or by using a cloned embryo), and then it is destroyed to save another one.
Do we have the right to create in this way categories of sub-humans that can be manipulated at will?
Quite obviously, I think not.
Secondly, although everyone agrees that human cloning must be condemned in general, some people are trying to draw a distinction between 'reproductive cloning' (aimed at reproducing a complete human being), which would be banned, and 'therapeutic cloning' , which could be authorised under supervision, subject to certain limits, and provided it is not carried out for commercial purposes.
But that is an artificial distinction, since it is based on the intention behind the cloning, whereas the act itself is identical in both cases: therapeutic cloning also essentially involves the reproduction of embryos by cloning.
All cloning is by definition reproductive.
The cloning of embryos for research purposes, or even the mere use of surplus embryos for these purposes, would amount to crossing an invisible boundary beyond which the exploitation of human life would become acceptable.
We would be entering a different society, one contrary to our values.
One solution to this dilemma would be to speed up research into the possibility of obtaining stem cells from adult organs, which could be clearly earmarked for therapeutic purposes, as called for in the resolution tabled by our fellow Members, Elisabeth Montfort and Nicole Thomas-Mauro.
That kind of procedure would be acceptable, since it is comparable to organ donation.
Looking ahead, that suggests that perhaps our current questions concern only a transitional stage in the research.
At any rate, we hope so.
Unfortunately, the working party, which has dubbed itself a 'Convention' , responsible for preparing the first draft of a Charter of Fundamental Human Rights is about to take a wrong turning here.
Article 3 of the draft, as it stands, confines itself to prohibiting 'the reproductive cloning of human beings' , i.e. it perpetuates the false distinction that we reject.
I tabled an amendment on this point, together with a few other Members, but although it was worded in very moderate terms, it has not, to date, been accepted.
Really, from whatever angle we look at this Charter, it is impossible to find any virtue in it whatsoever.
Throughout the ages, mankind has had to consider how to guide scientific developments so as to bring them in line with ethical and social choices.
This issue is all the more sensitive when it concerns human beings and genetic foundations.
We must, therefore, be extremely cautious, without going so far as to be obscurantist.
Given the present state of our knowledge and of the ethical debate, and in view of the UK Government' s unacceptable authorisation of human cloning, the first thing we must seek is a total and absolute moratorium on all experiments in human cloning.
The second, after hearing the opinion of the European Committee on Ethics, is to define clear guidelines that guarantee human dignity.
As they stand at present, I do not like any of the resolutions submitted by the groups.
The Socialist Group is not calling strongly enough for an immediate stop to all human cloning.
The PPE Group seems to be making a final judgment on such sensitive points of discussion as the distinction between reproductive and other cloning.
In my opinion, however, I think it would be useful to obtain an analysis from the European Committee on Ethics on these points, in order to clarify the issues.
The urgent nature of the subject should have demanded an effective approach:
an immediate and absolute moratorium;
in-depth reflection and a very wide-ranging basic debate prior to a directive laying down the rules to be adopted.
That is not the case with the resolutions put to the vote today.
I will therefore abstain on these motions for resolution.
There are some issues on which political differences should be set aside, not to make it appear as though a consensus could be reached but because they face everyone right across the board.
And if there were to be only one such issue, without doubt it would be the defence and promotion of human life and dignity.
Over the past few decades, scientific research has made enormous strides and given hope to those suffering from illness or disabilities and to their families.
Yet at the same time, some of this research and some of the scientists involved in it seem to have lost sight of what I would call a just and sound scale of values.
It is therefore up to those responsible for the common good, especially in the moral and political field, to put right certain abuses.
This applies to the British and American decisions to permit, respectively, cloning and the use of what are called unplanned 'supernumerary' embryos, in both cases for therapeutic purposes.
This raises a great many, closely related, problems.
There are not two kinds of cloning, reproductive and therapeutic. We must continue to prohibit the creation of human embryos endowed with the same genetic make-up as another human being, for whatever purpose.
Indeed, no human law that is not criminal can ever deny the fact that the embryo represents the beginning of life.
So it is unjustifiable to destroy an embryo under any circumstances, even to cure someone who is ill, for how could anyone decently justify destroying one human being in order to cure another?
Similarly, and more generally, life is an indivisible whole, it is present from the moment of conception and as such, is no longer subject to any human wishes.
Does the recognition of life depend on whether it is planned?
Certainly, as responsible individuals, the potential parents have to give some thought, before conception, to having a child; but once conceived, that child exists and any manipulation of it, let alone planning its destruction for whatever reason, is an infringement of its fundamental rights and, in the worst case, a crime.
It was a good thing that our Parliament took a clear stance on these abuses and thus, even if against the wishes of some of its Members, opted for life.
- (DE) I abstained in the vote on the PPE/Greens/EFA motion for a resolution on human cloning.
I think it is right to take a stand against the decision taken by the British Parliament. It has been stressed that the European Parliament is standing by its decision to ban cloning, and consequently also to withhold all funding for clone research.
However, I regard paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular as very dangerous, because the medical claims being made for biotechnology are taken at face value here, although the results so far have at best been contradictory.
By calling for further research into gene therapy and other forms of genetic engineering, the European Parliament is treading on very thin ice, particularly as there is not a word about the risks or about unsuccessful experiments, nor are they subjected to any kind of political assessment, all of which would cast some doubt on the unreservedly positive claims being made.
This expression of the European Parliament' s views on the cloning of embryos may represent a success in the short term.
However, I fear that totally uncritical calls for more medical genetic engineering could in the long term completely undermine this success and even reverse the situation completely.
They could open the door wider for technology whose implications are completely unknown.
The recent decision by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to allow the cloning of human embryos, in order to create 'spare part stores' for bones and vital organs, raises huge questions and problems.
This decision was taken before giving due consideration to numerous crucial medical, moral and social issues.
No one disputes the fact that rapid developments in genetic and molecular biology have opened up new paths for science, reduced the gulf between the impossible and the feasible and given us hope that we can combat the diseases and illnesses which are the scourge of mankind.
At the same time, however, and precisely because biomedical science has incalculable potential and a tremendous ability to penetrate every aspect of human life and development, turning dreams to nightmares, both the scientific community and society as a whole at all levels need to address the urgent and vital question of who should have control of this new, highly powerful scientific 'weapon' and why?
Where capitalism in its most unadulterated and depressing form and the unbridled market economy rule, there is a fine, indiscernible line between the scientific motives and speculative madness of the multinational pharmaceutical monopolies.
It is criminal for issues which impinge on human existence itself, on life and death, to be commercialised beyond the bounds of any social or political control.
The rapid rate of advance in this area, with crucial questions unanswered and matters of capital importance pending, is fraught with danger, given the huge economic interests hiding behind this endeavour.
The 'therapeutic cloning' plan will be the spark that kindles the fire since no one can guarantee that limited and specific use will be made of cloning.
The cloning of embryos could become the 'Trojan horse' which rekindles attempts to clone or 'counterfeit' human beings, with unpredictable and possibly dramatic consequences for the human race, and it must be averted.
The biggest risk is not inherent in the power of science but in the erroneous and uncontrolled exploitation and application of science.
And when these activities are conducted in the context of the profit motive and its obscure interests, then we must be especially attentive and constantly vigilant.
Lucas report (A5-0187/2000)
Mr President, this is the second time today that we have talked about a report which will help us all to sleep, particularly the elderly.
How could we not support this report which aims to reduce the noise of aeroplanes which come and go from airports surrounded by the homes of many people, who are certainly disturbed at night but also during the day?
However, allow me to put forward a proposal pertaining to this: that, in future, we try to build lots of small airports in isolated, uninhabited areas instead of a few enormous ones in state capitals.
I welcome the communication from the Commission, which underlines the fact that air transport is rapidly having an increasing impact on the environment at local, regional and global level.
Clearly we cannot allow this trend to continue and must rapidly adopt measures to reverse it.
What is at stake, indeed, is the protection of the environment, the quality of life and the health of Europeans.
We could make serious progress if we implemented the Commission' s proposal to apply the principle of 'reward the best and punish the worst' to air transport in Europe, drawing a clearer line of demarcation between the various activities on the basis of their quality in environmental terms.
Although the Commission' s communication describes a number of possible instruments, such as economic incentives and more stringent standards, it does not set out any measurable objectives or timetables.
Nor are there enough practical measures to encourage aviation to pay more respect to the environment.
So it is essential to set objectives and to respect timetables, so that the aviation industry, the airlines and the users can adapt to the legislative measures in good time.
That is the exercise on which the European Parliament has embarked.
Its report tackles several of the problems caused by air transport.
In particular, it looks at the problem of noise, which is an increasing source of concern to the people of Europe.
According to a study conducted under the EU' s fifth environmental action programme, 80 million people in Europe are exposed to noise levels that scientists regard as intolerable, while another 170 million are exposed to disturbing noise levels.
Recent studies also show that there is a link between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance, health and learning ability.
People who live close to airports are particularly affected by the noise of night flights.
The ICAO has initiated a process of revising noise levels.
The European Union must support that process and, if necessary, the Commission will have to take additional measures if the ICAO does not reach a satisfactory agreement.
There are two ways to reduce aircraft noise: at source, thanks to more stringent certification standards and plans for phasing out aircraft that do not comply with them, and by land-use planning measures near airports.
Then there is the problem of gas emissions.
It has been admitted that emissions from aviation account for about 3.5% of the global warming produced by human activity.
According to forecasts, these emissions will rise by 3% a year over the period 1992 to 2015.
So it is both urgent and vital to take measures to reduce aircraft emissions.
The list of pollutants from air transport is a long one.
This alarming fact should encourage us to take measures very quickly.
That means the Member States must give the Commission a clear negotiating mandate so that at the time of the 33rd session of the ICAO Assembly in 2001, it can vigorously pursue the environmental and transport policy objectives.
At a time when France has entered a conflict with the main users of diesel oil (truckers, farmers, ambulance drivers), which risks spreading around Europe with the escalation in fuel prices, at a time when negotiations have begun in Lyon on implementing the Kyoto Protocol, with all its provisions that need to be adopted in The Hague to combat emissions of greenhouse gases, we can see how far we still have to go at all levels to shift away from modes of transport that pollute and damage the environment towards environmentally sustainable ones that make a real contribution to the fight against greenhouse gas emissions.
In that sense, Mrs Lucas' report sets out the positive measures that will help reduce pollution in air transport including, in particular, the phasing out of the loudest aircraft.
At the same time, it raises practical and political problems, namely the obstacles of air transport policies and their adverse environmental impact.
Europe' s measures to reduce greenhouse gases are being blocked by the fact that it has excluded air transport, a major CO2 producer, from the Kyoto Protocol and the plans to reduce pollutants.
A tax on kerosene, environmental charges, zero VAT rating of air tickets: these are all points that need to be considered in order to establish fair competition between the different modes of transport.
My group has just voted in favour of the Lucas report, because of the following considerations. A massive warming of the earth's atmosphere in coming years because of emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases was recently forecast, once again by the World Wide Fund For Nature.
This calls for an immediate response in the form of a rational policy and an economic system that is not solely geared towards short-term profit.
With an estimated share of 15%, air transport is, of course, not the only cause of air pollution and by no means the most important. However, bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone, it is positively essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic.
These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way.
We support setting rigid limit values for emissions and noise pollution and the EU initiative being called for at the forthcoming 33rd ICAO Assembly.
And should the outcome of the ICAO Assembly be unsatisfactory, we are therefore also calling for the EU to set its own limits.
Measures of this kind can and must encourage the air transport industry to develop new technological solutions, and more efficient, cleaner and quieter jet turbines.
The twentieth century has witnessed some tremendous technological progress, especially in the field of transport and other long-distance communication.
This has created two holy cows: the car and the aircraft.
Those who seek material gain from cars or aircraft are prepared to subordinate everything to their freedom to use these modes of transport, and overlook the adverse effects on their fellow human beings and the environment.
Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector.
They are largely exempt from taxes and environmental rules.
This is why they can offer their services comparatively cheaply, even if the airfares are high on journeys governed by a near-monopoly.
For this reason alone, aviation can win the unfair competitive battle against the railways, which have lost a large part of their share of international passenger transport to other modes of long-distance travel, especially aviation.
As a result, cross-border railways are having to rely increasingly on privatisation plans and major investments in the high-speed network.
These measures, however, have a number of detrimental effects on the public and the environment, effects which would not have emerged without the competition from aviation.
It is high time that aviation met normal environmental requirements of the kind that are in place for all other sectors, in order to protect the public and the environment against noise, emission of harmful substances and risks of accidents.
Should this render aviation companies less profitable or hinder the enormous growth in air transport, this would not be a disaster, but rather a necessity.
Mrs Lucas has made a few modest steps in the right direction and these are largely in line with what my party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, endorses.
- (SV) We abstained from voting in the final vote on Mrs Lucas' report.
We share most of the points of view presented in this about the need for a more vigorous policy to combat the negative effects of aircraft upon the environment. We cannot, however, support paragraphs 20 and 23 of the text.
These propose a direct right of taxation for the EU in this area, together with the standardisation of national legislation on country planning.
We are firm opponents of these proposals.
Immediate, radical measures are urgently needed in order to protect the environment from the adverse impact of the ever increasing use of air transport.
However, the Commission proposal approaches the problem from the angle of competition and the profits of the aviation industry and the airlines.
As a result, it fails to deal with immediate priorities and, more importantly, only addresses in vague and general terms the problem of permissible limits on emissions of greenhouse gases and the definition of new, or at least improved, standards and rules which need to be applied at local and regional level and promoted at international level.
Similarly, it only contains vague, unsatisfactory proposals on reducing permissible noise levels, especially in the vicinity of airports during the day and, more importantly, at night.
A whole series of basic issues, such as land use around airports, improving air traffic etc. has been ignored, issues which are important factors in dealing with the environmental impact of air transport.
The Commission proposal is mainly money-driven.
Instead of forcing aerospace companies to develop research and apply newer, more environmentally-friendly technologies, it backs measures to boost revenue by introducing new taxes on aircraft purchases or changing the VAT arrangements for airline companies or the tax on kerosene, all of which can easily be passed on to the final consumer.
Attempts to reduce the number and times of flights by increasing the price of tickets, in conjunction with constant efforts to erode labour costs and safety specifications, are merely ways of maintaining, if not increasing the profits of the aviation industry, not measures to reduce the adverse environmental impact of air transport.
Typically, no mention is made of liberalising the air transport market, which is exacerbating not only the environmental impact, due to restricted controls on old, inadequately maintained aeroplanes, but the very safety of flights and passengers.
Zabell report (A5-0203/2000)
Mr President, this report refers to the fight against doping in sport.
Unfortunately, the international sporting authorities have not been able to halt or even combat this extremely serious scourge.
Doping in sport is like a priest who sins or a tone-deaf musician.
It is unthinkable that in sport, which stands for honesty and competitiveness, there are athletes who win because they use drugs.
I therefore voted against this report because it does not go far enough in calling for a genuine change in the fight against doping.
We should set up a European anti-doping agency instead of waiting for a world-wide agency to do what an individual state cannot achieve.
How can so many countries be persuaded to agree?
Mr President, with regard to the Zabell report, I would like to make it clear that I only voted for the amendments which require a legal basis, while I voted against the report as a whole.
Indeed, current events show that the policy adopted by the World Anti-Doping Agency is a failure, and Europe should not have associated itself with it since it is a policy made by others and for which we should not have to bear any responsibility.
It is a shame that Europe has not understood this, and that today and over the coming years it will find itself involved in a very tough fight, where it will have to use much more incisive, firm and hard-hitting means.
I have tried, drawing on my wealth of experience, to make the Members of the European Parliament understand this.
I am sorry that many of them have not fully grasped what I have been trying to make them understand throughout this part-session.
. (NL) Playing sports is good for us.
After all, playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being.
But unfortunately, the enjoyment we derive from sport has come under pressure over the past decades and has been marred by a persistent and one-sided focus on performance and ever greater commercial interests.
The use of doping in sport must be seen against this background.
In my opinion, the phenomenon of doping cannot be considered in isolation but forms part of the commercialisation of a leisure activity.
As a result, the discrepancy between amateur and professional sport has become far too pronounced.
Sport is high on the agenda in the Commission' s Helsinki report.
In the resolution too, sport is commended as fulfilling a social and integrating role which brings people closer together.
It is regrettable that many major sports events show signs of the opposite.
Not for nothing did the Dutch chef de mission, Andre Bolhuis, nickname the Olympic Games in Atlanta the Olympic War, probably because these games involved thousands of police and because of the hostile atmosphere which the American public and their media created with regard to overseas sportspeople.
If we are to counter these expressions of hostility, which we also encounter during international sports events in our countries, sportsmanship needs to be placed at the top of the bill once again.
The focus on performance and commercial interests should disappear very much into the background.
This would at the same time create a much better climate for fighting the use of doping in the most effective way possible.
In the area of sport, the Treaty does not accord any direct powers to EU institutions.
Accordingly, the involvement of the Community in fighting the use of doping should be low-key.
The sports sector is organised in its own unique way and national federations and unions still play a key role in this.
Consequently, I do not agree with the request to include a reference to sport in Article 151 of the EU Treaty.
After all, pressing for a Community-wide sports policy runs counter to the subsidiarity principle.
Although the resolution we voted on a moment ago does contain positive elements, I cannot support it mainly for the aforementioned institutional reason.
I am very glad we were able to hold a discussion in this Chamber on the serious public health problem of doping in sport.
I must congratulate the European Commission on the action plan it has proposed, together with the rapporteur and Mrs Buffet, President-in-Office of the Council.
Under the terms of the Olympic Charter, sport must embody "a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play" .
Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal.
Yet doping products are widely used by professional sportsmen and women, but also by amateurs.
This scourge, whose true scale is difficult to measure, is a complex phenomenon that poses a serious risk to the physical and psychological health of the sportsmen and women.
It is also a form of cheating that is contrary to the sporting ethic.
Because of that, we must take stronger European Union action to combat this phenomenon.
I therefore support the inclusion of a legal basis in the Treaty that would allow for Community action in the field of sport.
I know that this issue is giving rise to much discussion, which will in fact help fuel the debate to be held in the European Sports Forum in Lille on 26 and 27 October.
I will, of course, take part in it and give my views.
Apart from that, I endorse the call for the Commission to step up research into the causes of doping in the various sports disciplines, even though we know that one of the main reasons for the spread of doping lies in the commercial profits that are now linked to sport.
Under the Fifth Framework Research Programme, the European Union will have to conduct more research on doping substances, on methods of detection and on the health impact of using doping products.
I think it is also vital to launch information campaigns on the risks associated with doping products.
These campaigns should be aimed primarily at young people and be conducted with the help of athletes with an established reputation.
Since doping must be combated at international level, the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is without doubt a vital step forward.
This agency, set up in 1999, is currently operating under transitional procedures that leave something to be desired in terms of transparency and independence.
I am glad to say that the French Presidency has undertaken to improve the way it operates.
Let us restore the true value of sport.
Above all, sport must be regarded as an educational and social activity that encourages team spirit, solidarity and loyalty and helps combat racism and xenophobia.
We are voting against recitals I, J and K and are abstaining from voting on paragraph 2.
In different ways, these three recitals and this paragraph are urging the Commission to integrate sports policy into the texts of the Treaties.
Sports policy is a policy area characterised by its cultural context and framework and ought not therefore to be covered by the texts of the Treaties.
Sports policy is an area in which the Commission clearly ought not to have powers.
In our opinion, such powers are covered by the subsidiarity principle and ought to be exercised at national or lower levels of political decision-making.
We are abstaining from voting in the final vote.
Mr President, I voted for the Mennea report on sport because it contains a large number of positive elements and, in particular, because it highlights the importance of continuing the current practice of organising sporting events for disabled people.
I hope that this report will lead to the introduction of subsidised sporting events for the elderly.
If competitors were grouped according to age, in the same way that boxers are grouped according to weight, we could organise sporting events for people over 30, 40, 50 or 60 years of age.
Mr Mennea would certainly win another Olympic medal if we held events on the basis of age.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who voted for my report.
In my opinion, Europe has today taken a step forward in its approach to the world of sport.
Our task is still far from complete, for sport is continually changing and Europe cannot afford not to follow these changes.
I hope that the work which we have begun today, here in the European Parliament, will soon be completed.
I would like to make it clear that some of the points I had proposed were not approved, such as the status of sportspersons and the sporting contract etc. I hope that Europe will soon become more mature from this point of view and take into consideration those points which were not included.
Mr President, I voted against Mr Mennea' s report, which is no reflection upon Mr Mennea.
I remember his time as a great sprinter, and I was delighted that someone from a European country was able to end American dominance of the sport.
I voted against Mr Mennea' s report because I am quite adamant that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, sport is not a matter for the European Parliament.
By turning sports issues into political issues, we do a disservice both to sport and to the idea of drawing the peoples of Europe closer together.
I believe it is downright harmful, as well as wrong, to try to create a legal basis in this area.
On the basis of the subsidiarity principle and given the sort of society I want to work for, I believe in sport' s own ability to deal with these issues in national and international associations.
Let us unite behind this idea.
I also believe that the Bosman judgment has done very great harm to football and that the sporting community has every reason in the future to ask the European Parliament and the European Union to keep away from this area.
Let these issues be handled at national level and by the sporting community itself.
At a summit in Davos, Zbigniev Brzezinski, President Carter' s adviser, spoke about the need to use sport, show business and entertainment as a pressure valve for the millions of marginalised people that unrestrained free trade produces every year in a general free market economy.
A word was even coined for this new version of 'bread and circus' .
It is 'tittytainment' , formed from the American slang for breasts and the word entertainment.
The lesson was learned and the idea of sport as an entertainment, as an industry and as the opium of the impoverished masses of the world, took off.
There is an endless succession of world cups, European cup finals, Grand Prix competitions, the Olympics of Helsinki and Sydney, football, tennis, races, car rallies and horse races.
All this is done in the name of the social function of sport, which produces healthy minds in healthy bodies, to the point that the Treaty of Amsterdam now includes a declaration on sport emphasising "its role in forging identity and bringing people together" .
Indeed, we all know that, thanks to sport and to the Olympic Games, the Peloponnesian War never happened, that Athens and Sparta truly loved one another and that the circus brought the gladiators together. From the evidence of the Heysel stadium, with its death toll, to the British hooligans at the UEFA Cup in Copenhagen and elsewhere, not forgetting the case of Nivel, the French policeman murdered by German supporters, let alone the Turkish 'tourists' , the French PSG and others, it is quite obvious that sport makes people more sociable, tolerant and cooperative and fosters all those other qualities which have been promoted so well by the French suburbs and inner cities, since the World Cup, through the festive bonfires created by setting fire to cars.
Nor did high-level sport produce dozens of cases of rape and sexual attacks in the Olympic village in Atlanta; and French tennis champion, Nathalie Tauziat, who wrote a book criticising the very emotionally charged atmosphere behind the scenes of the tennis courts, was obviously eliminated from the French team selection in Sydney in the name of the team spirit and significant social values fostered by sport, according to Mr Mennea, the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Once this balm and these nice sentiments have been applied to the galling wounds of real life, our rapporteur becomes well aware that sport is not a cultural phenomenon but a political and strategic instrument used to enslave the citizen, who is made to forget the loss of his civic powers through a form of televisual training developing age-old instincts.
Share-capital companies, sports-club factories, from Manchester United to AC Milan, not to mention the US basketball and golf circuits, doping, the industry of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, which have left Pankov' s Germany and the Soviet Union to spread throughout the world, Adidas, Nike and other sponsors who want to see results, transfers to the tune of dollars beyond our wildest dreams, the EU Court of Justice' s judgments, including the famous 1995 Bosman judgment that everyone criticised but that ensures the free movement of young sportsmen and women and sports merchandise, the huge commercialisation, the alleged re-broadcasting rights and the collusion between sport and business - that is the real face of the industrialised world of sport that comes under our Community legislation.
It is from that manipulated world that we must protect real sport, the amateur sport practised in thousands of clubs, which have limited resources and survive thanks only to the devotion, ability and generosity of a huge number of voluntary workers.
That is where we must put our public funding, instead of investing it for the benefit of the tin gods of world stadiums.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.36 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr President, I wanted to express my concern as some facts are liable to be misinterpreted.
With regard to the urgent debates, we argued in favour of the inclusion of the TemelÃ­n nuclear reactor because this is a topic which is very much in the spotlight at the moment. However, I would ask you if we could move on to the debate on Iran as soon as possible.
This remains necessary due to the relentless violation of human rights - the execution of the death penalty by stoning springs to mind, as well as the constant disruption of international television programmes.
We voted in favour of TemelÃ­n but we believe that a debate on Iran is just as imperative.
Mrs Maes, Iran is to be covered in the debate on human rights, as is the TemelÃ­n nuclear power station.
I hope that this will meet your concerns.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Nuclear submarine accidents
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5Â­0704/2000 by Mr Sakellariou and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on nuclear submarines;
B5Â­0707/2000 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Europe of Democracies and Diversities Group, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine and the danger of nuclear pollution in the former Soviet Union;
B5Â­0709/2000 by Mrs Thors and Mr VÃ€yrynen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine and the danger of nuclear pollution in the former Soviet Union;
B5Â­0717/2000 by Mr Posselt and Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the sinking of the Kursk submarine;
B5Â­0725/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the danger of nuclear submarines;
B5Â­0736/2000 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on accidents involving nuclear submarines;
B5Â­0738/2000 by Mr SjÃ¶stedt and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the sinking of nuclear submarines.
Mr President, together with those who submitted the joint resolution, I, too, would like to express my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the Kursk nuclear submarine crew who died.
May they find comfort and strength in God, who can only truly gauge their sorrow and will gladly relieve their suffering.
The dreadful humanitarian disaster involving the Kursk once again brought home to the Russian population and to us how dangerous the consequences of accidents involving nuclear-powered installations and craft can be, and how important it is to comply with nuclear safety regulations.
This awareness-raising process has been set in motion, not least thanks to - and I would like to stress this here - those directly involved: Russian citizens and social organisations with a sense of responsibility.
Their names are no secret.
Not only do they deserve our respect, but also all the European support we can provide.
How irresponsible, on the other hand, is the way the Russian authorities, fronted by the country' s military apparatus, deal with atomic energy?
And that for as long as we can remember.
The nuclear contamination of the village Muslyumovo, in the southern Ural, with plutonium - and this is as long ago as 1949 - is a poignant example of this utterly reprehensible behaviour.
According to a lady in the village, in the old days, mothers would contract leukaemia at the age of fifty.
The same fate would befall their daughters at the tender age of twenty; nowadays, their grandchildren suffer from this deadly disease as young as two.
The joint resolution is absolutely right in highlighting the considerable nuclear risks which the dozens of scrapped nuclear submarines of the Russian northern fleet constitute.
For the city of Murmansk and direct surroundings, I would like to add one major danger to this huge, potential risk to both the public and the environment, namely the cargo ship Lepse.
Since the early sixties, this ship has served as a warehouse for atomic waste originating from nuclear-powered ice breakers.
Due to the Lepse' s bad condition, its nuclear cargo should be transferred to and made safe in special containers ashore.
At least, that has been the plan for years.
Why has nothing been done about it? The answer is simple.
It is down to the irresponsible attitude of the authorities, which refuse to meet the financier of the project, i.e. the European Union, halfway on two essential points: signing the agreement whereby Russia shoulders the responsibility for the activities, and the tax-free import of the required equipment for the operation.
This is a striking example of Russia' s official stance in urgent matters of nuclear safety.
The nuclear scandal in Moscow, which dates back to 1995, is also salient in this respect.
At the time, the director of the scientific institute which developed nuclear, Chernobyl-like reactors, came up with an 'enlightened' plan to increase the budget of his institute by providing heating for the houses in the vicinity by means of the institute' s research reactor.
The neighbourhood was tipped off in time and the whole plan was called off.
In fact, the reactor was closed down.
And how did the director Jevgeni Adamov fare?
He made it to Russia' s Minister for Atomic Energy and is dreaming of another, far more profitable project, a real money-spinner: Russia as collection and processing point for foreign radioactive waste.
May this serve as a warning to Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is deeply touched by the recent disaster involving the Kursk submarine and shares in the grief of those left behind and the Russian people.
In addition, we are greatly concerned about the nuclear time bomb and ecological disaster waiting to happen in the Barents Sea, involving the Kursk, but also other ship wrecks which are still located there.
It is therefore of utmost importance for Russia to join forces with international organisations for nuclear safety, and I would ask the Commissioner to press Russia to take responsibility and inspect the still active nuclear submarines, adapting them to better safety requirements if necessary.
There are plenty of international experts who could help Russia take stock of the problems and dismantle the nuclear waste present in the submarines in the Barents Sea.
Needless to say, Russia must exercise complete openness and cooperate fully.
Russia is also financially responsible.
Could the Commission or Commissioner explain to me in what way the European Union can help Russia in the dismantling of shipwrecks and how it can stave off the nuclear radiation risk for our EU citizens?
Mr President, our prayers and sympathy go to the 118 sailors and their families.
They deserve our solidarity.
But it must also be considered that we have a major concern in connection with the Kursk disaster, namely the situation in Russia.
We need to be quite clear that President Putin and the Russian authorities covered up a lot of the circumstances surrounding this accident.
Facts were suppressed, falsified or hushed up.
But in one interview he spoke the truth when he said that the Kursk accident was symptomatic of Russia's condition as a whole. This is a situation that we finally have to face up to.
We have to see the reality for what it is.
This is not just about nuclear safety and the nuclear submarine fleet, it is also about a mass of highly developed arms technologies for which there are no appropriate control and safety measures.
That is why it is of the utmost importance that we should do everything to ensure transparency finally reaches Russia.
It is only because of Mr Nikitin, and the independent media, which face increased repression, that we heard about the disaster at all, four days after the event.Thanks to international support, it was at least possible to avoid the very worst and I hope that it will also be possible to find a solution.
But that is not a satisfactory state of affairs.
That is why they need not only our help, but also frank talking.
What is called for is some plain speaking and an offer of cooperation that does not just mean reaching for our cheque book, but also includes developing the rule of law, democratic processes and independent media in Russia.
The most important point is to educate and support all democratic forces, all the independent media, the administration, the judiciary, and young politicians, especially those in local government, so that Russia becomes a partner with whom we can safely live together in Eurasia.
I do not want to go into other issues such as Chechnya and a host of others at this point.
Kursk by itself is symptomatic of how disasters in Russia can have a direct environmental and political impact on our part of Europe.
That is why it is very much in our interest to make sure that Russia gradually becomes a democratic state where the rule of law prevails.
What we are witnessing at present under President Putin is instead a retrograde trend which is a matter of great concern to us.
So we have an enormous responsibility here.
Mr President, as other Members have already said, the Kursk accident demonstrates that even ten years after the end of the Cold War, military objectives are still considered more important than human life.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy for the families who have been bereaved of their fathers and sons.
We know that it is not impossible that more people will yet be affected by this accident.
Everyone is aware of the dangers posed by two nuclear reactors lying on the sea bed. However, no one knows how great the danger and the insidious impact on people's health will be.
I therefore believe that we can only draw one conclusion from this accident: we have to finally admit that despite the end of the Cold War we - in both the East and the West - are still arming and rearming ourselves, and this is incredibly dangerous and will lead to people being killed. So we must finally put an end to this.
There can only be one response to this accident, and that response is 'disarmament now' .
This disarmament will only work if it is applied equally by the East and the West.
That also means that it has to be pursued jointly, in cooperation. It must not mean that people like Alexander Nikitin, who take part in this and thus help to fight the continuing dangers to humanity of the Cold War and of armament, are eliminated.
I call on the Commission to make it crystal clear to the Russian Government that we will not accept further legal judgments against Nikitin or tolerate his being put on trial again.
Mr President, our Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left entirely shares all the considerations and proposals regarding nuclear submarine accidents, which are a sad legacy from the Cold War.
In order to show that it is not all one-sided, I am bound to refer to the situation of the British submarine which broke down on 12 May in Sicily and has been in Gibraltar, the only British colony in the Mediterranean, since 19 May.
The situation is causing a great deal of alarm among the population, because, according to the Royal Navy' s own regulations, within a radius of 10 kilometres there is danger, within 100 kilometres there is still potential danger, and the submarine may only be repaired in category 'X' docks.
The docks in Gibraltar are type 'Z' .
I find the neo-colonial behaviour on the part of the United Kingdom, which solved the problem by replacing a 'Z' with an 'X' on a piece of paper using correction fluid or an eraser, very strange.
I think that it is important that the Commission and the Council demand that this submarine goes back to the United Kingdom and that they ensure that safety standards are complied with.
Mr President, the sinking of the Kursk has - mainly as a result of Russia' s inadequate response - brought home to us the disastrous heritage of 70 years of Soviet power.
The golden era of Communist nomenclature has generated a climate of such contempt towards people in the old Soviet Union, with so few standing a chance of survival in the present day, that this is why we are now facing this terrible disaster.
This is at the heart of our resolution.
In my opinion, the fact that the GUE Group is now tabling amendments which attempt to divert the attention away from this disaster by introducing a regional problem of a completely different nature displays very little taste indeed.
It is, in fact, downright impudent.
The European Union and European Parliament will need to put their foot down when it comes to the Kursk salvage operation.
We will need to be involved in these operations, partly on humanitarian grounds.
The recovery of the Kursk also highlights another problem, namely that of a large number of obsolete nuclear submarines in Russia, as well as the nuclear waste in the same northern region.
The European Union and European Parliament will need to make it clear that it is in Europe' s general interest, and as such in that of Russia, to lay this matter to rest sooner rather than later, firstly on behalf of the relatives, whom we offer our deepest sympathy, and secondly for the benefit of the nuclear situation in Europe.
This is what our resolution is about.
Mr President, we are talking about the tragedy involving the Russian submarine Kursk and we do of course share all the considerations of this joint resolution on the subject.
However, we must add immediately that, in order to gain credibility, the European Parliament and the European Union in general cannot ignore the fact that within its own territory there is a situation of serious nuclear risk as the result of a submarine accident, even though it is not, of course, of the tragic nature of the case of the Kursk.
I am referring to the case mentioned previously by my colleague Mr Marset, the British submarine Tireless, which has been anchored in the port of Gibraltar since May, where the intention is to repair it.
It is a port which, has been pointed out, does not have the technical conditions or the location for repairing this type of vessel.
The port is only equipped for repairing merchant ships, not warships and much less nuclear submarines.
The problem cannot be solved by simply reclassifying it, because that reclassification could affect the technical conditions.
But the problem is that the safety standards include emergency plans and special action for the population within a radius of ten kilometres, which in this case means around 200 000 people. That is something that cannot be improvised overnight, among other things because the population cannot be moved.
We must criticise the deplorable attitude of the British Government, but even more so the attitude of the Spanish Government, which maintained a deplorable and shameful silence on this issue until they were forced into a timid reaction by the protests from the inhabitants of the area.
I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that I am not in the habit of raising issues of domestic policy in this Parliament.
But this is not a matter of domestic policy, but one of European security, it is a matter of European decency and I am raising it here in order to provoke a reaction from this Parliament and from the authorities of the Union in general in order to remedy this intolerable situation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and along with my colleague Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, we join others in offering our condolences to the victims of the Russian nuclear submarine, and in asking for greater cooperation between the European Union and the Russian authorities in order to prevent a further disaster.
Obviously, we believe that the European Union has sufficient arguments to ensure such cooperation.
We would also like to express our concern - as other speakers have done - because, unfortunately, the matter that we were to discuss, that of the very serious, terrible and fatal accident of the submarine Kursk has led us to deal with the problem of a nuclear submarine in Mediterranean waters, in European Union territory, in a British colony.
This is causing very serious and justified alarm, due to a serious breakdown in the nuclear reactor, and because, among other things, European Union directives are not being complied with.
We think that there is a need to take urgent action.
The European Union must intervene, and this nuclear submarine needs to be urgently transported to a British base to be repaired under the proper conditions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, a British nuclear submarine has been moored at its Gibraltar base since 19 May.
The smallest breakdown in the cooling system of a nuclear reactor can never be considered as insignificant, as it contains heavy water with radioactive isotopes.
Moreover, the United Kingdom has knowingly failed to comply with Community regulations in terms of radiation protection, exposing its citizens in Gibraltar and those in Algeciras Bay to a very high probability of contamination, as it is now, and not last May, that it is recognising the extent of the breakdown.
In this case, there has been a violation of Community law.
We complained that Russia took four days to inform the European Community about its accident. We took two months.
I suppose that the booing that we received from some British Members when we criticised the situation in this House was also directed at the citizens of Gibraltar.
In this House we criticised the lack of information for the population in the area and of reliable and official news from the United Kingdom.
In the same way, we criticise something which is a reality: the United Kingdom, faced with considerable social pressures in the country, has decided to transfer its base for nuclear submarine operations and repairs to Algeciras Bay, without respecting its own standards, which do not allow it to have this type of base in highly populated areas.
Equally, we deplore the contemplative attitude of the Spanish Government, which only reacted when the pressure and concern reached a maximum.
For the above reasons, those of us from Andalusia ask this Parliament, and its President, far beyond the bilateral diplomatic interests of the Member States, to carry out the appropriate consultations and negotiations to make it possible to immediately transfer this submarine to bases that have sufficient security conditions to repair it and thus to put an end to the public alarm that has been created.
The Commission shares the deep regrets expressed in the resolutions on the accident involving the Russian submarine the Kursk in the Arctic Bering Sea on 12 August and the loss of the lives of 118 seamen.
We were particularly concerned about the policy of the Russian authorities in the first days after the accident on foreign assistance and information provided to the Russian population and the wider public.
Russia is ultimately responsible for devising and implementing a plan to manage its nuclear waste and spent fuel, and the resolutions, therefore, quite rightly call upon Russia to use all available resources, including its own specialists.
The Commission considers that the international community should offer the necessary assistance to Russia.
It has already launched a number of assistance projects under various Community programmes.
Improved radioactive waste management in north-west Russia is one of the explicit priorities included in the new TACIS regulation covering the next seven years.
The Commission welcomes any action that would increase the budget funding to be used to reduce the ideological threat in north-west Russia and in particular to enable laid-up nuclear submarines to be dismantled more quickly than 10 of the North Fleet's 100 disused nuclear submarines moored at various based in north-west Russia have been dismantled so far.
Besides the submarines, spent fuel from a number of nuclear-powered icebreakers also adds to the ecological risk.
The lack of storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel remains one of the major bottlenecks in dismantling operations as a whole.
Community-backed activities are studies to design and cost a storage facility in north-west Russia or in the southern Urals.
In the light of these studies, the international community, perhaps including the European Community, might later finance the construction of such a storage facility.
To speed up dismantling, the Community is supporting the design, construction, and licensing of a transport and storage tank for damaged spent fuel produced in the operation of nuclear submarines and icebreakers and currently stored under primitive conditions.
The Commission is also involved in a number of studies aiming to improve radioactive-waste management in north-west Russia.
Before concluding, I would like to stress the importance of international coordination in this immense task.
To give two examples, the Commission is serving in the IAEA-sponsored contact expert group.
The group's work might eventually make it possible to draw up a comprehensive strategy and key investment projects that should be supported by the international community and, together with a number of donor countries, the Commission is currently negotiating an agreement with the Russians.
This agreement, known as the 'Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme', is intended to overcome obstacles to international aid stemming, for instance, from tax exemptions and nuclear liability.
The Commission hopes that the Kursk accident will bring about real progress in these negotiations and, in particular, strengthen the resolve of the Russian authorities to conclude the agreement.
Mr President, I would like to know whether the Commissioner has anything to say on the issue, which also relates to nuclear submarines, of the Tireless in Gibraltar.
It has been raised by five Members in this House and he has not said anything about it.
I am concerned: is it that he is deaf?
Is it that he does not know what to do?
Mr President, we are talking about nuclear safety, and I repeat what was said by my colleague, Mr Marset Campos: we hope that the Commissioner will say something about our problem, a problem in the European Union that is affecting citizens from two Member States.
.
I took the liberty, on behalf of the Commission, of responding to the issue that we have on the agenda.
I find that quite natural.
Discussion of other subjects would have to be covered by other means and under a different agenda item.
I will be suggesting to my colleagues that we answer your questions in writing.
Mr President, the subject for today is 'Nuclear submarine accidents' .
The Conference of Presidents decided to also include the subject of the submarine in Gibraltar in the agenda.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 5.30 p.m.
Burundi
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5Â­0660/2000 by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Burundi;
B5Â­0711/2000 by Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the agreement on peace in Burundi signed in Arusha, Tanzania;
B5Â­0718/2000 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the situation in Burundi;
B5Â­0726/2000 by Mrs Maes and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Burundi;
B5Â­0734/2000 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on Burundi;
B5Â­0739/2000 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the Arusha agreement and the transition to democracy in Burundi.
Mr President, why do so many Africans struggle when it comes to sharing power?
If the principle 'the survival of the fittest' applies, leaving the weakest with nothing, then there is something fundamentally wrong.
If, on top of this, the fittest constitute the minority, then conflicts are bound to ensue.
As long as ethnic groups exclude each other and refuse to cooperate, there is precious little hope.
Only national reconciliation can offer some hope and this is certainly true of Burundi.
Following Mandela' s remarkable efforts, peace seemed to be on its way at last.
Unfortunately, the fighting has not stopped and some parties have refused to sign the peace accord.
Every effort must be made in order to ensure that the new negotiations are a success.
Maximum pressure must be brought to bear on Hutu rebels to take part in the peace process instead of following the destructive instructions issued by the likes of Mr Kaliba and Mr Mugabe.
In order to ensure that all parties are involved, it is of utmost importance for the political leaders to receive personal protection, and it is high time that the violence against innocent citizens, both on the part of the government and of the opposition, came to an end.
If the fight continues, human rights continue to be violated and parties fail to get involved, there can be no talk of fully resuming European aid.
Greater willingness on their part to make peace will lead to greater willingness on our part to help.
The mediators must bring about initiatives to demobilise the parties so that they can ultimately unite in one army.
As soon as the cease-fire is achieved, the Burundi refugees must be able to count on help from the international community to provide them with a safe shelter in Burundi.
On a final note, for lasting peace in Burundi, it is crucial that peace in the Congo region is established.
Only if Africans are willing to share power does this continent have a future.
Mr President, if we start from the principle 'better a deal that is flawed than no deal at all' , then it is true that Arusha constitutes a step forward in the Burundi peace process.
All credit for this has to go to Mandela, who shuttled between the different parties for months in order to get them not only on speaking terms but also around the negotiating table.
But the accord is not perfect.
Indeed, there is still no cease-fire and the fights around the capital of Bujumbura simply continue.
The two main Hutu rebel movements in the army, which are responsible for the best part of the violence, were not involved in the negotiations.
As such, the next phase in Nairobi, the meeting between the armed troops on 20 September, is probably more crucial than Arusha.
It is regrettable that the accord does not look beyond the regional context.
The neighbouring countries Congo and Tanzania, from where the armed groups operate, must also be reminded of their responsibilities.
Indeed, the question arises as to whether Mandela has not analysed the Burundi conflict too much from his own South African context.
It is correct that some Tutsi parties have used the risk of annihilation of the minority as an excuse to maintain their supremacy.
But this does not take away the fact that this risk in Burundi is real.
This is why we need to demand sufficient safety guarantees to protect the minority and make sure that in the event of any elections, there is no incitement of ethnic hatred.
Finally, Mr President, I do believe that Europe should resume the provision of semi-structural aid, especially in the areas of education and health care.
Otherwise, there is a risk that we will be held partly responsible for the death of thousands of innocent citizens; a thought to which I, as a Christian-Democrat, cannot reconcile myself.
Mr President, I fully subscribe to the entreaties of Mr Van den Bos and Mr Van Hecke.
With 200 000 fatalities in Burundi, Commissioner, there is clearly a need for a peace deal or a peace accord.
However, I fear that the peace accord has been brought about because it suited the Heads of State at the time.
Maybe they should have dragged the negotiations out a while longer in order to gather everybody around the table, because I am aware that as long as the key players, both on the Hutu side and Tutsi side, do not meet, there will be no real peace.
I do welcome the fact that some movements, which were at one time some of the most implacable, have now gathered around the table.
This is why I have good reason to believe this peace accord sets the tone for the future.
I now wonder how the European Union can best fulfil the desire for peace expressed by so many people in Burundi.
To start with, I believe we will need to step up the pressure in order to achieve overall peace in the Great Lakes region.
I cannot shake off the impression that various African leaders are still too self-seeking to be able to work steadily towards peace in Congo and the Great Lakes region.
A second point is the contentious resumption of aid.
I have always regretted the notorious boycott of Burundi, particularly as it was so selective.
I now hope that we can make some real headway by means of clearly-defined peace projects and development of democracy, which we can underpin with structural aid.
Mr President, as a militant supporter of the Lutte ouvriÃšre party in a country that played and still plays a shameful role in Burundi and in Rwanda, as it does in the whole region of central Africa, I cannot remain silent in the face of a resolution that strings together phrases supposedly in support of the people of that region while, in fact, concealing the despicable role the major powers played in the massacres carried out by the armed bands of the two conflicting ethnic groups in that region, the Tutsis and the Hutus.
Without even going back to the responsibility of the former Belgian colonial power deliberately sustaining and exacerbating the hostilities between the two ethnic groups in the two countries, today the part that both French and British interests played in the civil war is public knowledge, just as it is public knowledge that the French army was directly responsible for mobilising and arming the Hutu extreme right, which was responsible for real genocide.
And successive French Governments, on the right as well as on the left, were not even willing to do what the Belgian Government did, namely acknowledge their responsibility for this situation, although obviously that in no way lessens the crushing weight of that responsibility.
I therefore want to register my opposition to the hypocrisy of the major powers and express my solidarity with the people of Burundi and Rwanda who, over and above their ethnic rifts, over and above the responsibility of their own leaders, have paid a heavy price for the large imperialist powers' domination of Africa.
Mr President, over one hundred years ago, European colonial powers divided tribal lands in Africa to establish national boundaries.
African countries inherited the legacy of tribal conflict as major tribes sought to dominate national politics.
Some examples are the Afars and Issas in Djibouti, the Kikuyu and Luo in Kenya and the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi.
I believe the EU has to focus on how the ruling elite, the Tutsis in Burundi, can be persuaded to reconcile and cooperate with the majority Hutu to achieve peace.
The EU must insist that neighbouring countries do not interfere in Burundi and EU aid to them should be conditional on their cooperation.
This Parliament and the European Commission can help Burundi and this resolution is a very good step in that direction.
Mr President, I am very happy to be speaking at the request and on behalf of Mrs Sauquillo. We would first of all like to thank Nelson Mandela, who once again truly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize which has been awarded him.
I would like to stress that the Arusha Agreement does not represent the end of the war, for peace has not yet been established, but the agreement does exist and requires an immediate initiative from the European Union.
The initiative must include the following elements: we must send a message to those who have signed the agreement to urge them to persist and keep going along the road they have chosen; we must send a message to those who have not yet signed the agreement to remind them that there is no alternative to peace, that the only alternative to peace is to continue with the suffering caused by colonial inheritance, death and oppression; we must also send a message to the neighbouring countries to request that they refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries and must contribute to and uphold the peace process.
The European Union's initiative must include financial assistance, for genuine, stable peace processes need assistance if they are to evolve into stable democracies.
After last minute amendments and a nine-hour delay, the majority of the parties involved in the two years of talks signed a scaled-down peace agreement in Arusha on 28 August.
The Commission welcomes the signature of the peace accord as an important preliminary step in the long and difficult process of negotiations to end the conflict between Burundi's majority Hutu and minority Tutsi population.
However, as has been said in this discussion, some very important questions are still open, such as that of the cease-fire, which is the main gap in the agreement, the amnesty, the composition of the national assembly, the duration of the agreement and the transitory government leadership - no minor issues.
In spite of the number and the importance of these questions, the signature does represent an important event which puts an end to the Arusha process but not to the negotiations as such.
These will continue, mainly in Bujumbura, hopefully ensuring a higher ownership of the process by the Burundians themselves.
This has been a problem in the long process on many occasions.
The refusal to sign the agreement by the extremist parties is of concern to the Commission and every effort should be pursued to urge them to do so.
Two Tutsi parties added their signature to the agreement on the following day.
Cease-fire talks are organised for 20 September in Nairobi.
The regional presidents Moi and Thabo Mbeki stress their importance.
Successful conclusion is seen as a prerequisite for the start of the implementation of the peace agreement, deployment of UN peacekeepers and full restoration of development cooperation.
The European Community, at this stage, is ready at the technical level to gradually resume a full-scale cooperation programme in coordination with other donors.
Beyond a EUR 48 million rehabilitation programme whose implementation has started, the EC is finalising the procedures for the release of EUR 50 million STABEX funds to relaunch the rural economy.
A strategy paper is being prepared by the Commission to support the peace agreement implementation concentrating on demobilisation, social and economic reconstruction of Burundi and state reform.
Finally, the Commission is going to hold an informal donor meeting at technical level in Brussels on 15 September.
Its purpose is to report on the programme implementation, to improve coordination between donors, to prepare a common strategy to contribute to the peace agreement implementation and to prepare a high level round table of parties and donors which should take place in Paris this autumn.
We are organised to step up the actual cooperation.
I can tell Parliament that we see this as a good case to try and demonstrate how to better manage the transition from the phase of humanitarian assistance to the building up and gradual introduction of forward-oriented long-term development cooperation.
We are giving all the signals we can to organisations like the UNHCR, and also to other donors, to try and get well organised, as you can hear from what I have said.
Coordination is extremely important because we are still in a situation where the right balance and the right kind of signals to the parties in the process in Burundi are as important as the euros we are mobilising.
This is a very focused effort, trying to do things right.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 5.30 p.m.
Human rights
Mr President, the resolution that we have before us today is not intended in any way to criticise the key actors namely the Bhutanese or Nepalese Governments in the process of finding a solution for the 96 000 Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees living in the camps.
There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years.
This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people.
We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees, and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes.
But the people in those camps would prefer to be re-settled back in their homelands and not have that money.
They sent us this memorandum asking our support for action to solve their problem and to have justice.
In it they say "we pray at your end, honourable European Parliamentarians, that justice may prevail on us".
That is what we are doing here today.
Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people, will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results.
Mr President, earlier this year, I had the honour to be part of a delegation from the European Parliament to New Delhi and Nepal.
Arising from our visit and in particular our visit to the refugee camps in eastern Nepal, the delegation gave a commitment that they would do everything possible to raise the issue of the continuing plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of, and greatly value and appreciate, the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation.
This was clearly demonstrated to us during our visit to the region, and our resolve to continue to encourage an agreement now between Bhutan and Nepal is as strong as ever.
The influx of Bhutanese refugees into Nepal began in late 1991 and the fear of diminishing international attention, therefore, is always present.
The refugees have been waiting for the last ten years for an amicable and permanent solution to the crisis.
As Ms McCarthy has said - very many of them want to go home.
There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured.
In New York, the United Nations Millennium Summit is taking place as we speak and it offers the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal an opportunity to come together and to demonstrate their commitment to the ideas of peace and tolerance by agreeing to an early solution to the problem of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
This would be a fitting way to mark the UN's Millennium Summit.
I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so.
One of the crucial issues to be decided is the definition of the family unit for verification purposes.
Nepal has accepted a compromise put forward by the UNHCR who has been playing an important role in seeking to help to resolve the impasse.
I strongly urge the Bhutanese authorities to accept the compromise so that field verification can begin immediately.
While the European Union remains one of the major donors, both the UNHCR and the World Food Programme are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to run the refugee camps.
I would urge international donors to continue to make sufficient funds available to permit the running of the camps during the negotiation and the verification process.
At the same time, I would expect the donors to insist that the Bhutanese Government facilitate a rapid repatriation of the refugees.
I very much welcome the news conveyed to the House by Ms McCarthy of the generosity of the Japanese people in this particular respect.
We were assured that bilateral negotiations would be speedily concluded and that actual verification in the camps would begin last July.
That agreement regrettably is still outstanding.
I therefore reiterate once more our appeal to all those concerned to take the necessary political initiatives to achieve a lasting solution to the unacceptable plight of the Bhutanese refugees, of whom over 17 000 have been born in the camps.
Mr President, I think first we must thank the chairman of our delegation for relations with South-East Asia, Mr Gerard Collins, who has just spoken and to whom we owe this resolution, for the efforts he has made over the past months to try to resolve an issue which is not really that marginal, since it concerns tens of thousands of people who are now destitute, and have often been so for years.
I also want to say that Mr Collins had the support of the entire delegation, Mrs McCarthy, Mr Thomas Mann and all the other members, and I hope the Commission will follow up Parliament' s unanimous position and that we will see rapid results.
I think the ball is in Bhutan' s court, but it is now up to the Commission and the Council to put pressure on the Bhutanese Government.
Aside from this question, I want to draw attention to a matter that concerns us all and concerns our future.
Yesterday we voted for the Galeote Quecedo report on a common Community diplomacy, which in the end was reduced to a report on a future college of common diplomacy.
That is not much.
It is not much when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Bhutan, when we know that there is no Commission delegation in Nepal, but when we also know that no Member State has an embassy in Bhutan.
That certainly does not make for increased contact, nor does it make it easier to take diplomatic action to help solve this particular problem and other more general ones.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the report you adopted.
It does not mean the communitisation, even in part, of our common foreign and security policy.
Is it really that inconceivable that in a country such as Bhutan, where we have no embassy, we could have a Commission delegation that also acted as an embassy for the 15 Member States?
Is that really impossible?
Is it beyond your powers of imagination?
That is the question I wanted to ask you.
Mr President, we in the European Parliament's SAARC delegation had an opportunity in April to see for ourselves the conditions in which tens of thousands of refugees have been living for years in the camps in eastern Nepal.
The assistance from the European Union and the international organisations is quite respectable, but no one can guarantee long-term financial aid at that level.
It is high time that substantial agreements were reached.
Bhutan and Nepal are not neighbours, but they are close to each other in spirit.
Both are kingdoms, both have parliamentary systems with short histories, one is Buddhist and the other is Hindu.
Both are aware that lasting conflict will paralyse their national and economic progress.
Bhutan criticises Nepal on the grounds that its constant changes of government make it incapable of action.
That has changed.
Nepal accuses Bhutan of not being ready to adopt effective solutions.
I hope that will change.
The undertakings given by the Bhutanese Foreign Minister when he visited us in Brussels on 8 June have been honoured, as crucial negotiations began mid-year.
There is agreement on the four categories of people living in the refugee camps.
However, there has to be a common definition of the term 'family' for the purposes of the compromise put forward by the UNHCR, which Mr Collins has referred to.
Nepal has already agreed.
We are also appealing to India to stop primly holding back.
It is linked with both neighbours through agreements and economic ties.
There are 6 million Nepalese working in India.
The borders are open, and there are no asylum problems.
I am very familiar with the charter stipulating that bilateral conflicts should not be resolved at SAARC level.
Nevertheless, the largest democracy in the world does have the greatest influence in the region and bears some humanitarian responsibility here.
Some movement is discernible.
The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is putting its faith in far-sighted people of good will in Thimphu, in Kathmandu, and also in Delhi.
We are hoping that the talks in New York between the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Prime Ministers of Bhutan and Nepal will lead to a decisive breakthrough.
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can only lend its firm support to this resolution which, as the Members who have direct experience of this tragic situation have said, shows our institution's concern for a region which may well be far away but whose human tragedies cut us to the very heart.
As previous speakers have pointed out, a great deal has already been achieved and more will be achieved in the future, and it is our hope that the outcome of the forthcoming talks will be positive.
For my part, I join with Mr Dupuis in calling upon the Commission and the European Union as a whole to make diplomatic advances towards the countries which are most affected by this crisis.
All that remains is for me to state that we too will follow future developments in the situation closely.
Burma
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced, once again, with an exemplary case.
The text on Burma, unfortunately the umpteenth one, is very good.
The situation in Burma is crystal clear; there is a perfect dictatorship on the one side and an exemplary opposition on the other. There has, in fact, been no sign of progress in this country for ten years.
That is the situation.
So I think we should ask ourselves a few questions.
Our policy towards Asia is a criminal policy; it is quite literally criminal.
We treat regimes such as India, which continue to consolidate and strengthen democracy, however difficult that may be, on the same footing as other countries like China, Burma and North Korea, which, you could say, do all they can to strengthen dictatorship.
So, I think we should consider drawing up lists, defining categories and establishing different types of relations depending on the type of country.
Unfortunately that is not the case.
The European Parliament has been calling for this for a long time and we must continue to urge it.
We cannot continue to dialogue with organisations such as ASEAN and pretend that we regard them as a homogenous whole.
ASEAN is simply a grouping of totally different countries, with widely diverging interests and no prospect of integration.
We must encourage forms of integration based on democracy - which is absolutely not the case with this kind of country - and therefore promote and encourage our bilateral relations with the countries that respect democracy and want to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and pursue an extremely tough policy towards countries like Burma.
Let me finish by saying that Burma is a country now occupied by the People' s Republic of China.
We are informed by many sources that there are dozens of Chinese military bases in Burma.
The People' s Republic of China is currently encircling India: that is a real fact, an actual fact.
You are aware of the situation in Pakistan.
The People' s Republic of China' s strategic aid to the rearmament and strengthening of Pakistan' s nuclear weapons is a form of encirclement and if, in the course of the twentieth century, the major world problem was the German problem, the Franco-German problem, today and tomorrow too it will be an Indo-Chinese problem; and if we do not, as of now, support the countries that are moving towards democracy, towards strengthening democracy, such as India, but instead continue to roll out the red carpet for the Beijing authorities, we will simply be encouraging a grouping that will eventually become explosive.
The explosion will hit not just Asia, but in the end will also affect Europe and the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret having to speak once again to defend the cause of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
This is not only the defence of a person who suffers for having fought for democracy and freedom, but also of what she represents in a whole population' s fight to achieve those things.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi deserved the recognition of the international community by being awarded the Nobel Prize, the Sajarov Prize from this Parliament and the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International.
Now she is being denied the most basic freedoms, along with those who follow her in the difficult process against dictatorship, to which Mr Dupuis has already referred.
All these people are in an unacceptable situation.
Therefore, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals of the corresponding resolution and, in particular, I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8, which asks that both the United States and the Commission and the Council impose the appropriate political and economic sanctions as long as there is no process of democratisation in Burma.
Mr President, we are once again debating the difficult situation in which Burma' s elected President finds herself, as well as the aggression displayed by that country' s military regime.
I believe that over the past two years, we have submitted as many as five or six resolutions on the situation in Burma.
It is almost intolerable that a President, elected more than ten years ago with 80% of the votes behind her, who offers peaceful protest against her country' s military regime, should receive insufficient support to truly adopt the role which she deserves in her country, in order to fight a military regime which rides roughshod over human rights and the rights of minorities. This is despite the fact that she receives verbal support - by Mr Clinton only a few days ago -and the fact that she has received both the Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize for her peaceful protest.
The national economy stays afloat thanks to drugs.
Burma, the world' s second-largest drug-producing country, after Colombia, has dismantled its own parliament, has had numerous parliamentarians killed and imprisoned in the process, and forces its minorities into slave labour, especially in the construction of infrastructure. However, it still benefits from investments, including investments from European countries, such as those of the French oil company Total and the Dutch hydraulics industry, and there has been no attempt to block this kind of investment, either on the part of the EU or on the part of national Member States.

I am not actually in favour of economic sanctions, but in some cases - I am thinking of South Africa and Chile in the eighties - it is necessary to stop cruelty in its tracks.
In my opinion, the European Union and the United States should agree on a strategy against Burma.
I believe that Burma should be isolated politically and economically and that real, effective pressure must be exercised; if not, we sanction violent opposition.
People elsewhere have commented: look at Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
She has now been in peaceful protest for twelve years and still she is being sidelined and placed under house arrest, and her people are being arrested.
And what happens?
The international community looks on and does nothing.
I would ask the European Union to enter into talks with the United States in order come up with concrete ways of helping her, and in order to ensure that she and Burma' s parliament can re-establish democracy in Burma.
Mr President, I should like to support what the other speakers have said.
It is ten years since the NLD won a huge majority of seats in free and fair elections, but despite that, democracy has been suppressed from every angle and at every opportunity.
I believe that the recent readmittance of Burma to the Asean and EU-Asean meetings was a major mistake from the start.
Burma has done nothing since being readmitted to Asean to show that it deserves it.
There should be a serious rethink of this policy.
Burma should be excluded.
